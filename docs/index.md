TODO: tighten up

Contributions are not currently accepted.  This is because I intend on bootstrapping this wiki by generating the majority of the pages from public data sources.

In order to avoid annoying merge conflicts, I will only begin accepting user contributions once the initial content generation phase is finished.

I will provide more details on how you can contribute at a later date.  Stay tuned!
