description: >
  It's election night fever when Dan and Jeff realize that the episode will air long after the election. Clearly a devout Democrat, Dan complains about his hired help before bringing up a real live woman to referee history's least informed Harry Potter trivia competition. Plus: transitional D&D! Freestyle rapping! Not knowing how to end the show!

# Tip!
#   If a line starts with the # symbold then it is considered a comment.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
