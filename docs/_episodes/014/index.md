description: >
  It's a special night at Harmontown when Mayor Harmon decides the goal is to "achieve weightlessness" and establish Harmontown's real purpose. One hour, thirty tangents, two emails from Harmon's big brother and that goal remains unachieved, but a legendary theme park death does finally get its own theme song.

# Tip!
#   If a line starts with the # symbold then it is considered a comment.
#   Comments do not get processed by the wiki.  They are purely for your information.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

guests:
#- "Example guest 1"
#- "Example guest 2"

audienceGuests:
- "Adam Goldberg"

images:
#- "/assets/images/episodes/014/example-1.png"
