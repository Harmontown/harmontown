description: >
  Self destructive writer Dan Harmon claims he will one day found a colony of like-minded misfits. He's appointed suit-clad gadabout Jeff Davis as his Comptroller and bearded dreamboat Spencer Crittenden as his Dungeon Master. It's like a neurotic town hall meeting, often with alcohol and famous people.
  Featuring Dan Harmon, Jeff Bryan Davis and Spencer Crittenden.
