# Tip!
#   If a line starts with the # symbold then it is considered a comment.
#   Comments do not get processed by the wiki.  They are purely for your information.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
