  We hear about the drunk driver that hit Dan's house, plus Jeff's trip to India. Everyone questions Steve Levy's doctor's qualifications, but is glad he's alive. While roleplaying, the gang stakes out an in-use restroom for a very, very long time.

# Note: Consult the "Tips" lower down the page for info on how to edit
#       the guest, audienceGuests, and images lists.

# Tip!
#   If a line starts with the # symbold then it is considered a comment.
#   Comments do not get processed by the wiki.  They are purely for your information.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
