  This week's a whopper, with conversation topics ranging from Spencer's hip surgery, Dan's much anticipated Game of Thrones take, and another underscoring of how unprepared our (Dan's) parents were for the advent of the internet. All that and THE RETURN OF D&D.
  Featuring Dan Harmon, Jeff Bryan Davis, Spencer Crittenden and Steve Levy.

# Tip!
#   If a line starts with the # symbold then it is considered a comment.
#   Comments do not get processed by the wiki.  They are purely for your information.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
