description: |-
  A quiet military bunker in Charlotte known as The Comedy Zone is the site of a kinder, gentler town meeting than Nashville's booze-drenched hootenanny. Mayor Harmon attempts to write a constitution and learns about the deep seated, low-stakes conflict between the Carolinas. In D&D, the band reunites aboard a spaceship and Erin shames a loud lady.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
