  After a few false starts, it turns out Mayor Harmon may be suffering from a show-threatening case of homecoming confidence, but when special guests D.C Pierson and Kumail Nanjiani join, the meeting erupts into an awesome discussion of drugs, religion, Spencer, Hannibal Lechter and octopus sex. In D&D: Sharpie and Mulraine seal the deal.

# Tip!
#   If a line starts with the # symbold then it is considered a comment.
#   Comments do not get processed by the wiki.  They are purely for your information.

# Tip!
#   Adding items to lists is easy.  List items always start with a - symbol and have
#   have the same identation as the list name.  Here is an example.
#
#    foods:
#    - "bacon"
#    - "sausages"
#
#   In this example the list name is "foods" and it has two items (bacon, and sausages).
#
#   To get you started, the "guests", "audienceGuests", and "images" lists below have
#   a few example entries commented out.
#   To start using them remove the # symbol from the start of the line.
