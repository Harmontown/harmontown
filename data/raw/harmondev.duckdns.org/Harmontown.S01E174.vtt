{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.100\nBack finally in Hollywood, California from our excursion in New York City\n\n00:04.100 --> 00:06.900\nand some of the craziest shit we've ever really purported.\n\n00:09.400 --> 00:11.600\nHarmontown is now in session!\n\n00:17.100 --> 00:20.900\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden, please. Spencer to the stage.\n\n00:24.100 --> 00:25.400\nWe missed you, Spencer.\n\n00:25.400 --> 00:31.400\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:35.400 --> 00:37.400\nThank you very much. Thank you.\n\n00:45.400 --> 00:47.400\nI can tell you have a weird energy.\n\n00:49.400 --> 00:54.400\nYou're thinking, uh-oh, dad, dad, dad got a divorce.\n\n00:54.400 --> 00:59.400\nNo, the shave happens, but this was an absolute accident.\n\n00:59.400 --> 01:03.400\nI went drunk into a barber shop in New York.\n\n01:03.400 --> 01:07.400\nI did want to get a trim, but I've never gotten a trim from a barber,\n\n01:07.400 --> 01:11.400\nso he said, what number? And I said, one.\n\n01:13.400 --> 01:15.400\nYou just said, aimed in the dark?\n\n01:15.400 --> 01:18.400\nYeah, I looked at his face and said, I'll have what you're having.\n\n01:18.400 --> 01:23.400\nHe had like a beard, but he was a younger gentleman with black.\n\n01:23.400 --> 01:30.400\nSo for him, this looks like a beard, but for me, now I look like a strange lab rat\n\n01:30.400 --> 01:34.400\nthat's going through a George Michael phase.\n\n01:37.400 --> 01:39.400\nYou know that phase.\n\n01:39.400 --> 01:43.400\nBut don't worry, dad's fine.\n\n01:43.400 --> 01:49.400\nHe's still jerking off on mannequin legs and making breakfast,\n\n01:49.400 --> 01:52.400\nand everything's going to be fine.\n\n01:52.400 --> 01:54.400\nThe dogs don't seem too happy.\n\n01:54.400 --> 02:00.400\nNigel keeps shitting everywhere and eating everything, but that's sad.\n\n02:00.400 --> 02:04.400\nDoes he eat his own poop? Because that would be a self-solving problem.\n\n02:04.400 --> 02:06.400\nYeah, I know, I wish.\n\n02:06.400 --> 02:09.400\nYeah, it's like he's running out of shit to eat.\n\n02:09.400 --> 02:11.400\nIt's all turning into shit, yeah.\n\n02:11.400 --> 02:13.400\nYeah, yeah.\n\n02:13.400 --> 02:16.400\nPut it in the New Yorker, Harmon.\n\n02:16.400 --> 02:19.400\nI know, I thought, well, I do think in all seriousness,\n\n02:19.400 --> 02:22.400\nprobably there's a, well, I'm not going to blame myself for the bad mood\n\n02:22.400 --> 02:25.400\nunless you guys heard us talking shit about L.A. in the New York shows.\n\n02:25.400 --> 02:27.400\nSometimes we go to different cities and we're like, fuck those guys.\n\n02:27.400 --> 02:29.400\nWe're just kidding.\n\n02:29.400 --> 02:32.400\nBut if you're like me, you're a little, you're a little,\n\n02:32.400 --> 02:34.400\nthe wind was taking out of your sails.\n\n02:34.400 --> 02:37.400\nThere was something about today, even though the shit didn't really go down today,\n\n02:37.400 --> 02:40.400\nthe shit went down last week, specifically while we were on stage\n\n02:40.400 --> 02:43.400\nfor one of the shows, you know, the horrible events happened.\n\n02:43.400 --> 02:45.400\nBut it's just the wake of it all.\n\n02:45.400 --> 02:47.400\nI think it hit a tipping point today.\n\n02:47.400 --> 02:49.400\nI was like, I'm not going to do anything, I'm not going to do anything,\n\n02:49.400 --> 02:51.400\nI'm not going to do anything, I'm not going to do anything,\n\n02:51.400 --> 02:53.400\nI'm not going to do anything or taking any information\n\n02:53.400 --> 02:56.400\nwithout just feeling fucking apocalyptic about everything.\n\n02:56.400 --> 02:59.400\nIt just seems like, you know, I stood here and promised everybody\n\n02:59.400 --> 03:01.400\nthat Trump was a joke and that, you know,\n\n03:01.400 --> 03:03.400\nbecause the Irish were worried about it when Aaron was over there.\n\n03:03.400 --> 03:05.400\nAnd I was like, that guy's not going to wear it.\n\n03:05.400 --> 03:08.400\nIt's like, this guy's a fucking antichrist.\n\n03:08.400 --> 03:10.400\nYou just can't, then people keep, you know,\n\n03:10.400 --> 03:12.400\nand I don't think you should keep tweeting this stuff\n\n03:12.400 --> 03:15.400\nif you discover, oh, 20 years ago Trump was racist\n\n03:15.400 --> 03:20.240\nLike, the sad thing about it is it's like, well, what are we, what are we waiting for\n\n03:20.240 --> 03:23.680\nthe thing where all these idiots are going to go, you know what, you're right, he seems\n\n03:23.680 --> 03:26.000\nlike a bad guy.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:34.520\nHe's appealing to the most basest, fearful, horrible, part of, I'm not going to say the\n\n03:34.520 --> 03:39.160\nmost horrible people because the thing, the way to fight this is to believe that even\n\n03:39.160 --> 03:43.280\nthe ignorant have a little Buddha inside of them that we can tickle into the chin and\n\n03:43.280 --> 03:48.920\nbring them out, give them a shot of wheatgrass and a pat on the back and just say, look man,\n\n03:48.920 --> 03:54.540\nwe're scared too, we don't want the country to be broke, but don't fucking surround a\n\n03:54.540 --> 04:00.300\nmosque and holding a gun, wearing a ski mask, that's not a protest, what are you protesting?\n\n04:00.300 --> 04:04.720\nThis is insane, the thing is, it's just getting insane, the airlines like kicked these guys\n\n04:04.720 --> 04:08.880\noff, but like, I think that happened to two different airlines, like, and the press is\n\n04:08.880 --> 04:12.480\nkind of fucking playing ball with it because they're not just calling it racism now, they're\n\n04:12.480 --> 04:16.040\ncalling it like religious intolerance and anti-Muslim, it's like, the people didn't\n\n04:16.040 --> 04:20.600\nknow they were Muslim, they based it on something else, I'm sure, I'm sure if you were an atheist\n\n04:20.600 --> 04:25.520\nArab and someone didn't want to get on a plane with you, they're not like detecting your\n\n04:25.520 --> 04:33.880\nreligion, they're not fucking academics, what am I, I'm complaining to a very sad choir,\n\n04:33.880 --> 04:36.200\nI mean, whatever, but I wanted to acknowledge this.\n\n04:36.200 --> 04:38.720\nI feel like the mood was just because it was kind of hot today.\n\n04:38.720 --> 04:39.720\nOh, okay.\n\n04:39.720 --> 04:42.480\nHave you guys not been watching the news?\n\n04:42.480 --> 04:43.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n04:43.480 --> 04:49.920\nIt was just really, it was just really warm for mid-late November.\n\n04:49.920 --> 04:55.120\nI put me in a bad mood, also, I've just stopped watching the news now, I mean, I'll get it\n\n04:55.120 --> 04:58.640\nthrough bits and pieces, but like, when we got to New York, I got these texts from my\n\n04:58.640 --> 05:01.520\nbrother and some friends saying, did you hear about what happened and like, are your friends\n\n05:01.520 --> 05:02.520\nokay out there?\n\n05:02.520 --> 05:07.760\nAnd I was like, we have to walk on stage right now, so I just put my head in the dirt, like,\n\n05:07.760 --> 05:11.880\nwhich is a terrible thing to have to do, but we better than trying to come up with bits\n\n05:11.880 --> 05:12.880\nabout it.\n\n05:12.880 --> 05:18.400\nWe got up to the show and there was, there were 17 NYPD out in front of the theater,\n\n05:18.400 --> 05:22.560\nand I didn't notice that, but you told me about that, or someone else told us about it.\n\n05:22.560 --> 05:25.080\nThere was literally 12, I mean, we had the nut because we were like, how many are they\n\n05:25.080 --> 05:26.080\nhere?\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:27.080\nThere's 12.\n\n05:27.080 --> 05:29.680\nIt's like, can you imagine there were 12 cops basically every single place in New York.\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:31.200\nI have to imagine there was like, volunteer.\n\n05:31.200 --> 05:32.600\nWell, I think there wasn't the answer.\n\n05:32.600 --> 05:36.680\nWe said like, like, we're like, are we a, well, yeah, because we panicked a little bit.\n\n05:36.680 --> 05:37.680\nWe sat down on the green room.\n\n05:37.680 --> 05:40.080\nI think it might have been an ad sit that was because we're just like, wow, can you imagine\n\n05:40.080 --> 05:42.920\nthis is so sad because everybody, you know, the cops are sad.\n\n05:42.920 --> 05:49.760\nLike nobody really believes in that moment that there's a threat, but you know, like,\n\n05:49.760 --> 05:53.880\nthere's no, but, but at the same time, everyone understands that this has to be done now.\n\n05:53.880 --> 05:54.880\nAnd that's what makes everyone sad.\n\n05:54.880 --> 05:59.840\nIt's just like, oh, our lives have been eclipsed by tragedy and there's nothing we can do.\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:02.320\nAnd even the cops feel that way and the kids feel that way.\n\n06:02.320 --> 06:05.200\nAnd everyone's just like, okay, wave the baton or you go in.\n\n06:05.200 --> 06:09.560\nAnd it was just very morose, sad vibe, but the strange way is also kind of uplifting\n\n06:09.560 --> 06:13.000\nbecause obviously like all of those police, they have to come from somewhere.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:20.120\nSo if not, if not, like there must have been volunteers, like putting on NYPD flak jackets.\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:23.960\nI don't know if that's legal or I don't think that's, well, I don't know how many fucking\n\n06:23.960 --> 06:28.360\nNYPD, but they said they pull out of the reason why they put so many cops in a place is that\n\n06:28.360 --> 06:32.680\nbecause there's more than 500 people in this building and that's, that's there's 8 million\n\n06:32.680 --> 06:33.680\npeople.\n\n06:33.680 --> 06:36.560\nBecause there's 700 people in most of the hotels.\n\n06:36.560 --> 06:38.600\nIt was the counterterrorism.\n\n06:38.600 --> 06:39.840\nIt was the counter.\n\n06:39.840 --> 06:44.120\nSo, okay, so, so, so we were sitting in the green room and we're like, I was just operating\n\n06:44.120 --> 06:46.120\non the assumption of like, oh yeah, where are all these cops coming from?\n\n06:46.120 --> 06:47.360\nAnd then I think it was AdSit.\n\n06:47.360 --> 06:51.320\nI think it's kind of AdSit when like, do you think maybe it's because they have specific\n\n06:51.320 --> 06:54.800\nreason to think there's a threat here and we're like, what, oh, fuck.\n\n06:54.800 --> 06:59.600\nAnd I was like, we just want to feel bad about international tragedy.\n\n06:59.600 --> 07:02.640\nWe don't want to start being narcissistically panicked about it.\n\n07:02.640 --> 07:04.920\nBut I wouldn't, I couldn't get that out of my mind.\n\n07:04.920 --> 07:07.240\nAnd then some things happened during those two shows.\n\n07:07.240 --> 07:10.520\nA young lady went out and asked the cops like specifically, she's like, would you please\n\n07:10.520 --> 07:13.320\ntell us if there's something and they were like, no, no, no, no.\n\n07:13.320 --> 07:15.560\nIt's every place with over 300 people and blah, blah, blah.\n\n07:15.560 --> 07:19.360\nNo, I, I, I almost called the counterterrorism unit when you took your pants off at the end\n\n07:19.360 --> 07:20.880\nof the second shoot.\n\n07:20.880 --> 07:21.960\nI think they almost came up there.\n\n07:21.960 --> 07:29.280\nI believe in that moment I was as close as I have ever gotten to being a terrorist.\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:35.800\nI certainly was not celebrating freedom or I was, I wasn't rewarding it.\n\n07:35.800 --> 07:38.760\nUm, yeah, I don't know.\n\n07:38.760 --> 07:39.760\nJet blue.\n\n07:39.760 --> 07:40.760\nOkay.\n\n07:40.760 --> 07:43.760\nThat's been our show.\n\n07:43.760 --> 07:45.760\nGood night, everybody.\n\n07:45.760 --> 07:46.760\nI don't know.\n\n07:46.760 --> 07:48.560\nWhat was the picture you posted of the menu?\n\n07:48.560 --> 07:49.560\nWas that the, was that a jet blue?\n\n07:49.560 --> 07:50.760\nYeah, I don't, I don't understand that.\n\n07:50.760 --> 07:52.480\nIs it looking at my, yeah, I Instagram it.\n\n07:52.480 --> 07:54.160\nThere's nothing to talk about because I don't fucking understand it.\n\n07:54.160 --> 07:56.720\nIt's like these menu items on the, those like these little tiny icons and one looks like\n\n07:56.720 --> 07:57.720\na little horse.\n\n07:57.720 --> 08:01.240\nAnd one of them is like a little, either a smaller horse or a dog and it's like each\n\n08:01.240 --> 08:02.240\nmenu item.\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:04.400\nIt's like the where you would put like a heart if it was a little cholesterol or something\n\n08:04.400 --> 08:05.400\nlike that.\n\n08:05.400 --> 08:06.920\nSo it's like, oh, this one has horse plus dog.\n\n08:06.920 --> 08:08.520\nThere was a, there was a big horse.\n\n08:08.520 --> 08:10.200\nI looked closely at it.\n\n08:10.200 --> 08:14.800\nIt's the same horse is just smaller, but it was big horse plus smaller horse facing\n\n08:14.800 --> 08:15.800\nbig horse.\n\n08:15.800 --> 08:16.800\nRight.\n\n08:16.800 --> 08:17.800\nYeah.\n\n08:17.800 --> 08:21.640\nWhich is like a horse plus small horse equals like this little, this little one and a half\n\n08:21.640 --> 08:28.200\nhorse is, but my, my, my guess on that is it's, there's full or half sized portions\n\n08:28.200 --> 08:29.200\navailable.\n\n08:29.200 --> 08:35.800\nSo you, I could, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse or I'm, I'm, I'm a horse so hungry\n\n08:35.800 --> 08:40.760\nI could have the full pasta or I'm a, I'm a horse so small I could only have the half\n\n08:40.760 --> 08:41.760\npasta.\n\n08:41.760 --> 08:42.760\nAll right.\n\n08:42.760 --> 08:43.760\nAll right.\n\n08:43.760 --> 08:47.880\nWell, um, you know what, there's nothing, there's nothing on this list that I can't talk\n\n08:47.880 --> 08:51.560\nabout with our guests tonight who has a heart out and I don't want to cheat them.\n\n08:51.560 --> 08:54.920\nSo, uh, why don't we, why don't we just bring them up and start chatting.\n\n08:54.920 --> 09:01.720\nHe's a fantastic, really, really intimidatingly funny guy, uh, that I, I first got to, uh,\n\n09:01.720 --> 09:05.200\ntaste of, uh, his, his, his in-person talents.\n\n09:05.200 --> 09:07.000\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.080\nWhat am I, what language am I speaking?\n\n09:09.080 --> 09:11.960\nI'm telling me love him.\n\n09:11.960 --> 09:12.960\nI do love him.\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:19.920\nI was on a podcast with him, um, uh, and, uh, and then, and then he did Harmon Quest, um,\n\n09:19.920 --> 09:23.640\nfor an episode and he's just a, he's just a wonderful, wonderful, nerdy, really funny\n\n09:23.640 --> 09:24.640\ndude.\n\n09:24.640 --> 09:27.560\nAnd, uh, and, and, and he had to come here sooner or later.\n\n09:27.560 --> 09:28.560\nSo he's here tonight.\n\n09:28.560 --> 09:29.560\nLet's bring Thomas Middleditch up.\n\n09:29.560 --> 09:30.560\nOh yeah.\n\n09:30.560 --> 09:31.560\nHello.\n\n09:31.560 --> 09:32.560\nThank you.\n\n09:32.560 --> 09:33.560\nFor coming.\n\n09:33.560 --> 09:34.560\nHey.\n\n09:34.560 --> 09:35.560\nHey.\n\n09:35.560

Valley.\n\n10:00.280 --> 10:01.280\nYeah.\n\n10:01.280 --> 10:02.280\nYeah.\n\n10:02.280 --> 10:07.160\nThey don't tell you, they don't tell you in the biz that you've got to start getting\n\n10:07.160 --> 10:09.040\nup at like 5 30 in the morning earlier.\n\n10:09.040 --> 10:12.080\nSometimes it's kind of, are you guys shooting at a studio or you're on location?\n\n10:12.080 --> 10:14.560\nSony Pictures, Motion Picture Studio lot.\n\n10:14.560 --> 10:15.560\nNow do you live on?\n\n10:15.560 --> 10:16.560\nOver city.\n\n10:16.560 --> 10:18.560\nDo you live on the west side, east side?\n\n10:18.560 --> 10:19.560\nI live in Hollywood.\n\n10:19.560 --> 10:21.560\nSo that's, that's a hell of a drive.\n\n10:21.560 --> 10:22.560\nThat's a nice 45 minute.\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:23.560\nYeah.\n\n10:23.560 --> 10:25.560\nAt 5 30, it's going to be a breeze.\n\n10:25.560 --> 10:26.560\nYeah.\n\n10:26.560 --> 10:28.560\nThere's one bar over there.\n\n10:28.560 --> 10:29.560\nYeah.\n\n10:29.560 --> 10:30.560\nThat's right, Dan.\n\n10:30.560 --> 10:31.560\nStory checks out.\n\n10:31.560 --> 10:32.560\nYeah.\n\n10:32.560 --> 10:35.560\nUh, JetBlue can't stand them.\n\n10:35.560 --> 10:37.560\nI'm sitting there, you're bringing it up.\n\n10:37.560 --> 10:39.560\nI'm like, oh, I hate them.\n\n10:39.560 --> 10:40.560\nOh yeah?\n\n10:40.560 --> 10:41.560\nLet's hear your JetBlue.\n\n10:41.560 --> 10:42.560\nIt's chunk.\n\n10:42.560 --> 10:43.560\nIt's pretty petty and stupid.\n\n10:43.560 --> 10:46.560\nYeah, you're a first class only flyer.\n\n10:46.560 --> 10:49.560\nNo, no, I actually am a big fan of Coach.\n\n10:49.560 --> 10:50.560\nAnd uh.\n\n10:50.560 --> 10:53.560\nWell then you must feel that JetBlue has now sold out because they have a premium\n\n10:53.560 --> 10:54.560\nclass now.\n\n10:54.560 --> 10:58.560\nOh, well, yeah, I don't, that I don't know or care about.\n\n10:58.560 --> 11:04.560\nWell, welcome to, to Mile High Coveaching, where we talk about, I don't know, where\n\n11:04.560 --> 11:05.560\nare you going to say?\n\n11:05.560 --> 11:10.560\nOh, I was just going to say, well, last time I flew them, they were doing, if you want to\n\n11:10.560 --> 11:14.560\norder something, I don't know about the horses, but they'd have, you could either get free\n\n11:14.560 --> 11:20.560\nsnacks, like a bag of peanuts or whatever, and then you could pay money for like essentially\n\n11:20.560 --> 11:25.560\nsnack packs, which are just packages of smaller packages of snacks.\n\n11:25.560 --> 11:26.560\nThose boxes.\n\n11:26.560 --> 11:27.560\nThere's no sandwiches.\n\n11:27.560 --> 11:28.560\nThere's no nothing.\n\n11:28.560 --> 11:29.560\nSo forget it.\n\n11:29.560 --> 11:30.560\nForget sandwiches on JetBlue.\n\n11:30.560 --> 11:34.560\nYou're only getting packages of smaller packages of snacks.\n\n11:34.560 --> 11:38.560\nWell, because they convert, I mean, I don't know if that was always the case.\n\n11:38.560 --> 11:40.560\nJetBlue.\n\n11:40.560 --> 11:41.560\nDamn.\n\n11:41.560 --> 11:44.560\nThomas, is your hatred of JetBlue a snack-based hatred?\n\n11:44.560 --> 11:47.560\nIt's purely a snack-based hatred.\n\n11:47.560 --> 11:52.560\nYou can't, we're in a world where packaging is, we're getting mounds of packaging in this\n\n11:52.560 --> 11:57.560\nworld, and I can't get a sandwich now because I got to get packages of smaller packages\n\n11:57.560 --> 11:59.560\nof snacks.\n\n11:59.560 --> 12:02.560\nNot going to do it.\n\n12:02.560 --> 12:06.560\nAnd it is infuriating when you read, so when you read stories like that in Southwest Airlines\n\n12:06.560 --> 12:12.560\nthere was a little revolt because there were two Arab gentlemen who run a pizza restaurant\n\n12:12.560 --> 12:17.560\nin Chicago together or something, and they were holding a box because he had baklava\n\n12:17.560 --> 12:19.560\nin it, because that's how terrorists operate.\n\n12:19.560 --> 12:26.560\nThey get all gussied up in their best Muslim gear, and then they put a bomb in a box, and\n\n12:26.560 --> 12:30.560\nthey just walk up to the plane, and they go, can I please get on the plane?\n\n12:30.560 --> 12:32.560\nAnd they go, yeah, sure, that's just pizza, right?\n\n12:32.560 --> 12:34.560\nCome on in.\n\n12:34.560 --> 12:37.560\nAnd so somebody went up and said, I'm not flying with him.\n\n12:37.560 --> 12:43.560\nAnd then this entire airline, you know, these people who are always high-roading you if\n\n12:43.560 --> 12:53.560\nyou've had one too many, and you're, as Dino once did, you simply mistake the cockpit door\n\n12:53.560 --> 12:57.560\nfor the bathroom, and it's locked so you're banging on it.\n\n12:57.560 --> 13:01.560\nThat actually happened to Dino for real.\n\n13:01.560 --> 13:05.560\nHe was so drunk that, I wasn't there, but he tells us he was so drunk, he was like,\n\n13:05.560 --> 13:07.560\nwho the fuck's in the bathroom?\n\n13:07.560 --> 13:09.560\nIt's been forever, and he's like, banging on the cockpit door.\n\n13:09.560 --> 13:11.560\nVery dangerous, a very dangerous thing.\n\n13:11.560 --> 13:12.560\nNot a good move.\n\n13:12.560 --> 13:16.560\nBut it is something extra outrageous about that, because you're always living under the\n\n13:16.560 --> 13:23.560\ntyranny of these unremarkables, these threshold guardians who are like, it used to be there\n\n13:23.560 --> 13:30.560\nin the hospitality business, and then after 9-11 they became these fucking undeputized\n\n13:30.560 --> 13:31.560\nair marshals.\n\n13:31.560 --> 13:38.560\nThey were like, oh good, no more fucking Mr. Nice Guy, and by the way, never was nice.\n\n13:38.560 --> 13:41.560\nAnd now it's just the tone and all that shit.\n\n13:41.560 --> 13:46.560\nAnd you're always in a bad mood, and you're always hyper aware of the class system, because\n\n13:46.560 --> 13:48.560\nthere's no good way to do it.\n\n13:48.560 --> 13:52.560\nSo you're always in a bad mood, and they're in a bad mood, and it's just the worst situation.\n\n13:52.560 --> 13:56.560\nAnd then when you read stories like that, you're going, oh, so also if the shit does ever hit\n\n13:56.560 --> 13:59.560\nthe fan, you're a fucking traitor to everybody.\n\n13:59.560 --> 14:01.560\nYou're just a dummy.\n\n14:01.560 --> 14:03.560\nWhat kind of bullshit is that?\n\n14:03.560 --> 14:09.560\nIf a guy comes up and says, it's been how many years have we had?\n\n14:09.560 --> 14:12.560\nThat's insane.\n\n14:12.560 --> 14:16.560\nThat somebody would come up and go, I want to fly with that guy.\n\n14:16.560 --> 14:17.560\nIt's like, oh, I know how to handle this.\n\n14:17.560 --> 14:19.560\nI don't even have to read the manual.\n\n14:19.560 --> 14:22.560\nHey, sir, you're out.\n\n14:22.560 --> 14:24.560\nHe doesn't want to fly with you.\n\n14:24.560 --> 14:27.560\nI'm taking his side.\n\n14:27.560 --> 14:33.560\nAt one point, they made the guy show his baklava to everybody, and he shared it with them.\n\n14:33.560 --> 14:35.560\nWell, he should have brought a knife to everybody.\n\n14:35.560 --> 14:37.560\nI love baklava.\n\n14:37.560 --> 14:41.560\nYeah, and all the people shared the baklava with him, and they were like, we're so sorry, but, you know,\n\n14:41.560 --> 14:44.560\nracism just got rewarded for it.\n\n14:44.560 --> 14:45.560\nI get it.\n\n14:45.560 --> 14:46.560\nI get it.\n\n14:46.560 --> 14:52.560\nI mean, that's how my dog works, and how much smarter than my dog are people that 15 years\n\n14:52.560 --> 14:56.560\nafter 9-11 haven't figured out that fucking, god damn it, don't get me started.\n\n14:56.560 --> 14:59.560\nListen to all the other podcasts if you want to hear about this shit, right?\n\n14:59.560 --> 15:02.560\nYou come here for automotive tips.\n\n15:02.560 --> 15:08.560\nSo I understand you got a new Impala you're wrenching on.\n\n15:08.560 --> 15:11.560\nChevy Volt all day, baby.\n\n15:11.560 --> 15:17.560\nDan, on the topic of cars, real quick, Thomas, we frequently gripe about Uber and Lyft on the show.\n\n15:17.560 --> 15:18.560\nOkay, why?\n\n15:18.560 --> 15:23.560\nJust because funny hypocrisies and things that happen in the car.\n\n15:23.560 --> 15:28.560\nI prefer Lyft to Uber. Dan hates Uber, but we'll never go to Lyft.\n\n15:28.560 --> 15:33.560\nMy driver today had a brand new 2015 Mini Cooper.\n\n15:33.560 --> 15:35.560\nDon't care for it.\n\n15:35.560 --> 15:36.560\nYou don't care for it.\n\n15:36.560 --> 15:37.560\nCoopers?\n\n15:37.560 --> 15:38.560\nYeah.\n\n15:38.560 --> 15:43.560\nThe display is like this giant circle of like crazy digital readouts and all this stuff,\n\n15:43.560 --> 15:45.560\nand I go, oh, is this the new one?\n\n15:45.560 --> 15:47.560\nMy brother has, I think, 2012.\n\n15:47.560 --> 15:48.560\nIs this the new one?\n\n15:48.560 --> 15:49.560\nHe goes, yeah.\n\n15:49.560 --> 15:50.560\nI go, do you like it?\n\n15:50.560 --> 15:52.560\nHe goes, yeah, I like it.\n\n15:52.560 --> 15:54.560\nI go, but you don't love it?\n\n15:54.560 --> 15:56.560\nHe goes, I mean, I like it.\n\n15:56.560 --> 15:58.560\nI go, what don't you like about it?\n\n15:58.560 --> 16:07.560\nHe goes, it's kind of small.\n\n16:07.560 --> 16:09.560\nIt's a Mini.\n\n16:09.560 --> 16:10.560\nWell, it's not just the Mini.\n\n16:10.560 --> 16:12.560\nI knew it was a Mini, obviously, from the name.\n\n16:12.560 --> 16:18.560\nBut then when you get in it, you feel kind of like actively like it's pinning you in.\n\n16:18.560 --> 16:27.560\nLike it's doing it to you, like it's putting you in a container for chickens.\n\n16:27.560 --> 16:29.560\nYou mean, it's cooping you.\n\n16:29.560 --> 16:32.560\nIt's going, oh!\n\n16:32.560 --> 16:41.560\nSo even if it was a mega Cooper, you should expect some constriction.\n\n16:41.560 --> 16:43.560\nIt's my point.\n\n16:43.560 --> 16:47.560\nThe floor was sprinkled with seed, which was nice.\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:56.560\nFeet are glued to the floor of my own feces, and some guy from Tyson Foods keeps clubbing me in the head.\n\n16:56.560 --> 16:59.560\nWe got to stop eating meat.\n\n16:59.560 --> 17:00.560\nIt's true.\n\n17:00.560 --> 17:03.560\nIt's so delicious, but it's so bad.\n\n17:03.560 --> 17:06.560\nDan, are you verging on the vegetarianism all of a sudden?\n\n17:06.560 --> 17:07.560\nYou got to come.\n\n17:07.560 --> 17:08.560\nYou got to come over here.\n\n17:08.560 --> 17:09.560\nWhere are you?\n\n17:09.560 --> 17:12.560\nI just switched it over about, well, you're in some change now.\n\n17:12.560 --> 17:17.560\nYou saw this documentary, Cowspiracy, whole fuck, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n17:17.560 --> 17:21.560\nNow look, now look, occasionally I'll cheat.\n\n17:21.560 --> 17:24.560\nSo one day you'll be like, you're eating a fucking sushi, man.\n\n17:24.560 --> 17:25.560\nYou just told me you don't eat meat.\n\n17:25.560 --> 17:26.560\nNow just chill, okay?\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:29.560\nChill the fuck out.\n\n17:29.560 --> 17:31.560\nIt's like 90% of the time I don't.\n\n17:31.560 --> 17:33.560\nBut yeah, you got to get out of there, man.\n\n17:33.560 --> 17:36.560\nWhat I think is, you, is Kumail veggie?\n\n17:36.560 --> 17:37.560\nNo, no, no.\n\n17:37.560 --> 17:38.560\nOh, Zach Woods is.\n\n17:38.560 --> 17:43.560\nHe looks like a fucking action figure now, but Aziz and Schrab.\n\n17:43.560 --> 17:44.560\nSure.\n\n17:44.560 --> 17:49.560\nAnd then, so there's, what are you miming, Dan?\n\n17:49.560 --> 17:52.560\nWell, I just started drinking these Soylent things.\n\n17:52.560 --> 17:54.560\nYou know what Soylent is?\n\n17:54.560 --> 17:57.560\nLike Soylent Green, like human meat?\n\n17:57.560 --> 18:02.560\nNo, unfortunately they didn't know about that reference when they, I always thought, I always thought it was ironic.\n\n18:02.560 --> 18:08.560\nThey named it after the 1958 sci-fi book from which that comes.\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:13.560\nBut the movie, Soylent Green, I think which was also based on that book,\n\n18:13.560 --> 18:17.560\nadded a few things, including the cannibalism.\n\n18:17.560 --> 18:19.560\nThat's sweet, sweet human meat.\n\n18:19.560 --> 18:22.560\nAnd so the people that, in fact, the people that named it Soylent were just going like,\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:24.560\ndoff of the cap to a futuristic drink.\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:28.560\nWithout ever having seen the 1975 movie where the whole point is like,\n\n18:28.560 --> 18:32.560\nthe futuristic drink is human flesh.\n\n18:32.560 --> 18:34.560\nBut I just mistook it for like, ah, it's millennial marketing.\n\n18:34.560 --> 18:37.560\nYou know, like you walk past a place and it says like Acne Studios,\n\n18:37.560 --> 18:40.560\nand you're like, that's the worst name for, I got it, you little brat.\n\n18:40.560 --> 18:43.560\nYou're cheaping the old man out.\n\n18:43.560 --> 18:46.560\nYou don't want my paradigms on your paradigms.\n\n18:46.560 --> 18:48.560\nThey're like, sorry, kid's only old man.\n\n18:48.560 --> 18:49.560\nYeah.\n\n18:49.560 --> 18:50.560\nBeat it.\n\n18:50.560 --> 18:53.560\nThomas, what made you cross over?\n\n18:53.560 --> 18:56.560\nOh, it's always annoying to hear about.\n\n18:56.560 --> 18:58.560\nI've been vegetarian for 23 years.\n\n18:58.560 --> 18:59.560\nOh, okay.\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:00.560\nI'm still vegetarian.\n\n19:00.560 --> 19:03.560\nI don't even know what Cowspiracy is because I'm fucking already there.\n\n19:03.560 --> 19:04.560\nYou're already there.\n\n19:04.560 --> 19:05.560\nI wish, I wish I was.\n\n19:05.560 --> 19:06.560\nI wish I had been.\n\n19:06.560 --> 19:07.560\nI got one of those fucking lip-sits.\n\n19:07.560 --> 19:08.560\nGo ahead.\n\n19:08.560 --> 19:09.560\nYou got a lip-sit?\n\n19:09.560 --> 19:10.560\nSorry.\n\n19:10.560 --> 19:11.560\nBob.\n\n19:11.560 --> 19:12.560\nThat would be so, no.\n\n19:12.560 --> 19:14.560\nI have a story to tell you after this.\n\n19:14.560 --> 19:15.560\nWhy do I have to say that?\n\n19:15.560 --> 19:16.560\nIt's not much good.\n\n19:16.560 --> 19:17.560\nGo ahead.\n\n19:17.560 --> 19:18.560\nSpeak.\n\n19:18.560 --> 19:19.560\nI'm terribly uncomfortable.\n\n19:19.560 --> 19:20.560\nWhat do I do?\n\n19:20.560 --> 19:23.560\nHow do Thomas and I focus on our vegetarian story when you have a lip-sit going on?\n\n19:23.560 --> 19:24.560\nNo, just go ahead.\n\n19:24.560 --> 19:25.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n19:25.560 --> 19:26.560\nI'm not a narcissist.\n\n19:26.560 --> 19:27.560\nI'm a bad person.\n\n19:27.560 --> 19:28.560\nAnd just go.\n\n19:28.560 --> 19:29.560\nLip-sit sounds like an 80s song.\n\n19:29.560 --> 19:30.560\nLike, lip-sit.\n\n19:30.560 --> 19:39.560\nThe lip-sit, it's a painful song that you have upon your mouth.\n\n19:39.560 --> 19:40.560\nAll right.\n\n19:40.560 --> 19:41.560\nYeah.\n\n19:41.560 --> 19:43.560\nPop, sometimes they're just in grown hair.\n\n19:43.560 --> 19:44.560\nJust, you know, pop their hair.\n\n19:44.560 --> 19:45.560\nTell them your veggie origin story.\n\n19:45.560 --> 19:46.560\nWell, I mean.\n\n19:46.560 --> 19:49.560\nWell, Dan sucks behind you.\n\n19:49.560 --> 19:50.560\nLook, you know, I sit here.\n\n19:50.560 --> 19:53.560\nI call myself an environmentalist.\n\n19:53.560 --> 19:55.560\nI drive my Chevy Volt.\n\n19:55.560 --> 19:56.560\nI donate to Sierra Club.\n\n19:56.560 --> 19:58.560\nDefenders of Wildlife on all this kind of stuff.\n\n19:58.560 --> 20:00.560\nI'm like, here I am trying to save the planet.\n\n20:00.560 --> 20:05.560\nAnd then I didn't even realize literally the worst thing for the planet is animal husbandry.\n\n20:05.560 --> 20:06.560\nI didn't know that.\n\n20:06.560 --> 20:08.560\nYou know, people say, hey, cow farts.\n\n20:08.560 --> 20:10.560\nThey're pretty bad for the atmosphere.\n\n20:10.560 --> 20:12.560\nThey're the worst thing for the atmosphere.\n\n20:12.560 --> 20:13.560\nWho knew?\n\n20:13.560 --> 20:14.560\nMethane.\n\n20:14.560 --> 20:15.560\nReally bad stuff.\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:17.560\nGuys, it's exciting podcast material.\n\n20:17.560 --> 20:21.560\nBut, I mean, you know, and not to mention the sewage runoff.\n\n20:21.560 --> 20:23.560\nCows are like literally the worst thing.\n\n20:23.560 --> 20:24.560\nDeforestation.\n\n20:24.560 --> 20:25.560\nI like cougars and wolves and bears.\n\n20:25.560 --> 20:29.560\nThey clear rain forests to make room for the farting cows.\n\n20:29.560 --> 20:30.560\nRain forests?\n\n20:30.560 --> 20:31.560\nYeah.\n\n20:31.560 --> 20:36.560\nSomething like it's one to two acres a second of rainforest throughout space and time.\n\n20:36.560 --> 20:38.560\nOne second, one to two acres.\n\n20:38.560 --> 20:44.560\nAnd something like 93% of the reason is animal husbandry or feed crops for the animal husbandry.\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:45.560\nFucking man.\n\n20:45.560 --> 20:48.560\nEverybody's like, all these fucking me guys are like, what about almond milk, man?\n\n20:48.560 --> 20:49.560\nYou fucking asshole.\n\n20:49.560 --> 20:50.560\nAlmond milk.\n\n20:50.560 --> 20:53.560\nYou know what the worst fucking drought crop is?\n\n20:53.560 --> 20:54.560\nAlfalfa.\n\n20:54.560 --> 20:57.560\nWhat do we use alfalfa for to feed cows?\n\n20:57.560 --> 20:58.560\nWhat is California?\n\n20:58.560 --> 21:01.560\nAlfalfa, go to China to feed their cows.\n\n21:01.560 --> 21:05.560\nGod damn it.\n\n21:05.560 --> 21:07.560\nAnd then I tell you what, man.\n\n21:07.560 --> 21:09.560\nCan't you hear the song?\n\n21:09.560 --> 21:11.560\nIt's the sound of angry men.\n\n21:11.560 --> 21:12.560\nI stepped this meat shit.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:14.560\nI was like, fucking, I'm out.\n\n21:14.560 --> 21:16.560\nI'm out of this meat game.\n\n21:16.560 --> 21:17.560\nI'm out of this meat game.\n\n21:17.560 --> 21:19.560\nI don't want to be a part of it anymore.\n\n21:19.560 --> 21:20.560\nAnd then it hit me.\n\n21:20.560 --> 21:21.560\nAnd then it hit me.\n\n21:21.560 --> 21:24.560\nThis is a couple weeks later, I was sitting in some hotel room.\n\n21:24.560 --> 21:26.560\nI was like, oh my God.\n\n21:26.560 --> 21:29.560\nI quit for the environmentalist reason.\n\n21:29.560 --> 21:31.560\nBut then the death and the sadness hit me.\n\n21:31.560 --> 21:33.560\nIt's such a horrible industry.\n\n21:33.560 --> 21:34.560\nThey torture these creatures.\n\n21:34.560 --> 21:39.560\nAnd even if it's in a whole foods farm with pastures and stuff, it's like, here, Betsy,\n\n21:39.560 --> 21:40.560\nlive this fucking rad life.\n\n21:40.560 --> 21:42.560\nThank you for your time.\n\n21:42.560 --> 21:43.560\nBam.\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:44.560\nSlice.\n\n21:44.560 --> 21:46.560\nAnd it's like, I don't ever hunt anything.\n\n21:46.560 --> 21:47.560\nI don't even want to kill a chicken.\n\n21:47.560 --> 21:48.560\nWhat am I doing to these animals?\n\n21:48.560 --> 21:50.560\nI want them to live.\n\n21:50.560 --> 21:52.560\nDogs are beautiful, right?\n\n21:52.560 --> 21:53.560\nWe all like dogs.\n\n21:53.560 --> 21:55.560\nPigs are the same as dogs.\n\n21:55.560 --> 21:56.560\nWhy are we cutting the pigs up?\n\n21:56.560 --> 22:00.560\nWhy are we forcing them in these little cages where they literally cut off the pig's tail\n\n22:00.560 --> 22:04.560\nin front of them so it's so painful when the pig behind them nashes on their tail that\n\n22:04.560 --> 22:06.560\nit has to kick the pig behind it.\n\n22:06.560 --> 22:09.560\nOtherwise, it's too sad to do anything about it.\n\n22:09.560 --> 22:18.560\nAnd then you get infected tail meat, and then it's a loss in terms of money.\n\n22:18.560 --> 22:20.560\nIt's not worth it, you guys.\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:25.560\nIt's not worth it.\n\n22:25.560 --> 22:26.560\nIt tastes great.\n\n22:26.560 --> 22:27.560\nIt's not worth it, though.\n\n22:27.560 --> 22:29.560\nSo, Dan, you have a little zit in your lip?\n\n22:29.560 --> 22:30.560\nYeah.\n\n22:30.560 --> 22:33.560\nThat's what you're talking about.\n\n22:33.560 --> 22:35.560\nIt's right on the line, you know?\n\n22:35.560 --> 22:36.560\nThat's one of those.\n\n22:36.560 --> 22:38.560\nThat's what you're talking about, the sadness in the air.\n\n22:38.560 --> 22:43.560\nI feel that sometimes so crushingly is like, you take a look at the word and you're like,\n\n22:43.560 --> 22:44.560\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n22:44.560 --> 22:46.560\nWe're spinning around and we're melting each other.\n\n22:46.560 --> 22:48.560\nYeah, because it hurts, but then you...\n\n22:48.560 --> 22:49.560\nIf you try to pop it.\n\n22:49.560 --> 22:50.560\nTweezers.\n\n22:50.560 --> 22:52.560\nIt probably is an ingrown here.\n\n22:52.560 --> 22:59.560\nYeah, so I was at Spring Street Lounge in New York, and I was hanging out with some Venezuelans.\n\n22:59.560 --> 23:03.560\nAnd that's not their identity, but they were from there.\n\n23:03.560 --> 23:09.560\nOne of them was a coder who also does not like Mr. Robot.\n\n23:09.560 --> 23:11.560\nOh, I like Mr. Robot.\n\n23:11.560 --> 23:14.560\nTough titties.\n\n23:14.560 --> 23:19.560\nI just watch Fight Club again.\n\n23:19.560 --> 23:22.560\nWe got a hack into the world.\n\n23:22.560 --> 23:23.560\nI love that actor.\n\n23:23.560 --> 23:24.560\nNot so bad.\n\n23:24.560 --> 23:25.560\nI love the performances.\n\n23:25.560 --> 23:26.560\nI love...\n\n23:26.560 --> 23:27.560\nThere's a lot of great things about the show.\n\n23:27.560 --> 23:31.560\nI'm just a shitty fucking petty competitive writer when young writers get attention.\n\n23:31.560 --> 23:34.560\nThere's some fucking flare up in me that I still haven't overcome.\n\n23:34.560 --> 23:36.560\nI'm going to talk to my shrink about it.\n\n23:36.560 --> 23:37.560\nI get it.\n\n23:37.560 --> 23:38.560\nI do get it.\n\n23:38.560 --> 23:42.560\nIt's goodwill hunting 30 years later.\n\n23:42.560 --> 23:44.560\nDo you have a competition with goodwill hunting?\n\n23:44.560 --> 23:45.560\nYeah, still.\n\n23:45.560 --> 23:46.560\nI'm still mad about that.\n\n23:46.560 --> 23:47.560\nHow do you like them apples?\n\n23:47.560 --> 23:48.560\nThat like thing.\n\n23:48.560 --> 23:50.560\nHow is that guy supposed to respond?\n\n23:50.560 --> 23:51.560\nLike, why would he ever say yes?\n\n23:51.560 --> 23:54.560\nWell, who says yes when you say how do you like them apples?\n\n23:54.560 --> 23:56.560\nAnd if that guy hadn't said yes...\n\n23:56.560 --> 23:57.560\nDo you know the line he's talking about?\n\n23:57.560 --> 23:59.560\nYeah, when he gets the number?\n\n23:59.560 --> 24:00.560\nYeah.\n\n24:00.560 --> 24:01.560\nWhen he says yes to it?\n\n24:01.560 --> 24:02.560\nYeah.\n\n24:02.560 --> 24:03.560\nAnd if he hadn't?\n\n24:03.560 --> 24:04.560\nNo movie.\n\n24:04.560 --> 24:06.560\nI don't remember the yes.\n\n24:06.560 --> 24:08.560\nBecause that guy ends up...\n\n24:08.560 --> 24:09.560\nNo, just come on.\n\n24:09.560 --> 24:10.560\nLet's move on.\n\n24:10.560 --> 24:11.560\nBut I was...\n\n24:11.560 --> 24:12.560\nHow good is it?\n\n24:12.560 --> 24:14.560\nI was in this bar.\n\n24:14.560 --> 24:16.560\nSo, and I'm making friends with these gentlemen.\n\n24:16.560 --> 24:18.560\nThey're very funny and interesting.\n\n24:18.560 --> 24:22.560\nOne's a coder from Venezuela.\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:23.560\nBut he was Jewish.\n\n24:23.560 --> 24:24.560\nHis name was Abraham.\n\n24:24.560 --> 24:25.560\nMaybe I'm saying too much information.\n\n24:25.560 --> 24:26.560\nMaybe now we can...\n\n24:26.560 --> 24:29.560\nHe's going to get doxxed.\n\n24:29.560 --> 24:30.560\nBut he's a coder.\n\n24:30.560 --> 24:32.560\nHe'll be able to repel the attack.\n\n24:32.560 --> 24:41.560\nBut the only way you'll know that is with a fucking voiceover.\n\n24:41.560 --> 24:43.560\nThe other guy was like an accountant.\n\n24:43.560 --> 24:46.560\nAnd I was just getting to know them and talking about it.\n\n24:46.560 --> 24:48.560\nAnd we were having such a good time.\n\n24:48.560 --> 24:53.560\nAnd then the accountant guy started wanting to talk about the politics.\n\n24:53.560 --> 24:57.560\nAnd he was like the thing about the refugees and the Trump and all this stuff.\n\n24:57.560 --> 24:59.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n24:59.560 --> 25:00.560\nLet's not do it.\n\n25:00.560 --> 25:01.560\nI've gotten to that age.\n\n25:01.560 --> 25:03.560\nI was like, let's not talk about politics.\n\n25:03.560 --> 25:04.560\nI was like, yeah.\n\n25:04.560 --> 25:05.560\nWhat should we talk about?\n\n25:05.560 --> 25:06.560\nI was like...\n\n25:06.560 --> 25:08.560\nAnd then he started telling me about all the refugees.\n\n25:08.560 --> 25:09.560\nWhat age they should be.\n\n25:09.560 --> 25:10.560\nOr they should be sent back.\n\n25:10.560 --> 25:11.560\nAnd all this stuff.\n\n25:11.560 --> 25:12.560\nAnd I'm like, come on, man.\n\n25:12.560 --> 25:16.560\nWhat am I supposed to say to this?\n\n25:16.560 --> 25:20.560\nI'm supposed to white-splain to you?\n\n25:20.560 --> 25:21.560\nHe was a...\n\n25:21.560 --> 25:22.560\nI'm not saying he was like a...\n\n25:22.560 --> 25:23.560\nHe wasn't second generation.\n\n25:23.560 --> 25:26.560\nHe was like a guy that came here.\n\n25:26.560 --> 25:28.560\nAnd he's like now...\n\n25:28.560 --> 25:29.560\nHe's in this mode.\n\n25:29.560 --> 25:32.560\nAnd then this Irish guy comes up.\n\n25:32.560 --> 25:34.560\nThis Irish-American guy.\n\n25:34.560 --> 25:36.560\nAnd he was twirling like a baton.\n\n25:36.560 --> 25:38.560\nWhat's all this about then?\n\n25:38.560 --> 25:39.560\nWell, well, well.\n\n25:39.560 --> 25:42.560\nI think the two of you should be in school right about now.\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:43.560\nNo, no.\n\n25:43.560 --> 25:48.560\nWe're supposed to get barrels to wear for our fishing trip.\n\n25:48.560 --> 25:50.560\nWe chase so much steel as our clothes.\n\n25:50.560 --> 25:52.560\nFishing in the barrels.\n\n25:52.560 --> 25:54.560\nOh, it's an old-timey day.\n\n25:54.560 --> 25:56.560\nIt's an old-timey day, isn't it?\n\n25:56.560 --> 25:58.560\nNo, he was like Colin Quinn Irish.\n\n25:58.560 --> 26:02.560\nHe sounded and kind of looked exactly like Colin Quinn.\n\n26:02.560 --> 26:04.560\nSo he pictured that archetype.\n\n26:04.560 --> 26:05.560\nHis voice sounded...\n\n26:05.560 --> 26:07.560\nI said, you sound like fucking Colin Quinn.\n\n26:07.560 --> 26:09.560\nHe's like, hey, what about the Irish?\n\n26:09.560 --> 26:14.560\nHe just heard inflammatory language and was attracted to it.\n\n26:14.560 --> 26:17.560\nLike a bee and a picnic when the soda comes open.\n\n26:17.560 --> 26:20.560\nHe was just like, hey, what about the Irish?\n\n26:20.560 --> 26:22.560\nBut it wasn't like we were going down this stuff.\n\n26:22.560 --> 26:24.560\nThe ethnic group was bad.\n\n26:24.560 --> 26:26.560\nHe just was just...\n\n26:26.560 --> 26:28.560\nIt was like he wasn't responding to anything.\n\n26:28.560 --> 26:29.560\nHe was just starting it.\n\n26:29.560 --> 26:32.560\nAnd then I was like, I had nothing about the Irish.\n\n26:32.560 --> 26:34.560\nThose guys were riling each other up,\n\n26:34.560 --> 26:37.560\nbut they liked each other because they were both like these hardliners.\n\n26:37.560 --> 26:39.560\nAnd then the Irish guy turned out to be a vet.\n\n26:39.560 --> 26:41.560\nSo now you're fucked.\n\n26:41.560 --> 26:42.560\nVeterinarian or vet?\n\n26:42.560 --> 26:43.560\nNo.\n\n26:43.560 --> 26:48.560\nThe kind you can never disagree with about anything.\n\n26:48.560 --> 26:52.560\nLike you can tell a veterinarian that cats shouldn't be put to sleep,\n\n26:52.560 --> 26:54.560\nbut you can't fucking talk.\n\n26:54.560 --> 26:57.560\nPolitics with a guy who is in the shit.\n\n26:57.560 --> 26:59.560\nHe gets to be right about everything.\n\n26:59.560 --> 27:01.560\nThat's why I don't want to talk about politics in a bar\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:03.560\nbecause somebody will come over with like one leg and go like,\n\n27:03.560 --> 27:04.560\nfuck you, I'm right about everything.\n\n27:04.560 --> 27:06.560\nAnd you're like, you are, you're right.\n\n27:06.560 --> 27:09.560\nBut you're also saying weird shit, you know?\n\n27:09.560 --> 27:11.560\nBut like...\n\n27:11.560 --> 27:14.560\nSo anyways, I just want to say all these guys were nice guys.\n\n27:14.560 --> 27:16.560\nThis isn't a story about how I was just going to a nightmare.\n\n27:16.560 --> 27:17.560\nThis is the point of my story.\n\n27:17.560 --> 27:18.560\nHas this ever...\n\n27:18.560 --> 27:21.560\nI mean, this is like, I don't know if this is a New York thing or what,\n\n27:21.560 --> 27:24.560\nbut this was the weirdest thing.\n\n27:24.560 --> 27:26.560\nBecause the guy was like, you know, he had that machismo,\n\n27:26.560 --> 27:28.560\nthat Colin Quinn machismo.\n\n27:28.560 --> 27:31.560\nAnd you guys are like, Colin Quinn's 90.\n\n27:31.560 --> 27:35.560\nWell, when I was your age, Colin Quinn had machismo.\n\n27:35.560 --> 27:39.560\nNow Colin Quinn's like, I'm going to write him a letter.\n\n27:39.560 --> 27:42.560\nDear fucko.\n\n27:42.560 --> 27:44.560\nMe and Jim Norton are going to come over\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:49.560\nand say very funny things that are going to make you feel bad.\n\n27:49.560 --> 27:53.560\nDear Colin Quinn, now you sound like Christopher Lloyd.\n\n27:53.560 --> 27:55.560\nDear fucko.\n\n27:55.560 --> 27:57.560\nI don't care who I sound like.\n\n27:57.560 --> 28:00.560\nI'm a vet.\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:03.560\nSo we're just talking, and hang on,\n\n28:03.560 --> 28:09.560\nand the Irish American, Iraq war veteran,\n\n28:09.560 --> 28:12.560\nhe starts squinting at me while I'm talking.\n\n28:12.560 --> 28:14.560\nAnd he goes like, what is this?\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:15.560\nWhat is this?\n\n28:15.560 --> 28:16.560\nYou get some kind of...\n\n28:16.560 --> 28:17.560\nAnd he said he had some phrase.\n\n28:17.560 --> 28:19.560\nHe had some like, it was some kind of nickname for something\n\n28:19.560 --> 28:20.560\nthat I've never heard.\n\n28:20.560 --> 28:22.560\nHe goes, I've got a hoochie-coochie or something like that.\n\n28:22.560 --> 28:25.560\nHe said, blig-a-duber or something.\n\n28:25.560 --> 28:27.560\nAnd he says some word that was gibberish to me.\n\n28:27.560 --> 28:29.560\nAnd he's pointing at the back of my neck.\n\n28:29.560 --> 28:32.560\nAnd I'm like, what do I have in the back of my neck?\n\n28:32.560 --> 28:34.560\nAnd he's like, I think he's...\n\n28:34.560 --> 28:36.560\nBecause I thought, well, if there's much on my neck,\n\n28:36.560 --> 28:38.560\nI can get it off, I guess, because he's already reaching for it.\n\n28:38.560 --> 28:40.560\nWould I have a spider on my neck?\n\n28:40.560 --> 28:46.560\nAnd he grabs it and he pops a zit for me.\n\n28:46.560 --> 28:48.560\nAnd I was like, oh!\n\n28:48.560 --> 28:50.560\nAnd then he wipes it with his finger.\n\n28:50.560 --> 28:52.560\nLike, he was like...\n\n28:52.560 --> 28:54.560\nWell, I don't mean like, smears it on me.\n\n28:54.560 --> 28:56.560\nI mean like, respectfully.\n\n28:56.560 --> 28:58.560\nLike, he was like, grooming me.\n\n28:58.560 --> 29:00.560\nLike, he wasn't bullying me.\n\n29:00.560 --> 29:02.560\nHe was like, grooming me.\n\n29:02.560 --> 29:05.560\nSo you had a popable, visible zit.\n\n29:05.560 --> 29:07.560\nAnd he fucking reached out.\n\n29:07.560 --> 29:08.560\nI'll take care of that.\n\n29:08.560 --> 29:10.560\nLike, I was like, his kid or something.\n\n29:10.560 --> 29:13.560\nYou were like, for a second, like a foxhole brother.\n\n29:13.560 --> 29:14.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n29:14.560 --> 29:15.560\nYeah.\n\n29:15.560 --> 29:16.560\nYeah.\n\n29:16.560 --> 29:18.560\nAnd I said, it was just one of those moments, right?\n\n29:18.560 --> 29:20.560\nBecause it was like, ow!\n\n29:20.560 --> 29:23.560\nAnd then it was like, but it was so clearly not at all like...\n\n29:23.560 --> 29:27.560\nIt was the opposite of what you'd be afraid of\n\n29:27.560 --> 29:29.560\nin an encounter with that guy.\n\n29:29.560 --> 29:31.560\nBecause that guy reminds you of just opposition\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:32.560\nand all this stuff.\n\n29:32.560 --> 29:34.560\nAnd the guy was just like belligerent and jingoistic\n\n29:34.560 --> 29:37.560\nand narcissistic and bragging about it.\n\n29:37.560 --> 29:39.560\nHis combat and like wanting to talk about\n\n29:39.560 --> 29:41.560\nall the different races and all this stuff.\n\n29:41.560 --> 29:43.560\nAnd it was like, all of that you associate with,\n\n29:43.560 --> 29:46.560\nlike, you know, this is all bad,\n\n29:46.560 --> 29:48.560\nbut really it all boils down to, this is all usually bad\n\n29:48.560 --> 29:51.560\nbecause usually it's a symptom of a guy like doing bad things.\n\n29:51.560 --> 29:52.560\nYou know?\n\n29:52.560 --> 29:55.560\nLike, he's going to end up like picking a fight\n\n29:55.560 --> 29:58.560\nor hogging the jukebox or something.\n\n29:58.560 --> 29:59.560\nYou know?\n\n29:59.560 --> 30:01.560\nHe's going to turn out he was a bass player.\n\n30:01.560 --> 30:03.560\nI'm going to listen to his shitty album all night.\n\n30:03.560 --> 30:05.560\nLike, like, like...\n\n30:05.560 --> 30:07.560\nAll right, it's not just because he's a bass player\n\n30:07.560 --> 30:09.560\nthat the album's shitty.\n\n30:09.560 --> 30:11.560\nIt's a necessary instrument.\n\n30:11.560 --> 30:13.560\nI'm just saying, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n30:13.560 --> 30:15.560\nNot to offend any of the bass players.\n\n30:15.560 --> 30:18.560\nOf which this entire audience is comprised.\n\n30:18.560 --> 30:20.560\nYou've been with that guy.\n\n30:20.560 --> 30:22.560\nDino was the guy over at his house.\n\n30:22.560 --> 30:24.560\nAnd the guy said...\n\n30:24.560 --> 30:27.560\nHe pulled out his iPod and he said,\n\n30:27.560 --> 30:30.560\nhey, do you like...\n\n30:30.560 --> 30:32.560\nHe's like, hey, let me play some stuff.\n\n30:32.560 --> 30:33.560\nDo you mind if I do a little DJing?\n\n30:33.560 --> 30:35.560\nOkay. He's like, hey, do you like...\n\n30:35.560 --> 30:37.560\nDo you like Led Zeppelin?\n\n30:37.560 --> 30:38.560\nAnd Dino's like, yeah.\n\n30:38.560 --> 30:40.560\nAnd he's like, yeah, so does my band.\n\n30:42.560 --> 30:44.560\nAnd played the whole...\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:45.560\nThere's nothing more...\n\n30:45.560 --> 30:47.560\nI can't say when someone plays their music\n\n30:47.560 --> 30:50.560\nand then just, like, watches you listening to it.\n\n30:50.560 --> 30:51.560\nYeah.\n\n30:52.560 --> 30:54.560\nAnd I just want to turn to them and go,\n\n30:54.560 --> 30:56.560\nI don't think Radiohead ever did this.\n\n30:56.560 --> 30:58.560\nI know, I can't imagine.\n\n30:58.560 --> 30:59.560\nI think they were...\n\n30:59.560 --> 31:01.560\nI think they fucking sucked it up\n\n31:01.560 --> 31:04.560\nand waited for people to come to see them.\n\n31:04.560 --> 31:08.560\nI have so many questions about the veteran Zipopper guy,\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:10.560\nbecause I know you...\n\n31:10.560 --> 31:12.560\nYou're not a physical contact fan.\n\n31:12.560 --> 31:13.560\nNo, no, yeah.\n\n31:13.560 --> 31:14.560\nThat's the thing.\n\n31:14.560 --> 31:16.560\nIt was so paternal.\n\n31:16.560 --> 31:19.560\nAlso, you've talked about the fact that you wouldn't get a massage.\n\n31:19.560 --> 31:21.560\nNo, this is on paper.\n\n31:21.560 --> 31:24.560\nIt's my worst nightmare, because it's a big jock.\n\n31:24.560 --> 31:26.560\nIt's what jocks become,\n\n31:26.560 --> 31:28.560\nwhich is in their highest form,\n\n31:28.560 --> 31:30.560\narchetypically, which is a soldier,\n\n31:30.560 --> 31:32.560\nwhich is a guy who's trained to kill.\n\n31:32.560 --> 31:35.560\nIt's also combined with, like,\n\n31:35.560 --> 31:37.560\nhe's a right-wing person\n\n31:37.560 --> 31:39.560\nwho wants to talk about, you know,\n\n31:39.560 --> 31:42.560\nhow the things that are physical about people\n\n31:42.560 --> 31:45.560\nare markers of differences that are unsolvable\n\n31:45.560 --> 31:48.560\nand because Italians do this, but the Irish do that.\n\n31:48.560 --> 31:50.560\nEverything is like a nightmare about it,\n\n31:50.560 --> 31:52.560\nbut then he did that one little thing and it was like,\n\n31:52.560 --> 31:54.560\noh, dad.\n\n31:54.560 --> 31:55.560\nAnd then he just says,\n\n31:55.560 --> 31:57.560\nyou're going to be all right, Boyle.\n\n31:57.560 --> 31:59.560\nYou're going to be all right.\n\n31:59.560 --> 32:03.560\nYour initial physical reaction was not like...\n\n32:03.560 --> 32:05.560\nWell, it was shock. I didn't know what was happening.\n\n32:05.560 --> 32:07.560\nAnd then by the time I realized what was happening,\n\n32:07.560 --> 32:09.560\nhe was, like, gingerly cleaned it, you know?\n\n32:09.560 --> 32:11.560\nLike, he popped and then he, like, you know,\n\n32:11.560 --> 32:13.560\nhe wasn't just like...\n\n32:13.560 --> 32:15.560\nYeah, he was just like...\n\n32:15.560 --> 32:17.560\nSomeone's fainting in the back.\n\n32:17.560 --> 32:21.560\nThat's a really intimate thing to do with somebody.\n\n32:21.560 --> 32:22.560\nYeah, I know.\n\n32:22.560 --> 32:24.560\nAnd also, like, in the days of, like,\n\n32:24.560 --> 32:26.560\ndisease and stuff, yeah.\n\n32:26.560 --> 32:28.560\nIt's like, wow, wait.\n\n32:28.560 --> 32:30.560\nThis person's having a...\n\n32:30.560 --> 32:32.560\nIs this one person that's just having a...\n\n32:32.560 --> 32:33.560\nTom is like...\n\n32:33.560 --> 32:35.560\nWhat you said was my first thought is, like,\n\n32:35.560 --> 32:37.560\nthis is what you do when your brothers are in a fox hole\n\n32:37.560 --> 32:40.560\nnext to you, like, when you're in the shit, like...\n\n32:40.560 --> 32:42.560\nProbably you let the zits go.\n\n32:42.560 --> 32:43.560\nRight, if they...\n\n32:43.560 --> 32:45.560\nI think not with this guy.\n\n32:45.560 --> 32:47.560\nI think he probably had his...\n\n32:47.560 --> 32:49.560\nYou don't have the best skin in the whole army.\n\n32:49.560 --> 32:51.560\nThere are some people that like to pop zits.\n\n32:51.560 --> 32:52.560\nI got to be honest.\n\n32:52.560 --> 32:53.560\nMy mom is one of them.\n\n32:53.560 --> 32:55.560\nShe's like, she loved it when we were teens\n\n32:55.560 --> 32:57.560\nbecause she'd be like, give me your back.\n\n32:57.560 --> 32:58.560\nAnd it's like...\n\n32:58.560 --> 33:00.560\nThat's actually part of the reason I got the story up\n\n33:00.560 --> 33:02.560\nis because I knew, when he did it, I also knew\n\n33:02.560 --> 33:04.560\nthat's part of what mitigated it is because I have...\n\n33:04.560 --> 33:07.560\nI once dated a girl who had that thing,\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:09.560\nand I was like, it's so fucking weird\n\n33:09.560 --> 33:11.560\nbecause she's like, can I please?\n\n33:11.560 --> 33:13.560\nAnd I'm like, can you please?\n\n33:14.560 --> 33:17.560\nAre you sure you're not just trying to impress me?\n\n33:17.560 --> 33:19.560\nNot that it would?\n\n33:19.560 --> 33:21.560\nLike, like, like, like...\n\n33:21.560 --> 33:22.560\nNo, I really like it.\n\n33:22.560 --> 33:23.560\nLike, like, oh, don't...\n\n33:23.560 --> 33:24.560\nYeah, save them up.\n\n33:24.560 --> 33:27.560\nLike, like, I'm not excited.\n\n33:27.560 --> 33:29.560\nLike, there are some people who fucking love it.\n\n33:29.560 --> 33:31.560\nThere's, you know, videos online of people with like...\n\n33:31.560 --> 33:32.560\nThey're called dermatologists.\n\n33:32.560 --> 33:33.560\nYou get a facial...\n\n33:33.560 --> 33:35.560\nTheir favorite thing is the extraction part.\n\n33:35.560 --> 33:36.560\nThey love...\n\n33:36.560 --> 33:38.560\nI always ask them, like, you ever had a facial?\n\n33:38.560 --> 33:39.560\nOh, God, yes.\n\n33:39.560 --> 33:40.560\nYeah.\n\n33:40.560 --> 33:41.560\nOh, I can tell...\n\n33:41.560 --> 33:42.560\nWhat am I, an animal?\n\n33:43.560 --> 33:44.560\nAm I savage?\n\n33:44.560 --> 33:46.560\nI can tell because your face fairly glows, Thomas.\n\n33:46.560 --> 33:48.560\nI have night creams and day creams.\n\n33:50.560 --> 33:52.560\nFuck yeah, you do.\n\n33:52.560 --> 33:54.560\nWhat's your, what kind of...\n\n33:54.560 --> 33:55.560\nYou got a daily scrub you use?\n\n33:55.560 --> 33:58.560\nOh, no, I stay away from the scrubs that'll dry you out.\n\n33:59.560 --> 34:01.560\nDry you out quicker than a week in the desert.\n\n34:05.560 --> 34:08.560\nThere's one little epilogue to this story.\n\n34:08.560 --> 34:09.560\nThat's a good story.\n\n34:09.560 --> 34:11.560\nThat happens, that's in the midst of this.\n\n34:11.560 --> 34:13.560\nIt's like, okay, so that was weird.\n\n34:13.560 --> 34:16.560\nAnd it didn't necessarily start liking the guy.\n\n34:16.560 --> 34:18.560\nIt was just, I just found that kind of profound,\n\n34:18.560 --> 34:21.560\nthat unexpected things were happening\n\n34:21.560 --> 34:24.560\nin an encounter that from the moment that guy came up\n\n34:24.560 --> 34:26.560\nand said, what about the Irish?\n\n34:26.560 --> 34:28.560\nI was like, this is the fucking worst.\n\n34:30.560 --> 34:31.560\nBut it didn't, at the straight,\n\n34:31.560 --> 34:33.560\nit didn't end the way I thought it would.\n\n34:33.560 --> 34:35.560\nI didn't want to hang out there anyway, though.\n\n34:35.560 --> 34:37.560\nBut the biggest reason I didn't want to hang out there\n\n34:37.560 --> 34:40.560\nis because there were four guys sitting over at that\n\n34:40.560 --> 34:45.560\nend bar part where we would be if we were all there.\n\n34:45.560 --> 34:47.560\nBy the Cab Calloway Jive Diction or anything?\n\n34:47.560 --> 34:50.560\nAnd some, I think, they were regulars\n\n34:50.560 --> 34:52.560\nor they were older and they were like,\n\n34:52.560 --> 34:54.560\nthey seemed like literary types or something.\n\n34:54.560 --> 34:56.560\nAnd remember the story about me being mistaken\n\n34:56.560 --> 34:59.560\nfor a Mr. Grossman, like that was the same bar\n\n34:59.560 --> 35:01.560\nbecause I was wearing a jacket.\n\n35:01.560 --> 35:04.560\nThese guys all looked like Mr. Grossmans.\n\n35:04.560 --> 35:09.560\nAnd they were like, they were glowering at all of us\n\n35:09.560 --> 35:12.560\nthe whole time because we were all talking loudly.\n\n35:12.560 --> 35:15.560\nAnd I could hear them doing this running commentary\n\n35:15.560 --> 35:16.560\nthe whole time.\n\n35:16.560 --> 35:18.560\nAnd they were like, they were nerds\n\n35:18.560 --> 35:20.560\nand they were intellectuals because the real reason\n\n35:20.560 --> 35:22.560\nI left the bar is because I was getting angry\n\n35:22.560 --> 35:23.560\nand angry at them.\n\n35:23.560 --> 35:25.560\nBecause I wanted to turn to them and go,\n\n35:25.560 --> 35:26.560\nwhy don't you guys fucking cheer up\n\n35:26.560 --> 35:27.560\nor go somewhere you can be happy?\n\n35:27.560 --> 35:31.560\nFucking talking to two guys and a fucking,\n\n35:31.560 --> 35:34.560\nyeah, he's a fucking Mama Luke.\n\n35:34.560 --> 35:36.560\nBut he's popping my zits.\n\n35:36.560 --> 35:38.560\nWhat are you doing for me?\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:40.560\nWhat have you done for me lately?\n\n35:40.560 --> 35:42.560\nHe fought for this fucking country, Jack.\n\n35:42.560 --> 35:47.560\nBut it wasn't like, there was prejudice\n\n35:47.560 --> 35:49.560\ncoming from the guys who were probably\n\n35:49.560 --> 35:51.560\nthe most liberal and intellectual\n\n35:51.560 --> 35:53.560\nbecause they were like, oh, there's these,\n\n35:53.560 --> 35:55.560\nhere's these types that are going to bring.\n\n35:55.560 --> 35:58.560\nThey were a shadow that I was casting.\n\n35:58.560 --> 36:01.560\nBefore I got my zit popped,\n\n36:01.560 --> 36:05.560\nI was terrified that certain kinds of people\n\n36:05.560 --> 36:07.560\nare going to make your bar experience not right.\n\n36:07.560 --> 36:08.560\nAnd they were sitting there the whole time\n\n36:08.560 --> 36:10.560\njust statler and a walled orphan.\n\n36:12.560 --> 36:13.560\nAnd so I boned out.\n\n36:13.560 --> 36:18.560\nThat's the end of my story about getting my zits.\n\n36:18.560 --> 36:19.560\nAmerica.\n\n36:19.560 --> 36:20.560\nAnd as he walked home,\n\n36:20.560 --> 36:23.560\nthe ghost of future Christmas was like,\n\n36:23.560 --> 36:26.560\nyou've learned a valuable lesson.\n\n36:26.560 --> 36:29.560\nI want to know how many soldiers,\n\n36:29.560 --> 36:35.560\nMarines, airmen seem to go out there doing their duty\n\n36:35.560 --> 36:39.560\nand just, buddy, you got a thing over there.\n\n36:39.560 --> 36:42.560\nActors, you can probably verify this\n\n36:42.560 --> 36:44.560\nunless the community cast is really weird.\n\n36:44.560 --> 36:45.560\nBut I assumed that was like,\n\n36:45.560 --> 36:47.560\nif you watch enough dailies,\n\n36:47.560 --> 36:49.560\nthere's so much footage of,\n\n36:49.560 --> 36:51.560\nbecause they're sitting there for 12 hours\n\n36:51.560 --> 36:52.560\nunder hot lights.\n\n36:52.560 --> 36:53.560\nThey're at each other's mercy.\n\n36:53.560 --> 36:57.560\nSo they'll just like, like, oh, you got to,\n\n36:57.560 --> 36:58.560\nyou got to, you got to.\n\n36:58.560 --> 37:00.560\nAnd they're like, oh, can you just get it?\n\n37:00.560 --> 37:02.560\nAnd they're just picking each other's noses and stuff.\n\n37:02.560 --> 37:03.560\nNo.\n\n37:03.560 --> 37:04.560\nLike, like, like.\n\n37:04.560 --> 37:05.560\nStay out of here.\n\n37:05.560 --> 37:06.560\nYou don't want to, you don't look at it.\n\n37:06.560 --> 37:07.560\nYou don't want to get in there.\n\n37:07.560 --> 37:10.560\nThere's too much.\n\n37:10.560 --> 37:12.560\nYou always think you're going to go in,\n\n37:12.560 --> 37:13.560\nget a little treat.\n\n37:13.560 --> 37:16.560\nYou come out with a full feast.\n\n37:16.560 --> 37:17.560\nToo much.\n\n37:17.560 --> 37:18.560\nAnd I hate it.\n\n37:18.560 --> 37:20.560\nI hate it when people grab your nose,\n\n37:20.560 --> 37:22.560\nwhen people pinch your nose.\n\n37:22.560 --> 37:24.560\nBecause there's always a fucking, yeah.\n\n37:24.560 --> 37:25.560\nAnd it digs.\n\n37:25.560 --> 37:26.560\nAnd then I got a nosebleed\n\n37:26.560 --> 37:28.560\nbecause you thought it was so funny.\n\n37:28.560 --> 37:29.560\nWhen people pinch your nose,\n\n37:29.560 --> 37:30.560\nwhen people put your nose,\n\n37:30.560 --> 37:31.560\nyou got a sharp one in there.\n\n37:31.560 --> 37:33.560\nYou got a fucking, you got an angular one.\n\n37:33.560 --> 37:34.560\nYeah.\n\n37:34.560 --> 37:35.560\nI go, no, no, don't pinch noses.\n\n37:35.560

what are you pinching nose for?\n\n37:41.560 --> 37:42.560\nNo, I agree with that.\n\n37:42.560 --> 37:43.560\nGet out of my nose.\n\n37:43.560 --> 37:44.560\nBut that's not this.\n\n37:44.560 --> 37:46.560\nThis is actors protecting each other from the,\n\n37:46.560 --> 37:49.560\nyou know, they're like clearing out each other's natural openings and stuff.\n\n37:49.560 --> 37:51.560\nI'm just at my point being,\n\n37:51.560 --> 37:54.560\nwho God knows what soldiers do after a while,\n\n37:54.560 --> 37:55.560\nbecause even actors,\n\n37:55.560 --> 37:59.560\nwhich is just that little bit of like camaraderie and fatigue,\n\n37:59.560 --> 38:01.560\nyou know, and reliance on each other,\n\n38:01.560 --> 38:05.560\nthe behavior already starts to get unrecognizable\n\n38:05.560 --> 38:08.560\nfrom the perspective of the normal world.\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:13.560\nOh, would you be,\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:14.560\noh, what if Dan,\n\n38:14.560 --> 38:16.560\nif you found somebody

--> 38:24.560\nthat was really into and totally comfortable with\n\n38:24.560 --> 38:27.560\nthat kind of back extraction kind of service.\n\n38:27.560 --> 38:29.560\nWould you be down for that?\n\n38:29.560 --> 38:30.560\nNo.\n\n38:30.560 --> 38:32.560\nIt was only because he sneak attacked you and came up and did that.\n\n38:32.560 --> 38:33.560\nYeah.\n\n38:33.560 --> 38:34.560\nI wasn't like, oh, thank God he did that.\n\n38:34.560 --> 38:35.560\nI'm so happy that got done.\n\n38:35.560 --> 38:39.560\nI was just like, it was only just that he defied my\n\n38:39.560 --> 38:44.560\nevery fucking line that I had drawn for his personality.\n\n38:44.560 --> 38:45.560\nI tell ya.\n\n38:45.560 --> 38:47.560\nHe could have said like,\n\n38:47.560 --> 38:49.560\noh, I love Jenga.\n\n38:49.560 --> 38:50.560\nI don't know.\n\n38:50.560 --> 38:51.560\nHe could have said anything just random.\n\n38:51.560 --> 38:53.560\nHe turned out to be a human being\n\n38:53.560 --> 38:57.560\nand not like this fucking straw dog that I had created\n\n38:57.560 --> 39:01.560\nand was trying to figure out how to avoid a fight with.\n\n39:01.560 --> 39:03.560\nHe wasn't thinking that about me.\n\n39:03.560 --> 39:06.560\nOtherwise, he wouldn't have popped my sit.\n\n39:06.560 --> 39:08.560\nIf he had made decisions about me\n\n39:08.560 --> 39:10.560\nand was that adherent to them,\n\n39:10.560 --> 39:12.560\nI've been drinking in bars so long\n\n39:12.560 --> 39:14.560\nand there's this fucking kind of knucklehead that comes up\n\n39:14.560 --> 39:17.560\nand you're just like, no, no, I'm too young.\n\n39:17.560 --> 39:20.560\nLife is too short.\n\n39:20.560 --> 39:24.560\nHave you ever been scrubbed at a Korean spa?\n\n39:24.560 --> 39:28.560\nI used to go to this place called We Spots in Koreatown.\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:29.560\nIt's really cool.\n\n39:29.560 --> 39:31.560\nI loved it there, but I mean, not to get weird\n\n39:31.560 --> 39:34.560\nbecause of this TV show, I can't go there\n\n39:34.560 --> 39:36.560\nbecause I'll just be like nude and chilling out\n\n39:36.560 --> 39:38.560\nand somebody will be like, hey, fucking Richard.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:40.560\nI'll be like, I don't like this anymore.\n\n39:40.560 --> 39:42.560\nYou've ruined it, you've ruined it.\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:44.560\nBut I used to go there and in the corner always,\n\n39:44.560 --> 39:46.560\nthere's the full body scrubs where it's,\n\n39:46.560 --> 39:49.560\nyou're in the spa, you're getting over your hang-ups,\n\n39:49.560 --> 39:52.560\nyou're like, I'm nude, I'm comfortable with it.\n\n39:52.560 --> 39:55.560\nThat guy's got the biggest dick I've ever seen in my life.\n\n39:55.560 --> 39:57.560\nI don't care.\n\n39:57.560 --> 39:59.560\nAnd then there are these people in the corner\n\n39:59.560 --> 40:02.560\nthat they're lying on the bed and there's a man,\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:05.560\nand then I'm sure a woman in the woman's part,\n\n40:05.560 --> 40:08.560\nand they are vigorously full body scrubbing\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:11.560\nthe man who's lying down with, I guess,\n\n40:11.560 --> 40:14.560\nlike a sponge and soap and high pressure water\n\n40:14.560 --> 40:16.560\nand they're up in their crack.\n\n40:16.560 --> 40:20.560\nThey're everywhere, legs back and they're ripping around\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:23.560\nand they're up in the thing and they're scrubbing the crack\n\n40:23.560 --> 40:25.560\nand they're just like, oh, yeah.\n\n40:25.560 --> 40:27.560\nAnd I was like, I've always looked at that with envy\n\n40:27.560 --> 40:30.560\nof like, how could you have the security of your own body\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:33.560\nto be like, scrub me as hard as you fucking can.\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:38.560\nNow, any crevice I have, get in there\n\n40:38.560 --> 40:40.560\nand don't push your foot around.\n\n40:40.560 --> 40:42.560\nScrub me, you bitch.\n\n40:42.560 --> 40:48.560\nAnd like, I can't, I can't, I can't.\n\n40:48.560 --> 40:50.560\nAnd another gentleman, you don't know.\n\n40:50.560 --> 40:54.560\nThomas, just surrender to the scrub.\n\n40:54.560 --> 40:57.560\nBecause the Korean spot, it's like being in the middle\n\n40:57.560 --> 40:59.560\nof a really sexy street fight.\n\n40:59.560 --> 41:00.560\nLike, you're getting your ass kicked.\n\n41:00.560 --> 41:01.560\nNo, don't listen to him.\n\n41:01.560 --> 41:02.560\nHere's why.\n\n41:02.560 --> 41:03.560\nIf you have anxiety about that kind of thing,\n\n41:03.560 --> 41:05.560\nwell, those people that you think are your heroes\n\n41:05.560 --> 41:07.560\nin the moment, like, those are the same people that,\n\n41:07.560 --> 41:09.560\nyou know what else they do really well?\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:10.560\nThey merge on the freeway.\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:13.560\nThey don't give a fuck.\n\n41:13.560 --> 41:14.560\nBecause they have no anxiety.\n\n41:14.560 --> 41:17.560\nThey have no fear about anyone's judgment\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:19.560\nand they kill people.\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:20.560\nThey fucking murder people.\n\n41:20.560 --> 41:24.560\nThe first time you get a scrub is by accident.\n\n41:24.560 --> 41:25.560\nYou don't know.\n\n41:25.560 --> 41:26.560\nI'll get the full...\n\n41:26.560 --> 41:27.560\nHave you ever had a scrub?\n\n41:27.560 --> 41:28.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:29.560\nYou've had a full scrub?\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:30.560\nFuck yeah.\n\n41:30.560 --> 41:31.560\nHave you seen him drive?\n\n41:31.560 --> 41:32.560\nHave you seen him drive?\n\n41:32.560 --> 41:34.560\nDo you use turn signals?\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:35.560\nDo you?\n\n41:35.560 --> 41:36.560\nHave you seen me merge?\n\n41:36.560 --> 41:37.560\nDo you use turn signals?\n\n41:37.560 --> 41:38.560\nOh, I'm like Barishnaka.\n\n41:38.560 --> 41:41.560\nNot only do I use turn signals, I indicate.\n\n41:41.560 --> 41:42.560\nThat's good.\n\n41:42.560 --> 41:43.560\nI'm an indicator.\n\n41:43.560 --> 41:44.560\nI call them indicators too?\n\n41:44.560 --> 41:45.560\nI'm an indicator.\n\n41:45.560 --> 41:46.560\nI got flack for calling them indicators.\n\n41:46.560 --> 41:47.560\nYeah.\n\n41:47.560 --> 41:48.560\nI've been bullied in calling them indicators.\n\n41:48.560 --> 41:53.560\nWell, Dan and my Scottish ex-girlfriend were in Scotland for the holidays a couple years\n\n41:53.560 --> 41:54.560\nago.\n\n41:54.560 --> 41:55.560\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n41:55.560 --> 41:56.560\nScrubs.\n\n41:56.560 --> 41:57.560\nWhat?\n\n41:57.560 --> 41:58.560\nDon't try and tell me.\n\n41:58.560 --> 41:59.560\nI don't want to know about Scotland.\n\n41:59.560 --> 42:04.560\nI don't want to know about how the fuck you have the brass and the audacity to get your\n\n42:04.560 --> 42:05.560\nbodice mug.\n\n42:05.560 --> 42:06.560\nMy first scrub...\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:07.560\nMy first scrub was a little...\n\n42:07.560 --> 42:08.560\nOh, my God.\n\n42:08.560 --> 42:10.560\nYou never forget your first scrub, by the way.\n\n42:10.560 --> 42:11.560\nI wouldn't know.\n\n42:11.560 --> 42:13.560\nThe first scrub is the deepest.\n\n42:13.560 --> 42:14.560\nIt is deep.\n\n42:14.560 --> 42:15.560\nThey go deep.\n\n42:15.560 --> 42:16.560\nOh, it's fucking...\n\n42:16.560 --> 42:17.560\nThey get right up in there.\n\n42:17.560 --> 42:21.560\nNo, it's all hands on dick, those fucking scrubs, man.\n\n42:21.560 --> 42:23.560\nNo, it's fucking...\n\n42:23.560 --> 42:25.560\nBut it's really vigorous.\n\n42:25.560 --> 42:26.560\nYeah.\n\n42:26.560 --> 42:27.560\nAnd you're like, oh, my God.\n\n42:27.560 --> 42:28.560\nI don't know that...\n\n42:28.560 --> 42:35.120\nThis might cross a line of my tolerance for not intimacy, but this is really wild.\n\n42:35.120 --> 42:38.760\nBut the first time I did that, I went with a gal that was a friend of mine, and we went\n\n42:38.760 --> 42:43.560\nto Little Tokyo, and they walk all over, and your joints are cracking and popping.\n\n42:43.560 --> 42:49.160\nI was trying, like, I faced down, trying to visualize what she could possibly be doing\n\n42:49.160 --> 42:50.560\nto make the sensation that was going on.\n\n42:50.560 --> 42:54.560\nI was like, does she have 40 elbows?\n\n42:54.560 --> 42:55.560\nIt was...\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:56.560\nDid she call her friends in?\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:58.560\nLike, what the fuck is going on?\n\n42:58.560 --> 43:00.560\nThey're gang scrubbing, man.\n\n43:00.560 --> 43:02.560\nGet them!\n\n43:02.560 --> 43:05.560\nWait, so you had a lady scrubbist?\n\n43:05.560 --> 43:06.560\nI had a scrub...\n\n43:06.560 --> 43:07.560\nA lady scrubber.\n\n43:07.560 --> 43:08.560\nOoh!\n\n43:08.560 --> 43:10.560\nWouldn't fly a weasel.\n\n43:10.560 --> 43:12.560\nAre the von traps back there?\n\n43:12.560 --> 43:14.560\nI was trying to plus your bit.\n\n43:14.560 --> 43:17.560\nThen she was moving a little slow tonight.\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:22.560\nBut one time I got a gift certificate a long time ago to the Burke Williams in West Hollywood,\n\n43:22.560 --> 43:26.560\nwhich I think is gone, which is like where Crunch is, like on Sunset and...\n\n43:26.560 --> 43:27.560\nCrunch.\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:29.560\nLike Crescent Heights, right?\n\n43:29.560 --> 43:30.560\nSo I went in there and...\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:33.560\nIt's Crunch, near a pump.\n\n43:33.560 --> 43:38.560\nRight across the street from Tuft.\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:43.560\nThere's a dog groomer, it's called Balls, for no reason.\n\n43:43.560 --> 43:45.560\nSo I go into the spa.\n\n43:45.560 --> 43:46.560\nI know that it's routine.\n\n43:46.560 --> 43:48.560\nYou get a locker, you get a bathrobe.\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:49.560\nYou can go...\n\n43:49.560 --> 43:50.560\nYou can choose your own adventure.\n\n43:50.560 --> 43:55.560\nI can go into the tub and I can go into the sauna or to the steam room.\n\n43:55.560 --> 43:59.560\nOr I can sit and drink, you know, coconut lemon water.\n\n43:59.560 --> 44:01.560\nNot coconut, cucumber, whatever.\n\n44:01.560 --> 44:02.560\nYou can read a book.\n\n44:02.560 --> 44:08.560\nAnd then, but like if you go into any of the facilities, you have a towel or can be naked.\n\n44:08.560 --> 44:12.560\nSo I go into the steam room and I have my towel and you sit down.\n\n44:12.560 --> 44:16.560\nI walk in and there was, let's say, seven, eight guys in there already.\n\n44:16.560 --> 44:20.560\nEvery one of them was the hottest guy you've ever seen.\n\n44:20.560 --> 44:25.560\nEverybody was like, David Beckham's hotter younger brother.\n\n44:25.560 --> 44:27.560\nAnd it was just like, just cock out.\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:29.560\nAnd everyone's just talking like, what are you getting?\n\n44:29.560 --> 44:30.560\nI'm getting the semen's return.\n\n44:30.560 --> 44:33.560\nIt's not semen's, it's called...\n\n44:33.560 --> 44:36.560\nThe semen's demise?\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:37.560\nSo what was he going to say?\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:39.560\nThe semen's repose?\n\n44:39.560 --> 44:42.560\nThere was one called the Hunter's Retreat.\n\n44:42.560 --> 44:45.560\nAnd so they had all these names, but they were scrubbing involved on the set.\n\n44:45.560 --> 44:48.560\nSo you
