WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.100
Back finally in Hollywood, California from our excursion in New York City

00:04.100 --> 00:06.900
and some of the craziest shit we've ever really purported.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.600
Harmontown is now in session!

00:17.100 --> 00:20.900
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, please. Spencer to the stage.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.400
We missed you, Spencer.

00:25.400 --> 00:31.400
And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.400
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.400
I can tell you have a weird energy.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.400
You're thinking, uh-oh, dad, dad, dad got a divorce.

00:54.400 --> 00:59.400
No, the shave happens, but this was an absolute accident.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.400
I went drunk into a barber shop in New York.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.400
I did want to get a trim, but I've never gotten a trim from a barber,

01:07.400 --> 01:11.400
so he said, what number? And I said, one.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.400
You just said, aimed in the dark?

01:15.400 --> 01:18.400
Yeah, I looked at his face and said, I'll have what you're having.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.400
He had like a beard, but he was a younger gentleman with black.

01:23.400 --> 01:30.400
So for him, this looks like a beard, but for me, now I look like a strange lab rat

01:30.400 --> 01:34.400
that's going through a George Michael phase.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.400
You know that phase.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.400
But don't worry, dad's fine.

01:43.400 --> 01:49.400
He's still jerking off on mannequin legs and making breakfast,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.400
and everything's going to be fine.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.400
The dogs don't seem too happy.

01:54.400 --> 02:00.400
Nigel keeps shitting everywhere and eating everything, but that's sad.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.400
Does he eat his own poop? Because that would be a self-solving problem.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
Yeah, I know, I wish.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.400
Yeah, it's like he's running out of shit to eat.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.400
It's all turning into shit, yeah.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.400
Yeah, yeah.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.400
Put it in the New Yorker, Harmon.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.400
I know, I thought, well, I do think in all seriousness,

02:19.400 --> 02:22.400
probably there's a, well, I'm not going to blame myself for the bad mood

02:22.400 --> 02:25.400
unless you guys heard us talking shit about L.A. in the New York shows.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.400
Sometimes we go to different cities and we're like, fuck those guys.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.400
We're just kidding.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.400
But if you're like me, you're a little, you're a little,

02:32.400 --> 02:34.400
the wind was taking out of your sails.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
There was something about today, even though the shit didn't really go down today,

02:37.400 --> 02:40.400
the shit went down last week, specifically while we were on stage

02:40.400 --> 02:43.400
for one of the shows, you know, the horrible events happened.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.400
But it's just the wake of it all.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
I think it hit a tipping point today.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
I was like, I'm not going to do anything, I'm not going to do anything,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.400
I'm not going to do anything, I'm not going to do anything,

02:51.400 --> 02:53.400
I'm not going to do anything or taking any information

02:53.400 --> 02:56.400
without just feeling fucking apocalyptic about everything.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.400
It just seems like, you know, I stood here and promised everybody

02:59.400 --> 03:01.400
that Trump was a joke and that, you know,

03:01.400 --> 03:03.400
because the Irish were worried about it when Aaron was over there.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
And I was like, that guy's not going to wear it.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.400
It's like, this guy's a fucking antichrist.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
You just can't, then people keep, you know,

03:10.400 --> 03:12.400
and I don't think you should keep tweeting this stuff

03:12.400 --> 03:15.400
if you discover, oh, 20 years ago Trump was racist

03:15.400 --> 03:20.240
Like, the sad thing about it is it's like, well, what are we, what are we waiting for

03:20.240 --> 03:23.680
the thing where all these idiots are going to go, you know what, you're right, he seems

03:23.680 --> 03:26.000
like a bad guy.

03:26.000 --> 03:34.520
He's appealing to the most basest, fearful, horrible, part of, I'm not going to say the

03:34.520 --> 03:39.160
most horrible people because the thing, the way to fight this is to believe that even

03:39.160 --> 03:43.280
the ignorant have a little Buddha inside of them that we can tickle into the chin and

03:43.280 --> 03:48.920
bring them out, give them a shot of wheatgrass and a pat on the back and just say, look man,

03:48.920 --> 03:54.540
we're scared too, we don't want the country to be broke, but don't fucking surround a

03:54.540 --> 04:00.300
mosque and holding a gun, wearing a ski mask, that's not a protest, what are you protesting?

04:00.300 --> 04:04.720
This is insane, the thing is, it's just getting insane, the airlines like kicked these guys

04:04.720 --> 04:08.880
off, but like, I think that happened to two different airlines, like, and the press is

04:08.880 --> 04:12.480
kind of fucking playing ball with it because they're not just calling it racism now, they're

04:12.480 --> 04:16.040
calling it like religious intolerance and anti-Muslim, it's like, the people didn't

04:16.040 --> 04:20.600
know they were Muslim, they based it on something else, I'm sure, I'm sure if you were an atheist

04:20.600 --> 04:25.520
Arab and someone didn't want to get on a plane with you, they're not like detecting your

04:25.520 --> 04:33.880
religion, they're not fucking academics, what am I, I'm complaining to a very sad choir,

04:33.880 --> 04:36.200
I mean, whatever, but I wanted to acknowledge this.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.720
I feel like the mood was just because it was kind of hot today.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.720
Oh, okay.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.480
Have you guys not been watching the news?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.480
I'm sorry.

04:43.480 --> 04:49.920
It was just really, it was just really warm for mid-late November.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.120
I put me in a bad mood, also, I've just stopped watching the news now, I mean, I'll get it

04:55.120 --> 04:58.640
through bits and pieces, but like, when we got to New York, I got these texts from my

04:58.640 --> 05:01.520
brother and some friends saying, did you hear about what happened and like, are your friends

05:01.520 --> 05:02.520
okay out there?

05:02.520 --> 05:07.760
And I was like, we have to walk on stage right now, so I just put my head in the dirt, like,

05:07.760 --> 05:11.880
which is a terrible thing to have to do, but we better than trying to come up with bits

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
about it.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.400
We got up to the show and there was, there were 17 NYPD out in front of the theater,

05:18.400 --> 05:22.560
and I didn't notice that, but you told me about that, or someone else told us about it.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.080
There was literally 12, I mean, we had the nut because we were like, how many are they

05:25.080 --> 05:26.080
here?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
There's 12.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.680
It's like, can you imagine there were 12 cops basically every single place in New York.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.200
I have to imagine there was like, volunteer.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.600
Well, I think there wasn't the answer.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.680
We said like, like, we're like, are we a, well, yeah, because we panicked a little bit.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.680
We sat down on the green room.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.080
I think it might have been an ad sit that was because we're just like, wow, can you imagine

05:40.080 --> 05:42.920
this is so sad because everybody, you know, the cops are sad.

05:42.920 --> 05:49.760
Like nobody really believes in that moment that there's a threat, but you know, like,

05:49.760 --> 05:53.880
there's no, but, but at the same time, everyone understands that this has to be done now.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.880
And that's what makes everyone sad.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.840
It's just like, oh, our lives have been eclipsed by tragedy and there's nothing we can do.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.320
And even the cops feel that way and the kids feel that way.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.200
And everyone's just like, okay, wave the baton or you go in.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.560
And it was just very morose, sad vibe, but the strange way is also kind of uplifting

06:09.560 --> 06:13.000
because obviously like all of those police, they have to come from somewhere.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.120
So if not, if not, like there must have been volunteers, like putting on NYPD flak jackets.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.960
I don't know if that's legal or I don't think that's, well, I don't know how many fucking

06:23.960 --> 06:28.360
NYPD, but they said they pull out of the reason why they put so many cops in a place is that

06:28.360 --> 06:32.680
because there's more than 500 people in this building and that's, that's there's 8 million

06:32.680 --> 06:33.680
people.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.560
Because there's 700 people in most of the hotels.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.600
It was the counterterrorism.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.840
It was the counter.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.120
So, okay, so, so, so we were sitting in the green room and we're like, I was just operating

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
on the assumption of like, oh yeah, where are all these cops coming from?

06:46.120 --> 06:47.360
And then I think it was AdSit.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.320
I think it's kind of AdSit when like, do you think maybe it's because they have specific

06:51.320 --> 06:54.800
reason to think there's a threat here and we're like, what, oh, fuck.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.600
And I was like, we just want to feel bad about international tragedy.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.640
We don't want to start being narcissistically panicked about it.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.920
But I wouldn't, I couldn't get that out of my mind.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.240
And then some things happened during those two shows.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.520
A young lady went out and asked the cops like specifically, she's like, would you please

07:10.520 --> 07:13.320
tell us if there's something and they were like, no, no, no, no.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.560
It's every place with over 300 people and blah, blah, blah.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.360
No, I, I, I almost called the counterterrorism unit when you took your pants off at the end

07:19.360 --> 07:20.880
of the second shoot.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.960
I think they almost came up there.

07:21.960 --> 07:29.280
I believe in that moment I was as close as I have ever gotten to being a terrorist.

07:29.280 --> 07:35.800
I certainly was not celebrating freedom or I was, I wasn't rewarding it.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.760
Um, yeah, I don't know.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
Jet blue.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
Okay.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.760
That's been our show.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.760
Good night, everybody.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
I don't know.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.560
What was the picture you posted of the menu?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
Was that the, was that a jet blue?

07:49.560 --> 07:50.760
Yeah, I don't, I don't understand that.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.480
Is it looking at my, yeah, I Instagram it.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.160
There's nothing to talk about because I don't fucking understand it.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.720
It's like these menu items on the, those like these little tiny icons and one looks like

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
a little horse.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.240
And one of them is like a little, either a smaller horse or a dog and it's like each

08:01.240 --> 08:02.240
menu item.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.400
It's like the where you would put like a heart if it was a little cholesterol or something

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
like that.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.920
So it's like, oh, this one has horse plus dog.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.520
There was a, there was a big horse.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.200
I looked closely at it.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.800
It's the same horse is just smaller, but it was big horse plus smaller horse facing

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
big horse.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.800
Right.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
Yeah.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.640
Which is like a horse plus small horse equals like this little, this little one and a half

08:21.640 --> 08:28.200
horse is, but my, my, my guess on that is it's, there's full or half sized portions

08:28.200 --> 08:29.200
available.

08:29.200 --> 08:35.800
So you, I could, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse or I'm, I'm, I'm a horse so hungry

08:35.800 --> 08:40.760
I could have the full pasta or I'm a, I'm a horse so small I could only have the half

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
pasta.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
All right.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
All right.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.880
Well, um, you know what, there's nothing, there's nothing on this list that I can't talk

08:47.880 --> 08:51.560
about with our guests tonight who has a heart out and I don't want to cheat them.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.920
So, uh, why don't we, why don't we just bring them up and start chatting.

08:54.920 --> 09:01.720
He's a fantastic, really, really intimidatingly funny guy, uh, that I, I first got to, uh,

09:01.720 --> 09:05.200
taste of, uh, his, his, his in-person talents.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.000
What am I talking about?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.080
What am I, what language am I speaking?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.960
I'm telling me love him.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.960
I do love him.

09:12.960 --> 09:19.920
I was on a podcast with him, um, uh, and, uh, and then, and then he did Harmon Quest, um,

09:19.920 --> 09:23.640
for an episode and he's just a, he's just a wonderful, wonderful, nerdy, really funny

09:23.640 --> 09:24.640
dude.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.560
And, uh, and, and, and he had to come here sooner or later.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
So he's here tonight.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.560
Let's bring Thomas Middleditch up.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.560
Oh yeah.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.560
Hello.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.560
Thank you.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
For coming.

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
Hey.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
Hey.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
Hey.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
Hey.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
Hey.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
Hey.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
Hey.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
Hey.

09:41.560 --> 09:42.560
Hey.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.560
Hey.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.560
Hey.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.560
Hey.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
Hey.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.560
Hey.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.560
Hey. Hey.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.560
Do you want anything to drink?

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
Oh no, I'm fine.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.560
I got my, my wow-wow.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.560
Do you have an early, early day tomorrow?

09:55.560 --> 09:56.560
Yes.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.560
Yes.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.280
Shoot, shoot, shootin' that old TV show, that old rag, Silicon Valley.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
Yeah.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.280
Yeah.

10:02.280 --> 10:07.160
They don't tell you, they don't tell you in the biz that you've got to start getting

10:07.160 --> 10:09.040
up at like 5 30 in the morning earlier.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.080
Sometimes it's kind of, are you guys shooting at a studio or you're on location?

10:12.080 --> 10:14.560
Sony Pictures, Motion Picture Studio lot.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
Now do you live on?

10:15.560 --> 10:16.560
Over city.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.560
Do you live on the west side, east side?

10:18.560 --> 10:19.560
I live in Hollywood.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.560
So that's, that's a hell of a drive.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.560
That's a nice 45 minute.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.560
Yeah.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.560
At 5 30, it's going to be a breeze.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.560
Yeah.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.560
There's one bar over there.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.560
Yeah.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
That's right, Dan.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.560
Story checks out.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.560
Yeah.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.560
Uh, JetBlue can't stand them.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.560
I'm sitting there, you're bringing it up.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.560
I'm like, oh, I hate them.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
Oh yeah?

10:40.560 --> 10:41.560
Let's hear your JetBlue.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.560
It's chunk.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.560
It's pretty petty and stupid.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.560
Yeah, you're a first class only flyer.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.560
No, no, I actually am a big fan of Coach.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.560
And uh.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.560
Well then you must feel that JetBlue has now sold out because they have a premium

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
class now.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.560
Oh, well, yeah, I don't, that I don't know or care about.

10:58.560 --> 11:04.560
Well, welcome to, to Mile High Coveaching, where we talk about, I don't know, where

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
are you going to say?

11:05.560 --> 11:10.560
Oh, I was just going to say, well, last time I flew them, they were doing, if you want to

11:10.560 --> 11:14.560
order something, I don't know about the horses, but they'd have, you could either get free

11:14.560 --> 11:20.560
snacks, like a bag of peanuts or whatever, and then you could pay money for like essentially

11:20.560 --> 11:25.560
snack packs, which are just packages of smaller packages of snacks.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.560
Those boxes.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.560
There's no sandwiches.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
There's no nothing.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.560
So forget it.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.560
Forget sandwiches on JetBlue.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.560
You're only getting packages of smaller packages of snacks.

11:34.560 --> 11:38.560
Well, because they convert, I mean, I don't know if that was always the case.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.560
JetBlue.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
Damn.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.560
Thomas, is your hatred of JetBlue a snack-based hatred?

11:44.560 --> 11:47.560
It's purely a snack-based hatred.

11:47.560 --> 11:52.560
You can't, we're in a world where packaging is, we're getting mounds of packaging in this

11:52.560 --> 11:57.560
world, and I can't get a sandwich now because I got to get packages of smaller packages

11:57.560 --> 11:59.560
of snacks.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.560
Not going to do it.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.560
And it is infuriating when you read, so when you read stories like that in Southwest Airlines

12:06.560 --> 12:12.560
there was a little revolt because there were two Arab gentlemen who run a pizza restaurant

12:12.560 --> 12:17.560
in Chicago together or something, and they were holding a box because he had baklava

12:17.560 --> 12:19.560
in it, because that's how terrorists operate.

12:19.560 --> 12:26.560
They get all gussied up in their best Muslim gear, and then they put a bomb in a box, and

12:26.560 --> 12:30.560
they just walk up to the plane, and they go, can I please get on the plane?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.560
And they go, yeah, sure, that's just pizza, right?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.560
Come on in.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.560
And so somebody went up and said, I'm not flying with him.

12:37.560 --> 12:43.560
And then this entire airline, you know, these people who are always high-roading you if

12:43.560 --> 12:53.560
you've had one too many, and you're, as Dino once did, you simply mistake the cockpit door

12:53.560 --> 12:57.560
for the bathroom, and it's locked so you're banging on it.

12:57.560 --> 13:01.560
That actually happened to Dino for real.

13:01.560 --> 13:05.560
He was so drunk that, I wasn't there, but he tells us he was so drunk, he was like,

13:05.560 --> 13:07.560
who the fuck's in the bathroom?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.560
It's been forever, and he's like, banging on the cockpit door.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.560
Very dangerous, a very dangerous thing.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.560
Not a good move.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.560
But it is something extra outrageous about that, because you're always living under the

13:16.560 --> 13:23.560
tyranny of these unremarkables, these threshold guardians who are like, it used to be there

13:23.560 --> 13:30.560
in the hospitality business, and then after 9-11 they became these fucking undeputized

13:30.560 --> 13:31.560
air marshals.

13:31.560 --> 13:38.560
They were like, oh good, no more fucking Mr. Nice Guy, and by the way, never was nice.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.560
And now it's just the tone and all that shit.

13:41.560 --> 13:46.560
And you're always in a bad mood, and you're always hyper aware of the class system, because

13:46.560 --> 13:48.560
there's no good way to do it.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.560
So you're always in a bad mood, and they're in a bad mood, and it's just the worst situation.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.560
And then when you read stories like that, you're going, oh, so also if the shit does ever hit

13:56.560 --> 13:59.560
the fan, you're a fucking traitor to everybody.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.560
You're just a dummy.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.560
What kind of bullshit is that?

14:03.560 --> 14:09.560
If a guy comes up and says, it's been how many years have we had?

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
That's insane.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.560
That somebody would come up and go, I want to fly with that guy.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.560
It's like, oh, I know how to handle this.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
I don't even have to read the manual.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.560
Hey, sir, you're out.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.560
He doesn't want to fly with you.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.560
I'm taking his side.

14:27.560 --> 14:33.560
At one point, they made the guy show his baklava to everybody, and he shared it with them.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.560
Well, he should have brought a knife to everybody.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.560
I love baklava.

14:37.560 --> 14:41.560
Yeah, and all the people shared the baklava with him, and they were like, we're so sorry, but, you know,

14:41.560 --> 14:44.560
racism just got rewarded for it.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.560
I get it.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.560
I get it.

14:46.560 --> 14:52.560
I mean, that's how my dog works, and how much smarter than my dog are people that 15 years

14:52.560 --> 14:56.560
after 9-11 haven't figured out that fucking, god damn it, don't get me started.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.560
Listen to all the other podcasts if you want to hear about this shit, right?

14:59.560 --> 15:02.560
You come here for automotive tips.

15:02.560 --> 15:08.560
So I understand you got a new Impala you're wrenching on.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.560
Chevy Volt all day, baby.

15:11.560 --> 15:17.560
Dan, on the topic of cars, real quick, Thomas, we frequently gripe about Uber and Lyft on the show.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.560
Okay, why?

15:18.560 --> 15:23.560
Just because funny hypocrisies and things that happen in the car.

15:23.560 --> 15:28.560
I prefer Lyft to Uber. Dan hates Uber, but we'll never go to Lyft.

15:28.560 --> 15:33.560
My driver today had a brand new 2015 Mini Cooper.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.560
Don't care for it.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.560
You don't care for it.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.560
Coopers?

15:37.560 --> 15:38.560
Yeah.

15:38.560 --> 15:43.560
The display is like this giant circle of like crazy digital readouts and all this stuff,

15:43.560 --> 15:45.560
and I go, oh, is this the new one?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.560
My brother has, I think, 2012.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.560
Is this the new one?

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
He goes, yeah.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
I go, do you like it?

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
He goes, yeah, I like it.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.560
I go, but you don't love it?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.560
He goes, I mean, I like it.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
I go, what don't you like about it?

15:58.560 --> 16:07.560
He goes, it's kind of small.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.560
It's a Mini.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.560
Well, it's not just the Mini.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560
I knew it was a Mini, obviously, from the name.

16:12.560 --> 16:18.560
But then when you get in it, you feel kind of like actively like it's pinning you in.

16:18.560 --> 16:27.560
Like it's doing it to you, like it's putting you in a container for chickens.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.560
You mean, it's cooping you.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.560
It's going, oh!

16:32.560 --> 16:41.560
So even if it was a mega Cooper, you should expect some constriction.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.560
It's my point.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.560
The floor was sprinkled with seed, which was nice.

16:47.560 --> 16:56.560
Feet are glued to the floor of my own feces, and some guy from Tyson Foods keeps clubbing me in the head.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.560
We got to stop eating meat.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
It's true.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.560
It's so delicious, but it's so bad.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.560
Dan, are you verging on the vegetarianism all of a sudden?

17:06.560 --> 17:07.560
You got to come.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.560
You got to come over here.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.560
Where are you?

17:09.560 --> 17:12.560
I just switched it over about, well, you're in some change now.

17:12.560 --> 17:17.560
You saw this documentary, Cowspiracy, whole fuck, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.560
Now look, now look, occasionally I'll cheat.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.560
So one day you'll be like, you're eating a fucking sushi, man.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
You just told me you don't eat meat.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.560
Now just chill, okay?

17:26.560 --> 17:29.560
Chill the fuck out.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
It's like 90% of the time I don't.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.560
But yeah, you got to get out of there, man.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.560
What I think is, you, is Kumail veggie?

17:36.560 --> 17:37.560
No, no, no.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.560
Oh, Zach Woods is.

17:38.560 --> 17:43.560
He looks like a fucking action figure now, but Aziz and Schrab.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Sure.

17:44.560 --> 17:49.560
And then, so there's, what are you miming, Dan?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.560
Well, I just started drinking these Soylent things.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.560
You know what Soylent is?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.560
Like Soylent Green, like human meat?

17:57.560 --> 18:02.560
No, unfortunately they didn't know about that reference when they, I always thought, I always thought it was ironic.

18:02.560 --> 18:08.560
They named it after the 1958 sci-fi book from which that comes.

18:08.560 --> 18:13.560
But the movie, Soylent Green, I think which was also based on that book,

18:13.560 --> 18:17.560
added a few things, including the cannibalism.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.560
That's sweet, sweet human meat.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.560
And so the people that, in fact, the people that named it Soylent were just going like,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
doff of the cap to a futuristic drink.

18:24.560 --> 18:28.560
Without ever having seen the 1975 movie where the whole point is like,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.560
the futuristic drink is human flesh.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.560
But I just mistook it for like, ah, it's millennial marketing.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.560
You know, like you walk past a place and it says like Acne Studios,

18:37.560 --> 18:40.560
and you're like, that's the worst name for, I got it, you little brat.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.560
You're cheaping the old man out.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.560
You don't want my paradigms on your paradigms.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.560
They're like, sorry, kid's only old man.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.560
Yeah.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.560
Beat it.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.560
Thomas, what made you cross over?

18:53.560 --> 18:56.560
Oh, it's always annoying to hear about.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
I've been vegetarian for 23 years.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.560
Oh, okay.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.560
I'm still vegetarian.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.560
I don't even know what Cowspiracy is because I'm fucking already there.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.560
You're already there.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.560
I wish, I wish I was.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.560
I wish I had been.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.560
I got one of those fucking lip-sits.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
Go ahead.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.560
You got a lip-sit?

19:09.560 --> 19:10.560
Sorry.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.560
Bob.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.560
That would be so, no.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.560
I have a story to tell you after this.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.560
Why do I have to say that?

19:15.560 --> 19:16.560
It's not much good.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.560
Go ahead.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.560
Speak.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.560
I'm terribly uncomfortable.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.560
What do I do?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.560
How do Thomas and I focus on our vegetarian story when you have a lip-sit going on?

19:23.560 --> 19:24.560
No, just go ahead.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.560
I'm sorry.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
I'm not a narcissist.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.560
I'm a bad person.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.560
And just go.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
Lip-sit sounds like an 80s song.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
Like, lip-sit.

19:30.560 --> 19:39.560
The lip-sit, it's a painful song that you have upon your mouth.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.560
All right.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.560
Yeah.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.560
Pop, sometimes they're just in grown hair.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.560
Just, you know, pop their hair.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.560
Tell them your veggie origin story.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.560
Well, I mean.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.560
Well, Dan sucks behind you.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.560
Look, you know, I sit here.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.560
I call myself an environmentalist.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.560
I drive my Chevy Volt.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
I donate to Sierra Club.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
Defenders of Wildlife on all this kind of stuff.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
I'm like, here I am trying to save the planet.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.560
And then I didn't even realize literally the worst thing for the planet is animal husbandry.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
I didn't know that.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
You know, people say, hey, cow farts.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.560
They're pretty bad for the atmosphere.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
They're the worst thing for the atmosphere.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.560
Who knew?

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
Methane.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
Really bad stuff.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.560
Guys, it's exciting podcast material.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.560
But, I mean, you know, and not to mention the sewage runoff.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.560
Cows are like literally the worst thing.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.560
Deforestation.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.560
I like cougars and wolves and bears.

20:25.560 --> 20:29.560
They clear rain forests to make room for the farting cows.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
Rain forests?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
Yeah.

20:31.560 --> 20:36.560
Something like it's one to two acres a second of rainforest throughout space and time.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.560
One second, one to two acres.

20:38.560 --> 20:44.560
And something like 93% of the reason is animal husbandry or feed crops for the animal husbandry.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.560
Fucking man.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.560
Everybody's like, all these fucking me guys are like, what about almond milk, man?

20:48.560 --> 20:49.560
You fucking asshole.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.560
Almond milk.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.560
You know what the worst fucking drought crop is?

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
Alfalfa.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.560
What do we use alfalfa for to feed cows?

20:57.560 --> 20:58.560
What is California?

20:58.560 --> 21:01.560
Alfalfa, go to China to feed their cows.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.560
God damn it.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.560
And then I tell you what, man.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.560
Can't you hear the song?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.560
It's the sound of angry men.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
I stepped this meat shit.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.560
I was like, fucking, I'm out.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.560
I'm out of this meat game.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
I'm out of this meat game.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.560
I don't want to be a part of it anymore.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.560
And then it hit me.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.560
And then it hit me.

21:21.560 --> 21:24.560
This is a couple weeks later, I was sitting in some hotel room.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.560
I was like, oh my God.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.560
I quit for the environmentalist reason.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.560
But then the death and the sadness hit me.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.560
It's such a horrible industry.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.560
They torture these creatures.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.560
And even if it's in a whole foods farm with pastures and stuff, it's like, here, Betsy,

21:39.560 --> 21:40.560
live this fucking rad life.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.560
Thank you for your time.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.560
Bam.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
Slice.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.560
And it's like, I don't ever hunt anything.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.560
I don't even want to kill a chicken.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
What am I doing to these animals?

21:48.560 --> 21:50.560
I want them to live.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
Dogs are beautiful, right?

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
We all like dogs.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.560
Pigs are the same as dogs.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.560
Why are we cutting the pigs up?

21:56.560 --> 22:00.560
Why are we forcing them in these little cages where they literally cut off the pig's tail

22:00.560 --> 22:04.560
in front of them so it's so painful when the pig behind them nashes on their tail that

22:04.560 --> 22:06.560
it has to kick the pig behind it.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.560
Otherwise, it's too sad to do anything about it.

22:09.560 --> 22:18.560
And then you get infected tail meat, and then it's a loss in terms of money.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.560
It's not worth it, you guys.

22:20.560 --> 22:25.560
It's not worth it.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.560
It tastes great.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.560
It's not worth it, though.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.560
So, Dan, you have a little zit in your lip?

22:29.560 --> 22:30.560
Yeah.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.560
That's what you're talking about.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.560
It's right on the line, you know?

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
That's one of those.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.560
That's what you're talking about, the sadness in the air.

22:38.560 --> 22:43.560
I feel that sometimes so crushingly is like, you take a look at the word and you're like,

22:43.560 --> 22:44.560
what are we doing here?

22:44.560 --> 22:46.560
We're spinning around and we're melting each other.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.560
Yeah, because it hurts, but then you...

22:48.560 --> 22:49.560
If you try to pop it.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.560
Tweezers.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.560
It probably is an ingrown here.

22:52.560 --> 22:59.560
Yeah, so I was at Spring Street Lounge in New York, and I was hanging out with some Venezuelans.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.560
And that's not their identity, but they were from there.

23:03.560 --> 23:09.560
One of them was a coder who also does not like Mr. Robot.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.560
Oh, I like Mr. Robot.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.560
Tough titties.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.560
I just watch Fight Club again.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.560
We got a hack into the world.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
I love that actor.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.560
Not so bad.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.560
I love the performances.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.560
I love...

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
There's a lot of great things about the show.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.560
I'm just a shitty fucking petty competitive writer when young writers get attention.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.560
There's some fucking flare up in me that I still haven't overcome.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.560
I'm going to talk to my shrink about it.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
I get it.

23:37.560 --> 23:38.560
I do get it.

23:38.560 --> 23:42.560
It's goodwill hunting 30 years later.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
Do you have a competition with goodwill hunting?

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
Yeah, still.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.560
I'm still mad about that.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.560
How do you like them apples?

23:47.560 --> 23:48.560
That like thing.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.560
How is that guy supposed to respond?

23:50.560 --> 23:51.560
Like, why would he ever say yes?

23:51.560 --> 23:54.560
Well, who says yes when you say how do you like them apples?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.560
And if that guy hadn't said yes...

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
Do you know the line he's talking about?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.560
Yeah, when he gets the number?

23:59.560 --> 24:00.560
Yeah.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.560
When he says yes to it?

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
Yeah.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.560
And if he hadn't?

24:03.560 --> 24:04.560
No movie.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.560
I don't remember the yes.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.560
Because that guy ends up...

24:08.560 --> 24:09.560
No, just come on.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.560
Let's move on.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.560
But I was...

24:11.560 --> 24:12.560
How good is it?

24:12.560 --> 24:14.560
I was in this bar.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
So, and I'm making friends with these gentlemen.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.560
They're very funny and interesting.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.560
One's a coder from Venezuela.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.560
But he was Jewish.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
His name was Abraham.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
Maybe I'm saying too much information.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.560
Maybe now we can...

24:26.560 --> 24:29.560
He's going to get doxxed.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
But he's a coder.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.560
He'll be able to repel the attack.

24:32.560 --> 24:41.560
But the only way you'll know that is with a fucking voiceover.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.560
The other guy was like an accountant.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.560
And I was just getting to know them and talking about it.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.560
And we were having such a good time.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.560
And then the accountant guy started wanting to talk about the politics.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.560
And he was like the thing about the refugees and the Trump and all this stuff.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.560
Yeah, yeah.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
Let's not do it.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
I've gotten to that age.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.560
I was like, let's not talk about politics.

25:03.560 --> 25:04.560
I was like, yeah.

25:04.560 --> 25:05.560
What should we talk about?

25:05.560 --> 25:06.560
I was like...

25:06.560 --> 25:08.560
And then he started telling me about all the refugees.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
What age they should be.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
Or they should be sent back.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
And all this stuff.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
And I'm like, come on, man.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.560
What am I supposed to say to this?

25:16.560 --> 25:20.560
I'm supposed to white-splain to you?

25:20.560 --> 25:21.560
He was a...

25:21.560 --> 25:22.560
I'm not saying he was like a...

25:22.560 --> 25:23.560
He wasn't second generation.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.560
He was like a guy that came here.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.560
And he's like now...

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
He's in this mode.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.560
And then this Irish guy comes up.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
This Irish-American guy.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.560
And he was twirling like a baton.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
What's all this about then?

25:38.560 --> 25:39.560
Well, well, well.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.560
I think the two of you should be in school right about now.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
No, no.

25:43.560 --> 25:48.560
We're supposed to get barrels to wear for our fishing trip.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
We chase so much steel as our clothes.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.560
Fishing in the barrels.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.560
Oh, it's an old-timey day.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.560
It's an old-timey day, isn't it?

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
No, he was like Colin Quinn Irish.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.560
He sounded and kind of looked exactly like Colin Quinn.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.560
So he pictured that archetype.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.560
His voice sounded...

26:05.560 --> 26:07.560
I said, you sound like fucking Colin Quinn.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.560
He's like, hey, what about the Irish?

26:09.560 --> 26:14.560
He just heard inflammatory language and was attracted to it.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.560
Like a bee and a picnic when the soda comes open.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.560
He was just like, hey, what about the Irish?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.560
But it wasn't like we were going down this stuff.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.560
The ethnic group was bad.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.560
He just was just...

26:26.560 --> 26:28.560
It was like he wasn't responding to anything.

26:28.560 --> 26:29.560
He was just starting it.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.560
And then I was like, I had nothing about the Irish.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.560
Those guys were riling each other up,

26:34.560 --> 26:37.560
but they liked each other because they were both like these hardliners.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.560
And then the Irish guy turned out to be a vet.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
So now you're fucked.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
Veterinarian or vet?

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
No.

26:43.560 --> 26:48.560
The kind you can never disagree with about anything.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.560
Like you can tell a veterinarian that cats shouldn't be put to sleep,

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
but you can't fucking talk.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.560
Politics with a guy who is in the shit.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.560
He gets to be right about everything.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.560
That's why I don't want to talk about politics in a bar

27:01.560 --> 27:03.560
because somebody will come over with like one leg and go like,

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
fuck you, I'm right about everything.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.560
And you're like, you are, you're right.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.560
But you're also saying weird shit, you know?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.560
But like...

27:11.560 --> 27:14.560
So anyways, I just want to say all these guys were nice guys.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.560
This isn't a story about how I was just going to a nightmare.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
This is the point of my story.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
Has this ever...

27:18.560 --> 27:21.560
I mean, this is like, I don't know if this is a New York thing or what,

27:21.560 --> 27:24.560
but this was the weirdest thing.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
Because the guy was like, you know, he had that machismo,

27:26.560 --> 27:28.560
that Colin Quinn machismo.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.560
And you guys are like, Colin Quinn's 90.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.560
Well, when I was your age, Colin Quinn had machismo.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.560
Now Colin Quinn's like, I'm going to write him a letter.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.560
Dear fucko.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.560
Me and Jim Norton are going to come over

27:44.560 --> 27:49.560
and say very funny things that are going to make you feel bad.

27:49.560 --> 27:53.560
Dear Colin Quinn, now you sound like Christopher Lloyd.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.560
Dear fucko.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.560
I don't care who I sound like.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.560
I'm a vet.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.560
So we're just talking, and hang on,

28:03.560 --> 28:09.560
and the Irish American, Iraq war veteran,

28:09.560 --> 28:12.560
he starts squinting at me while I'm talking.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.560
And he goes like, what is this?

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
What is this?

28:15.560 --> 28:16.560
You get some kind of...

28:16.560 --> 28:17.560
And he said he had some phrase.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
He had some like, it was some kind of nickname for something

28:19.560 --> 28:20.560
that I've never heard.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
He goes, I've got a hoochie-coochie or something like that.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.560
He said, blig-a-duber or something.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.560
And he says some word that was gibberish to me.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.560
And he's pointing at the back of my neck.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.560
And I'm like, what do I have in the back of my neck?

28:32.560 --> 28:34.560
And he's like, I think he's...

28:34.560 --> 28:36.560
Because I thought, well, if there's much on my neck,

28:36.560 --> 28:38.560
I can get it off, I guess, because he's already reaching for it.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.560
Would I have a spider on my neck?

28:40.560 --> 28:46.560
And he grabs it and he pops a zit for me.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.560
And I was like, oh!

28:48.560 --> 28:50.560
And then he wipes it with his finger.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.560
Like, he was like...

28:52.560 --> 28:54.560
Well, I don't mean like, smears it on me.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.560
I mean like, respectfully.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.560
Like, he was like, grooming me.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
Like, he wasn't bullying me.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.560
He was like, grooming me.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.560
So you had a popable, visible zit.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.560
And he fucking reached out.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.560
I'll take care of that.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.560
Like, I was like, his kid or something.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.560
You were like, for a second, like a foxhole brother.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.560
Yeah, yeah.

29:14.560 --> 29:15.560
Yeah.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.560
Yeah.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.560
And I said, it was just one of those moments, right?

29:18.560 --> 29:20.560
Because it was like, ow!

29:20.560 --> 29:23.560
And then it was like, but it was so clearly not at all like...

29:23.560 --> 29:27.560
It was the opposite of what you'd be afraid of

29:27.560 --> 29:29.560
in an encounter with that guy.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.560
Because that guy reminds you of just opposition

29:31.560 --> 29:32.560
and all this stuff.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.560
And the guy was just like belligerent and jingoistic

29:34.560 --> 29:37.560
and narcissistic and bragging about it.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.560
His combat and like wanting to talk about

29:39.560 --> 29:41.560
all the different races and all this stuff.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.560
And it was like, all of that you associate with,

29:43.560 --> 29:46.560
like, you know, this is all bad,

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
but really it all boils down to, this is all usually bad

29:48.560 --> 29:51.560
because usually it's a symptom of a guy like doing bad things.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
You know?

29:52.560 --> 29:55.560
Like, he's going to end up like picking a fight

29:55.560 --> 29:58.560
or hogging the jukebox or something.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.560
You know?

29:59.560 --> 30:01.560
He's going to turn out he was a bass player.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.560
I'm going to listen to his shitty album all night.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.560
Like, like, like...

30:05.560 --> 30:07.560
All right, it's not just because he's a bass player

30:07.560 --> 30:09.560
that the album's shitty.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.560
It's a necessary instrument.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.560
I'm just saying, you know what I'm talking about.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.560
Not to offend any of the bass players.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.560
Of which this entire audience is comprised.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.560
You've been with that guy.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.560
Dino was the guy over at his house.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.560
And the guy said...

30:24.560 --> 30:27.560
He pulled out his iPod and he said,

30:27.560 --> 30:30.560
hey, do you like...

30:30.560 --> 30:32.560
He's like, hey, let me play some stuff.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
Do you mind if I do a little DJing?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.560
Okay. He's like, hey, do you like...

30:35.560 --> 30:37.560
Do you like Led Zeppelin?

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
And Dino's like, yeah.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.560
And he's like, yeah, so does my band.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.560
And played the whole...

30:44.560 --> 30:45.560
There's nothing more...

30:45.560 --> 30:47.560
I can't say when someone plays their music

30:47.560 --> 30:50.560
and then just, like, watches you listening to it.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.560
Yeah.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.560
And I just want to turn to them and go,

30:54.560 --> 30:56.560
I don't think Radiohead ever did this.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.560
I know, I can't imagine.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.560
I think they were...

30:59.560 --> 31:01.560
I think they fucking sucked it up

31:01.560 --> 31:04.560
and waited for people to come to see them.

31:04.560 --> 31:08.560
I have so many questions about the veteran Zipopper guy,

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
because I know you...

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
You're not a physical contact fan.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.560
No, no, yeah.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.560
That's the thing.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
It was so paternal.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.560
Also, you've talked about the fact that you wouldn't get a massage.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.560
No, this is on paper.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.560
It's my worst nightmare, because it's a big jock.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.560
It's what jocks become,

31:26.560 --> 31:28.560
which is in their highest form,

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
archetypically, which is a soldier,

31:30.560 --> 31:32.560
which is a guy who's trained to kill.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.560
It's also combined with, like,

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
he's a right-wing person

31:37.560 --> 31:39.560
who wants to talk about, you know,

31:39.560 --> 31:42.560
how the things that are physical about people

31:42.560 --> 31:45.560
are markers of differences that are unsolvable

31:45.560 --> 31:48.560
and because Italians do this, but the Irish do that.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.560
Everything is like a nightmare about it,

31:50.560 --> 31:52.560
but then he did that one little thing and it was like,

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
oh, dad.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
And then he just says,

31:55.560 --> 31:57.560
you're going to be all right, Boyle.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.560
You're going to be all right.

31:59.560 --> 32:03.560
Your initial physical reaction was not like...

32:03.560 --> 32:05.560
Well, it was shock. I didn't know what was happening.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.560
And then by the time I realized what was happening,

32:07.560 --> 32:09.560
he was, like, gingerly cleaned it, you know?

32:09.560 --> 32:11.560
Like, he popped and then he, like, you know,

32:11.560 --> 32:13.560
he wasn't just like...

32:13.560 --> 32:15.560
Yeah, he was just like...

32:15.560 --> 32:17.560
Someone's fainting in the back.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.560
That's a really intimate thing to do with somebody.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
Yeah, I know.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.560
And also, like, in the days of, like,

32:24.560 --> 32:26.560
disease and stuff, yeah.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.560
It's like, wow, wait.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.560
This person's having a...

32:30.560 --> 32:32.560
Is this one person that's just having a...

32:32.560 --> 32:33.560
Tom is like...

32:33.560 --> 32:35.560
What you said was my first thought is, like,

32:35.560 --> 32:37.560
this is what you do when your brothers are in a fox hole

32:37.560 --> 32:40.560
next to you, like, when you're in the shit, like...

32:40.560 --> 32:42.560
Probably you let the zits go.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.560
Right, if they...

32:43.560 --> 32:45.560
I think not with this guy.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
I think he probably had his...

32:47.560 --> 32:49.560
You don't have the best skin in the whole army.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.560
There are some people that like to pop zits.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.560
I got to be honest.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.560
My mom is one of them.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.560
She's like, she loved it when we were teens

32:55.560 --> 32:57.560
because she'd be like, give me your back.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.560
And it's like...

32:58.560 --> 33:00.560
That's actually part of the reason I got the story up

33:00.560 --> 33:02.560
is because I knew, when he did it, I also knew

33:02.560 --> 33:04.560
that's part of what mitigated it is because I have...

33:04.560 --> 33:07.560
I once dated a girl who had that thing,

33:07.560 --> 33:09.560
and I was like, it's so fucking weird

33:09.560 --> 33:11.560
because she's like, can I please?

33:11.560 --> 33:13.560
And I'm like, can you please?

33:14.560 --> 33:17.560
Are you sure you're not just trying to impress me?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.560
Not that it would?

33:19.560 --> 33:21.560
Like, like, like, like...

33:21.560 --> 33:22.560
No, I really like it.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.560
Like, like, oh, don't...

33:23.560 --> 33:24.560
Yeah, save them up.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.560
Like, like, I'm not excited.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.560
Like, there are some people who fucking love it.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.560
There's, you know, videos online of people with like...

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
They're called dermatologists.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.560
You get a facial...

33:33.560 --> 33:35.560
Their favorite thing is the extraction part.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.560
They love...

33:36.560 --> 33:38.560
I always ask them, like, you ever had a facial?

33:38.560 --> 33:39.560
Oh, God, yes.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.560
Yeah.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
Oh, I can tell...

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
What am I, an animal?

33:43.560 --> 33:44.560
Am I savage?

33:44.560 --> 33:46.560
I can tell because your face fairly glows, Thomas.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.560
I have night creams and day creams.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.560
Fuck yeah, you do.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.560
What's your, what kind of...

33:54.560 --> 33:55.560
You got a daily scrub you use?

33:55.560 --> 33:58.560
Oh, no, I stay away from the scrubs that'll dry you out.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.560
Dry you out quicker than a week in the desert.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.560
There's one little epilogue to this story.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.560
That's a good story.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.560
That happens, that's in the midst of this.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.560
It's like, okay, so that was weird.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.560
And it didn't necessarily start liking the guy.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.560
It was just, I just found that kind of profound,

34:18.560 --> 34:21.560
that unexpected things were happening

34:21.560 --> 34:24.560
in an encounter that from the moment that guy came up

34:24.560 --> 34:26.560
and said, what about the Irish?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.560
I was like, this is the fucking worst.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.560
But it didn't, at the straight,

34:31.560 --> 34:33.560
it didn't end the way I thought it would.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.560
I didn't want to hang out there anyway, though.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.560
But the biggest reason I didn't want to hang out there

34:37.560 --> 34:40.560
is because there were four guys sitting over at that

34:40.560 --> 34:45.560
end bar part where we would be if we were all there.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.560
By the Cab Calloway Jive Diction or anything?

34:47.560 --> 34:50.560
And some, I think, they were regulars

34:50.560 --> 34:52.560
or they were older and they were like,

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
they seemed like literary types or something.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.560
And remember the story about me being mistaken

34:56.560 --> 34:59.560
for a Mr. Grossman, like that was the same bar

34:59.560 --> 35:01.560
because I was wearing a jacket.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.560
These guys all looked like Mr. Grossmans.

35:04.560 --> 35:09.560
And they were like, they were glowering at all of us

35:09.560 --> 35:12.560
the whole time because we were all talking loudly.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.560
And I could hear them doing this running commentary

35:15.560 --> 35:16.560
the whole time.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.560
And they were like, they were nerds

35:18.560 --> 35:20.560
and they were intellectuals because the real reason

35:20.560 --> 35:22.560
I left the bar is because I was getting angry

35:22.560 --> 35:23.560
and angry at them.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.560
Because I wanted to turn to them and go,

35:25.560 --> 35:26.560
why don't you guys fucking cheer up

35:26.560 --> 35:27.560
or go somewhere you can be happy?

35:27.560 --> 35:31.560
Fucking talking to two guys and a fucking,

35:31.560 --> 35:34.560
yeah, he's a fucking Mama Luke.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.560
But he's popping my zits.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.560
What are you doing for me?

35:38.560 --> 35:40.560
What have you done for me lately?

35:40.560 --> 35:42.560
He fought for this fucking country, Jack.

35:42.560 --> 35:47.560
But it wasn't like, there was prejudice

35:47.560 --> 35:49.560
coming from the guys who were probably

35:49.560 --> 35:51.560
the most liberal and intellectual

35:51.560 --> 35:53.560
because they were like, oh, there's these,

35:53.560 --> 35:55.560
here's these types that are going to bring.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.560
They were a shadow that I was casting.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.560
Before I got my zit popped,

36:01.560 --> 36:05.560
I was terrified that certain kinds of people

36:05.560 --> 36:07.560
are going to make your bar experience not right.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.560
And they were sitting there the whole time

36:08.560 --> 36:10.560
just statler and a walled orphan.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.560
And so I boned out.

36:13.560 --> 36:18.560
That's the end of my story about getting my zits.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
America.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
And as he walked home,

36:20.560 --> 36:23.560
the ghost of future Christmas was like,

36:23.560 --> 36:26.560
you've learned a valuable lesson.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.560
I want to know how many soldiers,

36:29.560 --> 36:35.560
Marines, airmen seem to go out there doing their duty

36:35.560 --> 36:39.560
and just, buddy, you got a thing over there.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.560
Actors, you can probably verify this

36:42.560 --> 36:44.560
unless the community cast is really weird.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.560
But I assumed that was like,

36:45.560 --> 36:47.560
if you watch enough dailies,

36:47.560 --> 36:49.560
there's so much footage of,

36:49.560 --> 36:51.560
because they're sitting there for 12 hours

36:51.560 --> 36:52.560
under hot lights.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.560
They're at each other's mercy.

36:53.560 --> 36:57.560
So they'll just like, like, oh, you got to,

36:57.560 --> 36:58.560
you got to, you got to.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.560
And they're like, oh, can you just get it?

37:00.560 --> 37:02.560
And they're just picking each other's noses and stuff.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
No.

37:03.560 --> 37:04.560
Like, like, like.

37:04.560 --> 37:05.560
Stay out of here.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.560
You don't want to, you don't look at it.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.560
You don't want to get in there.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.560
There's too much.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.560
You always think you're going to go in,

37:12.560 --> 37:13.560
get a little treat.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.560
You come out with a full feast.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.560
Too much.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.560
And I hate it.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.560
I hate it when people grab your nose,

37:20.560 --> 37:22.560
when people pinch your nose.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.560
Because there's always a fucking, yeah.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.560
And it digs.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
And then I got a nosebleed

37:26.560 --> 37:28.560
because you thought it was so funny.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.560
When people pinch your nose,

37:29.560 --> 37:30.560
when people put your nose,

37:30.560 --> 37:31.560
you got a sharp one in there.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.560
You got a fucking, you got an angular one.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.560
Yeah.

37:34.560 --> 37:35.560
I go, no, no, don't pinch noses.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.560
Yeah.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
What are you doing?

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
What are you doing?

37:38.560 --> 37:39.560
Exactly.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
It's like, granny, what are you pinching nose for?

37:41.560 --> 37:42.560
No, I agree with that.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.560
Get out of my nose.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.560
But that's not this.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.560
This is actors protecting each other from the,

37:46.560 --> 37:49.560
you know, they're like clearing out each other's natural openings and stuff.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.560
I'm just at my point being,

37:51.560 --> 37:54.560
who God knows what soldiers do after a while,

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
because even actors,

37:55.560 --> 37:59.560
which is just that little bit of like camaraderie and fatigue,

37:59.560 --> 38:01.560
you know, and reliance on each other,

38:01.560 --> 38:05.560
the behavior already starts to get unrecognizable

38:05.560 --> 38:08.560
from the perspective of the normal world.

38:08.560 --> 38:13.560
Oh, would you be,

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
oh, what if Dan,

38:14.560 --> 38:16.560
if you found somebody like,

38:16.560 --> 38:17.560
there was a service,

38:17.560 --> 38:19.560
like a spa or something like that,

38:19.560 --> 38:21.560
and you found there was a guy or a woman

38:21.560 --> 38:24.560
that was really into and totally comfortable with

38:24.560 --> 38:27.560
that kind of back extraction kind of service.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.560
Would you be down for that?

38:29.560 --> 38:30.560
No.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.560
It was only because he sneak attacked you and came up and did that.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
Yeah.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
I wasn't like, oh, thank God he did that.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.560
I'm so happy that got done.

38:35.560 --> 38:39.560
I was just like, it was only just that he defied my

38:39.560 --> 38:44.560
every fucking line that I had drawn for his personality.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
I tell ya.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.560
He could have said like,

38:47.560 --> 38:49.560
oh, I love Jenga.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
I don't know.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.560
He could have said anything just random.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.560
He turned out to be a human being

38:53.560 --> 38:57.560
and not like this fucking straw dog that I had created

38:57.560 --> 39:01.560
and was trying to figure out how to avoid a fight with.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.560
He wasn't thinking that about me.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.560
Otherwise, he wouldn't have popped my sit.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.560
If he had made decisions about me

39:08.560 --> 39:10.560
and was that adherent to them,

39:10.560 --> 39:12.560
I've been drinking in bars so long

39:12.560 --> 39:14.560
and there's this fucking kind of knucklehead that comes up

39:14.560 --> 39:17.560
and you're just like, no, no, I'm too young.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.560
Life is too short.

39:20.560 --> 39:24.560
Have you ever been scrubbed at a Korean spa?

39:24.560 --> 39:28.560
I used to go to this place called We Spots in Koreatown.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.560
It's really cool.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.560
I loved it there, but I mean, not to get weird

39:31.560 --> 39:34.560
because of this TV show, I can't go there

39:34.560 --> 39:36.560
because I'll just be like nude and chilling out

39:36.560 --> 39:38.560
and somebody will be like, hey, fucking Richard.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.560
I'll be like, I don't like this anymore.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.560
You've ruined it, you've ruined it.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.560
But I used to go there and in the corner always,

39:44.560 --> 39:46.560
there's the full body scrubs where it's,

39:46.560 --> 39:49.560
you're in the spa, you're getting over your hang-ups,

39:49.560 --> 39:52.560
you're like, I'm nude, I'm comfortable with it.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.560
That guy's got the biggest dick I've ever seen in my life.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.560
I don't care.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.560
And then there are these people in the corner

39:59.560 --> 40:02.560
that they're lying on the bed and there's a man,

40:02.560 --> 40:05.560
and then I'm sure a woman in the woman's part,

40:05.560 --> 40:08.560
and they are vigorously full body scrubbing

40:08.560 --> 40:11.560
the man who's lying down with, I guess,

40:11.560 --> 40:14.560
like a sponge and soap and high pressure water

40:14.560 --> 40:16.560
and they're up in their crack.

40:16.560 --> 40:20.560
They're everywhere, legs back and they're ripping around

40:20.560 --> 40:23.560
and they're up in the thing and they're scrubbing the crack

40:23.560 --> 40:25.560
and they're just like, oh, yeah.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.560
And I was like, I've always looked at that with envy

40:27.560 --> 40:30.560
of like, how could you have the security of your own body

40:30.560 --> 40:33.560
to be like, scrub me as hard as you fucking can.

40:33.560 --> 40:38.560
Now, any crevice I have, get in there

40:38.560 --> 40:40.560
and don't push your foot around.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.560
Scrub me, you bitch.

40:42.560 --> 40:48.560
And like, I can't, I can't, I can't.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.560
And another gentleman, you don't know.

40:50.560 --> 40:54.560
Thomas, just surrender to the scrub.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.560
Because the Korean spot, it's like being in the middle

40:57.560 --> 40:59.560
of a really sexy street fight.

40:59.560 --> 41:00.560
Like, you're getting your ass kicked.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.560
No, don't listen to him.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.560
Here's why.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.560
If you have anxiety about that kind of thing,

41:03.560 --> 41:05.560
well, those people that you think are your heroes

41:05.560 --> 41:07.560
in the moment, like, those are the same people that,

41:07.560 --> 41:09.560
you know what else they do really well?

41:09.560 --> 41:10.560
They merge on the freeway.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.560
They don't give a fuck.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
Because they have no anxiety.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.560
They have no fear about anyone's judgment

41:17.560 --> 41:19.560
and they kill people.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
They fucking murder people.

41:20.560 --> 41:24.560
The first time you get a scrub is by accident.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.560
You don't know.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.560
I'll get the full...

41:26.560 --> 41:27.560
Have you ever had a scrub?

41:27.560 --> 41:28.560
Oh, yeah.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.560
You've had a full scrub?

41:29.560 --> 41:30.560
Fuck yeah.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
Have you seen him drive?

41:31.560 --> 41:32.560
Have you seen him drive?

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
Do you use turn signals?

41:34.560 --> 41:35.560
Do you?

41:35.560 --> 41:36.560
Have you seen me merge?

41:36.560 --> 41:37.560
Do you use turn signals?

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
Oh, I'm like Barishnaka.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.560
Not only do I use turn signals, I indicate.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
That's good.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.560
I'm an indicator.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.560
I call them indicators too?

41:44.560 --> 41:45.560
I'm an indicator.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.560
I got flack for calling them indicators.

41:46.560 --> 41:47.560
Yeah.

41:47.560 --> 41:48.560
I've been bullied in calling them indicators.

41:48.560 --> 41:53.560
Well, Dan and my Scottish ex-girlfriend were in Scotland for the holidays a couple years

41:53.560 --> 41:54.560
ago.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.560
No, no, no, no, no.

41:55.560 --> 41:56.560
Scrubs.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.560
What?

41:57.560 --> 41:58.560
Don't try and tell me.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.560
I don't want to know about Scotland.

41:59.560 --> 42:04.560
I don't want to know about how the fuck you have the brass and the audacity to get your

42:04.560 --> 42:05.560
bodice mug.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.560
My first scrub...

42:06.560 --> 42:07.560
My first scrub was a little...

42:07.560 --> 42:08.560
Oh, my God.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
You never forget your first scrub, by the way.

42:10.560 --> 42:11.560
I wouldn't know.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.560
The first scrub is the deepest.

42:13.560 --> 42:14.560
It is deep.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.560
They go deep.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.560
Oh, it's fucking...

42:16.560 --> 42:17.560
They get right up in there.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.560
No, it's all hands on dick, those fucking scrubs, man.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.560
No, it's fucking...

42:23.560 --> 42:25.560
But it's really vigorous.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.560
Yeah.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.560
And you're like, oh, my God.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
I don't know that...

42:28.560 --> 42:35.120
This might cross a line of my tolerance for not intimacy, but this is really wild.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.760
But the first time I did that, I went with a gal that was a friend of mine, and we went

42:38.760 --> 42:43.560
to Little Tokyo, and they walk all over, and your joints are cracking and popping.

42:43.560 --> 42:49.160
I was trying, like, I faced down, trying to visualize what she could possibly be doing

42:49.160 --> 42:50.560
to make the sensation that was going on.

42:50.560 --> 42:54.560
I was like, does she have 40 elbows?

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
It was...

42:55.560 --> 42:56.560
Did she call her friends in?

42:56.560 --> 42:58.560
Like, what the fuck is going on?

42:58.560 --> 43:00.560
They're gang scrubbing, man.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
Get them!

43:02.560 --> 43:05.560
Wait, so you had a lady scrubbist?

43:05.560 --> 43:06.560
I had a scrub...

43:06.560 --> 43:07.560
A lady scrubber.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.560
Ooh!

43:08.560 --> 43:10.560
Wouldn't fly a weasel.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.560
Are the von traps back there?

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
I was trying to plus your bit.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.560
Then she was moving a little slow tonight.

43:17.560 --> 43:22.560
But one time I got a gift certificate a long time ago to the Burke Williams in West Hollywood,

43:22.560 --> 43:26.560
which I think is gone, which is like where Crunch is, like on Sunset and...

43:26.560 --> 43:27.560
Crunch.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.560
Like Crescent Heights, right?

43:29.560 --> 43:30.560
So I went in there and...

43:30.560 --> 43:33.560
It's Crunch, near a pump.

43:33.560 --> 43:38.560
Right across the street from Tuft.

43:38.560 --> 43:43.560
There's a dog groomer, it's called Balls, for no reason.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.560
So I go into the spa.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.560
I know that it's routine.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.560
You get a locker, you get a bathrobe.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.560
You can go...

43:49.560 --> 43:50.560
You can choose your own adventure.

43:50.560 --> 43:55.560
I can go into the tub and I can go into the sauna or to the steam room.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.560
Or I can sit and drink, you know, coconut lemon water.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.560
Not coconut, cucumber, whatever.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.560
You can read a book.

44:02.560 --> 44:08.560
And then, but like if you go into any of the facilities, you have a towel or can be naked.

44:08.560 --> 44:12.560
So I go into the steam room and I have my towel and you sit down.

44:12.560 --> 44:16.560
I walk in and there was, let's say, seven, eight guys in there already.

44:16.560 --> 44:20.560
Every one of them was the hottest guy you've ever seen.

44:20.560 --> 44:25.560
Everybody was like, David Beckham's hotter younger brother.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.560
And it was just like, just cock out.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.560
And everyone's just talking like, what are you getting?

44:29.560 --> 44:30.560
I'm getting the semen's return.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.560
It's not semen's, it's called...

44:33.560 --> 44:36.560
The semen's demise?

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
So what was he going to say?

44:37.560 --> 44:39.560
The semen's repose?

44:39.560 --> 44:42.560
There was one called the Hunter's Retreat.

44:42.560 --> 44:45.560
And so they had all these names, but they were scrubbing involved on the set.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.560
So you Freudian slipped from Hunter to semen.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.560
Well, I was going nautical to be honest with you.

44:52.560 --> 44:53.560
Okay, all right.

44:53.560 --> 44:54.560
That's the connection.

44:54.560 --> 44:55.560
I failed to the show.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.560
And notice that's the second time I said semen already.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.560
This is my alarm, by the way.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.560
Just wrap it up because he's got a heart out and I want to play Shadowrun with him before he goes.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
Okay, all right.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.560
But that doesn't mean we're ending the show early.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.560
We're just going to get our guest on.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.560
I was completely intimidated by the...

45:11.560 --> 45:14.560
Everybody was so gorgeous and walking around,

45:14.560 --> 45:17.560
but I found out they ended up having to close that one down supposedly

45:17.560 --> 45:19.560
because it was so sexy in there.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.560
There was lots of shenanigans happening.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.560
Sounds like you're disturbing a place in West Hollywood.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.560
Yes, it was.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.560
I'm not going to say anything.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.560
I'm not going to say anything.

45:32.560 --> 45:34.560
I'm just going to look like that.

45:34.560 --> 45:38.560
That's why they also had to close down balls to dog grip.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.560
Because the dogs are fucking...

45:40.560 --> 45:42.560
Pump is still pumping, though.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.560
It's just full.

45:43.560 --> 45:48.560
Just Jack Russell's walking around with their fucking schlongs wagging as much as their tails.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.560
Jeez, sucking each other's dog dicks.

45:50.560 --> 45:54.560
Let's build this fucking wall.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
Dogs would come so hard.

45:56.560 --> 46:01.560
That the other dog would fetch the comb and bring it back.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.560
These are fucking hot, gay dogs.

46:04.560 --> 46:07.560
They shut that place down.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.560
It wasn't a health hazard.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.560
These are the cleanest fucking dogs in the world.

46:11.560 --> 46:17.560
It was a cultural threat because it was fucking changing minds.

46:17.560 --> 46:21.560
Thomas, would you be open for a scrub by a woman's scrub or is it...?

46:21.560 --> 46:24.560
It's very intimate.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.560
I just don't...

46:26.560 --> 46:28.560
Oh, God.

46:28.560 --> 46:33.560
I wouldn't mind getting scrubbed all over and even on the junk in an unsexual way.

46:33.560 --> 46:38.560
I couldn't picture a less sexy thing to be like all over your dick.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.560
I wouldn't get hard in that.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.560
I'd be like...

46:42.560 --> 46:47.560
But it's more about the butt crack.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.560
Are you worried about the...

46:49.560 --> 46:51.560
I would be worried about...

46:51.560 --> 46:53.560
My butt crack will never be clean.

46:53.560 --> 46:56.560
A, I'm worried about a dirty butt hole.

46:56.560 --> 46:57.560
And then my...

46:57.560 --> 46:59.560
I'm being like a too hairy of a butt.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.560
They're like, oh, I didn't expect it.

47:01.560 --> 47:02.560
Those go together.

47:02.560 --> 47:06.560
It will never be clean because it's like a fucking carpet back there.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.560
Yeah.

47:07.560 --> 47:10.560
And at home, if you had in the middle of your living room,

47:10.560 --> 47:11.560
your carpeted living room,

47:11.560 --> 47:16.560
if there was a hole that shit came out of three times a day,

47:16.560 --> 47:19.560
it just wouldn't matter what you did in that room.

47:19.560 --> 47:21.560
Never, ever, ever.

47:21.560 --> 47:25.560
I mean, sweetheart, we got to do something about this carpet.

47:25.560 --> 47:26.560
You ever noticed this?

47:26.560 --> 47:28.560
Shit, three times a day?

47:28.560 --> 47:31.560
They said it was a stain master, but it's a stain creator.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.560
Hey!

47:33.560 --> 47:39.560
Folks, let's bring out D'Morge Brown, who has been...

47:39.560 --> 47:44.560
D'Morge Brown with the greenest pants in town.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.560
It's just green, man.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.560
It's just green pants.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.560
That's all it is.

47:49.560 --> 47:51.560
Look at his haircut, man.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.560
I love it.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
Yeah.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
Very handsome.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.560
Yeah.

47:55.560 --> 47:56.560
There's no clean up.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.560
There's no non-handsome version.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.560
No, there isn't.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.560
I was going to say, I can't even remember the previous look now.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.560
I just...

48:02.560 --> 48:04.560
I haven't seen it in a long time.

48:04.560 --> 48:09.560
But I was like, uh-oh, but English is in class session.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.560
Yep.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.560
Yep.

48:11.560 --> 48:14.560
My English teacher's here.

48:14.560 --> 48:17.560
And I've been bad at English.

48:17.560 --> 48:20.560
Are you hoping he, like, papples you?

48:20.560 --> 48:21.560
Yeah.

48:21.560 --> 48:25.560
Cheap me after class, Professor Clean Cut.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.560
I would do it in class, man.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.560
Teach me, teach me some English.

48:29.560 --> 48:34.560
Professor, uh, Professor Clean Cut.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.560
Teach me, teach me some conjunctivitis.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.560
Teach me how to conjugate my...

48:40.560 --> 48:42.560
Your eyeballs?

48:42.560 --> 48:43.560
No.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.560
Uh...

48:44.560 --> 48:45.560
Where you been, DeMorge?

48:45.560 --> 48:46.560
Tell us about your travels.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.560
I actually haven't been traveling a whole lot.

48:48.560 --> 48:49.560
I've just been working a lot.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.560
It gets to this time of year and people want to get stuff done

48:51.560 --> 48:53.560
before people start disappearing for holiday.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.560
So I've just been shooting a bunch of stuff,

48:55.560 --> 48:56.560
little short films here and there.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.560
And then also Channel 101 ends in October.

48:59.560 --> 49:02.560
And so, uh, from the end of October to about the middle of October,

49:02.560 --> 49:04.560
or the end of September to middle of October,

49:04.560 --> 49:06.560
there were just project after project of people

49:06.560 --> 49:08.560
trying to slam and get something done.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.560
It's like Sweeps Week, kind of.

49:10.560 --> 49:11.560
Yeah.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.560
I mean, Kill the Baby, uh, which Aaron was also.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.560
And we finished with, like, a finale,

49:15.560 --> 49:17.560
which was, like, a 20-minute finale.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.560
And, you know, people have lives and things,

49:19.560 --> 49:21.560
so everybody only shoots on the weekends.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.560
And there you go.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.560
So Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday,

49:24.560 --> 49:26.560
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.560
You ever had a scrub?

49:28.560 --> 49:31.560
I have been to the Wii Spa.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.560
I have never, I've seen that stuff.

49:33.560 --> 49:35.560
I have not gone anywhere near that.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.560
I don't have any interest in that.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.560
I have an interest, but I'm so scared.

49:40.560 --> 49:45.560
I am, like, looking into Sauron's eye.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.560
But, like, falling in love at the same time.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.560
What danger is this scrub?

49:51.560 --> 49:54.560
When you leave after the whole, when you get the whole kit

49:54.560 --> 49:56.560
and kaboodle, when you leave there, you feel,

49:56.560 --> 49:58.560
it's like, it's a crazy euphoria, kind of feeling.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.560
Because your butthole's been titillated.

50:01.560 --> 50:03.560
Because you just got your, like, prostate jam.

50:03.560 --> 50:05.560
Your butthole shines like a new dime.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.560
Oh, my God.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.560
Somebody else could look into your butthole

50:09.560 --> 50:11.560
and see themselves.

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
See, I just, but I equate all that stuff,

50:13.560 --> 50:15.560
like, there's always, like, Chris McKenna would,

50:15.560 --> 50:17.560
for the writers, if we were working them too hard,

50:17.560 --> 50:19.560
he'd, like, hire a masseuse to come

50:19.560 --> 50:21.560
and, like, set up in a spare room

50:21.560 --> 50:23.560
and, like, the writers have been up all night.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
Love massage.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.560
No, I won't even do that.

50:27.560 --> 50:29.560
Shirt on massage, I won't even do it.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.560
Because it's, like, I'm so insecure

50:31.560 --> 50:33.560
that the idea of a professional person,

50:33.560 --> 50:35.560
like, who has, therefore,

50:35.560 --> 50:37.560
seen the widest range of people

50:37.560 --> 50:39.560
and touched them all,

50:39.560 --> 50:41.560
it doesn't really make any logical sense,

50:41.560 --> 50:43.560
but I'm just, like, oh, they're going to definitely know

50:43.560 --> 50:45.560
for sure that I'm a bad person.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
Which is how I feel.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.560
I'm also about prostitution,

50:49.560 --> 50:51.560
like, when people go, like, well,

50:51.560 --> 50:53.560
if you're lonely

50:53.560 --> 50:55.560
and you say that you're not

50:55.560 --> 50:57.560
going to be able to have sustained relationships,

50:57.560 --> 50:59.560
why are you talking about getting mannequins?

50:59.560 --> 51:01.560
I have to catch up with you with this stuff.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.560
But, like, why not,

51:03.560 --> 51:05.560
why not go to Las Vegas

51:05.560 --> 51:07.560
and engage in your legal right

51:07.560 --> 51:09.560
to, I don't know, are you kidding me?

51:09.560 --> 51:11.560
Never. That would be the last thing I did

51:11.560 --> 51:13.560
after I skydiving.

51:13.560 --> 51:15.560
Like, I would never, like, trying heroin.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.560
Like, I would

51:17.560 --> 51:19.560
heroin I'd try first.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.560
And then, let's get back to that.

51:21.560 --> 51:23.560
But, like, the idea

51:23.560 --> 51:25.560
of a sex worker,

51:25.560 --> 51:27.560
like, I, it's like,

51:27.560 --> 51:29.560
I'd be like, you she knows for sure,

51:29.560 --> 51:31.560
like, how my dick

51:31.560 --> 51:33.560
places on the, like, size chart,

51:33.560 --> 51:35.560
and also just, like,

51:35.560 --> 51:37.560
every love handle, every hair,

51:37.560 --> 51:39.560
it's just like, I've seen it all

51:39.560 --> 51:41.560
and here's where you are

51:41.560 --> 51:43.560
and she'd be thinking it. I bet her thoughts are more like,

51:43.560 --> 51:45.560
I know, well, that's,

51:45.560 --> 51:47.560
yeah, but that's, that's part of the problem.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.560
I guess I can't, like,

51:49.560 --> 51:51.560
I'm not confident enough to,

51:51.560 --> 51:53.560
like, like, the idea, because you'd know the whole time

51:53.560 --> 51:55.560
you'd be like, well, for sure she'd rather

51:55.560 --> 51:57.560
be somewhere else.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.560
That's, like, the, that would never,

51:59.560 --> 52:01.560
I would never be able to do anything.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.560
Spencer, would you get a scrap?

52:03.560 --> 52:05.560
Sure, yeah. From a prostitute?

52:05.560 --> 52:07.560
From, only from a prostitute.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.560
Yeah.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
Spencer doesn't give a fuck.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.560
I've, I've hired prostitutes

52:13.560 --> 52:15.560
to wash me, just because

52:15.560 --> 52:17.560
I can't reach all the time.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.560
The ship's horn, like, the ship's fog horn.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
That's for the sound effect.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.560
I wanted after that one.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.560
I knew this, I knew the sound.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.560
I just, you know, it's like the fog,

52:33.560 --> 52:35.560
the fog had rolled in.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
The fog of, yeah.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.560
It's just something that goes with, yeah.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.560
But it just has to bone out in a bit.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.560
We should get this started.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.560
Yeah, well, yeah, come on dudes, I got a bone out.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.560
Everybody's saying it.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.560
On this show, probably like three times a show.

52:53.560 --> 52:55.560
That's the, that's the ad for Creepshow 2.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.560
And they got that, like, we're going to bone out.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.560
Like, all the, when the people are.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.560
December, everyone's bonein' out.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.560
It does, it's all inside.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.560
We should bring up one person

53:05.560 --> 53:07.560
and let's make it a crassly

53:07.560 --> 53:09.560
gender, gender balancing

53:09.560 --> 53:11.560
casting decision.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.560
Well, bringing up one woman is not going to balance

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
out the stage.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.560
I'm, okay, let's nitpick semantics,

53:17.560 --> 53:19.560
but also let's get a young lady

53:19.560 --> 53:21.560
or an old lady. Why a young lady?

53:21.560 --> 53:23.560
Why didn't I say that? No, the youngest lady.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.560
Let's get, no, let's get to.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.560
I want all the women to organize themselves

53:27.560 --> 53:29.560
via birthday.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
If there are any in the same year,

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
we'll do it by

53:35.560 --> 53:37.560
month.

53:37.560 --> 53:39.560
Oldies up front, youngies in the back.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.560
My politeness gland, like, kicks

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
in because I get so nervous when I'm talking

53:43.560 --> 53:45.560
about, like, anything where I'm like, you're outside

53:45.560 --> 53:47.560
your safety zone, you're going to say something

53:47.560 --> 53:49.560
wrong. I was like, I was calling, I was just

53:49.560 --> 53:51.560
like, oh, young lady, and that's like, there's

53:51.560 --> 53:53.560
times when that's so, like, creepy sounding.

53:53.560 --> 53:55.560
Anyways.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
Yeah, anybody

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
interested in.

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
Somebody heart attack with our zip story

54:01.560 --> 54:03.560
or would you like to come up?

54:03.560 --> 54:05.560
Well, I, well, we had

54:05.560 --> 54:07.560
someone raise her hand and then

54:07.560 --> 54:09.560
so it's not

54:09.560 --> 54:11.560
it's not, it's not.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.560
Well, that got immediately awkward and strange.

54:13.560 --> 54:15.560
Would you, would you, would you be willing

54:15.560 --> 54:17.560
to come up? You raised your hand. Okay, yeah.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.560
Pimple Pumper or hand raiser? Oh, hand raiser.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.560
Pimple Pumper, of course hand raiser, obviously.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.560
Well, because she was first.

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
Not, not because Pickle person

54:29.560 --> 54:31.560
was a bad person at all. That's fine

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
what Pickle person did, but

54:33.560 --> 54:35.560
but she raised her hand first. What is your name?

54:35.560 --> 54:37.560
My name is Cassie. Cassie, hello. Hello, Cassie.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.560
Cassie. Thank you for joining us.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
I think that should be enough people. It's okay, I really

54:41.560 --> 54:43.560
just came up here because I wanted a water. Can I get one of those? Oh, yeah.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.560
Are you using us for our bottled water?

54:47.560 --> 54:49.560
I thought about using my hand just to ask for it, but this is

54:49.560 --> 54:51.560
a great opportunity. Well, would you like to leave

54:51.560 --> 54:53.560
and let the Pickle lady come up? Oh, okay.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
What's that? Happy, happy to be here.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.560
Okay, okay, good. All right.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.560
A little, a little under sold.

54:59.560 --> 55:01.560
I did want you to just like, grab that

55:01.560 --> 55:03.560
and then go back.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.560
You would have, you would have really

55:05.560 --> 55:07.560
won the tournament. Just go, just right at the side door

55:07.560 --> 55:09.560
and just leave. Oh, was I supposed to take one?

55:09.560 --> 55:11.560
Yeah. There's one for Demourge

55:11.560 --> 55:13.560
and then, yeah, basically

55:23.560 --> 55:25.560
Right. And so that character is Dr.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.560
Friend, I believe, right? Yes.

55:27.560 --> 55:29.560
He's like a, he's kind of like a mob doctor

55:29.560 --> 55:31.560
archetype. He's the guy who patches us up.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
Come here.

55:33.560 --> 55:35.560
Man, why'd you make me the fucking troll? And he's a future cleric.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.560
He's a troll, right?

55:37.560 --> 55:39.560
I think he's a troll. Look at all the equipment.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
Oh, he's a troll. Middle Ditch is an avid gamer

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
like that kind of makes you feel bad because

55:43.560 --> 55:45.560
he had a, he's, he's, he has like a game

55:45.560 --> 55:47.560
going with, like a real

55:47.560 --> 55:49.560
people who sit down and really game. He's doing

55:49.560 --> 55:51.560
Call of Cthulhu and now he's doing, he just started

55:51.560 --> 55:53.560
Gers, man. We're all Gers, man.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.560
And I asked Thomas

55:55.560 --> 55:57.560
while we're shooting Harmon Quest, could I, you know,

55:57.560 --> 55:59.560
could I join your group? He's like, no.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
Yeah. That's, that's, that's good.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.560
Well, the death knell to any good gaming group

56:03.560 --> 56:05.560
is accepting new members. Yeah.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
Suddenly you have like a tight group of four and then

56:07.560 --> 56:09.560
you're like, yeah, so and so doesn't come, yeah, schedule

56:09.560 --> 56:11.560
and get some vault. It's over. Nope.

56:11.560 --> 56:13.560
That was, that's why it was both admirable and it was

56:13.560 --> 56:15.560
like, fuck, then you really want in, you know,

56:15.560 --> 56:17.560
like, oh man. And so it's a candy

56:17.560 --> 56:19.560
store and it's locked.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.560
Close candy store. It's fucking insane.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.560
With only windows.

56:23.560 --> 56:25.560
And sounds of kids enjoying candy.

56:27.560 --> 56:29.560
What does that sound like?

56:29.560 --> 56:31.560
Wow.

56:31.560 --> 56:33.560
All right. Well, I'm starting to not

56:33.560 --> 56:35.560
want to get into the candy store.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.560
No, no, we've all seen spotlight by now.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.560
It's just.

56:39.560 --> 56:41.560
Kathy, you're playing whom?

56:41.560 --> 56:43.560
My name's Erin McGathy.

56:49.560 --> 56:51.560
Yeah.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.560
Can we, can we have it dead?

56:53.560 --> 56:55.560
Den.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.560
Maybe a bad pitch.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.560
Maybe a bad pitch.

56:59.560 --> 57:01.560
Can we have her play as just Erin McGathy

57:01.560 --> 57:03.560
play?

57:03.560 --> 57:05.560
No, that's, she's, uh, she's Aaron's character.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.560
It's just that, that clip.

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
That five second clip is like such a

57:09.560 --> 57:11.560
out of context would be such a

57:11.560 --> 57:13.560
weird thing to like send to Aaron.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.560
She'd be like, what are you doing?

57:17.560 --> 57:19.560
Oh, I don't know.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
She's like.

57:21.560 --> 57:23.560
Um, all right.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.560
So Spencer, what do you think about

57:25.560 --> 57:27.560
life and, uh, Isis?

57:27.560 --> 57:29.560
Overrated.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
Both of them.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.560
I agree.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.560
I agree.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.560
Don't worry about that.

57:37.560 --> 57:39.560
All right, Spencer, do we need it?

57:39.560 --> 57:41.560
I've been away from Shadowrun for like

57:41.560 --> 57:43.560
a couple of months, it feels like.

57:43.560 --> 57:45.560
So let's just, uh, where, where were we

57:45.560 --> 57:47.560
when we last left off? Do you have a recap

57:47.560 --> 57:49.560
Our guest recap was written by

57:49.560 --> 57:51.560
no one, you fucking assholes.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.560
Not you guys.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.560
You guys on the live crowd are fine.

57:55.560 --> 57:57.560
It's internet people I'm mad at.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.560
Okay, Spencer, I'm going to play the

57:59.560 --> 58:01.560
some music and you're going to give us a brief recap.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.560
All right.

58:03.560 --> 58:05.560
Yeah.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.560
Last time on Shadowrun.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.560
Our heroes return to their

58:09.560 --> 58:11.560
mission to store quests

58:11.560 --> 58:13.560
to find the MP3s.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.560
They brought them all back.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.560
Accomplishing their

58:17.560 --> 58:19.560
mission.

58:19.560 --> 58:21.560
Back at the bar.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.560
They assailed a woman the second she walked

58:23.560 --> 58:25.560
in the door.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.560
Not letting her drink.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.560
Bothering her with questions

58:29.560 --> 58:31.560
and then raping her mind.

58:31.560 --> 58:33.560
Eventually

58:33.560 --> 58:35.560
they pulled a quest out of her.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.560
Finding

58:37.560 --> 58:39.560
the whereabouts

58:39.560 --> 58:41.560
of her lost daughter

58:41.560 --> 58:43.560
last seen

58:43.560 --> 58:45.560
at flesh to fresh

58:45.560 --> 58:47.560
a support group for ghouls

58:47.560 --> 58:49.560
survivors of the HMHVV

58:49.560 --> 58:51.560
disease.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.560
They're still there in that tavern

58:53.560 --> 58:55.560
bothering the lady.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.560
On Harmon.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.560
Had we agreed on a price to bring your

59:01.560 --> 59:03.560
I think there was a price agreed on.

59:03.560 --> 59:05.560
What was the woman's name?

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
Peggy, right?

59:07.560 --> 59:09.560
I don't know.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.560
Well, right.

59:11.560 --> 59:13.560
Peggy,

59:13.560 --> 59:15.560
what's your daughter's name?

59:15.560 --> 59:17.560
Jim.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.560
She's truly outrageous.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.560
Is she a ghoul trying to get

59:25.560 --> 59:27.560
fresh again?

59:27.560 --> 59:29.560
She's a ghoul.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.560
They have this craving for flesh.

59:31.560 --> 59:33.560
Dead flesh.

59:33.560 --> 59:35.560
Not living flesh.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.560
They don't want to eat you.

59:37.560 --> 59:39.560
They want to murder you and then eat you.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.560
They can handle it

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
with therapy and stuff.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.560
She's been trying to control her urges

59:45.560 --> 59:47.560
and she's been making good progress.

59:47.560 --> 59:49.560
Will she stop being a ghoul

59:49.560 --> 59:51.560
or should she stop eating dead people?

59:51.560 --> 59:53.560
She'll just stop eating dead people.

59:53.560 --> 59:55.560
A ghoul is just a person with a disease.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.560
It's a condition.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.560
Is future Trump running

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.560
for president? Can we just build a ghoul wall?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.560
I'm asking you

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.560
to find my daughter, not prevent her

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.560
from getting to me.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.560
Sorry.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.560
That's just classic Dr. Friend humor.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.560
Spencer,

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.560
what's our

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560
hack eye? Is hack eye with us or no?

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.560
Hack eye is at the bar, yeah.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.560
Let's remember to take him with us this time.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.560
I walk over to hack eye

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.560
and say, hey, can you get a

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.560
location on Jim?

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.560
No.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.560
No.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
I'm gonna go to flesh to fresh.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.560
Okay. Thanks hack eye.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.560
My name's not hack eye. I'm Jim Nightblade.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.560
No, I know that.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.560
I was thanking hack eye for bothering him.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560
Would it be out of the border

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.560
for us to call in Uber

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.560
and proceed to the club?

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.560
The flesh to fresh has been

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.560
explained up and

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.560
disappeared.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.560
That's one of the reasons it's been so hard

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.560
to find traces of the daughter.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.560
The place just

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.560
up and vanished.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.560
Well, who in this town's got a

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.560
vendetta against ghouls?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560
The town of, where are we? New

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560
Berlin? New Los Angeles?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.560
New Seattle.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.560
New Seattle.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.560
Now hold on a second.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.560
Who was that? Was that Piggy talking?

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.560
Oh, that was me.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.560
No, that was the DM reminding

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.560
Horde Guard of the past.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.560
Oh, wait,

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.560
I'm sorry, I apologize,

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.560
but the building didn't

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560
disappear, it was just all the people.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.560
Well,

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.560
no, I mean, the building got blown up.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.560
So it kind of disappeared.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.560
Oh, so it didn't get...

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.560
What a childlike description of

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.560
explosions.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.560
So the place just got

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.560
raised and eradicated and demolished. Seems

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.560
that way. Is there a body count?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.560
Oh.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.560
You know, there wasn't one labeled, but

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.560
explosion that size,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.560
it wasn't an explosion.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.560
It was more of a fire,

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.560
but had to have some

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560
casualties. Were there police

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.560
outside, because then we know it's at least 500?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.560
Oh, there's always police.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.560
It's a good callback,

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.560
Erin McGathy.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560
Gathey.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.560
Well,

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.560
in this,

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.560
are there skills like

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560
streetwise or anything like that?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.560
I have a contact with the mafia,

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.560
so I could ask some questions, possibly his,

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.560
reasonably loyal.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.560
There's both of those things. Yeah, there's contacts and...

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.560
I have contacts with gang members

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.560
around town.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560
All of you should probably have contacts.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.560
Oh, yeah. Just the lenses.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.560
I look around the bar,

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.560
Spencer, and I try to see

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.560
if I can locate any of my gang contacts, or

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.560
the gangs that I know. No one

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.560
in any gangs you know are in the bar right now.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.560
I do the exact same. I'm looking

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.560
for a fellow named Ritz.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.560
Hank and Hawkeye are the only guys

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.560
in the bar. Oh, and Peggy.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.560
I'm going to place a call on the future phone

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.560
to

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.560
my friend Phil, a loan star.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.560
Okay. But I'm going to kind of keep it

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.560
secret from these guys, because I don't want them to know that I was a former

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.560
loan star.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.560
I'm a precog, and I'm anticipating that

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.560
Jim Nightblade might make a call

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.560
to the loan star.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.560
But I will keep this

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.560
to myself,

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560
because I'm not stupid.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.560
It's good. That's good. Okay.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.560
Beep, boop, beep, beep, beep.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.560
Oh, low!

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.560
What is that?

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560
Is that Jimmy? Yeah.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560
That's my name.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.560
As of now.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.560
What was it again? What was the old one?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.560
Yeah, that's all back during

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.560
Steeped Mystery. All right.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.560
So listen, you got to lie.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.560
What do you know about the

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.560
Flesh to Fresh Company?

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.560
Oh, those clinics?

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560
Oh, man.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560
Those Ghoul clinics, they've been popping up all over.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.560
They're real, real,

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.560
real meat markets.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560
I tell you what.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560
Say, what do you mean?

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.560
They don't just engage in the product

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560
as advertised. Oh, they do.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.560
They offer all sorts of services

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560
like flesh replacements

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560
and flesh treatments

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.560
and also brain

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.560
zapping.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.560
To make people not ghoulish?

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.560
They do all sorts of stuff, but

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.560
it's been said, you know,

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.560
they have ties to the Chinese mob.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560
China?

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.560
I just said that for no reason.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.560
I'm sorry.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.560
Just thinking about China.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.560
Bring back our jobs.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.560
So, all right, Phil.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.560
Thank you very much. Thanks.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.560
Bye now.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.560
Bye.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.560
I feel like I'm kind of stupid sometimes.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.560
Why don't we just go into the place

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.560
because as you said,

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.560
it just got blown up.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.560
There's places opening up all over.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.560
Should we go to the wreckage of the place

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.560
and kind of look around for evidence?

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.560
We could do that.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.560
Ironically...

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.560
Not as funny anymore.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.560
I understand.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.560
Yeah, well,

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.560
we could go to a crater and poke around.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.560
They have ties to the Chinese mob.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.560
Should we go and investigate local Chinese mob hangouts

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560
and do some surveillance on that?

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.560
You know, just the place.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Don't I?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.560
Let's find out.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.560
Yeah, no.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.560
I mean, you have all sorts of connections.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.560
Yeah, you're a doctor. You've probably worked with a Chinese mob

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.560
before, Dr. Friend.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.560
Inconclusive medicine, but I know the types.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.560
I didn't ask you to judge their medical skills.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.560
Well, it's a bit of a hocus pocus

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.560
and tiger blood, etc.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.560
It's a very sweeping statement

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.560
to make out about...

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.560
disgusting filth, really.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.560
We're fighting at the...

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560
Not very much of a friend, are you?

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560
Dr. Friend's a little racist.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.560
I'm saying, like, you're a doctor.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.560
Have you ever treated any of the Chinese

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.560
mafiosis before?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.560
No, once. Back in the 80s.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.560
The 3080s.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.560
It was a call

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.560
I hope never to receive again.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.560
They held a gun to my head

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.560
and said, fix him, fix him.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.560
Those are the only words they knew.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.560
That's it?

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.560
That's handy.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.560
It was, extremely.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.560
What condition was the patient in?

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.560
Oh, gunshot wounds, you know.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.560
Criminal stuff.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.560
I remember his name

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.560
exactly.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.560
It was...

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.560
David.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.560
The Chinaman.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.560
David McChinaman.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560
Oh, it's only been

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.560
3,000 years it should be easy to track him down.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.560
Yeah.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.560
What, are we in the year 6th?

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.560
No, no. I fucked that part up.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560
It's okay. I'm not a smart guy.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.560
I'm here because I do the

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.560
sneakies and the creepies.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.560
We know, we know.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.560
Dr. Friend, do you know

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.560
a Chinese mob hang out nearby?

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.560
Yes. The Golden Hole.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.560
It's a nano-opium den.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.560
All kinds of unsavory type

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.560
thing out there. I was so scared

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.560
that part of that name

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.560
would end up being

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.560
inappropriately Asian, but

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.560
boy, it just turned out to be

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.560
just Golden Hole.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.560
Golden Hole.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.560
It's as if the people who named the restaurant

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.560
in the middle of naming a

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.560
tailspin in white guilt

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.560
and just bailed.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.560
The Golden Hole

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.560
and the entryways through the back.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.560
Should we take the hover van?

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.560
Yes.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.560
Is the Golden Hole by pump?

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.560
Yes, it's by pump, which is still

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.560
raging. Still pumping.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.560
Still pumping. Well, we usually

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.560
franchise. There's one here in New Seattle now.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.560
We usually take Neo Ubers

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.560
where we need to go.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.560
I've already called Ubers, so it should be

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.560
outside right now.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.560
Hong Kong.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.560
Impatient as ever.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.560
Shotgun.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.560
So we're going to the Golden Hole

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.560
to talk to the Chinese mob.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.560
Dr. Fritzen, I have a question. Did David

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.560
the Chinaman make it?

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.560
Oh, yes. What do you take me for?

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Some kind of Chinese doctor?

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.560
Thomas Middleditch has to leave,

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.560
everybody.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.560
I think he would have wanted

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.560
that to be his closer.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560
He's got an early call

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.560
time.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.560
Thank you so much, man.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.560
Thank you.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.560
Yeah, if you like Silicon Valley

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560
and then you'll appreciate him leaving,

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.560
they could be bright, bright, bright

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.560
and bushy for it.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.560
Well,

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.560
we're kind of going to miss

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.560
his intel.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.560
Oh, yeah, definitely.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.560
Oh, yeah, but just in general,

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.560
also the show's just going to take a fucking nose

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.560
dive now. He had energy.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.560
Contrary to his name,

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.560
that guy is like an extreme

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.560
ditch

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.560
of entertainment.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.560
It's a definitive

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.560
like, there's nothing

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.560
like...

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.560
See?

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.560
All right.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.560
Should we stop the Shadowrun game there

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.560
because he left?

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.560
Or should we just say that he fell down

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.560
while I didn't continue to...

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.560
I mean, we have a lot of show levels.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.560
No, yeah, but I thought...

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.560
I did something experimental.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560
I moved the Shadowrun game to the middle of the show.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560
I didn't expect to play. We're contractually forbidden.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.560
Allegedly.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.560
Although I'm not that scared about the

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.560
enforcement of that rule. I don't think anyone really cares.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.560
It's just lawyer stuff.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.560
But we are supposed to just play for like 10 minutes

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.560
and always...

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.560
I think what happened there was a nice little tee-up to us

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560
playing a proper round next night show.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.560
Yeah.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560
I think we'll be diminishing our tracks.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you can stay up here.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.560
Cassie is in it.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.560
Yeah.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.560
We've got a new friend up here. We've got DeMorge.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560
We've got Handsome DeMorge.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.560
The Handsomest.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.560
DeMorge was always Handsome, but now we have

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.560
Naughty College Professor.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.560
Liberal...

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.560
Liberal College Professor with his

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560
inappropriate

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560
jokes that he makes in the margins of your essays.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.560
This

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.560
was pretty good for someone with such

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.560
nice gams.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560
A run-on

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.560
sentence from you. Come on.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.560
You're so pretty.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.560
I

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.560
had to talk about

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.560
office hours.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.560
Yeah.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.560
Office hours, indeed.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.560
Cassie, where'd you grow up?

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.560
Columbus, Ohio.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.560
Oh, yeah? That's where my mom was born.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.560
Me, too.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560
Your mom

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560
was born there as well? No.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.560
Sorry.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.560
I think you might have to eat that, Mike, Cassie.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.560
What? Oh, there we go.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.560
Put it closer than you think was appropriate.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.560
Okay.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.560
Yeah. Oh, by the way, also, if you get uncomfortable,

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.560
you can leave. I always say that to everybody.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.560
Regardless of the context.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.560
But, yeah, what is it?

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.560
Tell us more about yourself. Are you visiting

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.560
Los Angeles? No, I live here. I live in

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.560
Koreatown. All right. Well, I live in

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560
Koreatown, too, when I first moved down here. That was

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560
my first neighborhood. Yeah, that's how I am.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.560
That just moved out here, and it's really cheap, because

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.560
I'm the only white, so. Right.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.560
And it's not

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.560
for that reason, but it's a little

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560
scary over there still, isn't it?

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560
Oh, yeah. No, it's not that bad.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560
I mean, I've only heard, like, one gunshot,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.560
so I feel like that's pretty solid.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.560
What's the reason, I mean, like, don't

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.560
give us your address, but, like, what corner

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.560
are you near? I'm, like, right

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.560
next to, like, Wilshire

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.560
and Mariposa. Okay, yeah.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.560
I lived there, like, 9th and Serrano,

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.560
back in the, like, early, mid-90s.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.560
And at one point, the LAPD

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.560
called it the most dangerous neighborhood in Los Angeles,

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560
and it was gunshots every night.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560
And, like, not just a couple, but, like,

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.560
Wild Wild West, Beirut kind of said.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.560
It must have changed since then, right?

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.560
You got held up,

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560
and I've already told the story.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560
In the short time I was living there,

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560
and this is almost kind of a separate thing,

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560
because it's, like, when a homeless person kills

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.560
another homeless person, it's sort of, like, that's just,

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.560
that's not a neighborhood thing.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560
It's, like, oh, that's, like, oh, my god,

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560
there's so many homeless people. Nature.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.560
This is, like, a homeless

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.560
population thing, like,

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.560
but, like, yeah,

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.560
like, a homeless guy killed another homeless guy,

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.560
like, in the, like,

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560
in my backyard, essentially, except there was

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560
a fence between my backyard and the area

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560
where the homeless would congregate.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.560
Not exciting news,

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.560
but Koreatown, like,

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.560
sounds,

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.560
sounds a little more fun than

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.560
it was back then, anyway.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.560
It's really nice. I mean, there are some good bars,

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.560
and there's really good food, and it's really cheap,

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.560
which is cool, because I'm super poor.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560
What do you want to do to get rich?

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.560
Oh, I'm a healthcare designer.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.560
Okay.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560
That's a combination of words

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.560
I've never heard in my life.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.560
So, that's just, like, you can just,

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.560
you just, you, designing, like,

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560
like, programs, like, like, like...

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560
No, no, no, no, designing, like, places where people

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.560
receive care for their health.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560
Oh, like, designing hospitals, like, floor plans?

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560
Yeah.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.560
So, like, not an architect, but...

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.560
Well...

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.560
And not an interior decorator.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.560
Like, in between there is, like,

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.560
somebody really important that's going, like,

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.560
put the triage unit here,

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.560
if somebody runs into their arms cut off,

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.560
like, they can, you know, scientifically

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.560
figuring out how to lay out...

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560
Yeah, it's stuff like that. Yeah.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560
Yeah. I work for an architecture firm,

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.560
and I'm an interior designer at that architecture firm.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.560
So, people build places, and then we make sure

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.560
they have walls and stuff.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.560
Give us some, like, what's a,

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.560
what's like a, what's a term

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.560
that only healthcare designers know

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.560
that's, like, the next time we're in a hospital,

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.560
we can sound like a,

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.560
like, the equivalent of feng shui,

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.560
but for a healthcare designer, we can look,

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.560
like, if I go in it, because I cut my pinky off,

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.560
and I'm, like, I'm feeling like I'm being brushed off,

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560
that I can just, at least

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560
in my tirade, I can go,

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560
look, you think I don't know what the fuck's going on here?

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560
This place doesn't even have an open

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560
alpha way.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.560
You know how fucking dangerous

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560
that is?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560
Like, just give me some ammo.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.560
Um, everything

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.560
is in acronyms, so you could probably just

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560
make up acronyms for, like, what happened to you,

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.560
you're, like, I cut off my pinky,

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560
so it's, like, I-C-O-M-P.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.560
Everything is acronyms.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560
If you talk to people I work with, I'm, like, oh cool,

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.560
what does that stand for? And they're, like,

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.560
I don't know.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.560
Just saying, that's good. Okay, thanks.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.560
So you design, like, hospitals, or...

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560
Yeah, hospitals, clinics, you guys know, like...

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.560
Is it, it seems to me that

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.560
in the structure of those places, there are a lot of

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.560
hallways or corridors that are set up

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.560
with rooms in them that have no specific

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.560
definition, so that they're free

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560
to be changed, like in ICUs or rooms

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.560
that become adaptable because

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.560
there are eight people on that day who have

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.560
to be vertical, uh, and have to be washed

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.560
at any time, but there could be zero at that point,

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.560
that room could be something else.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.560
Yes. Is that what you mean by putting...

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.560
I'm saying that! You, sir, are correct.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.560
What do you mean by putting walls, like, putting walls in a place?

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.560
Oh, no, I mean, like, I mean, you have to have walls

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.560
in a hospital, but, uh,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560
I, I don't know, I just do, like,

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.560
we do floor plans, we do layouts, we end up picking

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.560
all the finishes, making sure that, like, if some

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.560
guy throws up on a couch,

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.560
it's cleanable.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.560
Is there, is there, like, a, I picture

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.560
my picture going to the health care design

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.560
job, I picture that there's, like, these

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.560
these programs where

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.560
you can bring up a floor plan

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560
of a hospital, and then

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.560
you can click play on, like, a simulator

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.560
and adjust the speed, and what it does

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.560
is simulates, like,

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.560
injured people, like, particles blowing

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.560
in wherever the...

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.560
like, it's like when you design cars, and you just, like,

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.560
have the air bouncing off the hood,

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560
so that you can design the car to be aerodynamic,

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.560
that they just, like, you just, you just

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.560
have, like, sick people pouring in

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.560
through a, through a, through a dispenser,

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.560
and then they're just, like, if they start

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.560
hitting, collecting in a corner, and you're like,

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.560
well, that's a...

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.560
So it's, like, health care tycoon?

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.560
But is there any

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.560
element that's like that?

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.560
No. Okay.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560
Well, and have you noticed that people keep

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.560
getting sick? So maybe...

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.560
Maybe...

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.560
Do you get as specific as the artwork

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560
in the, in the clinic? Oh, yeah.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560
Because what is it, what is the fascination

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.560
with, like, cock shells? Aqua.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.560
There's lots of, there's lots of seafoam

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.560
and aquas, and yeah, lots of moths

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.560
in there. Yeah, I think, like,

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.560
well, we try to change it, we try to spice it up.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.560
Maybe add in, like, a yellow.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.560
Ooh, Southwest Zest.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.560
Yeah.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.560
Yeah, but it's not ever, like, really up to us.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.560
People are like, no, we want it to be

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.560
mint, green, and light pink. That just says

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.560
you're definitely sick.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560
That means you're in

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.560
real trouble, Mrs. Johnson.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.560
You know what?

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.560
Yeah, if we, if we put bright colors

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.560
in the wall, that means you're fine. Yeah, well, you know,

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.560
you don't want to create an environment so

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.560
unhospital-like that people are like,

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.560
I should get out of bed, and they're, like,

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.560
ripping out of there. Like, it's a beautiful day out.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.560
I'm at a Burger King.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.560
I want to, I want to go play

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.560
on the ball pit. No, ma'am, you have

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.560
leukemia.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.560
I do? Look at the walls.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.560
Oh.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.560
Um, but I want to, well,

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560
not to, but like,

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.560
because I remember,

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.560
I wonder how much of that, like,

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.560
because I'm assuming that there's a client

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.560
then that goes like, yeah,

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.560
we wanted to take a chance, and then you're like, how about

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.560
a splash of yellow? And they're like, yeah, but it doesn't feel

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.560
hospital-y. And it's like,

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.560
there's that, which is like a momentum of, like,

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.560
a legacy of, like,

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.560
it's like with talk shows. It's like, oh, but he doesn't

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.560
have a desk. And it's like, then a desk

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.560
becomes a desk, becomes a desk, and somebody

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.560
tries a talk show, and I was like, I'm just going to sit

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.560
on a flagpole and do my talk show.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.560
I'm, because I'm crazy. And then

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560
everyone's like, yeah, but you're not behind a desk.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.560
And it's like a syndrome.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.560
Versus, like, people

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.560
going like, oh, there's been a study that the color

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.560
mint makes you, like,

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.560
willing to

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.560
be cut open. Submit to experimental evidence, yeah.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.560
But does it have to go both ways, then?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.560
I mean, does it, because people work there, too, and do

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.560
you want them to feel sick? No, we actually do

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.560
try.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.560
Like, we try to make it feel like a home,

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.560
because it's like been proven that if you

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560
feel like you're at a home and you're

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560
being well taken care of, then you get

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.560
well faster, and we're trying to have more windows,

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.560
because if you can see nature, you get well faster.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560
Whoa, see, that's the kind of

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.560
fucking juice we wanted.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.560
Yeah.

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.560
Give us that sweet healthcare designer juice.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.560
Yeah, so we'll do, like,

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.560
rehab for, like, eating disorders,

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.560
but you want it to feel like you just walked into,

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.560
like, your friend's home, and you can go,

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.560
like, eat their dinner, because you have to eat

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.560
when you go there. So we try to make it, like,

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.560
welcoming, and everybody, I mean, all this stuff,

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.560
it's, like, behavioral health, so you need to go in

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.560
and feel like you're not

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.560
in an institution. Like, you don't want to go

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.560
into St. Asylum because you want to commit

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.560
suicide. You want to go somewhere where they're like,

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.560
we know. Life's really hard.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.560
But, like, sit in this super comfortable,

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.560
bright teal chair and, like,

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.560
talk to me about it. Right. But also,

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.560
if you try to leave, we'll tackle you.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.560
Yeah. But all the doors are locked.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.560
Right. Do you have to have, for your line of work,

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.560
do you have to have, like, a psychological

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.560
background? Would you study any psychology?

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.560
No, I just studied interior design.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.560
Really? Yeah.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.560
And did you choose this, or did it kind of fall

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.560
into your lap, or? It's sort of, I mean,

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.560
healthcare happened on accident.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.560
I did, like, a senior thesis as

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.560
a hospice, which is a really

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.560
weird senior thesis because nobody

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.560
really wants to, like, listen to you talk

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.560
about how you read all these super depressing books

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.560
about people dying of cancer. But,

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.560
in conclusion, it ended up, like, getting me my

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560
job. And I just did that because,

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.560
like, my mom

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.560
was talking to me about this hospice that she

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.560
was at, and she's like, it's really nice. Like, this place

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.560
is great. And I was like, oh, that sounds like a good senior thesis.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.560
And our professor told us that we should

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.560
do things that are, like, nice

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.560
for people and not just, like, a new

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.560
restaurant, because then we seem like

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.560
we're limited. Not like Creepy Professor

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:12.560
DeMorge, who is only concerned

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.560
with your legs.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.560
It's starting to sound like healthcare design

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.560
is the Christian rock of interior

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.560
design.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.560
You're like, well,

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.560
there's always a job there

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.560
if you can create a, you know, because they need

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.560
help. And Christians

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.560
need rock, too.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.560
So then you're just like, Jesus

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.560
Christ!

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.560
Well, South Park

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.560
did it.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.560
What was that? There was something, there was something

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.560
I forgot. I knew I should have written it down.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.560
There was something

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.560
when Middleditch was up here that

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.560
and I fucking,

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.560
there's no way you guys are going to remind me of what it was,

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.560
because it was in my own brain and I forgot

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.560
it. Was it your, your lips it?

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.560
No, of course it wasn't that.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.560
We're going to talk about that.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.560
So, I'll never remember it.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.560
What was your, like, what would,

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.560
do you want to stay doing this for a long time?

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.560
So that's what you would like.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.560
Yeah, this is like, probably just going to be me

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.560
for eternity. That's fantastic. Look, good for you.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.560
You actually went to school, studied a thing and found

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.560
the niche that you wanted to be in. That's very cool.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.560
Yeah, yeah. I originally went for like

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.560
Friends at Chemistry and then I decided that I wasn't going

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.560
to go to med school so the government could pay me salary

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.560
to cut open some dead people.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.560
I was like, that's just way too much debt. I'll be

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.560
an interior designer.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.560
You kids.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.560
Yeah.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.560
So now you're creating the environments where

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.560
other people cut open dead people and are

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.560
in debt. Yeah.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.560
Yeah, they do get into a lot of debt.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.560
It's pretty much just comes full circle.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.560
Yeah, I do feel bad for, yeah, well

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.560
I've already said this. There's millennials.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.560
They really get fucked.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.560
The student debt thing is

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.560
crazy. You're welcome,

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.560
honey.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.560
I am old enough

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.560
to be your dad and I do feel bad, like

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.560
about the student debt.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.560
That's all folks.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.560
It's fucking crazy.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.560
It's like a national epidemic. It's crazy.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.560
It's like a scandal because

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.560
we just kept going.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.560
When I was in high school, it was

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.560
starting to happen when I was in high school.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.560
When I was in high school, my friend

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.560
Dave Friedle, he was

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.560
in a food service

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560
intern program.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.560
Even though he wasn't the most reliable

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.560
guy in terms of turning

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.560
his English homework and math

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.560
and stuff, he was staying in high school and

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560
he was getting a decent grade point average because

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.560
they had a program there that was like for

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.560
food service. It was like learning

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.560
trade and like part of his high school

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.560
diploma was that he would go

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.560
and work for a little bit at a restaurant

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.560
and then because

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.560
he had that program, he ended up being like

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.560
he was fucking like, he's had a great

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.560
career. Now he's a computer programmer, but just

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.560
that professionalism. But they were

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.560
yanking those programs the whole time.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.560
Just in those, like everything.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.560
Everything that had anything to do with

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.560
middle. It's like you're either going to go

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.560
to prison or you're going to go to college is

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.560
what everything became. And guess what?

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.560
College goes right to prison now.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.560
Because here's your, thank you

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.560
for your debt and here's your math and buy.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.560
There's no, so

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.560
it's like turns out, yeah, no, you should be

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.560
fucking teaching kids piano and you should be teaching

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.560
them how to fix cars and you should be teaching

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.560
them how to peel a banana. I don't know what you people do.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.560
Um,

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.560
I don't know what

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.560
did you, did you say stay in

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.560
school motherfucker? Trade school.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.560
Oh trade school motherfucker, yeah.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.560
Are there still trade schools?

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.560
Oh wait, but aren't those like kind of fucked

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.560
up too though? They're technical colleges

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.560
and trade schools. They don't get pushed

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.560
by, you know, people who should be

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.560
guiding youth. Yeah.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.560
I don't know, I thought I remembered

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560
part of that. Spencer, did you

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560
go to college? I forget. Oh yeah.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.560
What did you study?

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.560
Uh, what do you call it?

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.560
Bachelors Arts.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.560
So

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.560
the art of

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.560
uh, oh

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.560
no, no, no. I have a nice couch and a turntable

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560
and the Associates Arts.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.560
Okay.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.560
Advanced man caves.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.560
How many years of a higher

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.560
education did you get through? More

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.560
than you should to get an

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.560
Associates of Arts degree.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.560
That's two. I got a degree

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.560
on accident. Did I tell you guys

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.560
about this? No.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.560
My friend was graduating

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.560
from Moorpark College. It's college I went

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.560
to. Graduating from Moorpark College

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.560
and I was, I was invited so I was

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.560
sitting there waiting for him to walk and I

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560
was reading the program showing the list

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.560
of the recent graduates and I was like, oh,

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.560
there I am.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.560
I must have filled out a form or something

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.560
but I just had no idea that I

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.560
had done the

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.560
degree that I wanted until

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560
I was at the graduation,

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.560
which would have been my graduation

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.560
if

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.560
I was aware of that. That's the same as you

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560
finding out about parties

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.560
that were on Facebook after the fact.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.560
Yeah.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.560
That's my whole life.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Oh, this is always fun. Let's bring out Steve Levy.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.560
Steve Levy.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.560
Yeah.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.560
Yeah.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.560
Yeah.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.560
I think

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.560
it's important to bring it out because

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.560
I think probably some people out there are a

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.560
little concerned about you. Oh.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.560
Why? Well, because the last time we saw

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.560
you, it was like a movie of the week.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560
You were really into Vicodin.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.560
Oh.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.560
Was I really into it? Yeah, you were

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.560
really into it. You were really drunk.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.560
We thought you had a problem, man. You

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.560
looked like a drunk. You were, you

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.560
literally kept saying I really love Vicodin

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.560
and like, and then you were like, we played

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.560
an adventure. I remember

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.560
that.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.560
You were just on painkillers, man, right? Yeah.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.560
But you said you had a sip of booze, too,

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.560
right? No. No.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.560
No, okay. He hadn't eaten all day

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.560
or whatever. Yeah, that's

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.560
no good. Same shit. It was no good.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.560
I should get you high. I played your character

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.560
in Shadowrun. I heard it.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560
You did great. Oh, thank you. You

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.560
were, you did me proud.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.560
Steve Levy, what would you like

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.560
me to change about my life?

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.560
Why

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.560
do you never ask me these

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560
questions? Oh, man.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.560
I'm more curious though what Spencer was

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.560
doing. Because Spencer has more answers to this question we know.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.560
Right, right. You'd like me to be more productive,

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.560
right? You'd like me to work.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560
You don't ask a question and an answer

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.560
at 4th again. This is a really hard

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.560
question. Hard bottom.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.560
Lose your job

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.560
over this answer. You're way, you're way

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560
over committed. You are. And when I look at

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.560
our schedule, it's like, holy fuck.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.560
This is exhausting. How is he going to do all

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.560
this? Because all I fuck

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.560
is mannequin legs.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.560
Do you have any idea?

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.560
I just doubled our output.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.560
Yeah.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.560
Yeah.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560
Um.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.560
I don't know.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.560
And I drink soylent now? I don't

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.560
even have to wash a fork anymore.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.560
I know. I just like drink

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.560
meals. It's amazing. Wait, you

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.560
eat no solid food? Well, I don't

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.560
know. I eat whatever I, but I'm

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.560
like, when it,

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.560
in doubt, like when in doubt,

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560
I don't know. By default

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.560
I will, I have a

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.560
little meal in a

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.560
bottle. Got you.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.560
Right. In a

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.560
bottle.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.560
And it's

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.560
like 400 calories and it's got all the

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.560
vitamins and. But occasionally

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.560
you used, you know, eat

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.560
food, food. Yeah. And

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.560
like the longest I've gone, like just

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560
drinking soylent is two days, but it's

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.560
not like, it's not like one of those things where it's like, oh, you have to stick

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.560
to this program. Otherwise, this thing won't

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.560
happen. It was just, I'm just sort of like, it's like a

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560
protein shake. It's like, yeah, it's, but it's like, so

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.560
because like one of the worst things you can do if you're trying to lose

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.560
weight is like, is not eat

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.560
breakfast because you're not really particularly hungry

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560
when you wake up sometimes. And

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.560
what am I talking about? Steve, Steve,

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.560
what else would you change about Dan?

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.560
Yeah. Come on, get back to this.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.560
What? Fucking the dirt.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.560
You want me to

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.560
stop

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.560
buying women's clothes from Amazon?

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.560
Don't let him answer the question.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.560
I want you to be happy and do everything

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:12.560
that you want to. That's why I work

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.560
hard to make sure that happens.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.560
No, come on, you work hard because you

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560
want to run the industry one

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.560
day. Well, I don't know. And I want to work for

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.560
you.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.560
That's an honor. Steve,

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.560
what you

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560
want, we all want Dan, we all want all of our friends

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.560
to be happy. What would you

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.560
put into place? What would you implement as a

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.560
practice or a policy

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560
to help Dan be happier?

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560
Like fun time.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.560
Where like Dan can, like every day

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.560
this is your allotted period to do

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.560
what the fuck you want. This guy's the best.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560
I

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.560
would hope that would... He just said

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.560
we know he plays Minecraft and jerks off

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.560
Americans. Does that not... He plays Minecraft

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.560
while writing Rick and Morty. So it's like

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.560
why would he waste an hour playing

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.560
Minecraft when he's doing it all day?

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.560
What kind of fun time? Be specific.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.560
I want to have... Hold on here.

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.560
I have the issue with this. Yeah, we have this system.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.560
Yeah, I write Rick and Morty for

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.560
50 minutes during which there's no cell

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.560
phones or anything, let alone Minecraft

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.560
allowed, and then every 50 minutes

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.560
is a 10 minute break. That's what I play.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.560
No, he's not like writing

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.560
with one hand and then playing Minecraft.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.560
I wanted anybody to watch season 3 of

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.560
Rick and Morty and be like, must be the Minecraft.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.560
No, no. Work hard.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.560
Must be the Minecraft. Season 3 is going to be

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.560
amazing.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.560
Alright, so anyways, good job. You have fun

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.560
times. Yeah.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.560
Pitch some... In Spencer,

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.560
you can jump in this. Like spitball

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.560
some specific fun time activities for

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.560
Dent. Like go to the batting cages.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.560
This is good because my therapist is always going,

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.560
what do you do to refuel? Because

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.560
every day you're out

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.560
by 8 a.m.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.560
and then we have

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560
meetings till

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.560
11, and then from 11 to whatever

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.560
we were writing Rick and Morty, and then

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.560
after that there's Harmon Quest

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.560
and then it's like, what the fuck

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.560
else are you? Like, you have nothing...

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.560
And I fuck a mannequin. It's not really...

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.560
I do. I really do.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.560
And then you go to bed, hopefully. Well, I sleep

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.560
with a baby. Because I'm like, I came...

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.560
And you know what I dream about?

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.560
Getting up the next day and having

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.560
the perfect life. And then I go like, that's not

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.560
a dream. I woke up. I'm living

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.560
the dream. I'm not

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.560
unhappy. Spencer, what would you change about

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.560
then? Oh, man.

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.560
Come on, Spencer.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.560
I definitely have him wear a suit...

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.560
a suit

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.560
100% of the time.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560
Why?

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.560
With a deep, with a deep red tie.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.560
Yeah.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.560
Deep red tie. Like Hitman?

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.560
Like Hitman. Oh yeah, like the Hitman tie.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.560
Wait, that's just the tie though.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.560
The name of that track I'm playing is Hitman.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.560
Whoa!

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.560
Whoa!

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.560
This really did turn out to be an interesting show

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.560
after Thomas Biddleditch left

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.560
our experiment of having

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.560
the A-list guest leave in the middle

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.560
of the show. DeMorge, what would you change

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.560
about Cassie?

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.560
Come on, just say it.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.560
I don't know, man. I feel like you just got to...

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.560
You just got to live a little bit

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.560
and innovate a little bit. Break some rules,

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.560
man. Get in that hospital

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.560
and, you know,

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.560
I don't know, put a basketball

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.560
court in an emergency room

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.560
or something.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.560
So racist.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.560
So racist.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.560
Everybody's got to... Everybody's got to

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.560
survive.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.560
All right, sorry. Okay.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.560
Thank you. I have the floor. All right, Cassie.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.560
Do you feel improved? Okay, good. You'll do that.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.560
You'll put a basketball court in there.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.560
Cassie, do you feel like you don't live...

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.560
Do you ever, like...

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.560
Do you have your own fun time?

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.560
Do you live it up in your own time?

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.560
Or are you kind of an all about work?

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.560
Oh, like, half and half.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.560
You know, I work when I'm supposed to

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.560
and then I immediately leave work when I'm allowed to.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.560
And then what do you do to, like, cut loose?

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.560
I drink a lot.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.560
Yeah, no, really. What's your spirit of choice?

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.560
Uh...

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.560
We don't discriminate against alcohol.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.560
I think all of it's really worth it.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.560
Like, last night,

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.560
I was just hanging out with my roommate

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.560
and we had wine, tequila,

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.560
gin, vodka, and then we finished the night

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.560
off with two different beers.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.560
Yeah, high school. That's high school.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.560
Yeah, except I had to pay a bunch of money

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.560
for all of it.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.560
Yeah, like some guy that you, like, outside the 7-Eleven

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.560
and you're like, can you buy us some...

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.560
Hey, mister,

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.560
can I have a bottle of tequila?

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.560
What are you, 12?

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.560
Uh, all right.

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.560
Dan, what would you change about Steve Levy?

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.560
Oh, this is a better question.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.560
Well, here, you got his gums fixed.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.560
Yeah.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.560
You had a problem with his gums.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.560
Well, he got his way, he was on bike,

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.560
and then he had to have them fixed.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.560
I mean, everybody was talking about it.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.560
He called him Crazy Gums.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.560
Crazy Gums Johnson.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.560
We knew his last name.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.560
That's how fucked up his gums were.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.560
I called him Hubba Bubba.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.560
Because of the gum.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.560
Makes sense.

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.560
Tell me how to nickname people.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.560
Okay, no, really, when I would change it

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.560
about Steve Levy, however,

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.560
but this is all under the umbrella of,

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.560
I mean, this is perfect,

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.560
for the family that we have.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.560
But, it's pretty great.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.560
But, if I was, the things that I worry about

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.560
with Steve, that I would like him to be,

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.560
like, I think Steve is,

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.560
is very,

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.560
you're anxious about,

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.560
you know,

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.560
because you...

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.560
I am.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.560
I'm glad we solved that one.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.560
Can I say this?

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.560
You lost your dad at a young age,

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.560
and you're kind of like,

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.560
you're very honest about this,

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.560
like, you're very, like,

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.560
that threshold of,

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.560
like, you feel fragile,

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.560
you feel like life is fragile.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560
Maybe that's, I'm not putting words in your mouth,

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.560
but, like, you, you know,

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.560
you want people to make right choices

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.560
and be healthy, and like,

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.560
that's what makes you a good,

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.560
like, intrepid assistant.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.560
So, who would change anything about that?

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.560
But, I don't want you to go home at night

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.560
and be fucking dangerous,

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.560
because it's really just random.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.560
Yeah.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.560
I think you hit the nail on the head.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.560
Right. I fixed you, right?

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.560
Yes.

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.560
But it's not like a note you need to be given.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.560
You know you're stressed out a little bit.

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.560
Like, not stressed out.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.560
It's not your personality, but...

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.560
No.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.560
You're operating at a cautious level.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.560
Yeah, most of the time, I think.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.560
Well, during last week's show,

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.560
I was always a little bit through the roof.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.560
Because you were worried that

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.560
your dick was going to come out.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.560
Well...

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.560
Oh, in New York? Yeah.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.560
Oh, yeah, because there was, like, liquid and electricity

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.560
everywhere, and my dick was out.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.560
Yeah, no.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.560
And there had been a terrorist attack,

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.560
and there was SWAT teams everywhere.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.560
Yeah, no.

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.560
That's a great origin story for, like,

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.560
a superhero or villain.

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.560
Like, his dick was out on stage.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.560
And Dan Harmon, well, insecure about not having an act,

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.560
becomes Hackman.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.560
Part prop, part blackout.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560
Oh...

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.560
Andy Dick.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.560
I was never aware of the physical hazard

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.560
that we were standing in.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.560
I didn't realize there was live current running through.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.560
How do you not realize that you poured buckets

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.560
on Dino's head or something?

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.560
I did?

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.560
I mean, you were pouring...

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.560
Oh, I poured water on him.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.560
There was liquid everywhere.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.560
It was a great show.

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.560
This...

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.560
But boy, oh boy, that other show.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.560
We've fallen into a middle ditch.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.560
All right.

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.560
All right, let's turn this thing fucking...

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.560
Let's take it to the limit.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.560
Take it to the limit.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.560
I don't even know how many times I've said good.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.560
Yeah, but did you see the thing? Let's do one of those.

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.560
All right. You ready?

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.560
Let's do the funk music.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.560
Funk music?

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.560
Good job. I think we did it.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.560
Good job.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.560
It's that easy.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.560
That's all it takes.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.560
I had a whole picture of my head of, like,

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.560
these worm people who were miners.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.560
And they were going to work,

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.560
because it was like the...

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.560
And it was like a cross-section

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.560
that you could see them, like, walking.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.560
They were like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.560
They got little helmets on.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.560
Show don't tell.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.560
I'm doing it.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.560
They're little yellow jackets.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.560
And they're worms, but they have eyes,

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560
which is dumb, but they have a mining helmet on,

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.560
which is also dumb, because...

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560
And they're like, we are the

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.560
worm-minor

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.560
people.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.560
We...

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.560
We...

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560
We do the mining

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.560
for the worms.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.560
Well, have you ever

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.560
noticed that

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.560
worms live in the ground?

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.560
Did you think they did

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.560
digging on their own? No.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.560
There's an elite

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.560
sector of worms

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.560
that you never see

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.560
that do their digging for them.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.560
My name is Mr. Worm.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.560
I'm the president of all worms.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560
I like to distribute the wealth

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.560
because I'm a socialist.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.560
Because I'm a worm.

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.560
And I say,

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:14.560
you get to be a miner

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.560
and you are a regular worm.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.560
But in worm society,

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.560
miners are like the highest

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:22.560
because it's

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.560
a worm society.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560
All we do is live in the ground.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.560
It makes sense, because

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.560
if you do a one-for-one analog

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.560
to human society,

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560
the elite are people who

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.560
do what? They lay in bed

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.560
and read the paper.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.560
And when worms look

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.560
at people, that's what we always see.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.560
Why are they doing that?

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.560
And you know how when it rains,

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.560
all the worms come up?

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.560
And when it rains, all those worms

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.560
are coming up and they're always going,

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.560
like, where did the people go?

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.560
Worm society,

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.560
it's more complex than you think.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560
Mucous membranes

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.560
protect us from the world.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.560
Our anatomy is a tube.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.560
It's all that you have to lube.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.560
Your food, as it goes to the hood

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.560
of your body, the clitoral hood,

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
comes out when you're in the mood.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560
You're going to eat, eat, eat, and poot, poot, poot.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:28.560
All you are is a torus-shaped thing

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.560
that's like a sock that eats things.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.560
Nothing's changed.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.560
We have these cells and we used to

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.560
have a range of little microns

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.560
and we go up to a piece of food

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.560
and we get on it and we rub against it

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.560
to eat and all these later times

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.560
we've got mouths, but all it really is

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.560
is that we're rubbing up against the food

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.560
by putting it in our mouth.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.560
Because the inside of your intestinal tract

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.560
is the outside of your body.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.560
Get it?

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.560
Because your butthole connects to your mouth

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.560
and it's like a little spout

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560
but it goes straight through like a balloon

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.560
and it goes straight through like that.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.560
Your bloodstream needs to be

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.560
shielded from the alimentary canal.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.560
If there's a rupture, you get

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.560
septic diseases

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.560
like the little girl from Poltergeist.

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.560
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560
a pronouncement by president

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.560
Mr. Worm.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.560
I pronounce the little girl from

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.560
Poltergeist, a posthumous hero.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.560
She's a victim not of septic

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.560
disease,

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.560
but really of the entertainment

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.560
industry's refusal to stop

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.560
making money.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.560
Poltergeist was such a smash hit

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.560
that they refused

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.560
to take her to proper doctors

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.560
and get her checked out.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.560
I haven't researched this as much as a person

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.560
blaming an industry

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.560
for someone's death should.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.560
But I'm confident that there's

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.560
enough things going on in this news cycle

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.560
that this won't blow up in my worm

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.560
face.

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.560
Plus, who's going to take me

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.560
to task? I'm defending a little girl

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.560
and I'm

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.560
only attacking a system.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.560
You know, if I was like Charlie

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.560
Sheen's a jerk then, oh boy.

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.560
Oh, the Klaxons

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.560
would ring.

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.560
I smell clicks

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.560
the primates would say.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.560
But I'm just a worm

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.560
politician.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.560
Five seconds.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.560
Fuck your mama.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.560
We did it.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.560
We took it to the fucking limit.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.560
We took it to the limit of endurance.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.560
Are you thinking you could do better than that?

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.560
Maybe if we took it to the limit.

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.560
Peach Cobbler

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.560
takes it to the limit of the tiny square.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.560
It's allotted in your TV dinner.

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.560
All that means is it sits there

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.560
where it's supposed to.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.560
Take it past the limit.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.560
That's what heroes do.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.560
Astronauts take it to the limit

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.560
when they approach the atmosphere

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.560
and burn up and fall down.

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.560
Excuse me.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.560
What?

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.560
What are you people

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.560
ever sensitive about?

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.560
You are out of your

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.560
goddamn hive mind.

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.560
You are the most

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.560
reflexively sweaty

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.560
fucking anxiety driven

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.560
homeschooled fucking insects.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.560
Your fucking generation

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.560
is going to

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.560
die

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:36.560
together

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.560
all at once.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.560
Because you're not going to be able to

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.560
funk and process.

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.560
You're going outside the limit.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.560
There's limits here.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.560
I love you.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.560
Oh.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.560
Oh yeah. Plus you're racist.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.560
Apologize

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.560
to DeMorge.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.560
You guys

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.560
are always talking about how easy it is

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.560
to apologize. Why don't you ever

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.560
do it?

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:06.560
Apologize to DeMorge.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.560
Eh. Sounds fake.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.560
DeMorge, accept their apology.

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.560
I don't know man.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.560
It's been a long life.

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.560
Yeah, exactly.

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.560
I'm on his side.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.560
You guys are fucks.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.560
All right. Let's take it through

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.560
the limit.

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.560
Laterally.

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.560
You don't take it through the limit by going forward.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.560
You turn left and you fucking

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.560
right through the bloodstream out of the pore.

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.560
Whoa, that's supposed to be in me.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.560
Well, I took it to the limit.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.560
Says the thing that flew out of you.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.560
Like a bot fly.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.560
Okay.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.560
All right. Give me a...

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560
Be quiet for a second. Let me figure out

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.560
what you should give me.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.560
Give me a type of

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.560
wood.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:58.560
Ash. I heard ash.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.560
And birch.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.560
Okay. Ash and birch.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:04.560
Two normal pieces of wood, right?

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.560
Put them together. What do you get?

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.560
Two pieces of wood.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.560
Oh, okay.

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.560
Find out.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.560
Give me number three.

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.560
Yeah.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.560
Yeah.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.560
I'll fucking ask.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.560
I'm the thickest wood.

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.560
I got my roots in the ground.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.560
I need some more wood to pull them down.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.560
When I go outside

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.560
I'm part of a biosphere.

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.560
So you open wide.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.560
I got... I'm birch.

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.560
And I'm here to say my

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560
bark is white, but I rule the day.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560
I...

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.560
I like golf and mayonnaise

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:58.560
and the analogy

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.560
should be clear today.

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.560
Yo, I don't kill

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:04.560
me.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.560
Ash. Calm down.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.560
You're being

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.560
belligerent.

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.560
And I will call security.

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.560
Oh.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.560
Okay.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.560
Thank you.

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.560
I'm sorry.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.560
You don't have to feel bad.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.560
You just got frightening.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.560
My name is Sam.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560
Gerald.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.560
Sam Ash?

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.560
Sam Ash.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.560
Do you have guitars next door?

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.560
Yes.

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.560
I didn't know that you were

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.560
actually a piece of wood.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.560
I thought you were a human being.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.560
I'm...

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.560
You don't know me.

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.560
You make great guitars, though.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.560
Thank you.

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.560
It must have been hard for you to say.

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.560
I have a lot of insecurities.

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:02.560
Are we still doing anything?

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.560
This got fucked up.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.560
I know when...

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.560
Yeah, that got fucked up.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.560
Let's bail on that.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.560
That didn't work.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.560
I thought I was going somewhere...

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.560
No, no, no.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.560
Nope.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.560
When you said it, the guy's name was Sam.

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.560
How subconsciously are you aware

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.560
that right across the street from our theater

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.560
is a Sam Ash guitarist?

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.560
I don't know. Who cares?

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.560
I care. That's fascinating.

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:32.560
There are wars. I don't know.

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.560
There, I did it again.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.560
What?

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.560
That's amazing. Do it again.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.560
Licorice whip.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.560
Glass tumbler.

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.560
One more.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.560
Sandy Nelson.

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.560
No, come on. That's horrible.

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.560
All right.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.560
Glass tumbler was great, though.

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.560
Thank you.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.560
You should rap battle Steve.

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.560
No.

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.560
Steve, do you ever listen to

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.560
Public Enemy or Flavor Flav?

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.560
He was kind of the hype man.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.560
He was kind of like,

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.560
Yeah! Yeah, boy!

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:14.560
We just kind of do that a lot.

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.560
I vaguely.

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.560
You know the concept of a hype man, right?

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.560
Yeah.

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.560
What could you be my hype man?

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.560
I'm asking you.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.560
All you have to do is just be...

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.560
You want a den to be happier.

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.560
Right.

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:32.560
You don't have to rhyme.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.560
You just have to come in and say,

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:36.560
Yeah, that's what he's saying.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.560
Did you hear him? I don't think you heard him right.

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.560
You just repeat him.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.560
There's more coming now.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.560
There's more coming next.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:46.560
If you hear a rhyme coming,

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.560
I fuck you in the foot and I fuck you in the mouth.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.560
I fuck you to the north and you can go south with him.

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.560
Don't worry about that. Don't let that distract you.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.560
So a lot of work.

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.560
I'll pay you extra.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.560
You don't need to pay me.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.560
I'm down for the adventure.

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.560
I think you pay him according to the amount of hype

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.560
he brings.

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.560
And you can also just say random things too,

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.560
but just affirm me.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560
The idea of a hype man is that

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.560
otherwise I'm just alone and it's like,

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.560
Oh, that guy's crazy.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.560
He's talking about the government being bad and it's like,

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.560
Wait, who's this other guy?

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.560
This other guy agrees with him and is saying,

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560
Wait, he has friends and he has hype.

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.560
I might come in with an R&B

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.560
like hook.

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.560
Oh, yeah.

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.560
Like a Rihanna.

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.560
So like a refrain.

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.560
Okay.

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.560
And then a Demorge.

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.560
What's a Demorge doing this?

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:42.560
Demorge is going to sit there and think about soccer.

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.560
What about Spencer?

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.560
Spencer?

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.560
I don't know.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.560
Spencer and or Demorge.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.560
Both of you guys,

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:54.560
if you feel the moment to kind of add in a

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.560
sample, like a

01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:58.560
ask not what your country can do.

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.560
Like if you want to throw in one of those

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.560
like kind of like quote sample kind of

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.560
things on top of the track.

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560
Okay.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.560
So this is called clusterfuck.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.560
All right.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560
You ready to go from top of your head or do you want?

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.560
Yeah, I don't think this is just this thing worked.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.560
I thought it was pretty bold to pick

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.560
two types of words.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.560
Well, and I was also, I got impressed.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.560
Oh, the birch is the white guy.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.560
But then I was like, wait, oh, Ash is,

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:26.560
oh, no, that's not good.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.560
And I got self-conscious.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.560
And then that started to feed back into me.

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.560
I was like, wait, do I have to mitigate how this guy's talking?

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.560
And I was like, I lost the character and everything went off the rails.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.560
I thought your character development was quite rich

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:38.560
in tapestry.

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.560
I felt very quickly racist and I just bailed.

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.560
Okay.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.560
All right.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.560
So we now bring you to close out our show.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.560
We've got Dan Harmon on the mic.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.560
All right.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.560
Steve Levy on Hype Man.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.560
All right.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.560
Oh, I forgot.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.560
Cassie on possible R&B hook.

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.560
Okay.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560
And Demorrage and Spencer on possible sample bits.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.560
All right.

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.560
Click your head.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.560
You guys are excited about this?

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.560
Okay, now, Steve.

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.560
Now, Steve, when this beat starts,

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560
Hype Man

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:16.560
and Women across the world,

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:18.560
when the beat starts, it's your job to get this,

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.560
to get hands and air and maybe

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.560
in a fashion that maybe they don't care

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.560
about their hands being in the air.

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.560
You can play.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.560
Okay.

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:30.560
I've been to a bar mitzvah.

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.560
Take it.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.560
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:38.560
He turns 13 today.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.560
You're a mayor.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.560
And

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.560
rap aficionado

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.560
Dan Harmon.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.560
In your face.

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.560
Save your applause for Armageddon.

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.560
I'm coming to your head and I'm not forgetting

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.560
what you all did to me 100 years ago.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.560
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:02.560
I made it snow.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.560
The flakes come out

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.560
and your dad's a wussy, but I don't mean that

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:08.560
in a homophobic way.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.560
I respect him, but he's also gay.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.560
But he joined in

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.560
and then we both went out for din din

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.560
and he's got good taste

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.560
and he's a good person.

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.560
Okay.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.560
Oh, yeah.

01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.560
Oh, yeah.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.560
This guy's the fucking best.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.560
Yeah. I love you.

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.560
Here's another thing about lasers in time.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:34.560
I fucked your mama with a squeeze of lime.

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.560
I put the orange juice in

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.560
and it tasted bad because too much

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.560
citrus shouldn't be combined like that.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.560
It'll give you the stomach ache.

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.560
Heartburn is gonna

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:46.560
make your heart break.

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.560
One heart doesn't burn.

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:50.560
A motherfucking heart will make you learn.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.560
I put your mama on a plate.

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.560
I brought your daddy in

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.560
and brought out a roller skate.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.560
I said, sit on that and roll that way.

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.560
And I fucked your mama because again

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:02.560
your dad's gay.

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.560
But he did a great job skating

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.560
and he's good and his demographic

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.560
is more patriotic

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:10.560
because he earns more money

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.560
and he's a good person.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.560
Yeah.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.560
Uh...

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.560
Yeah. It's so great.

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.560
You're fucking killing it.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.560
This guy.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.560
I'm a white guy.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.560
Uh...

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.560
Yeah.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:40.560
It's only a two-minute track so I have to keep doing that

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.560
when it goes to the end.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.560
You're...

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.560
Hello?

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:48.560
MC Godzilla.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.560
MC Godzilla's on the stage.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:52.560
Hello?

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.560
I'm a giant lizard from the bottom of the sea

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.560
and the Japanese have angered me.

01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:58.560
Watch out!

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.560
Up in the shores of Tokyo

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.560
and I'm breathing fire and you know how I go.

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:04.560
I got down on this building

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.560
and that army comes.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.560
I don't give a fuck.

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.560
I zap your tanks with the lasers

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.560
into my eye and then I say fucking thanks.

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:14.560
Go back to the ocean.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.560
Oh shit. It's a moth.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.560
Little Japanese ladies call it off.

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.560
Moth.

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.560
And I fucking such monster.

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.560
And cough.

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:26.560
Hype me.

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.560
Hype me.

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.560
I need hype.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.560
Hype me up.

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.560
Hype me. I need hype.

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.560
There is Godzilla.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:40.560
And it's all done.

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:42.560
He's doing the same thing.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.560
What?

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.560
No.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.560
You're doing so well.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.560
Thank you.

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.560
He's good.

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.560
Hype me up.

01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.560
Yeah!

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.560
It's done.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.560
Anger and fury.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.560
Wrapping so hard.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:04.560
Wrapping on the mic.

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:06.560
My glass shards coming out of my ass.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.560
Cutting your ass.

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:10.560
Cutting up your ass.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.560
Get a real pilot.

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.560
Give me a second.

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:16.560
He means well.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:18.560
He's not the traditional Hype man.

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:20.560
He's...

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.560
He's...

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.560
He's not an enabler.

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.560
He's...

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:28.560
He's enough of a Hype man to know

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.560
that sometimes the MC

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.560
needs guidance.

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:34.560
It's not...

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.560
It's not the most popular decision

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:38.560
he could make.

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.560
And now this horrible news

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:42.560
from Tokyo.

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.560
A large lizard-like creature

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.560
identified as Godzilla has approached

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.560
the city such as...

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.560
Here, spend your sample.

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.560
Read my lips.

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.560
No new...

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:56.560
No new...

01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:58.560
No new taxes.

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.560
Godzilla.

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.560
Go to the bank.

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:04.560
What you gonna find?

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.560
Got pennies in the vault.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.560
Put the rich man's out there.

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:10.560
R&B hook.

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:12.560
R&B hook from Cassie.

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.560
Godzilla.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.560
Oh yeah.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.560
And Godzilla fucked your mom

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.560
because your dad is super gay.

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.560
Godzilla.

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.560
Well,

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.560
it's all over here.

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:30.560
I'm gonna take it from here and put it over here.

01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:32.560
Robin Hood.

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.560
Yeah.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.560
Yeah, throw your hands off.

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.560
There's a point where Hype becomes

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.560
distracting.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.560
I was in the middle of a point.

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.560
It just started.

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:46.560
Starting over.

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:48.560
Well, it's over here.

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.560
You gotta take the money and put it over here.

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.560
Oh shit, Godzilla.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:54.560
Godzilla's coming.

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.560
It's terrible to have to work in this environment.

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.560
I understand.

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.560
There are some people that have podcasts

01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:02.560
where they're just one person in their living room.

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:04.560
Lively.

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.560
Duncan Trussell doesn't do this shit.

01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.560
And he makes money. His Amazon portal's like

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.560
Cha-ching.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.560
Oh, cha-ching.

01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:14.560
Is that a racist phrase?

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.560
Or is it a cash register sound?

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.560
You wouldn't be amazed if you look into this shit.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.560
When you Google it,

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:22.560
I fucked your mama so hard she got spaghetti for a tit.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.560
So why is your tit a doodle?

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.560
You don't want to talk about Google.

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:28.560
I said,

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.560
yo, yahoo and main, fuck you.

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.560
I was just trying to do the etymology of cha-ching.

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.560
She's like, where you going?

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.560
I said, I'm going to the store.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.560
She said, I'm gonna follow you then.

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.560
I gave it space and I went through it.

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.560
And I saw her tit and I was like,

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.560
oh, alright.

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.560
Oh, yeah.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.560
Final two minutes.

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.560
Final two minutes.

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.560
Final thoughts, final thoughts.

01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.560
You're about to get Swifty.

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:56.560
Alright.

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.560
Okay, alright.

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.560
Let's get Swifty.

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.560
Okay, alright, okay.

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.560
Swifty made a human skin.

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.560
Everybody has a soul within.

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.560
You got a big bright light when you go home.

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.560
Let's go snoop.

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.560
Sleep tight because your daddy's going to roam away.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.560
And we all don't have fathers,

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.560
but that shouldn't make a bother

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.560
because we're all brothers

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.560
and we know to stay together.

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.560
I fucked your mama so hard I made feathers fly out.

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.560
Over pillow ass pussy.

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.560
Sorry.

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:28.560
Sorry.

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.560
It's not the time for that.

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.560
Women and people got to respect that.

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.560
They got to raise the children for us.

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.560
I'm Snoopy-D-Doop, but doopie-doopie-doop.

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.560
I'm driving on the Snoopy-Doop bus

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.560
gonna pick up passengers

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.560
and we're all us.

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.560
Gonna take you to the stop, take you to your school.

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.560
I've got the Snoopy-Doopie-Doop bus.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.560
I've got the Snoopy-Doop bus.

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.560
I've got every Snoopy-Doop bus

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.560
and I'm here to say,

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.560
I like to drive the Snoopy-Doop bus.

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.560
I've got the Snoopy-Doop bus.

01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.560
I've got the Snoopy-Doop bus.

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.560
Diarrhea!

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.560
Snoop, Snoop, a Snoopy-Doop.

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.560
Final thoughts.

01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.560
We're all people inside.

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:08.560
Open up your soul and open it wide.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:10.560
I'm gonna put my education in there.

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.560
I'm gonna fuck your mama so hard

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.560
she's into the air.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.560
My dick sprung and she flew up

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.560
like NASA.

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.560
Sup.

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.560
20 seconds.

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:26.560
Space.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.560
Exploration.

01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.560
Why'd we stop spending money on all that?

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.560
Let's get on

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.560
to the Snoopy-Doop bus.

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.560
10 seconds.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.560
10 seconds.

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.560
Don't privatize space.

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.560
Are you fucking crazy?

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.560
These people are gonna make McDonald's on the moon.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.560
Now we move to Julian.

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.560
Thank you for coming to Harmon's Town, everybody.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:53.560
Thank you for boarding the Snoopy-Doop bus for the night.

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.560
Let's hear it for Kathy, everyone.

01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:57.560
Kathy.

01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:59.560
The underutilized that love the Kathy.

01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:01.560
DeMorge Brown.

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.560
Steve Levy, the hype man.

02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:09.560
Stevie Fleve.

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:11.560
Chris O'Crypton.

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.560
Also the guy, Zac McKeever.

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.560
This is Marshall Kris Boruff.

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.560
Everybody else back here helping us melt down.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.560
Thomas Middleditch.

02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.560
Oh!

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.560
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:27.560
One more time for your mayor and MC, Mr. Dan Harmon.

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.560
Snoopy-Doop.

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.560
Snoopy-Doop.

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.560
Snoopy-Doop.

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.560
Now we go to a news report from Winnettka, Illinois,

02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.560
where the Snoopy-Doop bus

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.560
has wrecked at the side of the freeway

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.560
and is spitting fire at this very moment.

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.560
Thanks, guys.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:53.560
Very fast, take chances.

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.560
Did you get any of that?

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:19.560
It's a good show.
