{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.880\nMusic\n\n00:11.880 --> 00:35.200\nHello, ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, from beautiful uptown Burbank, Carpentown\n\n00:35.200 --> 00:36.200\nis now in session.\n\n00:36.200 --> 00:40.960\nLet's welcome to the stage the Game Master extraordinaire, the man with all the hair,\n\n00:40.960 --> 00:44.800\nthe guy who's right over there, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:44.800 --> 00:57.800\nWhat up, Spencer, and the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:57.800 --> 01:03.560\nWrapping north, wrapping west, wrapping on your titties, wrapping on your chest, wrapping\n\n01:03.560 --> 01:08.800\non your hat, wrapping on your gloves, wrapping with your mama, she's the woman I love, she's\n\n01:08.800 --> 01:15.920\nmy one lady for life, I love her like a spoon, loves a knife, all the same ass rhymes when\n\n01:15.920 --> 01:21.480\nI do my freestyle because I've been rapping for a long, too long a while, all my rhymes\n\n01:21.480 --> 01:29.600\nare written down, I got them in my pocket, okay, yeah, this is where I just want to wrap\n\n01:29.600 --> 01:32.320\nat the top of the show just to get the pump primed.\n\n01:32.320 --> 01:45.600\nJust hit that beat again, all right, so, all right, here's the top of the show, all right,\n\n01:45.600 --> 01:52.160\nso you've watched nature shows about bees, you've heard about bees, here's this, here's\n\n01:52.160 --> 01:58.600\nthis rule you've heard, killer bees, regular bees that you've agitated, whatever, you know,\n\n01:58.600 --> 02:03.680\nyou see the list of things to do and don't, bees are attacking you, don't do this, what's\n\n02:03.680 --> 02:11.160\nthe thing, you know, you know where I'm going, because it's the weird bee rule that intrigues.\n\n02:11.160 --> 02:14.520\nWe all know this, you know it.\n\n02:14.520 --> 02:18.680\nIf bees are chasing you, don't jump in water.\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:20.320\nDon't jump in water.\n\n02:20.320 --> 02:25.200\nDon't do it, don't, don't, absolutely under no circumstances, if a swarm of killer bees\n\n02:25.200 --> 02:30.040\nare chasing you, and you happen to be near a nice pool of water.\n\n02:30.040 --> 02:35.440\nDon't jump into it, because, and then you go, oh really, why, so that's like that rule\n\n02:35.440 --> 02:39.680\nlike where you're, if you're dying of thirst in the ocean and like even though you're surrounded\n\n02:39.680 --> 02:45.440\nby saltwater, don't drink the water, which then you find out why, oh, it's saltwater,\n\n02:45.440 --> 02:49.760\nyou will dehydrate yourself even faster than if you just don't drink water.\n\n02:49.760 --> 02:55.040\nThis rule's a little different though, because you go, oh, why, why, why, why, with the bees?\n\n02:55.040 --> 03:04.560\nWell, because they could, and they always use this phrase, they could be waiting for\n\n03:04.560 --> 03:09.880\nyou when you come up, because they can detect the carbon dioxide coming out of your mouth,\n\n03:09.880 --> 03:14.040\nthat's why they say, when you're running away from bees that are trying to kill you, do\n\n03:14.040 --> 03:20.080\nzigzag, wrap your head in a shirt, cover your head, for God's sakes, cover your head, cover\n\n03:20.080 --> 03:25.200\nyour mouth and your nose, they can track you by the carbon dioxide you're emitting.\n\n03:25.200 --> 03:32.960\nDo not, under any circumstances, jump into water, because what, it magnifies your carbon\n\n03:32.960 --> 03:33.960\ndioxide emissions?\n\n03:33.960 --> 03:39.800\nNo, they might be waiting for it when you come back up, but motherfucker, I'm also covering\n\n03:39.800 --> 03:47.800\nmy whole body with water and like what the fuck, like say it this way, from now on, I'm\n\n03:47.800 --> 03:48.800\nsick of these.\n\n03:48.800 --> 03:50.680\nWho are you targeting with this statement?\n\n03:50.680 --> 03:57.920\nEvery bee, every bee show, every bee article, Google bee attack, every bee article, Google\n\n03:57.920 --> 04:04.120\nevery fucking bee, Google bee attack, you're on notice every bee article, anybody that\n\n04:04.120 --> 04:08.960\nhas ever written or has ever gone to what, how should they phrase it, about bee attacks\n\n04:08.960 --> 04:14.040\nand how to survive them, from now on, before you copy and paste, because I know that's\n\n04:14.040 --> 04:22.760\nwhat you're doing, don't jump into water, just, just, just, just amend it to this.\n\n04:22.760 --> 04:33.680\nIf it's a choice between water and your house, go in your house, right, you'll be safer there.\n\n04:33.680 --> 04:34.680\nIn the house.\n\n04:34.680 --> 04:35.680\nThan in the water.\n\n04:35.680 --> 04:41.040\nIf you're in a fucking desert and you're running from god damn killer bees, and there's\n\n04:41.040 --> 04:46.400\nof some water, okay, jump the fuck in it.\n\n04:46.400 --> 04:47.520\nIt's there for you.\n\n04:47.520 --> 04:52.400\nI got, you know, you want to hear, I have some coyote tips, you want to hear my bee tips.\n\n04:52.400 --> 04:54.520\nWhat are your bee tips?\n\n04:54.520 --> 04:56.720\nYou're covering your head with your shirt, right?\n\n04:56.720 --> 04:57.720\nUh huh.\n\n04:57.720 --> 05:03.760\nBecause you're supposed to jump in the water, keep the shirt over your head, poke your head\n\n05:03.760 --> 05:08.760\nout of the water covered by the now wet shirt, you got a bubble of air in there.\n\n05:08.760 --> 05:09.920\nI mean, there's a million ways to use that.\n\n05:09.920 --> 05:16.640\nThere's a million ways to use water to avoid a bee attack, and everyone's so fucking taken\n\n05:16.640 --> 05:22.280\nwith their observation that the bees could be waiting for you when you come out.\n\n05:22.280 --> 05:24.480\nI don't care if they could be waiting for me.\n\n05:24.480 --> 05:28.640\nAlso, anytime you're ever escaping anything, the thing you're escaping could be waiting\n\n05:28.640 --> 05:29.640\nfor you at some point.\n\n05:29.640 --> 05:35.040\nIt's even, they even say could be, which means, I'm going to say, a lot of times not, I'm\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:39.040\ngoing to say a lot of times if you jump into water, killer bees are like, ah, fuck it.\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:43.960\nWhat are we going to play the track is carbon dioxide sting his nose every three minutes\n\n05:43.960 --> 05:48.960\ngame until he slowly dies over six months?\n\n05:48.960 --> 05:52.880\nIt would be scary to have like one of those cartoon reeds that you use to breathe when\n\n05:52.880 --> 05:55.040\nyou're hiding in a pond.\n\n05:55.040 --> 05:57.360\nAnd then the bees all pour into that, you know.\n\n05:57.360 --> 06:00.960\nI'm pretty sure that was like a Tom and Jerry cartoon.\n\n06:00.960 --> 06:01.960\nThat's scary.\n\n06:01.960 --> 06:07.920\nI want to see the article about the guy who was in a killer bee attack and ran and jumped\n\n06:07.920 --> 06:10.360\nin the water.\n\n06:10.360 --> 06:16.480\nAnd because he jumped in the water, not in spite of jumping in the water, because he jumped\n\n06:16.480 --> 06:18.240\nin the water, he died.\n\n06:18.240 --> 06:19.240\nHe got lost.\n\n06:19.240 --> 06:22.400\nIf you're in the water and you're underwater and all you're emitting is bubbles, it's going\n\n06:22.400 --> 06:24.000\nto be mostly carbon dioxide.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.000\nThey're going to go.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.360\nOh, this guy, there's a carbon dioxide fountain right here.\n\n06:27.360 --> 06:28.360\nHey, great.\n\n06:28.360 --> 06:29.360\nGuys right here.\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:33.800\nSo, so don't go into the water if there's a house closer, right?\n\n06:33.800 --> 06:34.800\nDon't go.\n\n06:34.800 --> 06:35.800\nGod damn it.\n\n06:35.800 --> 06:36.800\nOh, look at that house.\n\n06:36.800 --> 06:37.800\nIt's a bee proof house.\n\n06:37.800 --> 06:39.680\nOh, I see some water up there.\n\n06:39.680 --> 06:41.400\nWhat a better idea than the house.\n\n06:41.400 --> 06:43.640\nSo don't do that.\n\n06:43.640 --> 06:45.440\nThat's a way different rule.\n\n06:45.440 --> 06:47.320\nYou're going to kill somebody with that rule.\n\n06:47.320 --> 06:48.520\nDon't jump in the water.\n\n06:48.520 --> 06:49.720\nWhat if that's all there is?\n\n06:49.720 --> 06:50.720\nI just can't think.\n\n06:50.720 --> 06:55.480\nI mean, look, I love honey as much as the next person.\n\n06:55.480 --> 07:00.880\nAnd if I go getting in that honeycomb and I agitate the bees and they're coming after\n\n07:00.880 --> 07:03.880\nme, that's already a rarefied situation.\n\n07:03.880 --> 07:04.880\nThat's not a usual.\n\n07:04.880 --> 07:05.880\nWhat we're talking about now.\n\n07:05.880 --> 07:06.880\nWhat we're talking about.\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:11.240\nThere's a house and a pond like that's like, well, how often am I around just standing\n\n07:11.240 --> 07:12.240\nwater anyway?\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:13.240\nOr a house in a pool.\n\n07:13.240 --> 07:14.240\nBut no, we're talking.\n\n07:14.240 --> 07:20.600\nLook, we're talking about like you're cleaning out your tool shed and you move a sled.\n\n07:20.600 --> 07:25.440\nAnd there was a bee's nest in the wall and they start, they're Africanized.\n\n07:25.440 --> 07:28.920\nSo they start going like this fuckers trying to take our honey.\n\n07:28.920 --> 07:29.920\nGet them.\n\n07:29.920 --> 07:30.920\nAnd you're like, what?\n\n07:30.920 --> 07:31.920\nI didn't try shit.\n\n07:31.920 --> 07:32.920\nJust moving a sled, bitches.\n\n07:32.920 --> 07:34.280\nAnd then you're like running.\n\n07:34.280 --> 07:40.760\nLike, like if your pool is closer than your house by five feet, okay, head for the house.\n\n07:40.760 --> 07:43.320\nTake a couple more stings for the team.\n\n07:43.320 --> 07:44.720\nFor your kids.\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:45.720\nLive to tell the tale.\n\n07:45.720 --> 07:54.880\nWith your coyote, like punch kick maneuver, let's say that you didn't have house or water\n\n07:54.880 --> 07:59.240\nresources available to you, a bunch of bees are on your ass.\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:04.000\nWhat would your like instinctive game master technique be to thwart them?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.160\nAnd I don't know.\n\n08:06.160 --> 08:10.440\nI think that we're talking about the wrong problem and we really got to be addressing\n\n08:10.440 --> 08:11.800\nbeyond bee crime.\n\n08:11.800 --> 08:15.960\nWell, you know, you know, they work with those queens.\n\n08:15.960 --> 08:21.640\nIf the queen dies, then they start feeding the regular larva, royal jelly.\n\n08:21.640 --> 08:24.760\nBut they don't just, they don't just make for one queen.\n\n08:24.760 --> 08:26.720\nThey do a whole selection, a whole row.\n\n08:26.720 --> 08:33.120\nAnd then the first one to hatch, she goes and stings all the other queens to death in\n\n08:33.120 --> 08:35.120\ntheir cradle.\n\n08:35.120 --> 08:36.920\nBut here's the thing.\n\n08:36.920 --> 08:44.280\nI stayed at a hotel this week that boasted an apiary 120,000 bees and four queens.\n\n08:44.280 --> 08:47.320\nI was like, geez, how did they have such can they have such control over how many queens\n\n08:47.320 --> 08:48.320\nthere are?\n\n08:48.320 --> 08:49.320\nReally?\n\n08:49.320 --> 08:50.320\nI didn't know that was such a mathematical thing.\n\n08:50.320 --> 08:57.600\nThey're like, our, our beehives have four queens and 120,000 bees come taste our honey.\n\n08:57.600 --> 08:58.800\nAnd then I started looking it up.\n\n08:58.800 --> 08:59.800\nI'm like, really?\n\n08:59.800 --> 09:00.800\nThey have that much control.\n\n09:00.800 --> 09:10.080\nThe whole science of a biology or whatever is, it is, the, the be the queens will live\n\n09:10.080 --> 09:15.040\nlike five to seven years, but the older ones, they're not as productive.\n\n09:15.040 --> 09:19.120\nSo a beekeeper, we think they're so cool, they're just like gathering honey.\n\n09:19.120 --> 09:22.200\nThese fuckers are like the CIA in the fifties.\n\n09:22.200 --> 09:24.680\nThey're like, they're, they're like dipping and dapping in the government.\n\n09:24.680 --> 09:31.120\nLike they, they just, they'll, they'll reach in or the, they'll wound the queen because\n\n09:31.120 --> 09:37.520\nif the queen becomes wounded, then the bees will produce more queens that are more vibrant.\n\n09:37.520 --> 09:40.880\nBut typically what they'll do also is they don't even trust cause new queens are just\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:42.280\nas shitty as old queens.\n\n09:42.280 --> 09:47.120\nSo they'll like trade and buy queens and just import them and just kill the queen and then\n\n09:47.120 --> 09:51.920\ndrop a new one in there and be like, there's your new queen and the bees will be like fine\n\n09:51.920 --> 09:53.800\nwith us cause we're fucking morons.\n\n09:53.800 --> 09:57.680\nIt's like Sim City.\n\n09:57.680 --> 10:02.680\nYou know what's weird about bees is they're like flying ants basically, whose avapositors\n\n10:02.680 --> 10:10.880\nhave been adapted into stingers, but they, they don't do that pheromone thing, the ants\n\n10:10.880 --> 10:11.880\nhave the pheromone trail.\n\n10:11.880 --> 10:12.880\nOh, they don't smell.\n\n10:12.880 --> 10:17.280\nWell, honey bees, you know, they, they come back to the hive, you've seen the documentaries\n\n10:17.280 --> 10:22.920\nwhere they do the little dance, they do the little, the little clockwork, like they have\n\n10:22.920 --> 10:27.400\nan elaborate geometric code that like indicates coordinates.\n\n10:27.400 --> 10:28.400\nYeah.\n\n10:28.400 --> 10:29.600\nThat's fun.\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:30.600\nIt's crazy.\n\n10:30.600 --> 10:34.720\nI mean, thinking about the ways other animals communicate with each other is always this\n\n10:34.720 --> 10:39.040\nmind blowing thing to me because it's like, you know, even if it's, if it's very simplistic\n\n10:39.040 --> 10:42.560\nand basic, it's very crazy, but it's probably not simplistic and basic.\n\n10:42.560 --> 10:46.440\nIt's probably just impossible to truly comprehend on a meaningful level.\n\n10:46.440 --> 10:50.200\nIt's pretty crazy that they, yeah, they communicate with each other, but it doesn't, all it means\n\n10:50.200 --> 10:54.520\nis like, go get some pollen, like, like all their whole language is just for nothing.\n\n10:54.520 --> 10:57.160\nIf anybody was looking down at us, they'd be like, yeah, look at all this shit.\n\n10:57.160 --> 10:58.160\nThey're bullshit.\n\n10:58.160 --> 10:59.160\nYeah.\n\n10:59.160 --> 11:00.160\nThey love all these memes.\n\n11:00.160 --> 11:01.160\nThey talk in memes.\n\n11:01.160 --> 11:05.560\nBut all they're, all they're doing is like moving the oil from here and then trying to\n\n11:05.560 --> 11:09.160\nget to Mars, but they can't cars are probably some weird thing.\n\n11:09.160 --> 11:13.520\nLike from an outside perspective, it's like they have all this car stuff that's going\n\n11:13.520 --> 11:16.240\nall over the place and they get in and out of cars all the time.\n\n11:16.240 --> 11:20.100\nI'll tell you what bees haven't done aside from pollinating all of our flowers and\n\n11:20.100 --> 11:25.960\ngiving us walnuts and, you know, all of the food that we, they've never sent a car into\n\n11:25.960 --> 11:26.960\nspace.\n\n11:26.960 --> 11:27.960\nNo.\n\n11:27.960 --> 11:34.840\nAnd by the way, I dare, I challenge you bees to send a car into space and show us what\n\n11:34.840 --> 11:35.840\nyou got.\n\n11:35.840 --> 11:40.600\nI can't wait, like, if this was a cartoon, if our life was a cartoon, like the cutaway\n\n11:40.600 --> 11:47.000\ngag would be like, like Star Trek Enterprises there and then they're like having a scene\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.600\nand then the Tesla comes and just smashes into the enterprise and kills everybody.\n\n11:51.600 --> 11:52.600\nLike that's going to happen.\n\n11:52.600 --> 11:56.640\nLike I can't wait until our future society is like taken out by that Tesla because we\n\n11:56.640 --> 12:00.520\ndidn't think about the ramifications of just shooting something off into space.\n\n12:00.520 --> 12:01.520\nSo dumb.\n\n12:01.520 --> 12:05.760\nThey say that space junk is going to destroy all chance of exiting the planet.\n\n12:05.760 --> 12:08.920\nAren't the Chinese working on some laser to go blow up all the space junk?\n\n12:08.920 --> 12:09.920\nGod, I hope so.\n\n12:09.920 --> 12:14.240\nThere's so much space junk that we have all these astrophysicists that are like watching\n\n12:14.240 --> 12:18.520\nthe space junk to make sure we can launch stuff into space without it hitting space junk.\n\n12:18.520 --> 12:23.920\nBecause if we get hit by space junk, it'll all make a chain reaction and cause an impenetrable\n\n12:23.920 --> 12:27.160\nweb of space junk that renders our skies unleavable.\n\n12:27.160 --> 12:31.160\nYou know what Elon Musk should have done is maybe, maybe he did.\n\n12:31.160 --> 12:32.160\nMaybe he did.\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:36.960\nMaybe he sent a car into space so he could put all that space junk in the trunk.\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:37.960\nRight.\n\n12:37.960 --> 12:42.600\nAs this Elon Musk shooting a car into space in a country with a completely bankrupt space\n\n12:42.600 --> 12:48.000\nprogram that isn't doing shit in a world that has a shelf life on it of like 20 to 30 years\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.160\nmax.\n\n12:50.160 --> 12:57.120\nThe one guy who has a 30 year plan is like, I'd like to colonize Mars within the time\n\n12:57.120 --> 12:59.040\nthat it's going to take for us to eat through the planet.\n\n12:59.040 --> 13:01.520\nLike, hey, you can shoot whatever he wants out of space.\n\n13:01.520 --> 13:06.440\nLike, like, like, it's not somebody like easy target, like fucking things like all my friends\n\n13:06.440 --> 13:12.320\nlike, like rolling their eyes and like, I guess he doesn't care about starving children.\n\n13:12.320 --> 13:13.520\nWhat the, what in the fuck?\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:18.080\nYou know how many people are going to starve if we don't get the fuck off this whole planet?\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:20.560\nLike the guy is like, what is he like?\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:25.200\nGo pick up Philip Morris, Jesus Christ, the guy is just a cool rich guy, like flinging\n\n13:25.200 --> 13:26.200\nshit into space.\n\n13:26.200 --> 13:29.400\nIt's like, how the shit else is anything going to get done around here?\n\n13:29.400 --> 13:30.960\nYou got to throw cars out there.\n\n13:30.960 --> 13:33.760\nI don't know about, you know, he made those flamethrowers.\n\n13:33.760 --> 13:34.760\nI don't know.\n\n13:34.760 --> 13:36.680\nThat seems kind of, what are you trying to pull?\n\n13:36.680 --> 13:37.680\nWhy are you making flamethrowers?\n\n13:37.680 --> 13:41.560\nI think it's Joe because he's a Bond villain and that he like, I don't know.\n\n13:41.560 --> 13:45.800\nYeah, but if your joke is that, and then you start like producing C4 explosives for fun\n\n13:45.800 --> 13:48.840\nand profit, like, I mean, aren't you just doing that?\n\n13:48.840 --> 13:52.840\nI don't think that he's in the, in the sense that maybe we are, I don't think that he's\n\n13:52.840 --> 13:56.680\nan out and out, like liberal, I don't think that he thinks that everything needs to be\n\n13:56.680 --> 13:59.400\nregulated and, and maybe sat and stuff.\n\n13:59.400 --> 14:01.160\nYou might be something closer to a libertarian.\n\n14:01.160 --> 14:06.000\nWe probably have political differences in the, in, in that regard, but the same kind\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:11.760\nof hubris, is it like he gets shit done and he doesn't start a go fund me to say like,\n\n14:11.760 --> 14:15.760\nHey, if we all put our hands together, maybe we can pray and get into space and like, but\n\n14:15.760 --> 14:17.520\nit's like, he just does crazy shit.\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:21.240\nIt's like, well, I'll just make baseball hats and I'll fund an entire fucking piece\n\n14:21.240 --> 14:22.240\nof space equipment.\n\n14:22.240 --> 14:23.680\nAnd it's like, people buy it.\n\n14:23.680 --> 14:28.720\nLike there's like, he, to me, he represents the interesting aspect of like, like, like\n\n14:28.720 --> 14:33.760\nwhen we talk about capitalism's evils, we're really talking about unimaginative pieces\n\n14:33.760 --> 14:35.280\nof shit who are cheating.\n\n14:35.280 --> 14:36.800\nThey're not actually capitalists.\n\n14:36.800 --> 14:39.200\nThey're thieves because they're not interested in competing.\n\n14:39.200 --> 14:45.160\nThey're not interested in, um, uh, uh, you know, like actual, um, stirring of the economy.\n\n14:45.160 --> 14:49.840\nThey want to like miser their money and like use it to just like make more money and they're\n\n14:49.840 --> 14:51.720\nlike, not even actually playing the game.\n\n14:51.720 --> 14:52.720\nRight.\n\n14:52.720 --> 14:55.800\nAnd people who are like, Hey, you know, people are greedy.\n\n14:55.800 --> 14:57.440\nPeople don't want to donate stuff.\n\n14:57.440 --> 14:58.720\nPeople don't want to pitch in.\n\n14:58.720 --> 15:03.320\nSo maybe if I said, look at this fucking cool thing, would you give me a dollar and then\n\n15:03.320 --> 15:07.040\neveryone wants to be cool and gives me a dollar and it raises all this money that couldn't\n\n15:07.040 --> 15:10.360\notherwise be raised by Sally Struthers crying into a camera.\n\n15:10.360 --> 15:14.800\nAnd we use it to then try to further the species before it goes extinct.\n\n15:14.800 --> 15:19.280\nLike like I have some, what like Hail Mary or something like the guy does have plans.\n\n15:19.280 --> 15:21.040\nNo one else has a fucking plan.\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:27.080\nLike, like, like the closest guy, the second place plan to his is, I don't know, some guy\n\n15:27.080 --> 15:29.720\nwe had on our show that wants college to be more affordable.\n\n15:29.720 --> 15:33.600\nAnd then the third after that is a fucking Nazi that wants to build a wall.\n\n15:33.600 --> 15:35.080\nWho's that?\n\n15:35.080 --> 15:37.360\nI ain't got no plan.\n\n15:37.360 --> 15:38.360\nCharles Fleischer.\n\n15:38.360 --> 15:42.240\nYeah, we'll have him on as a guest to defend his wall.\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:44.240\nBut I don't know.\n\n15:44.240 --> 15:51.120\nHis theory is that if you build a wall around Charles Fleischer, it'll help, it'll amplify\n\n15:51.120 --> 15:53.120\nhis voice.\n\n15:53.120 --> 15:55.120\nAll right.\n\n15:55.120 --> 15:56.120\nThere was it.\n\n15:56.120 --> 15:57.120\nAll right.\n\n15:57.120 --> 15:58.120\nWell, let's bring up Rob Schrab.\n\n15:58.120 --> 16:05.120\nRob Schrab at the stage, everybody.\n\n16:05.120 --> 16:06.120\nYo.\n\n16:06.120 --> 16:21.200\nNow down to worship the man that you don't deserve, Rob Chippy Pippy Schrab.\n\n16:21.200 --> 16:23.200\nHello, everyone.\n\n16:23.200 --> 16:25.200\nHello, Jeffrey.\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:27.200\nWhat's up, Rob?\n\n16:27.200 --> 16:34.200\nIs it true that somebody changed your Wikipedia page to Rob Chippy Pippy Schrab?\n\n16:34.200 --> 16:37.000\nBecause I saw a little something.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nWas it you?\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.240\nNo, but I didn't know if that was a photo.\n\n16:39.240 --> 16:40.240\nBe honest.\n\n16:40.240 --> 16:41.240\nIt was not me.\n\n16:41.240 --> 16:42.240\nI swear to God.\n\n16:42.240 --> 16:43.240\nWould you know how to do it?\n\n16:43.240 --> 16:47.520\nI mean, I could probably Photoshop it if you gave me an afternoon, but that was either\n\n16:47.520 --> 16:49.800\na bit that somebody was doing?\n\n16:49.800 --> 16:51.560\nI'm pretty sure it's a bit.\n\n16:51.560 --> 16:52.560\nYeah.\n\n16:52.560 --> 16:53.560\nI don't think that's my name.\n\n16:53.560 --> 16:55.720\nYou don't think someone actually thought they were correcting the record?\n\n16:55.720 --> 17:02.480\nBecause I don't really know how the vicissitudes of Wikipedia work, because my Wikipedia page\n\n17:02.480 --> 17:05.240\nis hilariously inaccurate.\n\n17:05.240 --> 17:09.960\nSo maybe someone could just go on and change your, give you a nickname on it.\n\n17:09.960 --> 17:10.960\nYeah.\n\n17:10.960 --> 17:11.960\nYeah.\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:12.960\nYeah.\n\n17:12.960 --> 17:16.000\nBut in the, I mean, look, I don't want to start rehash the argument, but it did.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.600\nIt seemed conclusive that Rob's a Chippy Pippy, like from that story, like it wasn't,\n\n17:20.600 --> 17:21.600\nhe got mad about it.\n\n17:21.600 --> 17:22.600\nYeah.\n\n17:22.600 --> 17:23.600\nI mean, think about it.\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:24.600\nHe wanted to try dance.\n\n17:24.600 --> 17:25.600\nTry Pat.\n\n17:25.600 --> 17:26.600\nYeah.\n\n17:26.600 --> 17:27.600\nJust think about it.\n\n17:27.600 --> 17:30.400\nI mean, if you put it under the microscope, I think that it's really, really the only\n\n17:30.400 --> 17:35.600\nthing you can conclude from that, will you fucking turn your phone on mute?\n\n17:35.600 --> 17:36.600\nThat was my fault.\n\n17:36.600 --> 17:37.600\nI was texting Steve.\n\n17:37.600 --> 17:38.600\nAll right.\n\n17:38.600 --> 17:39.600\nWait.\n\n17:39.600 --> 17:40.600\nOkay.\n\n17:40.600 --> 17:41.600\nLook, anybody else would do that.\n\n17:41.600 --> 17:42.600\nHe would hit the roof.\n\n17:42.600 --> 17:46.000\nHe'd be like, hey, I'm trying to talk.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nI run a tight show.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nI'm trying to talk.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nYeah.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nYeah.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nHe just texts.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nTurn your kill and your mentions off.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nFuck, dude.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\nI'm trying to.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nI'm trying to.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nOh, careful.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nI'm trying to.\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nNothing but order around here.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\nI'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.000\nI'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nI'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nWhy do you make flame throwers?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nI'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nIt's a bond villain joke.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nI want to talk about a bond villain.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nBut he really did it, though.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:16.000\nWhat do you think people are going to do with those flame throwers?\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nClear brush?\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.760\nThey're going to hang them on the wall and say, I got one of 20,000 flame throwers\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:24.360\nthat I think it's cool that that the fucking historical dude made.\n\n18:24.360 --> 18:28.360\nI think he's cool that he's making space travel interesting again.\n\n18:28.360 --> 18:33.320\nI mean, we used to be so excited about it and in those and then we all got bored by\n\n18:33.320 --> 18:34.320\nit.\n\n18:34.320 --> 18:35.320\nYeah.\n\n18:35.320 --> 18:36.320\nAnd we're all like, fuck this.\n\n18:36.320 --> 18:37.320\nThis is too.\n\n18:37.320 --> 18:41.680\nAnd then everybody's going, yay, we're doing something futuristic again.\n\n18:41.680 --> 18:45.160\nIt's amazing that the Falcon Heavy is an amazing piece of equipment.\n\n18:45.160 --> 18:46.160\nI love it.\n\n18:46.160 --> 18:47.560\nYou would have done it different.\n\n18:47.560 --> 18:51.880\nI would have been scared up watching it because it's so magnificent.\n\n18:51.880 --> 18:53.560\nAnd then just the red convertible.\n\n18:53.560 --> 18:56.960\nIt's like it's just like you couldn't have picked a more midlife crisis thing to put\n\n18:56.960 --> 18:57.960\nin space.\n\n18:57.960 --> 18:59.560\nWell, he's going through his midlife crisis.\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:00.560\nThank God.\n\n19:00.560 --> 19:01.560\nYeah, good.\n\n19:01.560 --> 19:02.560\nBut say that.\n\n19:02.560 --> 19:04.240\nBut he's like, oh, he kind of laughed it off.\n\n19:04.240 --> 19:05.240\nHe grew up.\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:09.480\nHe saw heavy metal as a kid and went, I want to do that.\n\n19:09.480 --> 19:10.480\nAnd he does this.\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:11.480\nYeah.\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:15.120\nAnd it's like, it's like, imagine all the kids going like, look, I didn't know you\n\n19:15.120 --> 19:16.800\ncould just fucking do anything.\n\n19:16.800 --> 19:19.640\nWell, like, like, like, I didn't know space for me.\n\n19:19.640 --> 19:22.760\nThe space shuttle was like that because it didn't look like a dumb ass rocket.\n\n19:22.760 --> 19:24.760\nLike, like it all of a sudden had wings.\n\n19:24.760 --> 19:26.480\nSo remember them.\n\n19:26.480 --> 19:29.880\nThey would just be like these dumb ass rockets, man.\n\n19:29.880 --> 19:30.880\nYeah.\n\n19:30.880 --> 19:31.880\nRemember that?\n\n19:31.880 --> 19:32.880\nYou.\n\n19:32.880 --> 19:33.880\nUSA.\n\n19:33.880 --> 19:36.240\nI think the player will come from here.\n\n19:36.240 --> 19:39.240\nDon't you agree with me?\n\n19:39.240 --> 19:40.240\nFuck those things.\n\n19:40.240 --> 19:41.240\nFuck you.\n\n19:41.240 --> 19:42.240\nThey look like missiles.\n\n19:42.240 --> 19:46.040\nNo, the Saturn five is the greatest thing that humans have ever built.\n\n19:46.040 --> 19:48.120\nIt looks like a fucking missile.\n\n19:48.120 --> 19:49.120\nAnd you know it.\n\n19:49.120 --> 19:51.600\nIt looked like a fucking dumb, like, God damn.\n\n19:51.600 --> 19:54.040\nIt's not a big old dick.\n\n19:54.040 --> 19:58.680\nBecause there wasn't a Tesla inside it and there wasn't a pool.\n\n19:58.680 --> 19:59.680\nWhat do you want?\n\n19:59.680 --> 20:05.440\nYou wanted a suit to come out of the I wanted a big bucket of Viagra to pour out of it.\n\n20:05.440 --> 20:11.760\nAnd just fucking just like what what says midlife crisis erectile dysfunction more than\n\n20:11.760 --> 20:14.680\nsending your your hotshot convertible.\n\n20:14.680 --> 20:17.480\nI know and yes, and he had the fucking belly playing.\n\n20:17.480 --> 20:19.200\nI know it made people like space more.\n\n20:19.200 --> 20:23.320\nBut if you had to make you like space, remember to the space.\n\n20:23.320 --> 20:26.360\nSo it would have been better if you did not space, huh?\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:27.600\nIt would have been better if he did nothing.\n\n20:27.600 --> 20:28.760\nI would have.\n\n20:28.760 --> 20:31.880\nI would have liked to have been in the conversation and was throwing a couple of ideas.\n\n20:31.880 --> 20:32.880\nYeah.\n\n20:32.880 --> 20:33.880\nJeff in the decision.\n\n20:33.880 --> 20:34.880\nWell, he might.\n\n20:34.880 --> 20:35.880\nHe might.\n\n20:35.880 --> 20:39.080\nYou know, we're we're more within reach of getting him on this podcast than any podcast\n\n20:39.080 --> 20:40.160\nI could ever name.\n\n20:40.160 --> 20:41.160\nYou hear me, Marin?\n\n20:41.160 --> 20:44.640\nAnd now again, we're blowing it.\n\n20:44.640 --> 20:45.800\nWe're blowing it.\n\n20:45.800 --> 20:50.520\nI would say again, I would have sent a instead of the concrete block that they used to simulate\n\n20:50.520 --> 20:52.720\nmass for the for the for the payload.\n\n20:52.720 --> 21:02.280\nI would have sent an enormous cuff link, because I think that sends them just one, just one\n\n21:02.280 --> 21:08.400\nbecause the implication is we're not ready yet, folks or if if there is intelligent life\n\n21:08.400 --> 21:12.560\nout there and they see one giant cuff link out there, they're going to go, oh, the snake\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:13.560\nmonster.\n\n21:13.560 --> 21:15.240\nThey're asking us to make contact.\n\n21:15.240 --> 21:17.040\nOh, we're going to link up.\n\n21:17.040 --> 21:18.040\nWhat?\n\n21:18.040 --> 21:20.440\nI mean, he's got like the world is watching.\n\n21:20.440 --> 21:21.800\nHe could have done anything.\n\n21:21.800 --> 21:26.680\nHe could have opened up the nose going opened up, and it would have been like just a big\n\n21:26.680 -->

free?\n\n23:56.320 --> 24:00.320\nYou're not fucking Prometheus because you're robbing your employer and pouring free shots\n\n24:00.320 --> 24:03.920\nbecause by the way, then he turns down the jukebox after everyone's got the shot.\n\n24:03.920 --> 24:09.040\nHe turns down the jukebox and he makes this announcement, this weird fucking millennial\n\n24:09.040 --> 24:13.320\ntwee story about how his mom's car broke down and this is the song that was playing\n\n24:13.320 --> 24:14.320\nwhen it broke.\n\n24:14.320 --> 24:20.520\nI don't even, I couldn't even, my, my, my Gen X, like fucking anti-twee shield just\n\n24:20.520 --> 24:22.320\nlike filtered it all out.\n\n24:22.320 --> 24:27.960\nI get all I heard was him talking in this Kermit the Frog voice, like monopolizing everyone's\n\n24:27.960 --> 24:33.040\nattention because his giving of free shots was of course tasted like shit.\n\n24:33.040 --> 24:34.040\nOf course they did.\n\n24:34.040 --> 24:38.600\nI now have diabetes and whatever the fuck he has on his fingers.\n\n24:38.600 --> 24:43.400\nI drank it out of obligation to his fucking mom who lost her car.\n\n24:43.400 --> 24:45.160\nWorst person, worst person I've met all day.\n\n24:45.160 --> 24:47.040\nWhat, what was the song?\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:49.200\nI don't know.\n\n24:49.200 --> 24:51.640\nWhat is a twee?\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:57.280\nTwee was a phrase we started using in the, like early thousands to kind of dismiss the\n\n24:57.280 --> 24:58.280\nemerging kind of.\n\n24:58.280 --> 25:01.920\nI had to look up an urban dictionary word today.\n\n25:01.920 --> 25:02.920\nIncluding me.\n\n25:02.920 --> 25:06.080\nI mean, I don't know, maybe not you, obviously you're asking what twee is.\n\n25:06.080 --> 25:09.960\nIt's a word that people started using to be kind of like every refer to everything Zoe\n\n25:09.960 --> 25:12.480\nDeschanel was doing.\n\n25:12.480 --> 25:17.200\nAnything you wanted to be dismissive of because it was a dorkable or, or, or, you know, like,\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:22.200\nlike, like songs that, that, that have toys, ylophones in them or it was like kind of saccharine,\n\n25:22.200 --> 25:23.200\ncutesy pie.\n\n25:23.200 --> 25:27.400\nAnd I just sort of like the, the, the, the, the adult, the adult children that were starting\n\n25:27.400 --> 25:29.520\nto release like cute music.\n\n25:29.520 --> 25:30.520\nThe Bjorks.\n\n25:30.520 --> 25:31.520\nYeah.\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:32.520\nYeah.\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:33.520\nYeah.\n\n25:33.520 --> 25:34.520\nYeah.\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:35.520\nI imagine twee being a very subjective phrase.\n\n25:35.520 --> 25:36.520\nYou could argue that Bjork was twee.\n\n25:36.520 --> 25:39.920\nBut then again, she's also like very, you know, like she's been around for a long time\n\n25:39.920 --> 25:41.520\nand put, you know, doesn't just.\n\n25:41.520 --> 25:42.520\nYou're a fan.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:44.600\nOf course I'm a Bjork fan.\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:46.600\nWe should get her on the show.\n\n25:46.600 --> 25:48.600\nI'll tweet her.\n\n25:48.600 --> 25:56.520\nI wrote a joke as I pulled up with church today.\n\n25:56.520 --> 25:57.520\nI told Dan.\n\n25:57.520 --> 25:58.520\nDan was pretty, pretty excited about it.\n\n25:58.520 --> 25:59.520\nWhat is that joke?\n\n25:59.520 --> 26:01.520\nDan was pretty excited about it.\n\n26:01.520 --> 26:03.520\nI'm still workshopping.\n\n26:03.520 --> 26:05.440\nI'm still, I'm still workshopping at church.\n\n26:05.440 --> 26:07.760\nI think it's ready for the big time.\n\n26:07.760 --> 26:12.920\nChurch almost, church was almost beside herself with gale laughter.\n\n26:12.920 --> 26:15.160\nNo, I, I happened upon that scene.\n\n26:15.160 --> 26:16.160\nChurch was.\n\n26:16.160 --> 26:22.120\nShe was, we were talking about Stephen Tyler from Aerosmith and well, we were talking about\n\n26:22.120 --> 26:23.120\nthe Beatles.\n\n26:23.120 --> 26:28.240\nWell, the joke was involving the evolution of, of people like screaming, you know, like\n\n26:28.240 --> 26:30.240\nin songs and stuff like that.\n\n26:30.240 --> 26:33.760\nAnd so I'm still workshopping and this is not a finished product.\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:34.760\nThis is why we have podcasts.\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:35.760\nLet's hear you're happy.\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:36.760\nYeah.\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:37.760\nMaybe read it tomorrow.\n\n26:37.760 --> 26:38.760\nMaybe read it tomorrow.\n\n26:38.760 --> 26:39.760\nHelp me perfect this.\n\n26:39.760 --> 26:41.760\nOh yeah.\n\n26:41.760 --> 26:43.360\nThey usually add value.\n\n26:43.360 --> 26:55.080\nWhat ingredients does Stephen Tyler of Aerosmith use to make his Irish coffee extra special?\n\n26:55.080 --> 26:57.600\nIt's worse than when I encourage you to.\n\n26:57.600 --> 26:59.600\nIt's kind of worse.\n\n26:59.600 --> 27:01.200\nWhat was the original setup?\n\n27:01.200 --> 27:02.640\nWell, it was just, what's his favorite liqueur?\n\n27:02.640 --> 27:03.640\nOh yeah.\n\n27:03.640 --> 27:04.640\nWhat, what is Stephen?\n\n27:04.640 --> 27:05.640\nOkay.\n\n27:05.640 --> 27:06.640\nLet's keep it simple.\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:08.640\nWhat, what is Aerosmith Stephen Tyler's favorite liqueur?\n\n27:08.640 --> 27:09.640\nWhat?\n\n27:09.640 --> 27:10.640\nCripple cacao!\n\n27:10.640 --> 27:11.640\nI do.\n\n27:11.640 --> 27:12.640\nI do.\n\n27:12.640 --> 27:13.640\nI'm sorry.\n\n27:13.640 --> 27:16.880\nThat's, that again is a fucking perfect joke.\n\n27:16.880 --> 27:18.560\nThat's a timeless.\n\n27:18.560 --> 27:20.640\nYou'll be telling it to your grandchildren.\n\n27:20.640 --> 27:27.960\nYou know, long after Elon Musk's Tesla has fucking, like degraded into the sun's gravity.\n\n27:27.960 --> 27:35.400\nYeah, a guy who floats puns like that is offended by our roadster, a space-bound roadster that's\n\n27:35.400 --> 27:39.120\ncollecting data about radiation and all kinds of spacecraft.\n\n27:39.120 --> 27:40.120\nThank God.\n\n27:40.120 --> 27:41.120\nYour job is to love cars in space.\n\n27:41.120 --> 27:46.800\njob is to write perfect timeless jokes. I gotta say I heard you tell that joke\n\n27:46.800 --> 27:52.880\noutside the castle and I didn't actually hear it properly I just\n\n27:52.880 --> 27:56.760\nheard like the what do you call it? The payoff of the punch line. No just like the\n\n27:56.760 --> 28:02.560\nthe way the band like the way you talk and you were already repulsed. And so no\n\n28:02.560 --> 28:06.160\nI had to fill in with like just my own brain based on your cadences and stuff\n\n28:06.160 --> 28:11.440\nand so my what I heard your version of the joke was what's Steven Tyler's\n\n28:11.440 --> 28:17.080\nfavorite vegetable cuckoo cuckoo kale. And then I was like this seems like a\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:23.360\nbad joke. Yes because you misheard my perfect joke. No I didn't do it right don't\n\n28:23.360 --> 28:28.560\nget me wrong. See there's jokes that last like the Parthenon still stands not in\n\n28:28.560 --> 28:33.800\nits former glory but that's eons of time has passed this joke will be one of\n\n28:33.800 --> 28:37.680\nthose jokes that we will all be telling. Yeah no one's arguing. Yeah I have a\n\n28:37.680 --> 28:43.880\nquestion. What do you guys church hates it. What do you guys think dogs think music\n\n28:43.880 --> 28:49.520\nis and do they do they understand that it's a it's coming through a speaker\n\n28:49.520 --> 28:53.920\nbecause they they sit and act like it's fucking nothing but if a dog barks in a\n\n28:53.920 --> 29:00.320\nmovie they lose right shit. Well I've got like music I got a playlist that's like\n\n29:00.320 --> 29:04.600\nmusic for dogs. I play that while I stretch after my exercise. I play that\n\n29:04.600 --> 29:07.760\nlike sometimes when I leave the apartment. And I do feel like the dogs\n\n29:07.760 --> 29:13.040\nfucking like it. Yeah I mean it's but it's weird. It's like or there there's\n\n29:13.040 --> 29:16.480\nlike I don't know what it's basically class. It's classical music that has\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:22.080\ncertain like tonalities in it that relaxes the dog and I would put it on\n\n29:22.080 --> 29:27.320\nevery time Kate and I would leave so Lolly wouldn't freak out and feel sad\n\n29:27.320 --> 29:33.640\nbecause like my heart goes out to her because all we are are all she has is\n\n29:33.640 --> 29:39.600\nus and we are about to leave and and I would put it on and it would work but\n\n29:39.600 --> 29:44.120\nthen there would get to a point where when she would hear that music it meant\n\n29:44.120 --> 29:51.640\nwe're leaving. Oh and then she would get she would put on the act get ready. Yeah\n\n29:51.640 --> 29:55.240\nshe would be like I'll just play a little bit of I think it's it's classical so\n\n29:55.240 --> 29:58.280\nit's really not. I don't think. So the music would go on like this.\n\n29:58.280 --> 30:03.880\nKevin Day's gonna be like you can't you play them. Oh Spotify has been paused\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:07.320\nbecause your account is being used. The dogs are listening to this right now.\n\n30:07.320 --> 30:20.960\nSorry. This music would go on and then Lolly would look at Kate and I at the\n\n30:20.960 --> 30:34.760\ndoor like. He's acting. Dogs like really sad music this is the dog of music like\n\n30:34.760 --> 30:38.160\nit's got puppy dog eyes this music. I kind of like it I've come to really like\n\n30:38.160 --> 30:42.320\nit because I shower with it. This is like the Snoopy go home. This is like I switch from two\n\n30:42.320 --> 30:48.440\nfighters to this after after I've ripped my fucking delts after I fucking blasted\n\n30:48.440 --> 30:54.920\nthem. You love blasting delts. I like blasted on delts. I fucking blasted my\n\n30:54.920 --> 31:02.680\ndelts. Where are your delts. Shoulders. I might be right. Yeah nice try.

You know when you got your you get when you're\n\n31:11.960 --> 31:15.960\nwhen you're when you do you want to know if I've become swole. Did you get\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:23.760\nyour big on. I'm trying to get swole on the reg. Yeah. Yeah. Fam. Yeah. So you said\n\n31:23.760 --> 31:28.560\nbut I switched to this when I do my Vitruvians with my weights and then and\n\n31:28.560 --> 31:33.520\nthen my stretching and I find it calms me down. Maybe I'm a dog. But anyways I'm\n\n31:33.520 --> 31:37.960\njust saying like a dog is a dog is there was a dog at the rustic in you know and\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:42.800\nit's sitting there and it's like at its owner's feet and I get so distracted\n\n31:42.800 --> 31:46.080\nbecause I'm like I'm trying to talk to Waldron about the movie we're working on\n\n31:46.080 --> 31:50.840\nand I what movie can't tell you. Oh what movie can't tell you. I get right over\n\n31:50.840 --> 32:05.520\nOh we want a movie. We like what a fucking. Is it gumby. It's it's as dumb. I\n\n32:05.520 --> 32:10.360\nlike I'm still writing shit that dumb yes for hire which means for getting\n\n32:10.360 --> 32:15.440\nfired a year from now. But I could I was distracted by this dog because there's a\n\n32:15.440 --> 32:18.520\ndog in a bar like I'm always I know that someone's eventually going to step on\n\n32:18.520 --> 32:24.120\nits tail or something. It drives me nuts. But I was just watching the dog and it's\n\n32:24.120 --> 32:28.240\njust like you know I was only fucking music playing and as people talking I\n\n32:28.240 --> 32:32.320\nwas wondering what is the dog like how does it stay sane. And also if it\n\n32:32.320 --> 32:37.000\nunderstands does it understand that the jukebox is playing like oh that's like a\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:41.320\nguy they like to listen to each other bark and then they must be really pissed\n\n32:41.320 --> 32:45.000\nlike because we're like when we get mad that they're barking they're like I\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:49.720\ncan't fucking say one thing around here like these people are always talking\n\n32:49.720 --> 32:53.400\nwell they're not talking they're listening to talking well well dogs react\n\n32:53.400 --> 32:59.240\nto different sounds differently like Lolly will there be this car driving\n\n32:59.240 --> 33:03.360\nall over the place whatever people are walking down like that down to the\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:09.720\nsidewalks he doesn't give a shit.

I've never told it's not jokes more of an anecdote\n\n35:15.580 --> 35:17.580\nBut I will continue anyway\n\n35:17.580 --> 35:26.460\nLollie was sitting there next to me while we're doing it and there's the point where the the eyes change where it's just like the\n\n35:26.740 --> 35:32.180\nGremlin looking into the screen with its cat eyes, which I went to a taxidermist and I got like\n\n35:32.700 --> 35:36.220\nReal like animal eyes and it's just the face going\n\n35:36.740 --> 35:41.700\nLike a freeze frame of it and its eyes change color. Lollie went fucking crazy\n\n35:41.700 --> 35:50.020\nEasy just went crazy that this this like Bobcat.

She\n\n35:55.060 --> 36:01.780\nShe she recorded Harvey and then she airplayed it and then she recorded him\n\n36:02.460 --> 36:08.100\nreacting to him being airplayed and then she recorded that and then airplayed that and I\n\n36:08.100 --> 36:12.740\nAnd I came into the room because the sound Harvey was making we're so fucking insane\n\n36:13.340 --> 36:19.260\nBecause it was like he was he was either losing his mind or worse gaining it\n\n36:19.260 --> 36:21.860\nYeah, he was I think he was consciousness was coming\n\n36:22.860 --> 36:29.180\nSo honey if you keep doing this thing has a jaw that can snap our throats in half\n\n36:31.100 --> 36:34.940\nIt's only kept in line by its ignorance\n\n36:34.940 --> 36:39.780\nSo you're making itself aware. It's gonna be waiting for us in the kitchen one morning with\n\n36:40.500 --> 36:43.340\nThe neighbors head on a plate.

It's like this fucked up like\n\n39:07.180 --> 39:09.180\nHello\n\n39:09.300 --> 39:11.300\nFrom octopus world\n\n39:11.300 --> 39:17.180\nMy name is Frank. It's like it's like watching fucking polar express\n\n39:17.180 --> 39:20.660\nDid you the did Lollie watch shape of water? What did you think about it?\n\n39:21.420 --> 39:27.500\nNo, she didn't yeah, and she hasn't yet because she hasn't seen it. She answer one\n\n39:27.500 --> 39:29.500\nOh\n\n39:37.180 --> 39:42.860\nThe fucking dogs dogs every morning going to light a rose every goddamn morning eight o'clock\n\n39:42.860 --> 39:47.440\nI get up. I work out because I'm fucking so early. That's the early time and\n\n39:47.660 --> 39:51.260\nDid you get your big on same time every morning dash my neighbor's cat?\n\n39:51.980 --> 39:53.980\ncomes over and\n\n39:53.980 --> 39:58.540\nThe same same it's got the same cup of coffee. It like hangs out in my yard\n\n39:59.540 --> 40:04.140\nFucking Harvey and Nigel just like these guys like it's just like I\n\n40:05.140 --> 40:07.660\nJust what is it like? What does it like to be a dog?\n\n40:07.660 --> 40:13.260\nLike they just they are meeting that cat for the first time and each other for the first time every five minutes\n\n40:13.260 --> 40:15.460\nLike they're just so amazed that there's a cat in the yard\n\n40:15.460 --> 40:19.820\nAnd they're just like like just yelling at it like are they yelling get away?\n\n40:19.820 --> 40:24.340\nAre they yelling get over here like I had a cat and they were relentless\n\n40:24.340 --> 40:29.900\nThey would Harvey wouldn't leave the fucking cat alone like I it was the I regret it for the rest of my life\n\n40:29.900 --> 40:32.380\nsubjecting to that I think like I think\n\n40:33.180 --> 40:36.780\nlike Lolly barks at big dogs and\n\n40:37.180 --> 40:43.220\nAny dog that stares her down like and I don't think it's I don't think she's like\n\n40:43.220 --> 40:51.940\nI'm afraid of you. So my reaction is to make a lot of noise and and jump around and get you to run away\n\n40:52.140 --> 40:56.860\nBecause you probably will eat me and I think your Harvey\n\n40:57.500 --> 40:59.500\nThinks he's a small dog. I\n\n41:00.100 --> 41:01.700\nthink\n\n41:01.700 --> 41:05.660\nBut but but I know that if I let him out when the cat was there\n\n41:05.660 --> 41:10.060\nYeah, I know the cat would run away right if he came running out because he's a giant dog\n\n41:10.060 --> 41:15.300\nBut I also know and maybe this is to your point kind of but he wouldn't eat it\n\n41:15.300 --> 41:22.220\nHe wouldn't like no attack it. He would terrorize it because he's a fucking giant fucking moron\n\n41:22.340 --> 41:26.220\nBut like like the cat would be traumatized, but he would like run out\n\n41:26.220 --> 41:31.720\nHe would want to he wants to play with the cat. Why do you bark at something you want to play with?\n\n41:31.720 --> 41:37.480\nI think he's confused. I think yeah, I think he's running up and going\n\n41:37.480 --> 41:43.600\nAre you a friend or a friend? But you look like you don't you look you're not responding the way you should but friend friend\n\n41:43.600 --> 41:52.160\nNo, no, no, I think he's class. Let's see other thing. It's like they're the weird selective ability for dogs to be a part of our world\n\n41:52.400 --> 41:54.400\nLike they understand almost\n\n41:55.120 --> 41:59.600\nPerfectly where your front yard is they they they have like this these weird\n\n41:59.600 --> 42:05.880\nThey just blend into your world. They understand what windows are they know that they can't get through them\n\n42:05.880 --> 42:13.800\nSo they just stand there and bark at them and they they don't even ever try to like bang their head against the glass to get through\n\n42:13.800 --> 42:20.200\nIt they don't forget that glasses is an invisible barrier, but they don't remember what the fucking cat is\n\n42:20.200 --> 42:28.460\nThey're just like so goddamn amazed that it's a cat silverman had like a great theory about like a dog's perspective of an elevator\n\n42:28.460 --> 42:30.460\nLike they've got to think it's a time machine\n\n42:31.720 --> 42:35.880\nLike you go in the doors open up and now the furniture is different. What's going on here?\n\n42:35.880 --> 42:37.880\nAll right, I must be ten years in the future\n\n42:38.280 --> 42:43.100\nAnd I was like that's a fucking Pixar movie. You gotta do that. I wonder if they do that\n\n42:43.100 --> 42:50.120\nI wonder what that would be called up. I wonder if they keep track. It's called it's called puppet and elevator and\n\n42:50.600 --> 42:52.600\nThe soundtrack is by Stephen Taylor\n\n42:53.200 --> 42:56.000\nI wonder if they keep they put that they keep track\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:57.520\nof\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:03.400\nUp in an elevator and all that stuff like we would if we were if we didn't have certain\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:08.560\nAdvantages we would think it was a time machine, but they're like I'm going up three floors\n\n43:08.560 --> 43:10.640\nI'm going up like 30 dog units\n\n43:10.640 --> 43:15.520\nYou know like they because they you know all those stories about dogs that like they jump out a window\n\n43:15.520 --> 43:21.360\nAnd then they find their way home and you know, they they like they're they're like always they have like a little GPS in their head\n\n43:21.360 --> 43:26.880\nSo they're probably like, oh, I'm in a box and it's got no windows. I wish I had a window so I could stick my head out of it\n\n43:26.880 --> 43:32.960\nWhat's up with that shit dogs the dogs you put a cat in a car and the cats like god damn it\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:37.240\nWhat the fuck is this god damn it get me out of here? Are you fucking kidding me?\n\n43:37.240 --> 43:40.080\nI mean, I don't I didn't want to be in this the smallest space\n\n43:41.160 --> 43:44.920\nInvoluntarily in the first place now it's moving. Are you out of your goddamn mind?\n\n43:44.920 --> 43:48.840\nI'm gonna piss on your face if I can like it's rare to find a cat\n\n43:48.840 --> 43:56.560\nThat's like down with a with a joy ride. They kind of either go catatonic or they just fucking like it freak out dogs\n\n43:56.560 --> 44:01.160\nIt's just like I can't believe they stick their head out the window. They're into it\n\n44:03.160 --> 44:05.160\nThey're throwing them a tennis ball\n\n44:06.480 --> 44:10.400\nLike Lolly will look out the window and just be like\n\n44:11.320 --> 44:13.320\nIt's insane\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:20.360\nShit that would be what is going on here. It's like my legs aren't moving, but I'm running really fast\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:25.160\nWhat is going on? I can't believe what is just down with that?\n\n44:25.680 --> 44:32.480\nWell, it's like if we if we were experiencing something that we just didn't understand and it just kept happening to us we would be\n\n44:33.640 --> 44:35.080\nFascinated by it\n\n44:35.080 --> 44:36.680\nYeah, I would be well\n\n44:36.680 --> 44:39.200\nI know but it's like it first and foremost\n\n44:39.200 --> 44:43.640\nI agree with the cat and the cat's cats are smart to like cats never get used to it\n\n44:43.640 --> 44:45.880\nThey never come around and go like that on the other hand\n\n44:45.880 --> 44:52.400\nIt's kind of cool to be really fast cat like and taste the wind like cats love running quickly and cats love the world\n\n44:52.400 --> 44:55.880\nCats love to look at things like but dogs are just like look man\n\n44:56.240 --> 45:00.760\nThey're just like there's just a weird canine relationship with humans where they're just like I\n\n45:01.360 --> 45:04.760\nStimuli like like the wind in their face like it's a lot happening. Yeah\n\n45:06.520 --> 45:08.520\nsmells\n\n45:08.520 --> 45:15.120\nYeah, they're they're they're they're watching like they're watching five channels at the same time\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:20.480\nSo that you probably they you wouldn't put a dog and Elon Musk's car out in outer space because there's no wind\n\n45:20.480 --> 45:24.640\nAnd there's no smells out there. You know, there's a bunch of radiation to which is data. We're getting right now\n\n45:25.520 --> 45:32.600\nWould you put data out in space? Sure. Sure. I would data's already out in space not anymore shows cancelled\n\n45:32.600 --> 45:37.640\nWow, so little mic drop. Wow\n\n45:41.760 --> 45:46.960\nRob is doing the he's the he's the Geppetto of mic job mic drop. It's a Mike teabag\n\n45:47.880 --> 45:52.480\nThat's how they do it in London. That's how they drop the mic in London like a teabag\n\n45:52.480 --> 46:03.560\nHe's queen does it and you will be able to get all of your pumpkins for free this evening\n\n46:07.120 --> 46:13.360\nMy favorite part of that of course is the rift what a queen would say that would provoke a mic drop\n\n46:13.360 --> 46:25.080\nWhich turned out to be you won't be getting your free pumpkins. I'm no world traveler\n\n46:25.080 --> 46:30.120\nI'm no geo politician. I don't know what what's going on in England, but wow\n\n46:35.120 --> 46:37.120\nThere's been a whole gourd crisis\n\n46:37.840 --> 46:43.040\nWinston Churchill movie. Yeah, son. Yeah great performance really interesting as you said\n\n46:43.040 --> 46:46.300\nIt's kind of like well, it's like a like like watching an episode of\n\n46:47.120 --> 46:49.120\nWould you say the doctor?\n\n46:51.360 --> 46:56.540\nWhat's the Gary Oldman one, what's it called God the darkest hour I have the screener. I haven't watched it really amazed\n\n46:57.440 --> 47:03.400\nI'd be say this is the whole point of every every everything, but I was like amazed at how actually true it was\n\n47:03.400 --> 47:07.720\nI don't know what I expected, but like how like Winston Churchill's\n\n47:07.720 --> 47:14.800\nAbsolute this guy who you've there's a million quotes from quotes that truly you're like wow one guy said all this shit\n\n47:14.800 --> 47:16.800\nHe's like the fucking Vince Lombardi of\n\n47:18.120 --> 47:22.120\nWorld War two he really had a lot of profound ways of phrasing this shit\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:29.080\nAnd and but and then you watch the movie and it's like oh, yeah, that's all he did\n\n47:29.960 --> 47:32.200\nLike he was like he just he just fucking talked\n\n47:32.200 --> 47:38.080\nLike this I mean, I don't know what else I expected to see like a young Winston Churchill like vaulting over\n\n47:38.880 --> 47:44.320\nYou know with Wolverine claws that were still bone and hadn't been infused with titanium yet\n\n47:44.320 --> 47:49.720\nI'm impressed in the world that most of the great like actors now are from the adamantium. Don't write in\n\n47:50.960 --> 47:57.760\nContinue like all the big actors seem to be from like the UK or the antipodes and like like but we had an American actor playing\n\n47:57.760 --> 47:58.320\nWinston Churchill\n\n47:58.320 --> 48:04.520\nThat's kind of oh, I didn't know Gary open was American necessarily. I mean he played so many like different characters. I didn't know\n\n48:04.520 --> 48:06.520\nI think he's\n\n48:06.520 --> 48:10.760\nI think I thought he was British English. I thought it was English. I didn't know this\n\n48:11.240 --> 48:13.240\nYou know, I mean well\n\n48:13.840 --> 48:19.520\nJohn let's let's go did Winston Churchill in the crown and he is a\n\n48:20.080 --> 48:21.920\nman he is\n\n48:21.920 --> 48:24.520\nAmerican and his mouth is a circle\n\n48:24.520 --> 48:31.160\nNo, you make your mouth into a circle. Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. It's me Winston Churchill\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:33.160\nOh\n\n48:33.160 --> 48:37.000\nThe only thing we have to fear oh is being misquoted. Oh\n\n48:38.440 --> 48:41.480\nCome on speak softly and have another quote\n\n48:43.600 --> 48:49.080\nStop I know what you're talking about. Think of one of my real quotes. I don't know what you mean. My mouth is a circle\n\n48:49.080 --> 48:55.680\nOh, oh Daddy I wish the church daddy daddy, please daddy\n\n48:58.160 --> 49:01.160\nCan you both do the same scene but as Harvey Kytel's\n\n49:02.440 --> 49:07.880\nHarvey Kytel can you do a Harvey Kytel? I'll just give it a go. I don't know. I just picked what I picked what I random\n\n49:07.880 --> 49:11.480\nI don't think I could do. Just try a Harvey Kytel. What are you? What?\n\n49:12.240 --> 49:13.960\nWhat are you?\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:15.840\nWhat are you? What are you doing?\n\n49:15.840 --> 49:23.880\nDo you think do you think I am do you do you think I am doing what you think I am doing?\n\n49:27.960 --> 49:30.920\nThat's all I remember about him is he's heart of zing now Juliet Lewis\n\n49:30.920 --> 49:47.000\nI'm a natural barn killer. I love my favorite. I love Juliet Lewis\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:52.240\nI'm at my favorite liner and natural born killers. She's such a great like in another wise\n\n49:52.240 --> 49:57.560\nIt's it's pretty uncomfortable. I also love Tom Sizemore. I also love Quentin Tarantino\n\n49:57.560 --> 50:01.840\nWhatever go send your emails to my ass Bronson Pinchot\n\n50:02.480 --> 50:10.000\nI but but but Sizemore doing the scene in natural born killers where he's like he's in her cell and he wants it\n\n50:10.720 --> 50:16.800\nGive me Sizemore. I don't there's no Sizemore. There's only Zool. I don't know. He's Tom Sizemore\n\n50:16.800 --> 50:21.320\nHe's talking and he says like I want you to I want you to I want you to\n\n50:22.200 --> 50:24.200\npinch my nipple and\n\n50:24.200 --> 50:27.800\nPut this lipstick on and pinch my nipple. Well, you kiss me or whatever\n\n50:30.360 --> 50:32.360\nSo specific\n\n50:36.520 --> 50:40.720\nI was impressed by your Harvey cartel. I have to tell you that was that was pretty. What are you? What are you?\n\n50:41.920 --> 50:44.520\nCan I ask what you what? What are you doing?\n\n50:46.720 --> 50:52.240\nMy favorite Julia Lewis quote from natural born killers. I think it's from one of the deleted scenes\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:54.240\nwhen they're like\n\n50:54.640 --> 50:57.600\nbefore they go to drug world after they get bit by all the\n\n50:59.720 --> 51:06.880\nRattlesnakes, you know, they have to go. Yeah, there's this scene where I'm pretty sure it's in all improv\n\n51:06.880 --> 51:12.300\nThis like stone was just like go just jump off the script do whatever and\n\n51:13.200 --> 51:19.800\nJulia will Lewis is like, can we get the fuck out of here and get some snake juice killer?\n\n51:19.800 --> 51:21.800\nOh\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:25.280\nSnake juice killer\n\n51:27.400 --> 51:28.520\nantibiotics\n\n51:28.520 --> 51:34.120\nI haven't seen that movie in a while. Would you do would you get do me a favor and do your your famous Selma Hayek impression?\n\n51:35.040 --> 51:37.040\nHey, I'm Selma Hayek\n\n51:38.800 --> 51:42.880\nThe esclar brothers, it's coming in over the wire or we're gonna come here\n\n51:43.800 --> 51:46.800\nIt sounds like they're not gonna make it, but I I do want to\n\n51:46.800 --> 51:49.960\nIt's snowing out there. I do want to do them the service of plugging their\n\n51:50.720 --> 51:52.720\nbut holes\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:56.080\nHell yeah when I see them again\n\n51:57.720 --> 52:03.480\nFor too long the scolars but holes have gone because they've had me on their podcast don't people town twice now\n\n52:03.480 --> 52:10.080\nAnd it's great fun. I truly love doing it and they're they're they're good friends in as much as you can be good friends of people\n\n52:10.080 --> 52:12.080\nYou've you've done two podcasts with but\n\n52:12.080 --> 52:19.800\nThey're they have a new project. They were gonna come here and they're they're the thing that they were gonna plug is something\n\n52:19.800 --> 52:26.560\nWe're very excited about me and Dan. It's a documentary about about something. That's not always talked about in public\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:32.080\nFeces it's a poop documentary. It's a poop documentary\n\n52:33.320 --> 52:35.320\nThey got their funny friends\n\n52:35.760 --> 52:39.040\nTalking about poop. I think they delve into the history of poop\n\n52:39.040 --> 52:44.040\nWhat was the first thing that could be considered poop? Like well, I made that up poop. I\n\n52:44.680 --> 52:50.320\nI was that doesn't stop me from thinking it. I mean, yeah, you know, I think that I mean shouldn't you say\n\n52:50.320 --> 52:54.560\nI think I remembered Dan doing an awesome riff on how it might start\n\n52:54.560 --> 52:59.360\nNo, I remember that being the actual part of the movie. Oh, you saw it as you rift it\n\n53:00.200 --> 53:03.200\nBut like I thought you're being so you've seen the movie or you've not seen the movie\n\n53:03.200 --> 53:05.920\nOh, I've seen it and it changed my life in the way\n\n53:05.920 --> 53:09.200\nI look at poop forever is Dan Dan in the movie\n\n53:09.640 --> 53:15.320\nDan's in the movie everyone you want to be in the movies in the movie in typical documentary fashion\n\n53:15.320 --> 53:20.640\nI'm in the movie and I accomplished the rare task of making you hate me more than poop\n\n53:21.160 --> 53:26.560\nAs a that's a joke for my fans who know that every documentary and I come off like a fucking douchebag\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:34.600\nHarmon down the I think it'd be a mistake to make a poop documentary and not put Dan Harmon in it\n\n53:34.600 --> 53:40.520\nExactly. What are the documentaries? Are you in? I was in a back to the future documentary\n\n53:41.120 --> 53:42.960\nthey used\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:44.960\nin over my\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:49.280\nProtests is like, please don't well. I'm on camera saying please don't\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:53.520\nLike make me talk about the fact that back to the future two sucks\n\n53:54.840 --> 53:56.840\nDon't make me talk about it\n\n53:56.840 --> 54:00.480\nBut you weren't the only one in that documentary that said that I'm I\n\n54:00.480 --> 54:09.120\nWell, if that's true, I I know they sandwiched me saying that between like a father and son with different kinds of cancer\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:16.360\nWho's soul way of coping with it is to celebrate back to the future to and like a mayor who brought jobs to his town by\n\n54:16.360 --> 54:20.600\nBuilding a back to the future to statue and in the middle is me going like it sucks\n\n54:22.440 --> 54:27.560\nAnyways, that sounds like a good creative. Yeah, they probably won't work with you ever again\n\n54:27.560 --> 54:35.760\nYeah, and and also there goes my there goes my pristine PR. What is the name of the sclar poop documentary?\n\n54:36.640 --> 54:38.080\neverybody poops\n\n54:38.080 --> 54:44.320\nNo, that's not what it is.

So let's just take it again from the top. It's going to be a\n\n55:16.280 --> 55:18.280\nSmall release\n\n55:18.560 --> 55:23.920\nYeah, that's what I talk the sclar brothers have been talking a lot of shit lately\n\n55:23.920 --> 55:25.840\nliterally\n\n55:25.840 --> 55:30.360\nDidn't have to put literally there could have just stopped it\n\n55:30.960 --> 55:32.960\nHow would you get that they're joking?\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:35.040\nit's\n\n55:35.040 --> 55:38.080\nabout poo you guys are being very jaded and\n\n55:39.360 --> 55:43.600\nDon't you worry about our friends listening to stuff like this and going like how they don't seem to\n\n55:44.480 --> 55:48.920\nSupport us very much. Remember. Maybe we should not show up. Maybe they should have me on their show\n\n55:48.920 --> 55:52.720\nI mean, I I'm sad that they're not here tonight because a I love hanging out with them\n\n55:52.720 --> 55:55.960\nYeah, but also I have a million poop talk questions. Yeah\n\n55:56.160 --> 56:03.340\nWe really wanted to learn more about the movie and we're excited to do it. And that's the one thing we can't do\n\n56:04.240 --> 56:06.240\nMm-hmm. I agree poop talk\n\n56:06.840 --> 56:11.040\nSo like everyone in America that's listening and also all the other countries\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:21.320\nSpain we should all have to go name name seven countries in Europe. You have 20 seconds\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:24.760\nHe's not trying\n\n56:24.760 --> 56:26.760\nLike being pimped\n\n56:28.680 --> 56:31.240\nName five countries and anywhere in the world\n\n56:31.240 --> 56:36.160\nHe doesn't like playing by rules if you tell him to you know what you know how to get Rob to jump through a hoop\n\n56:36.160 --> 56:42.600\nUh, tell him tell him the hoops are not for jumping through. Okay, don't\n\n56:43.280 --> 56:45.280\nDon't name quite centuries\n\n56:47.560 --> 56:50.480\nNo name another country. I don't know whether to say\n\n56:51.160 --> 56:53.160\nThank you or\n\n56:53.480 --> 56:59.080\nStop it today. I have known you for 57 years. It's true this guy\n\n56:59.080 --> 57:03.240\nI look at my hands the other day and I went Jesus Christ\n\n57:03.240 --> 57:07.520\nMy hands are fucking looking old man, and they were shaking\n\n57:07.880 --> 57:15.360\nThey were all wrinkled and I was like what the fuck happened to my hands. What happened to my hands. They used to be so\n\n57:16.160 --> 57:18.160\nsoft\n\n57:19.040 --> 57:21.040\nWrinkled\n\n57:21.280 --> 57:23.040\nI\n\n57:23.040 --> 57:28.320\nStarted crying. I'm like going what the hell happened. Can you play the dog music while he talks about his hands?\n\n57:28.320 --> 57:32.480\nCould just usually because I can't see very well relax\n\n57:34.120 --> 57:36.840\nI can't I can't see very well\n\n57:36.840 --> 57:40.600\nSo I'm looking at my hands right now without my glasses and they look like you know\n\n57:41.440 --> 57:47.080\nLooking at Cybill Shepherd on moonlighting close-up. I mean, they're all like, you know frosted glass looking\n\n57:47.080 --> 57:48.040\nThey look pretty good\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:55.080\nI put my glasses my reading glasses my special close-up reading glasses for when I want to look at my phone and\n\n57:55.080 --> 57:58.560\nand read what's on my phone and I\n\n57:59.400 --> 58:04.240\nTurned my palm on my hand around and I just like looked at my hand and it was just like I\n\n58:06.080 --> 58:08.080\nActually noticed how old my\n\n58:09.240 --> 58:11.240\nhands looked\n\n58:11.240 --> 58:15.640\nAnd I said it's it's it's coming. It's it's almost over\n\n58:16.600 --> 58:23.720\nIt's almost over. It's like you know when you when you take ecstasy for the first time and it's the best feeling in the world\n\n58:23.720 --> 58:29.440\nYou know, you're just like, oh my god, and you peek and you go ah, it's great. And then all of a sudden\n\n58:29.960 --> 58:37.640\nYou start coming down and there's like this heartbreak of like I just got here. I just got here and I'm coming down\n\n58:38.520 --> 58:45.080\nThat's what my life is like right now. I just got here and I'm fading out\n\n58:46.040 --> 58:49.320\nThe dimmer switch on Trob is turning\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:52.240\nDamn clockwise\n\n58:52.240 --> 58:55.680\nCheck out Randy and Jason Scalarra's poop talk\n\n58:57.240 --> 59:00.520\nThat's good. That was great. That was that was fucking heavy\n\n59:00.520 --> 59:05.080\nYou know what you know what always accentuates for me coming down from the ecstasy of life is\n\n59:05.480 --> 59:13.320\nThat that being the exact chapter of the party where a million strangers burst in and point at you and yell privilege\n\n59:14.840 --> 59:17.080\nThat's my favorite part of the party. No\n\n59:17.080 --> 59:24.520\nWhen you're high on ecstasy, yeah, it's just a good. Well, no when I'm dying when I've been a laged I\n\n59:25.560 --> 59:28.720\nWas commenting on also. It's not a good time to be\n\n59:29.600 --> 59:37.400\nLike we we hit it. We hit our peak and we were we were and we weren't ready to you know for the whatever the opposite of the\n\n59:37.480 --> 59:41.160\nThe up the hill downhill. I think it is\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:46.800\nYou know, we weren't pretty sure it's not uphill. We weren't ready to we were ready to be over the hill\n\n59:46.800 --> 59:49.880\nI feel like I hit my peak like maybe\n\n59:51.840 --> 59:53.840\n30 minutes ago with my Steven Tyler\n\n59:55.480 --> 59:56.760\nI\n\n59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.120\nFeel like that was that's that's me at Mount Everest and now it's just gonna be a\n\n01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.800\nHorrible toboggan ride down at the bottom\n\n01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:10.360\nbut I was just saying they pull but politically fashionably like partially probably be because of the just population dynamics because the\n\n01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.160\nThe younger kids they're like part of a huge shadow of the baby boom\n\n01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.400\nIt's like a giant huge section of the population like it became open season on on old people\n\n01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.040\nSo it's like you there's kind of like a you hit the peak and then you start going down hill\n\n01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.800\nAnd then you hear this war cry in the distance. You're like, oh man. Well, at least it's downhill and then it's like, oh\n\n01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.600\nFuck shit. I am an easy target. I\n\n01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.680\nThought I could like slide into like retirement like by the old rules\n\n01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.320\nYou know, you're supposed to like be a old young white man and like become an old white man\n\n01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.200\nAnd then you you you hoard your privilege and then you you have it in your little sack\n\n01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:56.120\nAnd then you tiptoe quietly to a wagon and coast downhill into a into a little shall I\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nI might not make it\n\n01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.640\nLike there's a there's a price on my scalp\n\n01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.640\nPeople know that this is the route you take now\n\n01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.320\nMm-hmm. There's there's there's I won't call them bandits because they might be heroes. I might be the villain\n\n01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320\nBut there's there's people on the highway\n\n01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880\nThey know I'm here. They're gonna get me\n\n01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.600\nThis new purge movie looks pretty good\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.400\nWhat's this one? What's it's a purge equal prequel prequel coming up with the purge coming up with the purge\n\n01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:39.240\nIt's called the binge. He thought he peaked he thought he peaked\n\n01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840\nMy hands just got five years younger\n\n01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:54.420\nYou can make your hands young by being funny oh boy, maybe that's that's that explains a lot\n\n01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:01.020\nYeah, oh my god really. Yeah, we got this is not good guys. I've got I've always had oldest-looking hands\n\n01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:06.140\nBut this is really skin gets papery. It looks like like like like rice paper. Oh god\n\n01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:12.060\nWell Schrabs looking at his hands. I think well Schrab though like what you're looking at is the fact that you're old but you're\n\n01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:18.780\nYou're you're physically fit so you're you're yeah look at Jeff's hands. This is different\n\n01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:25.380\nThis looks like Tom Savini put latex. Do you wear gloves? Mine look fine because I have a layer of fat\n\n01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.020\nNo, you're fine because\n\n01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:37.060\nNo, this this is really bad. This is not good. It's a lot of paper right you touch paper. I touch paper\n\n01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.560\nI think it really dries out your hands\n\n01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:45.420\nYou moisturize Schrab. Do you use any moisturizer? I try to you guys have a lower body fat\n\n01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:52.180\nSo you're as you're gonna as you grow older, which let me look at your hands.

It's hurtful\n\n01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:46.620\nReally, it's actually really good. I really enjoyed it sad said that you feel comfortable enough to talk to people like that\n\n01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.660\nThat's why I'm a little lighter. Now this one will suck\n\n01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.820\nI'm sure because I think that one you can hear me going this episode sex like well\n\n01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:58.300\nThis episode sex.

I don't know there might be something\n\n01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.580\nMaybe I need to be an Abbott, you know, maybe that's my thing. I'm complaining the whole time. I'm like, oh, you guys are picking on me\n\n01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.300\nI hate you. I'm annoyed with you.

I think\n\n01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:26.860\nOr my therapist says Dan when you're certain you're in trouble Dan Harmon\n\n01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.780\nYou're better off not being certain\n\n01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.980\nThat's when you excel when you don't know things when you're confused people need you to be\n\n01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.220\nUncertain you not everybody you\n\n01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.780\nDan when you're certain\n\n01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.500\nLike every time you think you know something for sure just stop\n\n01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.780\nJust go soak your head in a bucket and you were like, how much does this cause I?\n\n01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.580\nThink it's two dollars. I thought it was great advice\n\n01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.460\nAlthough it's not really a place to follow because when I'm certain of something\n\n01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.780\nI'm like, I don't need to follow that advice of this situation. I'm certain of it\n\n01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:07.140\nLike I can't really follow right.

I was so broke that I went I I said I'm in let's do this and I you know\n\n01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.060\nAnd they were like well West Craven likes\n\n01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.700\nCrossword puzzles, so we think\n\n01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.460\nAnd he's also a bird watcher, so if you can get that in there, too, and I'm just like\n\n01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.740\nYes, and I'm like writing it and writing it right\n\n01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:32.060\nThose last two details up or is that for real? It's for real the crossword puzzle, but the bird watching bird watch. Oh my god\n\n01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.340\nI remember the crossword puzzle because I was like whoa\n\n01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:41.180\nAnd and then and then at one point was this it was this West Cravens idea or they're pitching it\n\n01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:47.220\nTheir idea because I never once in this whole thing never got to meet West Craven and\n\n01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:54.180\nWhich is sad because I I'm a huge fan. I think he's brilliant. I got the\n\n01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.780\nImpression towards the end that this guy\n\n01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:04.060\nWas not an executive. He was like an up-and-comer or whatever had an idea. I said let's put two and two together\n\n01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.180\nlet's just do this and\n\n01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.780\nand\n\n01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:12.940\nAnd West was like yeah sure whatever well, yeah, I mean why say no\n\n01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:21.180\nBut people some people say how did this get made or how does it like why is Hollywood so plastic or what why does this happen?\n\n01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.780\nOh, the thing is the answer is why say no, why would you ever say no? It cost nothing to say yes, right?\n\n01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:34.460\nIt cost nothing to say no and says cost everything to say yes, but well, okay, but I was saying the opposite\n\n01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.460\nI'm just saying like you're\n\n01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.180\nYou could ruin your career by saying no to the wrong thing\n\n01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:46.380\nYou can't ruin your career by saying yes to the wrong things until it comes to the point where because everything dies anyway\n\n01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:52.500\nSo if you're West Craven and your assistance assistance assistance vice president of assistance is saying like oh, yeah\n\n01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.660\nAnd also as a thing I want to do is like it's you and a crossword puzzle and fighting a mummy\n\n01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.820\nYou just you just you just say the fastest route to the end of the phone call\n\n01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.780\nYou don't pull over your car and go now hold on a second\n\n01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:10.740\nI'm West Craven and I'll be god damned if you're gonna be interested in me and keep making projects about me for no money\n\n01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.700\nWell, I drive my car around you just go.

You would have to lean into it where there would be constantly people like going\n\n01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:07.700\nWest Craven, how do I know that guy? Ah, I'm a director. What did you do?\n\n01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:14.740\nOh, I think I think I don't think well you're talking about the consumers perspective\n\n01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:18.380\nI don't think so. I think he's like he's like Stephen King or whatever. It wouldn't matter be like West Craven\n\n01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.060\nYou're like, I know those words. It's like Kleenex or something. I don't know\n\n01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:27.060\nI think you know the average person doesn't know what he looks like enough that if you saw a caricature of him that you would go\n\n01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:33.700\nWest Craven. No, no, no, you don't need to it's a carrot. Fuck the caricature. No the name. That's it\n\n01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:39.780\nThat's all you start with and then it's that's why you step on the gas of the caricature when you do a receding hairline at a gray\n\n01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.100\nbeard and you you you you lean into it\n\n01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:45.900\nHe's like doctor who like doctor who doesn't have to fucking like be sexy and cool\n\n01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:53.300\nHe's just like like that's the thing is like okay crossword puzzles bird watching which is interesting because that's ultimately what what the doctor is\n\n01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:57.140\nRight. He's West Craven. He just goes around and he's it's a cool name\n\n01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:02.380\nAnd it's like it kind of sells itself these shows call doctor who he's the characters the doctor\n\n01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.940\nbut\n\n01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:10.620\nBut back then it was fucking ludicrous because it I still think it's pretty fucking well\n\n01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:17.180\nAlso, you know that if tomorrow if West Craven was alive and because I know this because I've done these fucking projects where you go\n\n01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:19.180\nLike somebody goes like oh my god\n\n01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.860\nI'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do a pretensi name\n\n01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:30.420\nThat's like equivalent because I don't want to get in trouble by naming names, but like sorry like Garth Brooks loves\n\n01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:38.260\nCommunity Rick and Morty whatever and you go like and he went he and he also loves animation because his kids an animation\n\n01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.900\nYou go fucking all right like look I have an animation studio look\n\n01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.780\nTell you what Garth Brooks is an agent for the government\n\n01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:50.140\nHe is that like when the government has something that needs done that no one also do he calls Garth they call Garth Brooks\n\n01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:55.860\nIt's it fucking sells itself. It's hilarious. The person's recognizable doesn't matter. I'll do it. You do it with anybody\n\n01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:00.020\nIt doesn't matter. It's like Mike nice.

And then she's gonna have four noses on the side of her nose\n\n01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.680\nOh doc doc. You're saying you're gonna put hair on her head. You're gonna put a hat on her head. Which is it?\n\n01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.480\nWe can do anything. Human heads are basically like your potato products. It all comes out of the butt\n\n01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.880\nTrailer I'll be right back. All right\n\n01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.480\nGet them\n\n01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.600\nFuck\n\n01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840\nIt wasn't that big of a jump\n\n01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.840\nWell, it'll be interesting to find out if this is a worse\n\n01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.260\npodcast than a Cheapy Peepy. I'm a big fan. Cheapy Peepy.\n\n01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.820\nHow can it be worse? We had more Cheapy Peepy per this\n\n01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.020\npodcast than we have as podcasts. This has been a\n\n01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.060\nCheapy Peepy. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.\n\n01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.620\nI don't know. I think it's going to turn out that my happiness\n\n01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.420\nis linked to the show's failure. That's just my cynical\n\n01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.140\ntheory. Could be right. I think we'll find out that my hubris\n\n01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.980\nover my Steven Taylor joke might have made the joke less\n\n01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:49.380\nfunny. We'll see what happens. What time is it? I'm glad I\n\n01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:55.020\nshowed up. I wasn't supposed to be here, but I was. Well, you\n\n01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.060\nhave to come in because you're Garry Shandling in the D&D. Let's\n\n01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:05.380\nbring up Steve Levy. Steve Levy. Oh, yeah.

And he shaved his face.\n\n01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:22.300\nWhy are you moving? That is very close to you. I mean, I'm fine\n\n01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.100\nwith that. Oh, and one of the segments that I loved most of\n\n01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.060\nall was the snuggling. Remember the snuggling? Oh, yeah. Oh,\n\n01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.500\nyeah. Yeah, that's hard to top because that that that things\n\n01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.380\nwent to an emotional level. It made me want to go like, oh, we\n\n01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:36.220\nhave a regular segment. Like if if if somebody comes on, you go\n\n01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.060\nlike, you got to snuggle with Steve Levy, Steve Levy, and he\n\n01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.500\nasks you what's your biggest fear?

He doesn't have any emotions. I\n\n01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.740\ndon't know as a friend as a friend. I'm telling you that\n\n01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:59.020\nsounds exactly like a friend as a friend. Oh, is that what a\n\n01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:02.580\nfriend is? You fucking give me a moniker like that. They're\n\n01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:07.460\nWikipedia's fucking jumping on my job. You've been writing my\n\n01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:12.540\njob all month, man. Fuck off. Chippy peepees a better thing.\n\n01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.900\nOh, that's what a friend would do.

Beard full of dicks.\n\n01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.660\nHe's hiding dicks in his beard. It's either that it's either\n\n01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:44.820\nthat or kiss me. I'm Monday. Kiss me. I'm Monday. But it\n\n01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.660\nneeds to be your beards full of dicks. Not not beard full of\n\n01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.020\ndicks already. Giving me notes.\n\n01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:59.780\nWell, it should have been. I'm not a Cheapy Peepy. Instead,\n\n01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.260\nyou you made it Cheapy Peepy. Oh, me. You look at me. I\n\n01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.260\ndon't know who makes the titles. Who chooses the titles?\n\n01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:10.180\nWell, sure, not fucking me. Who picks it? Chris? Who chooses?\n\n01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.900\nOkay, well, I remember. I remember. Oh, so it was\n\n01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.900\ndone. Corrected the spelling. I said it should be Cheapy Peepy\n\n01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.020\nbut spell it like this. But I didn't made up word spelled\n\n01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:26.580\nright. Oh, wasn't there something on this exact same\n\n01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.460\nissue? What was it? What was the word? There's a made up word\n\n01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.900\nthat Dan was insisting was spelled wrong and Rob was\n\n01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:37.940\ngetting mad about it. Friend. It could have been emotions.\n\n01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:44.260\nMight as well. I'm not an emotionless person. No, you are.\n\n01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.540\nAs a friend, I'm just saying you're great. Well, or more as a\n\n01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:51.300\nnon friend. You're just lying. No, like, leave the other\n\n01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:54.100\npossibility. I know you longer than anyone.

I did, but I\n\n01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:57.020\nguess not enough. Like we kind of like she felt like I wasn't\n\n01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.020\nconnected enough while she was gone. Oh, I'm sorry to hear\n\n01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:05.580\nthat. I was proud of you working out though. Thank you. You went\n\n01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:09.660\nup in your in your in your weightlifting.

Ask him what he's afraid of.\n\n01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:27.340\nDan. Yeah. What's your biggest fear? Spiders. Arachnophobia.\n\n01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:32.140\nSpiders. I wouldn't be afraid of Arachnophobia. Spiders.\n\n01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:39.900\nWhat's what will kind of spiders? Fast ones. What are you\n\n01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.940\nafraid they're going to do to you? Run up my arm and\n\n01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:48.780\nclaw it all in my ear and lay eggs or cover my face. Just bite me\n\n01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:55.020\nall over my face. Yikes. What are you afraid of with spiders?\n\n01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.020\nWell, I don't know that I am afraid of spiders. Really? I kind\n\n01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.060\nof invite them to jump on me in the off chance. They're\n\n01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.900\nradioactive. Take this seriously. Yeah, it feels like this is\n\n01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.060\na big fucking game to you. You know, I don't want to be\n\n01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.100\nsnuggled by a goddamn performer. He seems sincere and then\n\n01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.020\nit just comes out. It's all a fucking joke. Why don't you get\n\n01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.140\ndown behind Steve and let's get a little. That's the only way\n\n01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.940\nthis is ever going to fucking work. It's weird how I'm\n\n01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.500\naccused of being emotionless, but really what I am is a\n\n01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.620\nfucking stud finder for human emotion. Like I detected your\n\n01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:29.820\nartifice. You're snuggled with you and you're a fucking\n\n01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.700\nrude. You just found another stud.\n\n01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:38.140\nFuck Steve Levy in the butt.\n\n01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:45.340\nWhat's your greatest fear, Steve Levy?\n\n01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.460\nOh my god, you're so beautiful.\n\n01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.140\nI smell so good.\n\n01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.260\nOh god, you feel me, throbbing your ass.\n\n01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:07.900\nOh god, you're listening to the podcast. Let us know how this\n\n01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.340\ntranslates.\n\n01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:17.340\nSchrab is thrusting a little bit. I can't. I can't. I can't do this.\n\n01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:23.340\nI can't do this anymore. I can't do this. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.\n\n01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:30.220\nYeah, yeah, Dan, you suck. Well,\n\n01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.900\nthis didn't work. You didn't do it right. I was there two\n\n01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.900\nseconds and I went there and back again. I've seen Dan\n\n01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:45.020\npretty emotional before. Yeah. Yeah, tell him about it.\n\n01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:50.140\nLots of different times. I mean, at one time, the hard drive\n\n01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.620\ndidn't work really the way it was supposed to. I mean, he's a\n\n01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.380\nguy who doesn't, he doesn't like to necessarily wear his\n\n01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.980\nemotions on his sleeve. So where does he wear them?\n\n01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:08.220\nIn my work, where they benefit people, you know, I express\n\n01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:15.340\nthem. I wear them on the page. Whoa. And I don't know what\n\n01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.780\ncould be a more intimate thing to do for someone than to\n\n01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:26.860\nbuild an empire. That's convenient.\n\n01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:36.300\nYou know, I have the ability to unplug my heart from\n\n01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:43.260\ndangerous situations and I've encountered a lot and I've\n\n01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:48.700\nsurvived and I think that my instincts are always right\n\n01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.900\nabout who to open up to and who not to. How important, Dan,\n\n01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.300\nis your friendship to Schrab? Like, how much does that mean\n\n01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.980\nto you? Like, not just in the past, but like present and\n\n01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:02.380\nforward. What? Like how much? Like one to five. Like street\n\n01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.500\nvalue? Like how like dollar value? No, like, no, describe\n\n01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:12.380\nthe importance of it. 50 grand. Oh, you didn't want the,\n\n01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.100\nall right. What do you, what do you mean describe? You\n\n01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.460\ndescribe. This is only describing me. Describe the\n\n01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:20.940\nimportance of anything. What do you mean? Wait a minute,\n\n01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:27.500\nwait a minute. Tell us. This is really awkward. Tell me.\n\n01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.060\nPretend no one else is listening. Like, let's say Schrab\n\n01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.860\nwasn't here. We weren't podcasting this. What is the\n\n01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:37.820\nvalue of Schrab in your life? I don't think you have to\n\n01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:45.580\nanswer that. Schrab is a metric of, this is a good video.\n\n01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:50.380\nOf how, what's, I don't know. It's a, it's a, it's a heartwarming\n\n01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:53.660\nmoment that I have saved on my phone of you guys. We were\n\n01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:57.580\nediting community and I don't remember how it came up, but\n\n01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:00.780\nyou guys hadn't like actually hung out in a while\n\n01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:04.540\nand you missed each other and you, and you guys just\n\n01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:08.460\nhad a very loving, long embrace. You hugged\n\n01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.140\nin the edit bay and they have it on camera. Well, we don't hug very\n\n01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.260\noften. But Dan, you're about to answer the question. You're\n\n01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:17.900\nabout to, but no, I don't know how to answer. I wasn't about to\n\n01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:20.940\nanswer it. It's a silly question. It's silly. You're about, you're\n\n01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.180\nabout to say something. You're about to, you're about to say\n\n01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:25.900\nsomething. Well, Schrab, Schrab, I was about to say Schrab,\n\n01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.900\nsomething like that will, everybody will laugh at. Like\n\n01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:32.060\nSchrab's a metric of, of my life. Like he's, he's been there\n\n01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.060\nthe whole time. That doesn't sound like friendship because\n\n01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.900\nyou're like, oh, he's been there the whole time. That sounds\n\n01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.860\nlike, that sounds like Andy Cap talking about his wife or\n\n01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:45.500\nsomething. It's not too far off. Like, boy, boy. Well, you\n\n01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:50.220\nbet. Oh, I don't know what his wife's name is. Was she throw\n\n01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.980\nlike a, let's say Schrab disappeared, went away, moved\n\n01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:57.900\naway.
