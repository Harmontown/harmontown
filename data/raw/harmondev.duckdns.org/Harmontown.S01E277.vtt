00:00.000 --> 00:11.880
Music

00:11.880 --> 00:35.200
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, from beautiful uptown Burbank, Carpentown

00:35.200 --> 00:36.200
is now in session.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.960
Let's welcome to the stage the Game Master extraordinaire, the man with all the hair,

00:40.960 --> 00:44.800
the guy who's right over there, Spencer Crittenden.

00:44.800 --> 00:57.800
What up, Spencer, and the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:57.800 --> 01:03.560
Wrapping north, wrapping west, wrapping on your titties, wrapping on your chest, wrapping

01:03.560 --> 01:08.800
on your hat, wrapping on your gloves, wrapping with your mama, she's the woman I love, she's

01:08.800 --> 01:15.920
my one lady for life, I love her like a spoon, loves a knife, all the same ass rhymes when

01:15.920 --> 01:21.480
I do my freestyle because I've been rapping for a long, too long a while, all my rhymes

01:21.480 --> 01:29.600
are written down, I got them in my pocket, okay, yeah, this is where I just want to wrap

01:29.600 --> 01:32.320
at the top of the show just to get the pump primed.

01:32.320 --> 01:45.600
Just hit that beat again, all right, so, all right, here's the top of the show, all right,

01:45.600 --> 01:52.160
so you've watched nature shows about bees, you've heard about bees, here's this, here's

01:52.160 --> 01:58.600
this rule you've heard, killer bees, regular bees that you've agitated, whatever, you know,

01:58.600 --> 02:03.680
you see the list of things to do and don't, bees are attacking you, don't do this, what's

02:03.680 --> 02:11.160
the thing, you know, you know where I'm going, because it's the weird bee rule that intrigues.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.520
We all know this, you know it.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.680
If bees are chasing you, don't jump in water.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.320
Don't jump in water.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.200
Don't do it, don't, don't, absolutely under no circumstances, if a swarm of killer bees

02:25.200 --> 02:30.040
are chasing you, and you happen to be near a nice pool of water.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.440
Don't jump into it, because, and then you go, oh really, why, so that's like that rule

02:35.440 --> 02:39.680
like where you're, if you're dying of thirst in the ocean and like even though you're surrounded

02:39.680 --> 02:45.440
by saltwater, don't drink the water, which then you find out why, oh, it's saltwater,

02:45.440 --> 02:49.760
you will dehydrate yourself even faster than if you just don't drink water.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.040
This rule's a little different though, because you go, oh, why, why, why, why, with the bees?

02:55.040 --> 03:04.560
Well, because they could, and they always use this phrase, they could be waiting for

03:04.560 --> 03:09.880
you when you come up, because they can detect the carbon dioxide coming out of your mouth,

03:09.880 --> 03:14.040
that's why they say, when you're running away from bees that are trying to kill you, do

03:14.040 --> 03:20.080
zigzag, wrap your head in a shirt, cover your head, for God's sakes, cover your head, cover

03:20.080 --> 03:25.200
your mouth and your nose, they can track you by the carbon dioxide you're emitting.

03:25.200 --> 03:32.960
Do not, under any circumstances, jump into water, because what, it magnifies your carbon

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
dioxide emissions?

03:33.960 --> 03:39.800
No, they might be waiting for it when you come back up, but motherfucker, I'm also covering

03:39.800 --> 03:47.800
my whole body with water and like what the fuck, like say it this way, from now on, I'm

03:47.800 --> 03:48.800
sick of these.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.680
Who are you targeting with this statement?

03:50.680 --> 03:57.920
Every bee, every bee show, every bee article, Google bee attack, every bee article, Google

03:57.920 --> 04:04.120
every fucking bee, Google bee attack, you're on notice every bee article, anybody that

04:04.120 --> 04:08.960
has ever written or has ever gone to what, how should they phrase it, about bee attacks

04:08.960 --> 04:14.040
and how to survive them, from now on, before you copy and paste, because I know that's

04:14.040 --> 04:22.760
what you're doing, don't jump into water, just, just, just, just amend it to this.

04:22.760 --> 04:33.680
If it's a choice between water and your house, go in your house, right, you'll be safer there.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
In the house.

04:34.680 --> 04:35.680
Than in the water.

04:35.680 --> 04:41.040
If you're in a fucking desert and you're running from god damn killer bees, and there's

04:41.040 --> 04:46.400
of some water, okay, jump the fuck in it.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.520
It's there for you.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.400
I got, you know, you want to hear, I have some coyote tips, you want to hear my bee tips.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.520
What are your bee tips?

04:54.520 --> 04:56.720
You're covering your head with your shirt, right?

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
Uh huh.

04:57.720 --> 05:03.760
Because you're supposed to jump in the water, keep the shirt over your head, poke your head

05:03.760 --> 05:08.760
out of the water covered by the now wet shirt, you got a bubble of air in there.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.920
I mean, there's a million ways to use that.

05:09.920 --> 05:16.640
There's a million ways to use water to avoid a bee attack, and everyone's so fucking taken

05:16.640 --> 05:22.280
with their observation that the bees could be waiting for you when you come out.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.480
I don't care if they could be waiting for me.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.640
Also, anytime you're ever escaping anything, the thing you're escaping could be waiting

05:28.640 --> 05:29.640
for you at some point.

05:29.640 --> 05:35.040
It's even, they even say could be, which means, I'm going to say, a lot of times not, I'm

05:35.040 --> 05:39.040
going to say a lot of times if you jump into water, killer bees are like, ah, fuck it.

05:39.040 --> 05:43.960
What are we going to play the track is carbon dioxide sting his nose every three minutes

05:43.960 --> 05:48.960
game until he slowly dies over six months?

05:48.960 --> 05:52.880
It would be scary to have like one of those cartoon reeds that you use to breathe when

05:52.880 --> 05:55.040
you're hiding in a pond.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.360
And then the bees all pour into that, you know.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.960
I'm pretty sure that was like a Tom and Jerry cartoon.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.960
That's scary.

06:01.960 --> 06:07.920
I want to see the article about the guy who was in a killer bee attack and ran and jumped

06:07.920 --> 06:10.360
in the water.

06:10.360 --> 06:16.480
And because he jumped in the water, not in spite of jumping in the water, because he jumped

06:16.480 --> 06:18.240
in the water, he died.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.240
He got lost.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.400
If you're in the water and you're underwater and all you're emitting is bubbles, it's going

06:22.400 --> 06:24.000
to be mostly carbon dioxide.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
They're going to go.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.360
Oh, this guy, there's a carbon dioxide fountain right here.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.360
Hey, great.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
Guys right here.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.800
So, so don't go into the water if there's a house closer, right?

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
Don't go.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
God damn it.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
Oh, look at that house.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.800
It's a bee proof house.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.680
Oh, I see some water up there.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.400
What a better idea than the house.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.640
So don't do that.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.440
That's a way different rule.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.320
You're going to kill somebody with that rule.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.520
Don't jump in the water.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.720
What if that's all there is?

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
I just can't think.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.480
I mean, look, I love honey as much as the next person.

06:55.480 --> 07:00.880
And if I go getting in that honeycomb and I agitate the bees and they're coming after

07:00.880 --> 07:03.880
me, that's already a rarefied situation.

07:03.880 --> 07:04.880
That's not a usual.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.880
What we're talking about now.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
What we're talking about.

07:06.880 --> 07:11.240
There's a house and a pond like that's like, well, how often am I around just standing

07:11.240 --> 07:12.240
water anyway?

07:12.240 --> 07:13.240
Or a house in a pool.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.240
But no, we're talking.

07:14.240 --> 07:20.600
Look, we're talking about like you're cleaning out your tool shed and you move a sled.

07:20.600 --> 07:25.440
And there was a bee's nest in the wall and they start, they're Africanized.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.920
So they start going like this fuckers trying to take our honey.

07:28.920 --> 07:29.920
Get them.

07:29.920 --> 07:30.920
And you're like, what?

07:30.920 --> 07:31.920
I didn't try shit.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
Just moving a sled, bitches.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.280
And then you're like running.

07:34.280 --> 07:40.760
Like, like if your pool is closer than your house by five feet, okay, head for the house.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.320
Take a couple more stings for the team.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.720
For your kids.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
Live to tell the tale.

07:45.720 --> 07:54.880
With your coyote, like punch kick maneuver, let's say that you didn't have house or water

07:54.880 --> 07:59.240
resources available to you, a bunch of bees are on your ass.

07:59.240 --> 08:04.000
What would your like instinctive game master technique be to thwart them?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.160
And I don't know.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.440
I think that we're talking about the wrong problem and we really got to be addressing

08:10.440 --> 08:11.800
beyond bee crime.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.960
Well, you know, you know, they work with those queens.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.640
If the queen dies, then they start feeding the regular larva, royal jelly.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.760
But they don't just, they don't just make for one queen.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.720
They do a whole selection, a whole row.

08:26.720 --> 08:33.120
And then the first one to hatch, she goes and stings all the other queens to death in

08:33.120 --> 08:35.120
their cradle.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.920
But here's the thing.

08:36.920 --> 08:44.280
I stayed at a hotel this week that boasted an apiary 120,000 bees and four queens.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.320
I was like, geez, how did they have such can they have such control over how many queens

08:47.320 --> 08:48.320
there are?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.320
Really?

08:49.320 --> 08:50.320
I didn't know that was such a mathematical thing.

08:50.320 --> 08:57.600
They're like, our, our beehives have four queens and 120,000 bees come taste our honey.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.800
And then I started looking it up.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
I'm like, really?

08:59.800 --> 09:00.800
They have that much control.

09:00.800 --> 09:10.080
The whole science of a biology or whatever is, it is, the, the be the queens will live

09:10.080 --> 09:15.040
like five to seven years, but the older ones, they're not as productive.

09:15.040 --> 09:19.120
So a beekeeper, we think they're so cool, they're just like gathering honey.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.200
These fuckers are like the CIA in the fifties.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.680
They're like, they're, they're like dipping and dapping in the government.

09:24.680 --> 09:31.120
Like they, they just, they'll, they'll reach in or the, they'll wound the queen because

09:31.120 --> 09:37.520
if the queen becomes wounded, then the bees will produce more queens that are more vibrant.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.880
But typically what they'll do also is they don't even trust cause new queens are just

09:40.880 --> 09:42.280
as shitty as old queens.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.120
So they'll like trade and buy queens and just import them and just kill the queen and then

09:47.120 --> 09:51.920
drop a new one in there and be like, there's your new queen and the bees will be like fine

09:51.920 --> 09:53.800
with us cause we're fucking morons.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.680
It's like Sim City.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.680
You know what's weird about bees is they're like flying ants basically, whose avapositors

10:02.680 --> 10:10.880
have been adapted into stingers, but they, they don't do that pheromone thing, the ants

10:10.880 --> 10:11.880
have the pheromone trail.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.880
Oh, they don't smell.

10:12.880 --> 10:17.280
Well, honey bees, you know, they, they come back to the hive, you've seen the documentaries

10:17.280 --> 10:22.920
where they do the little dance, they do the little, the little clockwork, like they have

10:22.920 --> 10:27.400
an elaborate geometric code that like indicates coordinates.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Yeah.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.600
That's fun.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
It's crazy.

10:30.600 --> 10:34.720
I mean, thinking about the ways other animals communicate with each other is always this

10:34.720 --> 10:39.040
mind blowing thing to me because it's like, you know, even if it's, if it's very simplistic

10:39.040 --> 10:42.560
and basic, it's very crazy, but it's probably not simplistic and basic.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.440
It's probably just impossible to truly comprehend on a meaningful level.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.200
It's pretty crazy that they, yeah, they communicate with each other, but it doesn't, all it means

10:50.200 --> 10:54.520
is like, go get some pollen, like, like all their whole language is just for nothing.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.160
If anybody was looking down at us, they'd be like, yeah, look at all this shit.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
They're bullshit.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
Yeah.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
They love all these memes.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
They talk in memes.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.560
But all they're, all they're doing is like moving the oil from here and then trying to

11:05.560 --> 11:09.160
get to Mars, but they can't cars are probably some weird thing.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.520
Like from an outside perspective, it's like they have all this car stuff that's going

11:13.520 --> 11:16.240
all over the place and they get in and out of cars all the time.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.100
I'll tell you what bees haven't done aside from pollinating all of our flowers and

11:20.100 --> 11:25.960
giving us walnuts and, you know, all of the food that we, they've never sent a car into

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
space.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
No.

11:27.960 --> 11:34.840
And by the way, I dare, I challenge you bees to send a car into space and show us what

11:34.840 --> 11:35.840
you got.

11:35.840 --> 11:40.600
I can't wait, like, if this was a cartoon, if our life was a cartoon, like the cutaway

11:40.600 --> 11:47.000
gag would be like, like Star Trek Enterprises there and then they're like having a scene

11:47.000 --> 11:51.600
and then the Tesla comes and just smashes into the enterprise and kills everybody.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.600
Like that's going to happen.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.640
Like I can't wait until our future society is like taken out by that Tesla because we

11:56.640 --> 12:00.520
didn't think about the ramifications of just shooting something off into space.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
So dumb.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.760
They say that space junk is going to destroy all chance of exiting the planet.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.920
Aren't the Chinese working on some laser to go blow up all the space junk?

12:08.920 --> 12:09.920
God, I hope so.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.240
There's so much space junk that we have all these astrophysicists that are like watching

12:14.240 --> 12:18.520
the space junk to make sure we can launch stuff into space without it hitting space junk.

12:18.520 --> 12:23.920
Because if we get hit by space junk, it'll all make a chain reaction and cause an impenetrable

12:23.920 --> 12:27.160
web of space junk that renders our skies unleavable.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.160
You know what Elon Musk should have done is maybe, maybe he did.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.160
Maybe he did.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.960
Maybe he sent a car into space so he could put all that space junk in the trunk.

12:36.960 --> 12:37.960
Right.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.600
As this Elon Musk shooting a car into space in a country with a completely bankrupt space

12:42.600 --> 12:48.000
program that isn't doing shit in a world that has a shelf life on it of like 20 to 30 years

12:48.000 --> 12:50.160
max.

12:50.160 --> 12:57.120
The one guy who has a 30 year plan is like, I'd like to colonize Mars within the time

12:57.120 --> 12:59.040
that it's going to take for us to eat through the planet.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.520
Like, hey, you can shoot whatever he wants out of space.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.440
Like, like, like, it's not somebody like easy target, like fucking things like all my friends

13:06.440 --> 13:12.320
like, like rolling their eyes and like, I guess he doesn't care about starving children.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.520
What the, what in the fuck?

13:13.520 --> 13:18.080
You know how many people are going to starve if we don't get the fuck off this whole planet?

13:18.080 --> 13:20.560
Like the guy is like, what is he like?

13:20.560 --> 13:25.200
Go pick up Philip Morris, Jesus Christ, the guy is just a cool rich guy, like flinging

13:25.200 --> 13:26.200
shit into space.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.400
It's like, how the shit else is anything going to get done around here?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.960
You got to throw cars out there.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.760
I don't know about, you know, he made those flamethrowers.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.760
I don't know.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.680
That seems kind of, what are you trying to pull?

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
Why are you making flamethrowers?

13:37.680 --> 13:41.560
I think it's Joe because he's a Bond villain and that he like, I don't know.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.800
Yeah, but if your joke is that, and then you start like producing C4 explosives for fun

13:45.800 --> 13:48.840
and profit, like, I mean, aren't you just doing that?

13:48.840 --> 13:52.840
I don't think that he's in the, in the sense that maybe we are, I don't think that he's

13:52.840 --> 13:56.680
an out and out, like liberal, I don't think that he thinks that everything needs to be

13:56.680 --> 13:59.400
regulated and, and maybe sat and stuff.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.160
You might be something closer to a libertarian.

14:01.160 --> 14:06.000
We probably have political differences in the, in, in that regard, but the same kind

14:06.000 --> 14:11.760
of hubris, is it like he gets shit done and he doesn't start a go fund me to say like,

14:11.760 --> 14:15.760
Hey, if we all put our hands together, maybe we can pray and get into space and like, but

14:15.760 --> 14:17.520
it's like, he just does crazy shit.

14:17.520 --> 14:21.240
It's like, well, I'll just make baseball hats and I'll fund an entire fucking piece

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
of space equipment.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.680
And it's like, people buy it.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.720
Like there's like, he, to me, he represents the interesting aspect of like, like, like

14:28.720 --> 14:33.760
when we talk about capitalism's evils, we're really talking about unimaginative pieces

14:33.760 --> 14:35.280
of shit who are cheating.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.800
They're not actually capitalists.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.200
They're thieves because they're not interested in competing.

14:39.200 --> 14:45.160
They're not interested in, um, uh, uh, you know, like actual, um, stirring of the economy.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.840
They want to like miser their money and like use it to just like make more money and they're

14:49.840 --> 14:51.720
like, not even actually playing the game.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
Right.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.800
And people who are like, Hey, you know, people are greedy.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.440
People don't want to donate stuff.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.720
People don't want to pitch in.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.320
So maybe if I said, look at this fucking cool thing, would you give me a dollar and then

15:03.320 --> 15:07.040
everyone wants to be cool and gives me a dollar and it raises all this money that couldn't

15:07.040 --> 15:10.360
otherwise be raised by Sally Struthers crying into a camera.

15:10.360 --> 15:14.800
And we use it to then try to further the species before it goes extinct.

15:14.800 --> 15:19.280
Like like I have some, what like Hail Mary or something like the guy does have plans.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.040
No one else has a fucking plan.

15:21.040 --> 15:27.080
Like, like, like the closest guy, the second place plan to his is, I don't know, some guy

15:27.080 --> 15:29.720
we had on our show that wants college to be more affordable.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.600
And then the third after that is a fucking Nazi that wants to build a wall.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.080
Who's that?

15:35.080 --> 15:37.360
I ain't got no plan.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.360
Charles Fleischer.

15:38.360 --> 15:42.240
Yeah, we'll have him on as a guest to defend his wall.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.240
But I don't know.

15:44.240 --> 15:51.120
His theory is that if you build a wall around Charles Fleischer, it'll help, it'll amplify

15:51.120 --> 15:53.120
his voice.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.120
All right.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.120
There was it.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
All right.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
Well, let's bring up Rob Schrab.

15:58.120 --> 16:05.120
Rob Schrab at the stage, everybody.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.120
Yo.

16:06.120 --> 16:21.200
Now down to worship the man that you don't deserve, Rob Chippy Pippy Schrab.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.200
Hello, everyone.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
Hello, Jeffrey.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
What's up, Rob?

16:27.200 --> 16:34.200
Is it true that somebody changed your Wikipedia page to Rob Chippy Pippy Schrab?

16:34.200 --> 16:37.000
Because I saw a little something.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Was it you?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.240
No, but I didn't know if that was a photo.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.240
Be honest.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.240
It was not me.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.240
I swear to God.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.240
Would you know how to do it?

16:43.240 --> 16:47.520
I mean, I could probably Photoshop it if you gave me an afternoon, but that was either

16:47.520 --> 16:49.800
a bit that somebody was doing?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.560
I'm pretty sure it's a bit.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.560
Yeah.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.560
I don't think that's my name.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.720
You don't think someone actually thought they were correcting the record?

16:55.720 --> 17:02.480
Because I don't really know how the vicissitudes of Wikipedia work, because my Wikipedia page

17:02.480 --> 17:05.240
is hilariously inaccurate.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.960
So maybe someone could just go on and change your, give you a nickname on it.

17:09.960 --> 17:10.960
Yeah.

17:10.960 --> 17:11.960
Yeah.

17:11.960 --> 17:12.960
Yeah.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.000
But in the, I mean, look, I don't want to start rehash the argument, but it did.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.600
It seemed conclusive that Rob's a Chippy Pippy, like from that story, like it wasn't,

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
he got mad about it.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
Yeah.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
I mean, think about it.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
He wanted to try dance.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
Try Pat.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
Yeah.

17:26.600 --> 17:27.600
Just think about it.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.400
I mean, if you put it under the microscope, I think that it's really, really the only

17:30.400 --> 17:35.600
thing you can conclude from that, will you fucking turn your phone on mute?

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
That was my fault.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
I was texting Steve.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
All right.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.600
Wait.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
Okay.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
Look, anybody else would do that.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
He would hit the roof.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.000
He'd be like, hey, I'm trying to talk.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
I run a tight show.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm trying to talk.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
He just texts.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Turn your kill and your mentions off.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Fuck, dude.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I'm trying to.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm trying to.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, careful.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I'm trying to.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Nothing but order around here.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
I'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Why do you make flame throwers?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I'm trying to talk about Elon Musk.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It's a bond villain joke.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I want to talk about a bond villain.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
But he really did it, though.

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
What do you think people are going to do with those flame throwers?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Clear brush?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.760
They're going to hang them on the wall and say, I got one of 20,000 flame throwers

18:19.760 --> 18:24.360
that I think it's cool that that the fucking historical dude made.

18:24.360 --> 18:28.360
I think he's cool that he's making space travel interesting again.

18:28.360 --> 18:33.320
I mean, we used to be so excited about it and in those and then we all got bored by

18:33.320 --> 18:34.320
it.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.320
Yeah.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.320
And we're all like, fuck this.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.320
This is too.

18:37.320 --> 18:41.680
And then everybody's going, yay, we're doing something futuristic again.

18:41.680 --> 18:45.160
It's amazing that the Falcon Heavy is an amazing piece of equipment.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.160
I love it.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.560
You would have done it different.

18:47.560 --> 18:51.880
I would have been scared up watching it because it's so magnificent.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.560
And then just the red convertible.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.960
It's like it's just like you couldn't have picked a more midlife crisis thing to put

18:56.960 --> 18:57.960
in space.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.560
Well, he's going through his midlife crisis.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.560
Thank God.

19:00.560 --> 19:01.560
Yeah, good.

19:01.560 --> 19:02.560
But say that.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.240
But he's like, oh, he kind of laughed it off.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
He grew up.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.480
He saw heavy metal as a kid and went, I want to do that.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
And he does this.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.480
Yeah.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.120
And it's like, it's like, imagine all the kids going like, look, I didn't know you

19:15.120 --> 19:16.800
could just fucking do anything.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.640
Well, like, like, like, I didn't know space for me.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.760
The space shuttle was like that because it didn't look like a dumb ass rocket.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
Like, like it all of a sudden had wings.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.480
So remember them.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.880
They would just be like these dumb ass rockets, man.

19:29.880 --> 19:30.880
Yeah.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
Remember that?

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
You.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.880
USA.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.240
I think the player will come from here.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.240
Don't you agree with me?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.240
Fuck those things.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
Fuck you.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.240
They look like missiles.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.040
No, the Saturn five is the greatest thing that humans have ever built.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.120
It looks like a fucking missile.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
And you know it.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.600
It looked like a fucking dumb, like, God damn.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.040
It's not a big old dick.

19:54.040 --> 19:58.680
Because there wasn't a Tesla inside it and there wasn't a pool.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
What do you want?

19:59.680 --> 20:05.440
You wanted a suit to come out of the I wanted a big bucket of Viagra to pour out of it.

20:05.440 --> 20:11.760
And just fucking just like what what says midlife crisis erectile dysfunction more than

20:11.760 --> 20:14.680
sending your your hotshot convertible.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.480
I know and yes, and he had the fucking belly playing.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.200
I know it made people like space more.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.320
But if you had to make you like space, remember to the space.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.360
So it would have been better if you did not space, huh?

20:26.360 --> 20:27.600
It would have been better if he did nothing.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.760
I would have.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.880
I would have liked to have been in the conversation and was throwing a couple of ideas.

20:31.880 --> 20:32.880
Yeah.

20:32.880 --> 20:33.880
Jeff in the decision.

20:33.880 --> 20:34.880
Well, he might.

20:34.880 --> 20:35.880
He might.

20:35.880 --> 20:39.080
You know, we're we're more within reach of getting him on this podcast than any podcast

20:39.080 --> 20:40.160
I could ever name.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.160
You hear me, Marin?

20:41.160 --> 20:44.640
And now again, we're blowing it.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.800
We're blowing it.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.520
I would say again, I would have sent a instead of the concrete block that they used to simulate

20:50.520 --> 20:52.720
mass for the for the for the payload.

20:52.720 --> 21:02.280
I would have sent an enormous cuff link, because I think that sends them just one, just one

21:02.280 --> 21:08.400
because the implication is we're not ready yet, folks or if if there is intelligent life

21:08.400 --> 21:12.560
out there and they see one giant cuff link out there, they're going to go, oh, the snake

21:12.560 --> 21:13.560
monster.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.240
They're asking us to make contact.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.040
Oh, we're going to link up.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.040
What?

21:18.040 --> 21:20.440
I mean, he's got like the world is watching.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.800
He could have done anything.

21:21.800 --> 21:26.680
He could have opened up the nose going opened up, and it would have been like just a big

21:26.680 --> 21:30.040
but that was wasn't it?

21:30.040 --> 21:33.360
I mean, well, what does your butt look like?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.200
Well, does it look like a car?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.200
It kind of was.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
It's a car.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.700
Not a but.

21:38.700 --> 21:39.700
Wait.

21:39.700 --> 21:40.700
Are you pro car or not?

21:40.700 --> 21:46.520
I'm not with me and pro anti you because you cheapy peeping him.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.200
You gave him the heavy, cheapy peeping me.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.200
You're making fun of me.

21:50.200 --> 21:57.880
Can I get you cheap peeping shots at your friend when you offered saying, hey, could

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
I do this?

21:58.880 --> 21:59.880
Can I get you?

21:59.880 --> 22:03.040
You're the one who started vilifying me in the story about you coming to pick it up and

22:03.040 --> 22:04.040
we giving you a drink.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
You were the villain.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
I didn't.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
I was the villain.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.120
How does a villain give people iPads?

22:09.120 --> 22:12.880
What what what country are you from?

22:12.880 --> 22:14.040
I'm from the same country.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.040
You are.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.040
You know this.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
We've known each.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.040
I've known you since you were 19.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.040
That's a rhetorical question.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
Okay.

22:21.040 --> 22:28.480
Can I can I shift our target so that we can for once in our friendship know the same enemy

22:28.480 --> 22:31.960
because I met the biggest asshole in the world tonight.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.960
Oh, shit.

22:32.960 --> 22:39.080
The worst server far cry from biggest asshole servers are, you know, at least

22:39.080 --> 22:47.240
they're serving as bartender at Rust again.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.240
He comes over.

22:48.240 --> 22:56.080
He's got a big giant tray covered in like, like shots that look like kind of reddish.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.240
Like, you don't know what's in them.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.840
You know, that's a there's a mixture of something.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.160
It's not like, I bet there are Washington apples.

23:02.160 --> 23:11.080
He comes over and he goes shot shot and he puts one down in front of Waldron one down

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
in front of me.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.240
And I go, I go, what is it?

23:15.240 --> 23:19.440
And he as if he couldn't wait to be asked that like, obviously he goes and he stops

23:19.440 --> 23:26.920
and he goes like, why is it that people always ask that when they're getting free shit?

23:26.920 --> 23:30.520
And I was like, and I was like, and what is it?

23:30.520 --> 23:35.200
And he's like, it's a fucking apple, apple, japple, crapple, napple, whatever the fuck.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.200
He keeps going away.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.480
And I'm like, by the way, fuck you.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.280
What in the fucking rape culture?

23:42.280 --> 23:43.280
What is this?

23:43.280 --> 23:45.080
How about rape culture?

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
Herpes is free.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.080
What the hell?

23:47.080 --> 23:48.080
I'm not a materialistic person.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.080
Definitely rape culture.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.040
I just want to know what the fuck is in my drink.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.040
You asshole.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.320
What if I have a fucking allergy?

23:53.320 --> 23:56.320
What the fuck are you talking about with the free?

23:56.320 --> 24:00.320
You're not fucking Prometheus because you're robbing your employer and pouring free shots

24:00.320 --> 24:03.920
because by the way, then he turns down the jukebox after everyone's got the shot.

24:03.920 --> 24:09.040
He turns down the jukebox and he makes this announcement, this weird fucking millennial

24:09.040 --> 24:13.320
twee story about how his mom's car broke down and this is the song that was playing

24:13.320 --> 24:14.320
when it broke.

24:14.320 --> 24:20.520
I don't even, I couldn't even, my, my, my Gen X, like fucking anti-twee shield just

24:20.520 --> 24:22.320
like filtered it all out.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.960
I get all I heard was him talking in this Kermit the Frog voice, like monopolizing everyone's

24:27.960 --> 24:33.040
attention because his giving of free shots was of course tasted like shit.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.040
Of course they did.

24:34.040 --> 24:38.600
I now have diabetes and whatever the fuck he has on his fingers.

24:38.600 --> 24:43.400
I drank it out of obligation to his fucking mom who lost her car.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.160
Worst person, worst person I've met all day.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.040
What, what was the song?

24:47.040 --> 24:49.200
I don't know.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.640
What is a twee?

24:51.640 --> 24:57.280
Twee was a phrase we started using in the, like early thousands to kind of dismiss the

24:57.280 --> 24:58.280
emerging kind of.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.920
I had to look up an urban dictionary word today.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Including me.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.080
I mean, I don't know, maybe not you, obviously you're asking what twee is.

25:06.080 --> 25:09.960
It's a word that people started using to be kind of like every refer to everything Zoe

25:09.960 --> 25:12.480
Deschanel was doing.

25:12.480 --> 25:17.200
Anything you wanted to be dismissive of because it was a dorkable or, or, or, you know, like,

25:17.200 --> 25:22.200
like, like songs that, that, that have toys, ylophones in them or it was like kind of saccharine,

25:22.200 --> 25:23.200
cutesy pie.

25:23.200 --> 25:27.400
And I just sort of like the, the, the, the, the adult, the adult children that were starting

25:27.400 --> 25:29.520
to release like cute music.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
The Bjorks.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.520
Yeah.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
Yeah.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
Yeah.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.520
Yeah.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.520
I imagine twee being a very subjective phrase.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.520
You could argue that Bjork was twee.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.920
But then again, she's also like very, you know, like she's been around for a long time

25:39.920 --> 25:41.520
and put, you know, doesn't just.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
You're a fan.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.600
Of course I'm a Bjork fan.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.600
We should get her on the show.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
I'll tweet her.

25:48.600 --> 25:56.520
I wrote a joke as I pulled up with church today.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.520
I told Dan.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.520
Dan was pretty, pretty excited about it.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.520
What is that joke?

25:59.520 --> 26:01.520
Dan was pretty excited about it.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.520
I'm still workshopping.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.440
I'm still, I'm still workshopping at church.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.760
I think it's ready for the big time.

26:07.760 --> 26:12.920
Church almost, church was almost beside herself with gale laughter.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.160
No, I, I happened upon that scene.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.160
Church was.

26:16.160 --> 26:22.120
She was, we were talking about Stephen Tyler from Aerosmith and well, we were talking about

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
the Beatles.

26:23.120 --> 26:28.240
Well, the joke was involving the evolution of, of people like screaming, you know, like

26:28.240 --> 26:30.240
in songs and stuff like that.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.760
And so I'm still workshopping and this is not a finished product.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.760
This is why we have podcasts.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
Let's hear you're happy.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
Yeah.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
Maybe read it tomorrow.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.760
Maybe read it tomorrow.

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
Help me perfect this.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.760
Oh yeah.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.360
They usually add value.

26:43.360 --> 26:55.080
What ingredients does Stephen Tyler of Aerosmith use to make his Irish coffee extra special?

26:55.080 --> 26:57.600
It's worse than when I encourage you to.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
It's kind of worse.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.200
What was the original setup?

27:01.200 --> 27:02.640
Well, it was just, what's his favorite liqueur?

27:02.640 --> 27:03.640
Oh yeah.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.640
What, what is Stephen?

27:04.640 --> 27:05.640
Okay.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.640
Let's keep it simple.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.640
What, what is Aerosmith Stephen Tyler's favorite liqueur?

27:08.640 --> 27:09.640
What?

27:09.640 --> 27:10.640
Cripple cacao!

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
I do.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
I do.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.640
I'm sorry.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.880
That's, that again is a fucking perfect joke.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.560
That's a timeless.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.640
You'll be telling it to your grandchildren.

27:20.640 --> 27:27.960
You know, long after Elon Musk's Tesla has fucking, like degraded into the sun's gravity.

27:27.960 --> 27:35.400
Yeah, a guy who floats puns like that is offended by our roadster, a space-bound roadster that's

27:35.400 --> 27:39.120
collecting data about radiation and all kinds of spacecraft.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.120
Thank God.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.120
Your job is to love cars in space.

27:41.120 --> 27:46.800
job is to write perfect timeless jokes. I gotta say I heard you tell that joke

27:46.800 --> 27:52.880
outside the castle and I didn't actually hear it properly I just

27:52.880 --> 27:56.760
heard like the what do you call it? The payoff of the punch line. No just like the

27:56.760 --> 28:02.560
the way the band like the way you talk and you were already repulsed. And so no

28:02.560 --> 28:06.160
I had to fill in with like just my own brain based on your cadences and stuff

28:06.160 --> 28:11.440
and so my what I heard your version of the joke was what's Steven Tyler's

28:11.440 --> 28:17.080
favorite vegetable cuckoo cuckoo kale. And then I was like this seems like a

28:17.080 --> 28:23.360
bad joke. Yes because you misheard my perfect joke. No I didn't do it right don't

28:23.360 --> 28:28.560
get me wrong. See there's jokes that last like the Parthenon still stands not in

28:28.560 --> 28:33.800
its former glory but that's eons of time has passed this joke will be one of

28:33.800 --> 28:37.680
those jokes that we will all be telling. Yeah no one's arguing. Yeah I have a

28:37.680 --> 28:43.880
question. What do you guys church hates it. What do you guys think dogs think music

28:43.880 --> 28:49.520
is and do they do they understand that it's a it's coming through a speaker

28:49.520 --> 28:53.920
because they they sit and act like it's fucking nothing but if a dog barks in a

28:53.920 --> 29:00.320
movie they lose right shit. Well I've got like music I got a playlist that's like

29:00.320 --> 29:04.600
music for dogs. I play that while I stretch after my exercise. I play that

29:04.600 --> 29:07.760
like sometimes when I leave the apartment. And I do feel like the dogs

29:07.760 --> 29:13.040
fucking like it. Yeah I mean it's but it's weird. It's like or there there's

29:13.040 --> 29:16.480
like I don't know what it's basically class. It's classical music that has

29:16.480 --> 29:22.080
certain like tonalities in it that relaxes the dog and I would put it on

29:22.080 --> 29:27.320
every time Kate and I would leave so Lolly wouldn't freak out and feel sad

29:27.320 --> 29:33.640
because like my heart goes out to her because all we are are all she has is

29:33.640 --> 29:39.600
us and we are about to leave and and I would put it on and it would work but

29:39.600 --> 29:44.120
then there would get to a point where when she would hear that music it meant

29:44.120 --> 29:51.640
we're leaving. Oh and then she would get she would put on the act get ready. Yeah

29:51.640 --> 29:55.240
she would be like I'll just play a little bit of I think it's it's classical so

29:55.240 --> 29:58.280
it's really not. I don't think. So the music would go on like this.

29:58.280 --> 30:03.880
Kevin Day's gonna be like you can't you play them. Oh Spotify has been paused

30:03.880 --> 30:07.320
because your account is being used. The dogs are listening to this right now.

30:07.320 --> 30:20.960
Sorry. This music would go on and then Lolly would look at Kate and I at the

30:20.960 --> 30:34.760
door like. He's acting. Dogs like really sad music this is the dog of music like

30:34.760 --> 30:38.160
it's got puppy dog eyes this music. I kind of like it I've come to really like

30:38.160 --> 30:42.320
it because I shower with it. This is like the Snoopy go home. This is like I switch from two

30:42.320 --> 30:48.440
fighters to this after after I've ripped my fucking delts after I fucking blasted

30:48.440 --> 30:54.920
them. You love blasting delts. I like blasted on delts. I fucking blasted my

30:54.920 --> 31:02.680
delts. Where are your delts. Shoulders. I might be right. Yeah nice try. Dan what

31:02.680 --> 31:07.720
was the last time you got your big on my big. Yeah when you got your big on B.I.G.

31:07.720 --> 31:11.960
my your big my biceps. You know when you got your you get when you're

31:11.960 --> 31:15.960
when you're when you do you want to know if I've become swole. Did you get

31:15.960 --> 31:23.760
your big on. I'm trying to get swole on the reg. Yeah. Yeah. Fam. Yeah. So you said

31:23.760 --> 31:28.560
but I switched to this when I do my Vitruvians with my weights and then and

31:28.560 --> 31:33.520
then my stretching and I find it calms me down. Maybe I'm a dog. But anyways I'm

31:33.520 --> 31:37.960
just saying like a dog is a dog is there was a dog at the rustic in you know and

31:37.960 --> 31:42.800
it's sitting there and it's like at its owner's feet and I get so distracted

31:42.800 --> 31:46.080
because I'm like I'm trying to talk to Waldron about the movie we're working on

31:46.080 --> 31:50.840
and I what movie can't tell you. Oh what movie can't tell you. I get right over

31:50.840 --> 32:05.520
Oh we want a movie. We like what a fucking. Is it gumby. It's it's as dumb. I

32:05.520 --> 32:10.360
like I'm still writing shit that dumb yes for hire which means for getting

32:10.360 --> 32:15.440
fired a year from now. But I could I was distracted by this dog because there's a

32:15.440 --> 32:18.520
dog in a bar like I'm always I know that someone's eventually going to step on

32:18.520 --> 32:24.120
its tail or something. It drives me nuts. But I was just watching the dog and it's

32:24.120 --> 32:28.240
just like you know I was only fucking music playing and as people talking I

32:28.240 --> 32:32.320
was wondering what is the dog like how does it stay sane. And also if it

32:32.320 --> 32:37.000
understands does it understand that the jukebox is playing like oh that's like a

32:37.000 --> 32:41.320
guy they like to listen to each other bark and then they must be really pissed

32:41.320 --> 32:45.000
like because we're like when we get mad that they're barking they're like I

32:45.000 --> 32:49.720
can't fucking say one thing around here like these people are always talking

32:49.720 --> 32:53.400
well they're not talking they're listening to talking well well dogs react

32:53.400 --> 32:59.240
to different sounds differently like Lolly will there be this car driving

32:59.240 --> 33:03.360
all over the place whatever people are walking down like that down to the

33:03.360 --> 33:09.720
sidewalks he doesn't give a shit. Skateboard. She goes fucking nuts man. She

33:09.720 --> 33:14.860
does not like skateboard sounds when she hears the cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck

33:14.860 --> 33:19.480
going down to size. Goes fucking crazy goes fucking crazy. Here's the dump

33:19.480 --> 33:26.800
truck goes fucking crazy. Here's the bus. I don't care. Here's a bicycle. I don't

33:26.800 --> 33:31.820
give a shit. What is that? That's gotta be frequency stuff like. Yeah but it's

33:31.820 --> 33:39.340
Like we were talking about this like a couple times, you know now that there's like HD screens and things like that more and more dogs

33:39.340 --> 33:45.060
Are paying attention to the screen when it was like standard death, right? They didn't give a shit, but now

33:45.740 --> 33:48.180
Lolli will stare and watch

33:49.100 --> 33:51.620
TV with me and will go

33:52.340 --> 34:00.220
Absolutely crazy when any kind of cartoon dog. Yeah, we can't watch the animals. Yeah, I can't play video games with the animals

34:00.220 --> 34:07.460
No, no, no, and it's not and it's and it's dogs like Brian from family guy, which is a bipedal

34:07.460 --> 34:11.620
He's like holding drinks and he's talking like that. Lolli will go cheese

34:12.860 --> 34:15.780
So she recognizes a non quadrupedal

34:17.660 --> 34:20.460
Screen she would go crazy, but would not give up

34:22.300 --> 34:26.300
Intervention episode and there was a fucking Harvey just starts going ape shit and

34:26.300 --> 34:28.220
uh

34:28.220 --> 34:32.900
Ken Ceeley's talking and and he's like you gotta recover you gotta you don't understand

34:32.900 --> 34:36.380
Is this a problem your sister has you got a supporter and Harvey's like

34:36.700 --> 34:43.260
Like what is it Harvey? What is he? You don't like his enabling and there's like he's in a another shitty intervention hotel

34:43.260 --> 34:50.900
There's a fucking drawing a shitty drawing like just a minimalist fucking like Zen crap art like

34:50.900 --> 34:57.820
Hotel art like idea of a dog like piece of art on the wall. It was like a like a couple lines

34:57.820 --> 35:00.380
You'd use to make the shape of a dog and he's like

35:04.100 --> 35:10.300
When I was when I was editing the Portuguese gremlins trailer for for community

35:10.300 --> 35:15.540
This is this is my favorite joke and it's you don't know it. I've never told it's not jokes more of an anecdote

35:15.580 --> 35:17.580
But I will continue anyway

35:17.580 --> 35:26.460
Lollie was sitting there next to me while we're doing it and there's the point where the the eyes change where it's just like the

35:26.740 --> 35:32.180
Gremlin looking into the screen with its cat eyes, which I went to a taxidermist and I got like

35:32.700 --> 35:36.220
Real like animal eyes and it's just the face going

35:36.740 --> 35:41.700
Like a freeze frame of it and its eyes change color. Lollie went fucking crazy

35:41.700 --> 35:50.020
Easy just went crazy that this this like Bobcat. I think was looking through the magic window at her

35:50.020 --> 35:53.940
Yeah, I told the story on air of that like when I was married to McGathey. She

35:55.060 --> 36:01.780
She she recorded Harvey and then she airplayed it and then she recorded him

36:02.460 --> 36:08.100
reacting to him being airplayed and then she recorded that and then airplayed that and I

36:08.100 --> 36:12.740
And I came into the room because the sound Harvey was making we're so fucking insane

36:13.340 --> 36:19.260
Because it was like he was he was either losing his mind or worse gaining it

36:19.260 --> 36:21.860
Yeah, he was I think he was consciousness was coming

36:22.860 --> 36:29.180
So honey if you keep doing this thing has a jaw that can snap our throats in half

36:31.100 --> 36:34.940
It's only kept in line by its ignorance

36:34.940 --> 36:39.780
So you're making itself aware. It's gonna be waiting for us in the kitchen one morning with

36:40.500 --> 36:43.340
The neighbors head on a plate. Why don't you eat out of the bowl?

36:44.940 --> 36:48.780
What so wait a minute when you say he she's she's airplane

36:48.780 --> 36:54.100
Well, I mean like she's she's was she doing video of him and then putting it on the big screen

36:54.220 --> 36:57.380
Yeah, she's video. Yeah, she had two devices going

36:57.380 --> 37:04.820
Was was Harvey like looking at yeah, he was he was looking at the back of himself barking at the TV

37:04.820 --> 37:10.060
Which had a Harvey on it that was barking the original was you know, it was like enter the dragon with Bruce Lee

37:10.060 --> 37:15.540
Yeah, it was like an infinity Harvey and everyone and the real life Harvey was like progressively going

37:15.540 --> 37:20.540
I am

37:22.900 --> 37:29.300
Have you ever like taken like like a wind-up like dog toy or any kind of like

37:29.580 --> 37:37.380
You know quadruped like a thing that barks or wind up a robot dog thing and put it in front of Nigel and Harvey

37:37.380 --> 37:46.040
I can't I don't remember we I've done this with Lollie like maybe three times in my life with her

37:46.300 --> 37:49.660
Thinking like this will be cute. She'll like oh, what this cute toy?

37:49.660 --> 37:55.620
I wait we got like this dog toy that was like all furry you turn it on and it walks

37:57.220 --> 37:59.380
And walks walks walk and barks like bark

38:00.700 --> 38:02.700
Put it down

38:02.700 --> 38:09.100
Lollie hits the fucking roof. She's just like jeez. What is what is this?

38:09.860 --> 38:11.860
What is this thing?

38:12.220 --> 38:13.860
What is this?

38:13.860 --> 38:15.860
Why is this thing?

38:16.020 --> 38:19.340
It has no soul. What is this?

38:19.740 --> 38:25.300
Why are you doing turning off? Get it away from me. Get it away

38:25.300 --> 38:33.380
Hey, what is this? Lollie could not handle it. I put it out there to the fans to put that to music at some point

38:33.380 --> 38:37.500
Well, it's like it's like it's send that to my Twitter account or to Harmontown.com

38:38.340 --> 38:43.740
Imagine if I brought in like a real pay you top dollar for the robot human person to walk

38:46.060 --> 38:48.940
Yeah, well if octopus creatures came from outer space

38:48.940 --> 38:55.620
And they and the the flying saucer door came open and they came out and they looked at us for a second

38:55.620 --> 38:59.460
And then they took some measurements with octopus rulers and then they went they went

39:00.020 --> 39:05.500
And they went back inside and then that came down. It's like this fucked up like

39:07.180 --> 39:09.180
Hello

39:09.300 --> 39:11.300
From octopus world

39:11.300 --> 39:17.180
My name is Frank. It's like it's like watching fucking polar express

39:17.180 --> 39:20.660
Did you the did Lollie watch shape of water? What did you think about it?

39:21.420 --> 39:27.500
No, she didn't yeah, and she hasn't yet because she hasn't seen it. She answer one

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
Oh

39:37.180 --> 39:42.860
The fucking dogs dogs every morning going to light a rose every goddamn morning eight o'clock

39:42.860 --> 39:47.440
I get up. I work out because I'm fucking so early. That's the early time and

39:47.660 --> 39:51.260
Did you get your big on same time every morning dash my neighbor's cat?

39:51.980 --> 39:53.980
comes over and

39:53.980 --> 39:58.540
The same same it's got the same cup of coffee. It like hangs out in my yard

39:59.540 --> 40:04.140
Fucking Harvey and Nigel just like these guys like it's just like I

40:05.140 --> 40:07.660
Just what is it like? What does it like to be a dog?

40:07.660 --> 40:13.260
Like they just they are meeting that cat for the first time and each other for the first time every five minutes

40:13.260 --> 40:15.460
Like they're just so amazed that there's a cat in the yard

40:15.460 --> 40:19.820
And they're just like like just yelling at it like are they yelling get away?

40:19.820 --> 40:24.340
Are they yelling get over here like I had a cat and they were relentless

40:24.340 --> 40:29.900
They would Harvey wouldn't leave the fucking cat alone like I it was the I regret it for the rest of my life

40:29.900 --> 40:32.380
subjecting to that I think like I think

40:33.180 --> 40:36.780
like Lolly barks at big dogs and

40:37.180 --> 40:43.220
Any dog that stares her down like and I don't think it's I don't think she's like

40:43.220 --> 40:51.940
I'm afraid of you. So my reaction is to make a lot of noise and and jump around and get you to run away

40:52.140 --> 40:56.860
Because you probably will eat me and I think your Harvey

40:57.500 --> 40:59.500
Thinks he's a small dog. I

41:00.100 --> 41:01.700
think

41:01.700 --> 41:05.660
But but but I know that if I let him out when the cat was there

41:05.660 --> 41:10.060
Yeah, I know the cat would run away right if he came running out because he's a giant dog

41:10.060 --> 41:15.300
But I also know and maybe this is to your point kind of but he wouldn't eat it

41:15.300 --> 41:22.220
He wouldn't like no attack it. He would terrorize it because he's a fucking giant fucking moron

41:22.340 --> 41:26.220
But like like the cat would be traumatized, but he would like run out

41:26.220 --> 41:31.720
He would want to he wants to play with the cat. Why do you bark at something you want to play with?

41:31.720 --> 41:37.480
I think he's confused. I think yeah, I think he's running up and going

41:37.480 --> 41:43.600
Are you a friend or a friend? But you look like you don't you look you're not responding the way you should but friend friend

41:43.600 --> 41:52.160
No, no, no, I think he's class. Let's see other thing. It's like they're the weird selective ability for dogs to be a part of our world

41:52.400 --> 41:54.400
Like they understand almost

41:55.120 --> 41:59.600
Perfectly where your front yard is they they they have like this these weird

41:59.600 --> 42:05.880
They just blend into your world. They understand what windows are they know that they can't get through them

42:05.880 --> 42:13.800
So they just stand there and bark at them and they they don't even ever try to like bang their head against the glass to get through

42:13.800 --> 42:20.200
It they don't forget that glasses is an invisible barrier, but they don't remember what the fucking cat is

42:20.200 --> 42:28.460
They're just like so goddamn amazed that it's a cat silverman had like a great theory about like a dog's perspective of an elevator

42:28.460 --> 42:30.460
Like they've got to think it's a time machine

42:31.720 --> 42:35.880
Like you go in the doors open up and now the furniture is different. What's going on here?

42:35.880 --> 42:37.880
All right, I must be ten years in the future

42:38.280 --> 42:43.100
And I was like that's a fucking Pixar movie. You gotta do that. I wonder if they do that

42:43.100 --> 42:50.120
I wonder what that would be called up. I wonder if they keep track. It's called it's called puppet and elevator and

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
The soundtrack is by Stephen Taylor

42:53.200 --> 42:56.000
I wonder if they keep they put that they keep track

42:56.000 --> 42:57.520
of

42:57.520 --> 43:03.400
Up in an elevator and all that stuff like we would if we were if we didn't have certain

43:04.000 --> 43:08.560
Advantages we would think it was a time machine, but they're like I'm going up three floors

43:08.560 --> 43:10.640
I'm going up like 30 dog units

43:10.640 --> 43:15.520
You know like they because they you know all those stories about dogs that like they jump out a window

43:15.520 --> 43:21.360
And then they find their way home and you know, they they like they're they're like always they have like a little GPS in their head

43:21.360 --> 43:26.880
So they're probably like, oh, I'm in a box and it's got no windows. I wish I had a window so I could stick my head out of it

43:26.880 --> 43:32.960
What's up with that shit dogs the dogs you put a cat in a car and the cats like god damn it

43:32.960 --> 43:37.240
What the fuck is this god damn it get me out of here? Are you fucking kidding me?

43:37.240 --> 43:40.080
I mean, I don't I didn't want to be in this the smallest space

43:41.160 --> 43:44.920
Involuntarily in the first place now it's moving. Are you out of your goddamn mind?

43:44.920 --> 43:48.840
I'm gonna piss on your face if I can like it's rare to find a cat

43:48.840 --> 43:56.560
That's like down with a with a joy ride. They kind of either go catatonic or they just fucking like it freak out dogs

43:56.560 --> 44:01.160
It's just like I can't believe they stick their head out the window. They're into it

44:03.160 --> 44:05.160
They're throwing them a tennis ball

44:06.480 --> 44:10.400
Like Lolly will look out the window and just be like

44:11.320 --> 44:13.320
It's insane

44:13.320 --> 44:20.360
Shit that would be what is going on here. It's like my legs aren't moving, but I'm running really fast

44:21.000 --> 44:25.160
What is going on? I can't believe what is just down with that?

44:25.680 --> 44:32.480
Well, it's like if we if we were experiencing something that we just didn't understand and it just kept happening to us we would be

44:33.640 --> 44:35.080
Fascinated by it

44:35.080 --> 44:36.680
Yeah, I would be well

44:36.680 --> 44:39.200
I know but it's like it first and foremost

44:39.200 --> 44:43.640
I agree with the cat and the cat's cats are smart to like cats never get used to it

44:43.640 --> 44:45.880
They never come around and go like that on the other hand

44:45.880 --> 44:52.400
It's kind of cool to be really fast cat like and taste the wind like cats love running quickly and cats love the world

44:52.400 --> 44:55.880
Cats love to look at things like but dogs are just like look man

44:56.240 --> 45:00.760
They're just like there's just a weird canine relationship with humans where they're just like I

45:01.360 --> 45:04.760
Stimuli like like the wind in their face like it's a lot happening. Yeah

45:06.520 --> 45:08.520
smells

45:08.520 --> 45:15.120
Yeah, they're they're they're they're watching like they're watching five channels at the same time

45:15.280 --> 45:20.480
So that you probably they you wouldn't put a dog and Elon Musk's car out in outer space because there's no wind

45:20.480 --> 45:24.640
And there's no smells out there. You know, there's a bunch of radiation to which is data. We're getting right now

45:25.520 --> 45:32.600
Would you put data out in space? Sure. Sure. I would data's already out in space not anymore shows cancelled

45:32.600 --> 45:37.640
Wow, so little mic drop. Wow

45:41.760 --> 45:46.960
Rob is doing the he's the he's the Geppetto of mic job mic drop. It's a Mike teabag

45:47.880 --> 45:52.480
That's how they do it in London. That's how they drop the mic in London like a teabag

45:52.480 --> 46:03.560
He's queen does it and you will be able to get all of your pumpkins for free this evening

46:07.120 --> 46:13.360
My favorite part of that of course is the rift what a queen would say that would provoke a mic drop

46:13.360 --> 46:25.080
Which turned out to be you won't be getting your free pumpkins. I'm no world traveler

46:25.080 --> 46:30.120
I'm no geo politician. I don't know what what's going on in England, but wow

46:35.120 --> 46:37.120
There's been a whole gourd crisis

46:37.840 --> 46:43.040
Winston Churchill movie. Yeah, son. Yeah great performance really interesting as you said

46:43.040 --> 46:46.300
It's kind of like well, it's like a like like watching an episode of

46:47.120 --> 46:49.120
Would you say the doctor?

46:51.360 --> 46:56.540
What's the Gary Oldman one, what's it called God the darkest hour I have the screener. I haven't watched it really amazed

46:57.440 --> 47:03.400
I'd be say this is the whole point of every every everything, but I was like amazed at how actually true it was

47:03.400 --> 47:07.720
I don't know what I expected, but like how like Winston Churchill's

47:07.720 --> 47:14.800
Absolute this guy who you've there's a million quotes from quotes that truly you're like wow one guy said all this shit

47:14.800 --> 47:16.800
He's like the fucking Vince Lombardi of

47:18.120 --> 47:22.120
World War two he really had a lot of profound ways of phrasing this shit

47:23.360 --> 47:29.080
And and but and then you watch the movie and it's like oh, yeah, that's all he did

47:29.960 --> 47:32.200
Like he was like he just he just fucking talked

47:32.200 --> 47:38.080
Like this I mean, I don't know what else I expected to see like a young Winston Churchill like vaulting over

47:38.880 --> 47:44.320
You know with Wolverine claws that were still bone and hadn't been infused with titanium yet

47:44.320 --> 47:49.720
I'm impressed in the world that most of the great like actors now are from the adamantium. Don't write in

47:50.960 --> 47:57.760
Continue like all the big actors seem to be from like the UK or the antipodes and like like but we had an American actor playing

47:57.760 --> 47:58.320
Winston Churchill

47:58.320 --> 48:04.520
That's kind of oh, I didn't know Gary open was American necessarily. I mean he played so many like different characters. I didn't know

48:04.520 --> 48:06.520
I think he's

48:06.520 --> 48:10.760
I think I thought he was British English. I thought it was English. I didn't know this

48:11.240 --> 48:13.240
You know, I mean well

48:13.840 --> 48:19.520
John let's let's go did Winston Churchill in the crown and he is a

48:20.080 --> 48:21.920
man he is

48:21.920 --> 48:24.520
American and his mouth is a circle

48:24.520 --> 48:31.160
No, you make your mouth into a circle. Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. It's me Winston Churchill

48:31.800 --> 48:33.160
Oh

48:33.160 --> 48:37.000
The only thing we have to fear oh is being misquoted. Oh

48:38.440 --> 48:41.480
Come on speak softly and have another quote

48:43.600 --> 48:49.080
Stop I know what you're talking about. Think of one of my real quotes. I don't know what you mean. My mouth is a circle

48:49.080 --> 48:55.680
Oh, oh Daddy I wish the church daddy daddy, please daddy

48:58.160 --> 49:01.160
Can you both do the same scene but as Harvey Kytel's

49:02.440 --> 49:07.880
Harvey Kytel can you do a Harvey Kytel? I'll just give it a go. I don't know. I just picked what I picked what I random

49:07.880 --> 49:11.480
I don't think I could do. Just try a Harvey Kytel. What are you? What?

49:12.240 --> 49:13.960
What are you?

49:13.960 --> 49:15.840
What are you? What are you doing?

49:15.840 --> 49:23.880
Do you think do you think I am do you do you think I am doing what you think I am doing?

49:27.960 --> 49:30.920
That's all I remember about him is he's heart of zing now Juliet Lewis

49:30.920 --> 49:47.000
I'm a natural barn killer. I love my favorite. I love Juliet Lewis

49:47.000 --> 49:52.240
I'm at my favorite liner and natural born killers. She's such a great like in another wise

49:52.240 --> 49:57.560
It's it's pretty uncomfortable. I also love Tom Sizemore. I also love Quentin Tarantino

49:57.560 --> 50:01.840
Whatever go send your emails to my ass Bronson Pinchot

50:02.480 --> 50:10.000
I but but but Sizemore doing the scene in natural born killers where he's like he's in her cell and he wants it

50:10.720 --> 50:16.800
Give me Sizemore. I don't there's no Sizemore. There's only Zool. I don't know. He's Tom Sizemore

50:16.800 --> 50:21.320
He's talking and he says like I want you to I want you to I want you to

50:22.200 --> 50:24.200
pinch my nipple and

50:24.200 --> 50:27.800
Put this lipstick on and pinch my nipple. Well, you kiss me or whatever

50:30.360 --> 50:32.360
So specific

50:36.520 --> 50:40.720
I was impressed by your Harvey cartel. I have to tell you that was that was pretty. What are you? What are you?

50:41.920 --> 50:44.520
Can I ask what you what? What are you doing?

50:46.720 --> 50:52.240
My favorite Julia Lewis quote from natural born killers. I think it's from one of the deleted scenes

50:52.240 --> 50:54.240
when they're like

50:54.640 --> 50:57.600
before they go to drug world after they get bit by all the

50:59.720 --> 51:06.880
Rattlesnakes, you know, they have to go. Yeah, there's this scene where I'm pretty sure it's in all improv

51:06.880 --> 51:12.300
This like stone was just like go just jump off the script do whatever and

51:13.200 --> 51:19.800
Julia will Lewis is like, can we get the fuck out of here and get some snake juice killer?

51:19.800 --> 51:21.800
Oh

51:23.280 --> 51:25.280
Snake juice killer

51:27.400 --> 51:28.520
antibiotics

51:28.520 --> 51:34.120
I haven't seen that movie in a while. Would you do would you get do me a favor and do your your famous Selma Hayek impression?

51:35.040 --> 51:37.040
Hey, I'm Selma Hayek

51:38.800 --> 51:42.880
The esclar brothers, it's coming in over the wire or we're gonna come here

51:43.800 --> 51:46.800
It sounds like they're not gonna make it, but I I do want to

51:46.800 --> 51:49.960
It's snowing out there. I do want to do them the service of plugging their

51:50.720 --> 51:52.720
but holes

51:54.080 --> 51:56.080
Hell yeah when I see them again

51:57.720 --> 52:03.480
For too long the scolars but holes have gone because they've had me on their podcast don't people town twice now

52:03.480 --> 52:10.080
And it's great fun. I truly love doing it and they're they're they're good friends in as much as you can be good friends of people

52:10.080 --> 52:12.080
You've you've done two podcasts with but

52:12.080 --> 52:19.800
They're they have a new project. They were gonna come here and they're they're the thing that they were gonna plug is something

52:19.800 --> 52:26.560
We're very excited about me and Dan. It's a documentary about about something. That's not always talked about in public

52:28.560 --> 52:32.080
Feces it's a poop documentary. It's a poop documentary

52:33.320 --> 52:35.320
They got their funny friends

52:35.760 --> 52:39.040
Talking about poop. I think they delve into the history of poop

52:39.040 --> 52:44.040
What was the first thing that could be considered poop? Like well, I made that up poop. I

52:44.680 --> 52:50.320
I was that doesn't stop me from thinking it. I mean, yeah, you know, I think that I mean shouldn't you say

52:50.320 --> 52:54.560
I think I remembered Dan doing an awesome riff on how it might start

52:54.560 --> 52:59.360
No, I remember that being the actual part of the movie. Oh, you saw it as you rift it

53:00.200 --> 53:03.200
But like I thought you're being so you've seen the movie or you've not seen the movie

53:03.200 --> 53:05.920
Oh, I've seen it and it changed my life in the way

53:05.920 --> 53:09.200
I look at poop forever is Dan Dan in the movie

53:09.640 --> 53:15.320
Dan's in the movie everyone you want to be in the movies in the movie in typical documentary fashion

53:15.320 --> 53:20.640
I'm in the movie and I accomplished the rare task of making you hate me more than poop

53:21.160 --> 53:26.560
As a that's a joke for my fans who know that every documentary and I come off like a fucking douchebag

53:28.000 --> 53:34.600
Harmon down the I think it'd be a mistake to make a poop documentary and not put Dan Harmon in it

53:34.600 --> 53:40.520
Exactly. What are the documentaries? Are you in? I was in a back to the future documentary

53:41.120 --> 53:42.960
they used

53:42.960 --> 53:44.960
in over my

53:45.160 --> 53:49.280
Protests is like, please don't well. I'm on camera saying please don't

53:49.960 --> 53:53.520
Like make me talk about the fact that back to the future two sucks

53:54.840 --> 53:56.840
Don't make me talk about it

53:56.840 --> 54:00.480
But you weren't the only one in that documentary that said that I'm I

54:00.480 --> 54:09.120
Well, if that's true, I I know they sandwiched me saying that between like a father and son with different kinds of cancer

54:09.120 --> 54:16.360
Who's soul way of coping with it is to celebrate back to the future to and like a mayor who brought jobs to his town by

54:16.360 --> 54:20.600
Building a back to the future to statue and in the middle is me going like it sucks

54:22.440 --> 54:27.560
Anyways, that sounds like a good creative. Yeah, they probably won't work with you ever again

54:27.560 --> 54:35.760
Yeah, and and also there goes my there goes my pristine PR. What is the name of the sclar poop documentary?

54:36.640 --> 54:38.080
everybody poops

54:38.080 --> 54:44.320

We got to get this ad we got to get this ad clean

55:10.560 --> 55:14.600
We got to get this poop documentary commercial clean. So let's just take it again from the top. It's going to be a

55:16.280 --> 55:18.280
Small release

55:18.560 --> 55:23.920
Yeah, that's what I talk the sclar brothers have been talking a lot of shit lately

55:23.920 --> 55:25.840
literally

55:25.840 --> 55:30.360
Didn't have to put literally there could have just stopped it

55:30.960 --> 55:32.960
How would you get that they're joking?

55:33.440 --> 55:35.040
it's

55:35.040 --> 55:38.080
about poo you guys are being very jaded and

55:39.360 --> 55:43.600
Don't you worry about our friends listening to stuff like this and going like how they don't seem to

55:44.480 --> 55:48.920
Support us very much. Remember. Maybe we should not show up. Maybe they should have me on their show

55:48.920 --> 55:52.720
I mean, I I'm sad that they're not here tonight because a I love hanging out with them

55:52.720 --> 55:55.960
Yeah, but also I have a million poop talk questions. Yeah

55:56.160 --> 56:03.340
We really wanted to learn more about the movie and we're excited to do it. And that's the one thing we can't do

56:04.240 --> 56:06.240
Mm-hmm. I agree poop talk

56:06.840 --> 56:11.040
So like everyone in America that's listening and also all the other countries

56:11.040 --> 56:21.320
Spain we should all have to go name name seven countries in Europe. You have 20 seconds

56:22.760 --> 56:24.760
He's not trying

56:24.760 --> 56:26.760
Like being pimped

56:28.680 --> 56:31.240
Name five countries and anywhere in the world

56:31.240 --> 56:36.160
He doesn't like playing by rules if you tell him to you know what you know how to get Rob to jump through a hoop

56:36.160 --> 56:42.600
Uh, tell him tell him the hoops are not for jumping through. Okay, don't

56:43.280 --> 56:45.280
Don't name quite centuries

56:47.560 --> 56:50.480
No name another country. I don't know whether to say

56:51.160 --> 56:53.160
Thank you or

56:53.480 --> 56:59.080
Stop it today. I have known you for 57 years. It's true this guy

56:59.080 --> 57:03.240
I look at my hands the other day and I went Jesus Christ

57:03.240 --> 57:07.520
My hands are fucking looking old man, and they were shaking

57:07.880 --> 57:15.360
They were all wrinkled and I was like what the fuck happened to my hands. What happened to my hands. They used to be so

57:16.160 --> 57:18.160
soft

57:19.040 --> 57:21.040
Wrinkled

57:21.280 --> 57:23.040
I

57:23.040 --> 57:28.320
Started crying. I'm like going what the hell happened. Can you play the dog music while he talks about his hands?

57:28.320 --> 57:32.480
Could just usually because I can't see very well relax

57:34.120 --> 57:36.840
I can't I can't see very well

57:36.840 --> 57:40.600
So I'm looking at my hands right now without my glasses and they look like you know

57:41.440 --> 57:47.080
Looking at Cybill Shepherd on moonlighting close-up. I mean, they're all like, you know frosted glass looking

57:47.080 --> 57:48.040
They look pretty good

57:48.040 --> 57:55.080
I put my glasses my reading glasses my special close-up reading glasses for when I want to look at my phone and

57:55.080 --> 57:58.560
and read what's on my phone and I

57:59.400 --> 58:04.240
Turned my palm on my hand around and I just like looked at my hand and it was just like I

58:06.080 --> 58:08.080
Actually noticed how old my

58:09.240 --> 58:11.240
hands looked

58:11.240 --> 58:15.640
And I said it's it's it's coming. It's it's almost over

58:16.600 --> 58:23.720
It's almost over. It's like you know when you when you take ecstasy for the first time and it's the best feeling in the world

58:23.720 --> 58:29.440
You know, you're just like, oh my god, and you peek and you go ah, it's great. And then all of a sudden

58:29.960 --> 58:37.640
You start coming down and there's like this heartbreak of like I just got here. I just got here and I'm coming down

58:38.520 --> 58:45.080
That's what my life is like right now. I just got here and I'm fading out

58:46.040 --> 58:49.320
The dimmer switch on Trob is turning

58:50.240 --> 58:52.240
Damn clockwise

58:52.240 --> 58:55.680
Check out Randy and Jason Scalarra's poop talk

58:57.240 --> 59:00.520
That's good. That was great. That was that was fucking heavy

59:00.520 --> 59:05.080
You know what you know what always accentuates for me coming down from the ecstasy of life is

59:05.480 --> 59:13.320
That that being the exact chapter of the party where a million strangers burst in and point at you and yell privilege

59:14.840 --> 59:17.080
That's my favorite part of the party. No

59:17.080 --> 59:24.520
When you're high on ecstasy, yeah, it's just a good. Well, no when I'm dying when I've been a laged I

59:25.560 --> 59:28.720
Was commenting on also. It's not a good time to be

59:29.600 --> 59:37.400
Like we we hit it. We hit our peak and we were we were and we weren't ready to you know for the whatever the opposite of the

59:37.480 --> 59:41.160
The up the hill downhill. I think it is

59:41.800 --> 59:46.800
You know, we weren't pretty sure it's not uphill. We weren't ready to we were ready to be over the hill

59:46.800 --> 59:49.880
I feel like I hit my peak like maybe

59:51.840 --> 59:53.840
30 minutes ago with my Steven Tyler

59:55.480 --> 59:56.760
I

59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.120
Feel like that was that's that's me at Mount Everest and now it's just gonna be a

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.800
Horrible toboggan ride down at the bottom

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:10.360
but I was just saying they pull but politically fashionably like partially probably be because of the just population dynamics because the

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.160
The younger kids they're like part of a huge shadow of the baby boom

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.400
It's like a giant huge section of the population like it became open season on on old people

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.040
So it's like you there's kind of like a you hit the peak and then you start going down hill

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.800
And then you hear this war cry in the distance. You're like, oh man. Well, at least it's downhill and then it's like, oh

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.600
Fuck shit. I am an easy target. I

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.680
Thought I could like slide into like retirement like by the old rules

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.320
You know, you're supposed to like be a old young white man and like become an old white man

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.200
And then you you you hoard your privilege and then you you have it in your little sack

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:56.120
And then you tiptoe quietly to a wagon and coast downhill into a into a little shall I

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I might not make it

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.640
Like there's a there's a price on my scalp

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.640
People know that this is the route you take now

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.320
Mm-hmm. There's there's there's I won't call them bandits because they might be heroes. I might be the villain

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320
But there's there's people on the highway

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880
They know I'm here. They're gonna get me

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.600
This new purge movie looks pretty good

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.400
What's this one? What's it's a purge equal prequel prequel coming up with the purge coming up with the purge

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:39.240
It's called the binge. He thought he peaked he thought he peaked

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840
My hands just got five years younger

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:54.420
You can make your hands young by being funny oh boy, maybe that's that's that explains a lot

01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:01.020
Yeah, oh my god really. Yeah, we got this is not good guys. I've got I've always had oldest-looking hands

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:06.140
But this is really skin gets papery. It looks like like like like rice paper. Oh god

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:12.060
Well Schrabs looking at his hands. I think well Schrab though like what you're looking at is the fact that you're old but you're

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:18.780
You're you're physically fit so you're you're yeah look at Jeff's hands. This is different

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:25.380
This looks like Tom Savini put latex. Do you wear gloves? Mine look fine because I have a layer of fat

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.020
No, you're fine because

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:37.060
No, this this is really bad. This is not good. It's a lot of paper right you touch paper. I touch paper

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.560
I think it really dries out your hands

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:45.420
You moisturize Schrab. Do you use any moisturizer? I try to you guys have a lower body fat

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:52.180
So you're as you're gonna as you grow older, which let me look at your hands. Yeah, they're just it's like a plump like pig pig hoof

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.560
Like you can't see veins. Look at that. It's like a baby

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.620
45

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.540
All right, let's I got I got baby hands, too

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.140
Sorry, they're wet

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.940
Yes

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.420
Man Pinterest still picks up drops of calls

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.660
Jeff doesn't have a mic

I just want to know what you like when I can I give you a note that'll take it from four to eight

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:59.500
Absolutely, I didn't say this was a complete a joke. I thought of this as we pulled up to the starburns castle

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.700
This is just a performance. It's cosmetic. I just I need you to punch creme

Love Schrabbing Schrabbing is a timeless enterprise and people think they can Schrab you but they can't Schrab you right and

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.340
People are doing some faux Schrabbins. Yeah

No, it's it's and I worked those real Schrab. I don't have a good enough memory and I'm not a good enough friend

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:46.660
Famous troll just completely independent king of all trolls anything like no one writing any of these articles

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.740
obnoxious

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.300
redundant question tweets

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.100
On on the air that was so long ago

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.420
Jimmy Kimmel or Fallon

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:11.100
No, no, no, I think it was it was on I think it was from harm at time

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:16.980
But that was like so long ago. That was like that was like maybe three years ago. Maybe even four. Yeah

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.260
Wow, it's before that's a lot of years died

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:28.820
Yeah, how long have we been doing Harmontown? Oh, it's at least five years. I would say I would say so long that it's sad, but

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.620
It's good because we've gone through transformations because it's not really the same podcast

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:38.980
I listened to the Cheapy Peepy episode earlier today really insulting. It's hurtful

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:46.620
Really, it's actually really good. I really enjoyed it sad said that you feel comfortable enough to talk to people like that

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.660
That's why I'm a little lighter. Now this one will suck

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.820
I'm sure because I think that one you can hear me going this episode sex like well

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:58.300
This episode sex. I was wrong the whole time. It's it's like gold. It's gold Cheapy Peepy. It's like top 10

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:03.940
Top 10 stop saying episode. Yeah, we can't follow Cheapy Peepy episode peepee with music for dogs

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.940
No, this has been awful probably because I'm in high spirits. I don't know there might be something

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.580
Maybe I need to be an Abbott, you know, maybe that's my thing. I'm complaining the whole time. I'm like, oh, you guys are picking on me

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.300
I hate you. I'm annoyed with you. I wish I wish my podcast was better

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:20.180
You know, like maybe my lot in life is just to be miserable. I don't know. Maybe what I'm happy. I think

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:26.860
Or my therapist says Dan when you're certain you're in trouble Dan Harmon

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.780
You're better off not being certain

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.980
That's when you excel when you don't know things when you're confused people need you to be

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.220
Uncertain you not everybody you

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.780
Dan when you're certain

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:45.500
Like every time you think you know something for sure just stop

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.780
Just go soak your head in a bucket and you were like, how much does this cause I?

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.580
Think it's two dollars. I thought it was great advice

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.460
Although it's not really a place to follow because when I'm certain of something

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.780
I'm like, I don't need to follow that advice of this situation. I'm certain of it

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:07.140
Like I can't really follow right. Well, that's why she's telling you but I always do realize that she's fucking right

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:12.220
Like I look back and I go yeah, there you were you've you've definitely thought you knew what the fuck you were doing

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:17.740
It's like you're just gonna speed that up like the Mobius strip of your dry erase board advice to your high self

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:23.300
Yeah, you you can't listen to hi Dan. Hi Dan knows what he's talking about

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:29.220
That's a deep cut reference what

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:35.060
Remember Dan's office back in the Commonwealth apartment and I had a note on my whiteboard and it said

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:40.540
Dear hi Dan or no dear non high dear not hi Dan

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.780
Don't get high

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.780
It makes you feel like you're having a heart attack

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.180
signed hi Dan and

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:54.060
Then Jeff saw it while we were getting high. He's like, what's this as a note. I wrote well

01:09:54.140 --> 01:10:00.260
Well, hi a and to remind myself. He's like, but we're getting high. I was like, well, I'm not gonna listen to this guy. He's hi

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:09.940
Yeah, he's acting all you still have heart palpitations when you smoke the the fucking gonj well the advent of

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.300
vape pens vape life

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:19.380
Ah, so so it's really controllable. It was the paper that was no, I think it's just and I think it's just in general like

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.180
It's it will grown weed is

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.940
That's rolled into a thing and it's a herb

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:31.460
As as opposed to a cartridge you buy from a fucking 7-eleven

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:36.620
That's like that's all the same oil like I just think I've learned I still everyone's well

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.420
I get too high if I get too high for 20 minutes

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:46.940
I'll they check my pulse because that way if my pulse stops I'll go go. You'll be the first to know first to know

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.340
Have you ever read anywhere

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.980
Online in a book

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:03.180
Meltkarten what have you of somebody having a heart attack because of of gonj

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:09.900
No, I mean like the fatality the faith that's like that's the running joke with weed or not running joke the fact that we joke

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.220
About it sit down. There's no no one dies from fucking weed

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:16.540
You you'd have to you have to you'd have to suffocate in it

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.260
You'd have to be dropped into a silo full of weed

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.940
No, it doesn't it's it

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:28.140
Is high I think it's what people it took me a long time to realize that that's what older guys when I was younger

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.300
And they would say I can't smoke weed as much anymore

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.340
It makes me paranoid right and I always thought they meant I would always be like the police are coming

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:41.780
Yeah, can't you just not know the police are coming or know that the police aren't coming because I thought paranoia meant like hallucinations

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.540
Like but I think paranoia is just like a catch-all phrase that means

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:52.980
Something's wrong for me. It doesn't mean the police are coming like when I'm super high and I'm like driving around

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.900
Anytime I see anyone on the phone

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.700
I think they're talking to everyone else I see on the phone

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:01.500
And I think they're all talking to be about me and talking to the government and stuff

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.660
I'm not the mr. Show sketch when they did they see you're really odious really order from the end of

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:13.540
Was it good fellows? Yeah, the mister show show sketch when they had that the lidsville or whatever

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:19.940
What was the the I can't remember the thing in the HR puff and stuff sketch and then there's a state of drug

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:28.100
It's just like and then and then David Christ is the little boy going like what's let's just order a pizza and

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.540
Like oh, I can't do that man

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.740
Kenny's like they'll know

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.900
Everybody hates them know that we want a pizza

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.780
I declare this pizza to be

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.380
awesome

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.380
That's a great

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:54.300
That's amazing. Okay. This just popped completely random in my head and

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.620
Well, this is no place for that. Okay

01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.140
and

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:06.020
I want to state this I want to start this off because I saying I'm not racist. I'm getting out right now. I

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:13.820
am a huge like nightmare in Elm Street fan and I love like the scream franchise

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:19.340
I think West Craven is brilliant. I think he's very very funny and I we miss him

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.780
He's rest in peace West Craven. But do you remember?

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.940
the time

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.180
Like it was it was like early days like early

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:36.180
Aughts or whatever. I met with West Craven's people. I got a call UTA calls and goes hey West Craven

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.780
Yeah, do an animated series. Yeah, I remember an

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:43.700
An animated series and I like what that sounds amazing. He wants to do like oh like a horse

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:47.700
Yes, he wants to do it like a horror animated series. That's like it's fucking great

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:52.700
What it's got to be like something like creep show or some kind of you know, like kind of easy comics

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:57.300
It's animated. It'll be violent. It'll be cool. This is dry. This is exactly what I want to be doing

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.460
This will be super fucking cool

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:04.980
I gotta do this and I go there and West Craven's not there. I'm meeting with some guy there

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:11.960
Who's a delightful person, but he goes okay? Here's the pitch

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.860
West Craven when he's not making

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.780
Horror movies is going out and fighting monsters in

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.260
Buffy the vampire slayer ask adventures

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:28.900
And I was and it's called the West Craven Chronicles

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:35.840
He plays animated series about it West Craven himself going out and West Craven being buffing director. Yes

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.020
Animated killing them killing vampires and they had

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.340
Art

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:51.060
I could draw it if I knew how to draw I could because I can picture it so clearly and there's like this kind of Batman the animated series

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.260
version of West Craven

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.860
fighting a Yeti and

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:02.480
And he's he's got like the salt and pepper beard and the hair it's like back and this kind of like

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.380
like

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:11.220
Intelligent look on his face fighting like a mummy and then he's fighting like and I'm like and I'm and my brain is going

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.220
And I'm going

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220
Okay

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.980
What's this oh

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:31.340
There he is again as a West Craven fighting an alligator person

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:37.100
That's great. That's great. So it's this is this is this is this is a guy. This is guy

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.060
You got this so so and he's he's he wants to do this. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:44.900
Yeah, we put it to like West is totally into it. What's the idea?

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540
Could I

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.540
It just would help me put together like, you know a pitch or whatever

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.500
And then just like a calm walk

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:15.420
Thank you very much. I'll just be going out. You're gonna go already. Yeah, I got ideas

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.260
I got to just I got to go take care of it

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.260
but

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:26.380
Open up the door and close it and it just like see Charlie Chaplin fast-forward me run to the car

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:43.340
Dan opens up. He's got a bathrobe and a coffee mug that says kiss me on Monday and

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:45.340
Just

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.700
Ferris Bueller like

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.780
Sit the fuck down you got to hear this story and look at this visual aid

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:58.780
I am not gonna live this alone

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:04.460
This is the reason we're friends and it was like insane and I was so

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:13.060
Broke as fuck. I was so broke that I went I I said I'm in let's do this and I you know

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.060
And they were like well West Craven likes

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.700
Crossword puzzles, so we think

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.460
And he's also a bird watcher, so if you can get that in there, too, and I'm just like

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.740
Yes, and I'm like writing it and writing it right

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:32.060
Those last two details up or is that for real? It's for real the crossword puzzle, but the bird watching bird watch. Oh my god

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.340
I remember the crossword puzzle because I was like whoa

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:41.180
And and then and then at one point was this it was this West Cravens idea or they're pitching it

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:47.220
Their idea because I never once in this whole thing never got to meet West Craven and

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:54.180
Which is sad because I I'm a huge fan. I think he's brilliant. I got the

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.780
Impression towards the end that this guy

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:04.060
Was not an executive. He was like an up-and-comer or whatever had an idea. I said let's put two and two together

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.180
let's just do this and

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.780
and

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:12.940
And West was like yeah sure whatever well, yeah, I mean why say no

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:21.180
But people some people say how did this get made or how does it like why is Hollywood so plastic or what why does this happen?

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.780
Oh, the thing is the answer is why say no, why would you ever say no? It cost nothing to say yes, right?

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:34.460
It cost nothing to say no and says cost everything to say yes, but well, okay, but I was saying the opposite

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.460
I'm just saying like you're

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.180
You could ruin your career by saying no to the wrong thing

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:46.380
You can't ruin your career by saying yes to the wrong things until it comes to the point where because everything dies anyway

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:52.500
So if you're West Craven and your assistance assistance assistance vice president of assistance is saying like oh, yeah

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.660
And also as a thing I want to do is like it's you and a crossword puzzle and fighting a mummy

01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.820
You just you just you just say the fastest route to the end of the phone call

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.780
You don't pull over your car and go now hold on a second

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:10.740
I'm West Craven and I'll be god damned if you're gonna be interested in me and keep making projects about me for no money

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.700
Well, I drive my car around you just go. Yeah, bye

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.140
Right bye. I'm busy doing sounds great sounds great

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:22.660
Love it and everyone and then every conference call the trickles down for there. I was like love it. Love it

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:29.700
Love it. Love it. West love like the crossword puzzle and the bird-watching thing sounds like his pitches. No, no

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:36.500
No, that's definitely no, that's his underlings sucking up to him. That's someone being like I am nailing this and they're

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:42.460
Yeah, which oddly I want to say don't you think now are you revisiting this right now on this stage and thinking actually now?

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:50.660
post Netflix post mind hunter post garb for post post just everything golden age post golden age post like

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:58.180
Actually Mike Tyson mystery. Yeah, like like like why not west you would have to lean into post Rick and Morty

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:02.740
Fuck it. You would have to lean into it where there would be constantly people like going

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:07.700
West Craven, how do I know that guy? Ah, I'm a director. What did you do?

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:14.740
Oh, I think I think I don't think well you're talking about the consumers perspective

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:18.380
I don't think so. I think he's like he's like Stephen King or whatever. It wouldn't matter be like West Craven

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.060
You're like, I know those words. It's like Kleenex or something. I don't know

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:27.060
I think you know the average person doesn't know what he looks like enough that if you saw a caricature of him that you would go

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:33.700
West Craven. No, no, no, you don't need to it's a carrot. Fuck the caricature. No the name. That's it

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:39.780
That's all you start with and then it's that's why you step on the gas of the caricature when you do a receding hairline at a gray

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.100
beard and you you you you lean into it

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:45.900
He's like doctor who like doctor who doesn't have to fucking like be sexy and cool

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:53.300
He's just like like that's the thing is like okay crossword puzzles bird watching which is interesting because that's ultimately what what the doctor is

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:57.140
Right. He's West Craven. He just goes around and he's it's a cool name

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:02.380
And it's like it kind of sells itself these shows call doctor who he's the characters the doctor

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.940
but

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:10.620
But back then it was fucking ludicrous because it I still think it's pretty fucking well

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:17.180
Also, you know that if tomorrow if West Craven was alive and because I know this because I've done these fucking projects where you go

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:19.180
Like somebody goes like oh my god

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.860
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do a pretensi name

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:30.420
That's like equivalent because I don't want to get in trouble by naming names, but like sorry like Garth Brooks loves

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:38.260
Community Rick and Morty whatever and you go like and he went he and he also loves animation because his kids an animation

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.900
You go fucking all right like look I have an animation studio look

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.780
Tell you what Garth Brooks is an agent for the government

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:50.140
He is that like when the government has something that needs done that no one also do he calls Garth they call Garth Brooks

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:55.860
It's it fucking sells itself. It's hilarious. The person's recognizable doesn't matter. I'll do it. You do it with anybody

01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:00.020
It doesn't matter. It's like Mike nice. It's like then it's all execution dependent

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:06.060
The shows good or it's not like like fucking who cares and that but then the crazy thing that always happens is you go

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:09.820
Here's your one sheet. Here's your free labor. Here's your fucking drawings

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.940
I hired talented people to draw Garth Brooks. This is a fake example

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.500
But it's like the real the real one is like fucking mind-boggling

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.500
Toby Keith

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:26.140
The I drew your fucking irrelevant country Western ass like like like as an action figure looking awesome

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:31.660
And I had people write up all of this is free labor fucking handed to you on a silver platter

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.500
Bring bring a phone call for you

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:40.380
Garth Brooks is assistant and Garth Brooks is lawyer and Garth Brooks is agent Garth Brooks is family and if Garth Brooks is a

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.940
foundation and Garth Brooks is

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.940
Taxidermist would like to talk to you

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.780
Is Garth Brooks on the line? No, he is not but

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.340
Jenny is Richard

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.660
I don't know I don't get just don't get distracted. Don't get distracted. I'm a little drunk. I'm a little drunk

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:03.980
They all get on the phone. I was like, hey, yeah, what's going on? You got Garth Brooks fight in the Loch Ness monster

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:10.440
That's just not the Garth Brooks style. I don't know if you're from this is Garth Brooks style is talking

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:17.540
I'm Sheila Henderson Garth Brooks doesn't fight the Loch Ness monster young man, and you're like this is unbelievable

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.820
I'm 40 and

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.860
You should be so grateful

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:28.220
That I of what I gave to you because I could cut the head off and replace it with a pop singer and

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:33.860
And I'm going to and I did and then they sucked too, but it's like like what are you?

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:38.540
The voice craven thing works fine. He's a

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:44.220
Crossword puzzles. He's got a fucking hate yet easy. He's gonna go hunt him. Who cares. Just let me make a show

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:51.340
Just let me make it. What are you waiting for a good idea for a show in your mind? You're a fucking idiot

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:59.260
Why do you think that TV needs to sound like a good idea before you let it get made you suck?

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:06.380
You don't make TV. You watch it. Yeah, why are you in charge? This is insane?

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:12.340
Just give me TV money. I'll make a good TV show. I

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.340
Tend to

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.180
They're gonna rip that out of context. Yeah

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:23.060
Again, I ask our fans to add that to the original music thing that Rob

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:27.900
Put that under if you're out there and you're fucking like, oh, you know what?

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.900
I'm a manager of so-and-so and I got a thing to be in mind

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:35.260
I think I could put you in touch with Death Metalhead and the Johnson and fucking one of six

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:40.620
Just take your fucking silver platter if I come into the room if you got me in a conversation

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:47.020
You're gonna get a good show about your fucking goddamn musician. Yeah, you don't care about this shit anyway

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:52.980
Otherwise, you'd be making about it making it you care about fucking fruit infused waters and shit

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.660
And we aren't talking about that. So let's get out of here

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.500
In

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.780
We're not talking about that. We're not talking about

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:08.580
Food that's what their water is kind of amazing that people sit around in rooms

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:13.460
They go like yeah, I don't think mr. Potato Head would do that go fuck yourself

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.420
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck mr. Potato Head would do. I don't think

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.020
Ticonderoga man would uh

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:27.940
Would be that sharp. I'm a storyteller. I know exactly what mr. Potato Head would do he'd asked the question

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.020
Who am I my face keeps changing and half of it's in my ass

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:37.660
What's what's the what's the meeting with the goddess in the mr. Potato Head movie? He finds out he can be Mrs.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.700
Potato Head like like like there is no fucking difference

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:47.980
It's a goddamn fucking anthem to the non-binary identity like it's fucking like like that's it

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.820
You know, yeah, and now fucking Coleco or whoever

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:56.020
Dumps that plastic shit into our children's faces is gonna be on the phone tomorrow

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.660
I'm gonna spend nine minutes. It's gonna go. We love it. We love it

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:04.020
We're gonna run out of ways to joke about it because we're just gonna do all the joking references

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.740
Seriously, the original mr. Potato Head's actual potatoes, right? There were things that you could there were little add-ons

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.980
You could just take a potato. Yeah, they and then they made the potato plastic

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:19.540
But but but early days it was a real you would like your own there was a mustache and an eyeball and a hat

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:24.740
Put it on a real potato. Yeah on a real potato, and then they then they've plasticized their potatoes

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:29.380
Yeah, well, they had already I mean unless the original shit was made out of potato

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.100
I don't even give a fuck. I'd applaud the the step up to a fake potato

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.500
Well, it's a step up to selling you a fake because they're not getting any of that actual potato money. Yeah

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.820
They're like we're letting these people fucking

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:47.860
They would like go to like a swank parties or that there's a guy singing it's like if you're blue when you don't know

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:52.360
What to do ten you got a gold potato party and I like that it was like

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.360
Uh, Howard Howard Lancashire of the third from Coleco price

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.720
Meet Howard Hughes who's on his arm. Oh miss Mellon Monroe. She looks like she's having a good time

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.720
That fuselage could use some tweaking

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:11.080
Uh, and look who's there. Oh if it isn't old writer the potato magnate

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880
Looks like he's got murder in his eye

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:22.520
Could it be because half of the money from mr. Potato head sales goes to the potato

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:33.320
Because I finished something guarantee the like why are we letting big potato make all this money off of our thing

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.640
Yeah, and the biopic de caprio is playing the fisher price guy. He's like look at that smug fuck

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.440
Over there by the punchball. What are you talking about?

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.880
He's so fake. He's so plastic. What a fake plastic potato. No, he's the potato guy's over there

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:51.720
He's like right the potato guy stealing all my fucking money. He's so fake. I made that fucking schlub

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.680
Make food worth what it is today

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:03.080
He's his girlfriend Samantha hasbro who he just started dating. It's like, why don't you just make the potato plastic too?

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.240
Hey, shut up. I don't know

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.000
After she says he's so fake. He's so

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.880
Plastic trailer that's in the trailer. Yeah, he slaps her and she falls down the stairs and then while she's in the hospital

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:21.160
Uh, the doctor explains that they'll have to do surgery to reconstruct her face

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.720
And then he's like I have an idea

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:24.680
And it's her idea

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:29.080
We're gonna have to take some of your butt and put it on your face

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:34.040
In order to fix it. The only way to fix her is to put her lips onto her ear

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:40.360
And put a hat on her chin. We're gonna have to take it off. And then she's gonna have four noses on the side of her nose

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.680
Oh doc doc. You're saying you're gonna put hair on her head. You're gonna put a hat on her head. Which is it?

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.480
We can do anything. Human heads are basically like your potato products. It all comes out of the butt

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.880
Trailer I'll be right back. All right

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.480
Get them

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.600
Fuck

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840
It wasn't that big of a jump

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.840
Well, it'll be interesting to find out if this is a worse

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.260
podcast than a Cheapy Peepy. I'm a big fan. Cheapy Peepy.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.820
How can it be worse? We had more Cheapy Peepy per this

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.020
podcast than we have as podcasts. This has been a

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.060
Cheapy Peepy. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.620
I don't know. I think it's going to turn out that my happiness

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.420
is linked to the show's failure. That's just my cynical

01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.140
theory. Could be right. I think we'll find out that my hubris

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.980
over my Steven Taylor joke might have made the joke less

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:49.380
funny. We'll see what happens. What time is it? I'm glad I

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:55.020
showed up. I wasn't supposed to be here, but I was. Well, you

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.060
have to come in because you're Garry Shandling in the D&D. Let's

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:05.380
bring up Steve Levy. Steve Levy. Oh, yeah. You gotta love it

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:13.140
or leave it. He shaved his face. Looking good with a Robin

01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:19.100
Hood sweater. Robin Hood sweater. And he shaved his face.

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:22.300
Why are you moving? That is very close to you. I mean, I'm fine

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.100
with that. Oh, and one of the segments that I loved most of

01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.060
all was the snuggling. Remember the snuggling? Oh, yeah. Oh,

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.500
yeah. Yeah, that's hard to top because that that that things

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.380
went to an emotional level. It made me want to go like, oh, we

01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:36.220
have a regular segment. Like if if if somebody comes on, you go

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.060
like, you got to snuggle with Steve Levy, Steve Levy, and he

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.500
asks you what's your biggest fear? Right? Why don't you snuggle

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
with leave you right now, Dan? Why don't you me? Yeah, why

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.500
don't you? He doesn't have any. He doesn't have any emotions. I

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.740
don't know as a friend as a friend. I'm telling you that

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:59.020
sounds exactly like a friend as a friend. Oh, is that what a

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:02.580
friend is? You fucking give me a moniker like that. They're

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:07.460
Wikipedia's fucking jumping on my job. You've been writing my

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:12.540
job all month, man. Fuck off. Chippy peepees a better thing.

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.900
Oh, that's what a friend would do. That's what a friend would do.

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.220
A friend would would say he's emotional as fucking call me

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:24.460
Cheapy Peepy asshole. Sucker, dick, liquor, ball,

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:30.660
Satisfy or fuck face. You fucking beards full of dicks. I

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:34.780
can hate you. Is that the show title? Beard full of dicks.

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.660
He's hiding dicks in his beard. It's either that it's either

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:44.820
that or kiss me. I'm Monday. Kiss me. I'm Monday. But it

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.660
needs to be your beards full of dicks. Not not beard full of

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.020
dicks already. Giving me notes.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:59.780
Well, it should have been. I'm not a Cheapy Peepy. Instead,

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:03.260
you you made it Cheapy Peepy. Oh, me. You look at me. I

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.260
don't know who makes the titles. Who chooses the titles?

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:10.180
Well, sure, not fucking me. Who picks it? Chris? Who chooses?

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.900
Okay, well, I remember. I remember. Oh, so it was

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.900
done. Corrected the spelling. I said it should be Cheapy Peepy

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.020
but spell it like this. But I didn't made up word spelled

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:26.580
right. Oh, wasn't there something on this exact same

01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.460
issue? What was it? What was the word? There's a made up word

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.900
that Dan was insisting was spelled wrong and Rob was

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:37.940
getting mad about it. Friend. It could have been emotions.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:44.260
Might as well. I'm not an emotionless person. No, you are.

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.540
As a friend, I'm just saying you're great. Well, or more as a

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:51.300
non friend. You're just lying. No, like, leave the other

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:54.100
possibility. I know you longer than anyone. Would you assume

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:58.060
cuddle position? Just just take an experiment and see how this

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:01.220
works. Yeah, show us. Oh, what? It's gonna. Yeah, let's bring

know, it's your birthday this week. No. Oh, sorry. Give me

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.420
the dog music and I'll play it to your phone. Dan, we want

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:27.580
dogs. Dog songs. Dog songs.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:34.460
Yeah. Leavey and Dan are now assuming a cuddle position.

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:42.300
How you doing, Dan? I haven't seen you all week. Well, it's nice

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:45.340
to see you. It's nice to see you too. Did you have a nice time

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:53.900
away? Yeah, it was good, but you missed Cody. I did, but I

01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:57.020
guess not enough. Like we kind of like she felt like I wasn't

01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.020
connected enough while she was gone. Oh, I'm sorry to hear

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:05.580
that. I was proud of you working out though. Thank you. You went

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:09.660
up in your in your in your weightlifting. I was good. I'm

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:13.420
worried that none of this is flying in the face of Rob's

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.860
allegations of my emotion. Ask him. Ask him what he's afraid of.

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:27.340
Dan. Yeah. What's your biggest fear? Spiders. Arachnophobia.

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:32.140
Spiders. I wouldn't be afraid of Arachnophobia. Spiders.

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:39.900
What's what will kind of spiders? Fast ones. What are you

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.940
afraid they're going to do to you? Run up my arm and

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:48.780
claw it all in my ear and lay eggs or cover my face. Just bite me

01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:55.020
all over my face. Yikes. What are you afraid of with spiders?

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.020
Well, I don't know that I am afraid of spiders. Really? I kind

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.060
of invite them to jump on me in the off chance. They're

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.900
radioactive. Take this seriously. Yeah, it feels like this is

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.060
a big fucking game to you. You know, I don't want to be

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.100
snuggled by a goddamn performer. He seems sincere and then

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.020
it just comes out. It's all a fucking joke. Why don't you get

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.140
down behind Steve and let's get a little. That's the only way

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.940
this is ever going to fucking work. It's weird how I'm

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.500
accused of being emotionless, but really what I am is a

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.620
fucking stud finder for human emotion. Like I detected your

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:29.820
artifice. You're snuggled with you and you're a fucking

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.700
rude. You just found another stud.

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:38.140
Fuck Steve Levy in the butt.

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:45.340
What's your greatest fear, Steve Levy?

01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.460
Oh my god, you're so beautiful.

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.140
I smell so good.

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.260
Oh god, you feel me, throbbing your ass.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:07.900
Oh god, you're listening to the podcast. Let us know how this

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.340
translates.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:17.340
Schrab is thrusting a little bit. I can't. I can't. I can't do this.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:23.340
I can't do this anymore. I can't do this. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.

01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:30.220
Yeah, yeah, Dan, you suck. Well,

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.900
this didn't work. You didn't do it right. I was there two

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.900
seconds and I went there and back again. I've seen Dan

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:45.020
pretty emotional before. Yeah. Yeah, tell him about it.

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:50.140
Lots of different times. I mean, at one time, the hard drive

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.620
didn't work really the way it was supposed to. I mean, he's a

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.380
guy who doesn't, he doesn't like to necessarily wear his

01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.980
emotions on his sleeve. So where does he wear them?

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:08.220
In my work, where they benefit people, you know, I express

01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:15.340
them. I wear them on the page. Whoa. And I don't know what

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.780
could be a more intimate thing to do for someone than to

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:26.860
build an empire. That's convenient.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:36.300
You know, I have the ability to unplug my heart from

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:43.260
dangerous situations and I've encountered a lot and I've

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:48.700
survived and I think that my instincts are always right

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.900
about who to open up to and who not to. How important, Dan,

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.300
is your friendship to Schrab? Like, how much does that mean

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.980
to you? Like, not just in the past, but like present and

01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:02.380
forward. What? Like how much? Like one to five. Like street

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.500
value? Like how like dollar value? No, like, no, describe

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:12.380
the importance of it. 50 grand. Oh, you didn't want the,

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.100
all right. What do you, what do you mean describe? You

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.460
describe. This is only describing me. Describe the

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:20.940
importance of anything. What do you mean? Wait a minute,

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:27.500
wait a minute. Tell us. This is really awkward. Tell me.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.060
Pretend no one else is listening. Like, let's say Schrab

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.860
wasn't here. We weren't podcasting this. What is the

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:37.820
value of Schrab in your life? I don't think you have to

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:45.580
answer that. Schrab is a metric of, this is a good video.

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:50.380
Of how, what's, I don't know. It's a, it's a, it's a heartwarming

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:53.660
moment that I have saved on my phone of you guys. We were

01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:57.580
editing community and I don't remember how it came up, but

01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:00.780
you guys hadn't like actually hung out in a while

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:04.540
and you missed each other and you, and you guys just

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:08.460
had a very loving, long embrace. You hugged

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.140
in the edit bay and they have it on camera. Well, we don't hug very

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.260
often. But Dan, you're about to answer the question. You're

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:17.900
about to, but no, I don't know how to answer. I wasn't about to

01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:20.940
answer it. It's a silly question. It's silly. You're about, you're

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.180
about to say something. You're about to, you're about to say

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:25.900
something. Well, Schrab, Schrab, I was about to say Schrab,

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.900
something like that will, everybody will laugh at. Like

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:32.060
Schrab's a metric of, of my life. Like he's, he's been there

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.060
the whole time. That doesn't sound like friendship because

01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.900
you're like, oh, he's been there the whole time. That sounds

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.860
like, that sounds like Andy Cap talking about his wife or

01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:45.500
something. It's not too far off. Like, boy, boy. Well, you

01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:50.220
bet. Oh, I don't know what his wife's name is. Was she throw

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.980
like a, let's say Schrab disappeared, went away, moved

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:57.900
away. Like this was, this is so close to happening for real.

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:01.580
Don't let's say his person, his old papery hands took over

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:04.940
and he just, he just, he just turned into dust and evaporated.

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.820
What would be, what would you feel is missing from your life

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:13.100
of Schrab just ceased to be here, your friends?

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:18.620
Schrab would be missing. For you, Dan. Right.

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.300
What does that mean? What, what, what, what, what, what would

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:28.460
that vacancy be? He'd be, it'd be the guy that, you know,

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:35.980
it's like, it's like your brother, you know, like, he's,

01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:39.980
he's been there the whole time. Like, so it's like,

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:45.020
yeah, yeah, it'd be a bummer for sure. It'd be a bad thing.

01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:49.820
Please stop talking. Everyone, just stop. Like, I'm not

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.500
seeking words out of your mouth. You guys are being so

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.620
Wisconsin about this. It's so. It'd be like, it'd be like if

01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:02.700
Zeppelin lost its drums, you know? That's, that's dumb.

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.940
You guys are just being the, the, the Milwaukee, like Midwest

01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:12.300
withholding people that you guys were raised as, but that's,

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.660
you know, I know those feelings run deeper than just that.

01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:19.100
Well, things that run deep don't, yeah, they don't

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.980
also run shallow. I think there should be an expression, like maybe,

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:27.340
you know, still waters or something, but the, the, well, it's like,

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.660
like, well, what's the, what's there to, what are you going to

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:32.620
have a parade every day? You know, as a parade every day?

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:36.700
Disneyland. How, how, how deep do those routes run?

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:40.700
That's a fucking craft fair with a fucking

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:45.820
Nazi mouse being sold as earrings.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:50.620
You know, friendship is, you know, somebody's there all the time.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:57.180
Like, well, what about when Dino goes away or if, or you, you know, like, what,

01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:01.180
it's, you know, what, what, what if bacon didn't exist?

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:06.220
I'd be happy. Well, a lot of people would be stoked if I

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.380
disappeared, but, you know, if you love bacon.

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:14.700
I don't. How do you feel about bacon, Rob?

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:19.340
I don't like it. You don't like it. Makes me sad.

01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:24.700
Well, anyways, what, you guys are, everybody's looking at me like I'm,

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.620
you know, I've, I've been wanting to end this. I'd be too. That was, I think it was,

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:32.460
I think it's, you're fucking show, dude. Take control. We'll play D&D.

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:36.620
All right. There we go. Let's do it. Garry Shandling. Yuck.

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:39.500
Garry Shandling. That was awful. We only, we only got 15 minutes. Should we,

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.380
should we crack open a D&D? Yeah, let's do it.

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:46.380
Jesus. I just thought maybe you guys would tell each other, you love each other.

01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:50.620
What is it? Did, I don't even tell my mom. I text my mom,

01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:56.060
Happy Mother's Day, maybe sometimes. You know. I don't need anything.

01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:02.380
What does I love you mean? I love yous for, for girlfriends.

01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:07.740
And I love everybody.

01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:13.580
I vote for GPPP. GPPP. Should we just call this

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:17.660
episode GPPP too? No.

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:21.900
With Roman numerals too. I don't like it. GPPP, the, the, the PPP, the PPP.

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:25.820
I don't like it. Or let's call it, let's call it, I love you GPPP.

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:29.500
No. The Piquel church said. The P, the P, the Piquel.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.580
The Piquel. The Piquel. The Piquel.

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.660
Unfair. GP Piquel.

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:39.020
GP Piquel. I vote for, I love you GPPP. There, I said it.

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:43.500
You what? I, I love you GPPP. That would be the title.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:47.740
Is, you know, so it'd be like a title of you not being able to tell Rob that you

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.420
love him. This, I don't love, I love you. I love

01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:55.900
what I like. Why, why am I always, why is it, where did this legend start of me

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:59.500
being like emotionless? Emotionless. Like what, where did that?

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:02.460
I think you started it. Yeah.

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:07.340
Yeah. But I didn't, you used that as an excuse to win arguments and

01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:12.300
and, and, and have like free reign to be mean to people.

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.260
But that's crazy. That's what you're saying is crazy.

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.020
Yeah. Well, it's like, like, like as an alternative, like what do you do?

01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.500
Like what do you, how do you win arguments with people?

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.300
I don't, I don't, I don't do anything. Yeah, Rob loses arguments.

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:28.700
I'm not good at, good at anything. All right. Well, so, so you win.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:38.940
Congratulations. How's that fart drink? See, that's like, when I look back on our

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:44.620
friendship, any time anybody bends over, reaches for anything, just adding a

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:48.940
fart sound to every movement. It's, it's, it's, uh, you can either

01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:54.860
elicit like great laughter or just stop it.

01:44:54.860 --> 01:45:00.620
Yeah. Well, the latter being me for 20 years, this fucking guy, like, like,

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:05.580
just every fucking meal, every goddamn bite. This is why we don't eat it.

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:10.060
Eat together. Like, I was like, like, well, that's why the fly two is

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:15.340
underrated and I take a bite and it's just like, it's just, and I'm like,

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.540
stop, okay, I get it. It's a fart sound. When I eat, like, I guess you're saying

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:21.740
I'm fat or whatever. Like, no, no, I'm saying your, your,

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:25.020
whatever you're eating is making fart noises. Yeah.

01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.860
It took me a while, but I figured out it was all in good fun.

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.820
It really didn't have anything to do with the fly too.

01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:35.660
It just, you know, I just, I thought it was funny.

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.420
I thought it was really funny how upset you got.

01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:42.940
Yeah, I get it. You got it so upset about it, it's like

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:46.460
racism and, and, and people dying all over the world and

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:53.500
that's the thing that's going to make you.

01:45:53.500 --> 01:46:00.300
I do not like that. I don't like it. I hate that when I put food in my mouth

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:04.060
and I chew on it and it makes fart noise. I don't like it.

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:09.420
That's, that's, that's interesting. I find it, I find, I find it amusing.

01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:17.020
Yeah. Well, I, it's, it's like, uh, God, oh God, I'm a salacious crumb.

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:22.940
Dude, what is, what is this? Yeah, exactly. It's always, it's always

01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:26.940
right under the surface. Yeah, well, it's like, I make such an easy target.

01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:31.420
I went to Dan's house, I got the free iPad and I, and I, oh, he's so mean to me.

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:34.540
Like, like, like, look at it, like, like, do that Rashomon, like,

01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:40.380
fucking imagine me. Like, I didn't listen. I was fucking, I came down. I was like,

01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:46.300
five dollars.

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.300
At my door.

01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:56.300
Where's my iPad?

01:46:56.300 --> 01:47:01.340
Where's my iPad? Oh, where's my iPad?

01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:06.060
Oh, you're coming in my house. Oh, you're coming in my house.

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:09.020
Dude, I didn't say anything. Do you want something to drink?

01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:11.020
Let's just fucking go.

01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:18.860
Oh, thank you. Oh, now he's talking. Oh, he's talking to me.

01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:24.940
Oh, oh, he's got some problems. Oh, oh, oh, he's got problems.

01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:30.060
Oh, oh, oh, no, my girlfriend is, is, is walking out in a bathrobe.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:40.300
Ah, oh, oh, shit. Oh, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, I think you better go now.

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:45.420
Take your iPad. I think you better go now.

01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:49.180
I hope you don't believe this. I, I, like, yeah, I, you know, like,

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:52.860
let me tell my, from his perspective, I guess I am the villain.

01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:54.860
I'm a fucking artist.

01:47:54.860 --> 01:48:00.380
Fucking insane. He came over. He got the iPad. You invited me.

01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:04.620
And you, and you on the plane. I guess. Stop talking about the plane.

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:07.180
On the plane, he goes, well, well, why don't you buy it?

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.540
Oh, that would be really nice. That would be a good way for me to decide whether or

01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:13.740
not I want to plunk down some money. I could see what it, you were like going,

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:18.540
it's really heavy though. When I, I like the, I like the small one because

01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:23.260
when I hold it, it's not heavy, but the bigger one, it's, it's heavy.

01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:27.100
It looks, it's heavy, but maybe, maybe for you, it won't be as heavy.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.340
I've got two of them. So it's really not that big of a deal.

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:35.100
I just want to say, like, and then, and then I text them, I go,

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:42.620
hey, did you, could I, could I, could I try out that, that, that, that iPad pro?

01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:48.300
Yeah, we're at the, you rust again. Come on down.

01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:54.220
Okay, cool. I should get out of the house and go down there.

01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.260
Everybody at the table goes, hi, Rob. Hi, Rob. Hi, Rob. Hi, Rob.

01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.940
How you been, Rob? How you been, Rob?

01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.420
Dan.

01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:06.700
Come on, to be fair, that was a, it was a, it was a great day.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.340
I was having a. Don't invite a person over.

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:15.420
And then I go, okay, it's 1130. I don't feel like drinking right now.

01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:19.260
And I don't have my iPad, so. I'm going to leave.

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:22.940
Zero profit for the Schrab.margin. I guess I'll be off on my way.

01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:25.580
I would stay there for an hour without any contact.

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:29.020
To work on my fucking, uh, green goblin glider.

01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:35.340
You, I, you got my iPad and I said, before you left, I said,

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:39.020
do you have the right charger for it? And you're like, what?

01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:42.300
What are you talking about? And I'm like, the charger, I don't know,

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.620
like a cube and you're like the thing that goes to the thing.

01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.380
And I'm like, yeah, but like, I just want to make sure because it's an iPad pro

01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:52.220
and it won't like, if you just use a regular thing you'd use for a phone,

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:56.380
it'll charge slower than it, than it uses the charge.

01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:59.820
So you, I've come to learn that you definitely need this thing.

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:02.220
Like, you know what? Let me just go get one. I have a thousand of them.

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:06.380
I go upstairs to go find one. He comes up.

01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:07.660
He followed you.

01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.820
Yeah. I know. And I didn't have a problem with it.

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.740
I didn't have a fucking problem with it.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.140
I, I, but I found the thing and then I showed it to you

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:15.980
and you're like, oh, I got a million of those.

01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:20.060
And I'm like, okay, cool. And then you sat down and then you're hanging out.

01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.460
Yeah. I didn't have a fucking problem with that either.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:25.180
But it's standing there in my underwear and then you sat there

01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:27.740
and then I was like, do you want me to get you a drink?

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:32.380
And you're like, oh, what, what am I a piece of shit?

01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:35.820
A piece of shit or something?

01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:37.660
And I'm like, no, I'm offering you a drink.

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.420
I'll get you a drink like you want to hang out.

01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:40.940
I'm in my fucking underwear.

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:44.540
I don't, I don't, but I'll fucking get you a drink and we'll hang out

01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:48.700
because you're my friend, you know, like, like, like, because I'm down to clown.

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:55.660
And I, and I, and I fucking like, I go, I go get the fucking ice and the drink.

01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:58.460
I was fucking like, this is, I'm like fucking Bilbo.

01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:01.500
I'm like, once you're in the Shire, you're fucking, you're my guest.

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:04.620
Like here, of course, let's sit, let's talk.

01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:08.300
Oh, tell me about the world. Tell me about, tell me about the memo.

01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:09.260
What's going on with the memo?

01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.780
I'm like, I don't know what the memo is thinking.

01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:14.140
Then Cody comes in and then you saw Cody and you're like, what the fuck?

01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.580
Why didn't you tell me Cody was here?

01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:17.340
I'm like, well, because it doesn't matter.

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:18.780
It's like, cool, like whatever.

01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.140
I roll with the flow.

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.140
I like, I fucking love my friends.

01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.460
I chill. I want to come over and get an iPad.

01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:27.180
You got iPad. Hey, you sure you don't, you want to charge it, right?

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:30.460
I was like, from my perspective, like, all I'm doing is like,

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.700
serving and protecting and fucking.

01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:36.540
And then Cody fucking gets too tired to talk about the memo and goes to bed.

01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:39.980
And then after a while, I go like, I said, I said,

01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:42.460
you characterize it as me like giving you some brush off.

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:46.140
I was like, it was like, I was like, like, man,

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:48.140
I really wish I could help you right now.

01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:53.100
Sounds like you're sinking in quicksand, but I don't want to get my hands dirty.

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:54.060
I didn't say that.

01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:55.900
I'm going to back away.

01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.140
Could you throw me a branch?

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.900
What? Did you say please throw me a branch?

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:02.860
No, I didn't.

01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:04.060
I didn't. You're right.

01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.460
Yeah. It must be nice to be in.

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:11.340
It wasn't. It was like, I'm like, well, just like,

01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:14.780
I would have put on some pants and got hung out with you if you'd said, man.

01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.660
This isn't the first time you've come to the door and you're underwear

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.820
and let me in. Yeah.

01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:23.740
Have a drink at 9 30.

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.100
Great. Sounds like a good friendship.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:31.900
I was having a fine time until until I realized that you were like the whole time going.

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.260
Why is he here?

01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:35.580
That's why he's here.

01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:38.540
When did you realize that you said get out?

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:44.860
When I said, I've got I've got I had the Postmates brought fucking food over.

01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.580
I ate the whole sandwich and I'm like, I'm like, I ate the sandwich.

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:49.180
Like it's been hours.

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:50.300
I'm like, I'm going to go.

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.540
I'm going to go back and be with my girlfriend now.

01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:56.540
All right. Like, like, oh, it sounds like I but but you're my friend

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.060

01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:06.220
I wish, you know, I want and then and then also when you do the show tonight, you know,

like it's just fucking like gollum with his fucking iPad is like, I guess I'll do the show.

01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:12.460
Doesn't sound like gollum at all.

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.140
Well, that was a terrible guy.

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.540
That guy was just like, sometimes people take this shit seriously.

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:22.060
You know, it's like the guy is like, you know, you ever hear him tell his stories

01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.740
about his mom and you meet his mom.

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:25.660
She's a fucking sweetheart.

01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:31.340
He's like, he's getting started. Yeah, my mom, my mom, my mom was like, she took my comic books

01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.820
away and she said, you can't masturbate to these anymore.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:36.620
And I was like, wow, what a what a crazy Midwestern bitch this sounds like.

01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:39.740
Then you meet her and she's like, geez, I just wish my son was sane.

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:45.340
And you're like, yeah, you know, like, this is Schrab.

01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:47.180
He creates myths, he creates legends.

01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:50.220
I should have a relationship with my mom like you have.

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:54.940
Then I would be then I would be doing just great.

01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:57.580
But I'm just saying you you're you're a poet.

01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:58.380
You're an artist.

01:53:58.380 --> 01:53:59.740
You guys should go on mom swappers.

01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:03.260
You mom you make you make shit sound.

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:04.300

It might as well be called.

01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:10.380

01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:49.900
Why wasn't it called poop talk?

01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:51.100
It should be called poop talk.

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.140
Poop talk.

01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:52.620
I don't know.

01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:55.340
Kiss me on Monday.

01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.060
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:56.620
I love you all.

01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:57.820
Drive fast and take chances.

01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:58.300
See y'all.

01:55:58.300 --> 01:55:58.940
Kiss me on Monday.

01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:15.900
Zach put a beat on before you get beat on.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:20.460
Did you get any of that?

01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:30.460
It's a good show.
