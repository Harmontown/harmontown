Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hermontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:45.000\nThank you, wow.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:51.000\nWhat's with the big crowd, Jeff? What's going on?\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nDon't know. Maybe your show got canceled.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nIt was canceled last time. I guess it was a big crowd last time, too.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:05.000\nI guess this is all we got now, huh? This is all the people that were watching community.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nAll 200 of them.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:11.000\nWhat's next for you, Dan? Are you going to arrest on your laurels?\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nI'm really up in the air about that.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:19.000\nMy fantasy, as you probably know, is to be able to not write ever again.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:26.000\nBut there's this whole mortgage, and I want to have a baby, and baby need diapers.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:32.000\nBaby's got to go to college, because it'll probably be a fucking athlete.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nBecause that's just my karma.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:41.000\nIf baby is an athlete, it'll pay for itself, the scholarships and shit.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nWell, you're right, you're right.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:50.000\nAnyways, the money. Life is money. I'm in the second half of my life now. It's time for the selfless half of my life to begin.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nI have met with my goddess. I now need to atone with the cosmos.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nAre you prepared to be a father? Do you think that you're ready to bring a child into this world?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nI mean, worse guys than me have done it.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nThat's not an answer.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:13.000\nThe population of this planet is all you ever need, that it's not that hard a job.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:20.000\nProject yourself into a three-year-old child of yours, and Aaron's.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:23.000\nYou're a father of a three-year-old.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nAm I in the child?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:29.000\nProject yourself into that reality.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nSo you're a father of a three-year-old person.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\nWhat's your day-to-day, your quotidian shit?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:41.000\nWell, I'm hoping, yeah, I hope I can work from home by that time.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:47.000\nI hope I can be like a house husband and really put my full energy into the kid.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:52.000\nThat's why I don't know what I'm going to do next, because I could do a Fox deal.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:57.000\nThey had rolled that when I got my job back at Community.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:03.000\nSo there's that whole network sitcom world still waiting there.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nBut now I have this opportunity.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nI could, without really burning any bridges, I could walk away from that.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nI could write movies.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nI could write a book.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nWhat's your fantasy about your next project?\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nIf you could have anything as your next thing, what would it be?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:26.000\nWell, I really want to write this one movie that I've been trying to write for 15 years now.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nDaedalus?\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:28.000\nYeah.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nDo that one.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nCan we talk about that, or would that be bad business?\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nNo, I don't want to talk it out or anything.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nWell, it's just a story I want to write.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nGet off my dick.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:53.000\nBut you and I used to go to the drawing room and talk about this movie, and you would cry and not write that movie.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:57.000\nYeah, I've been working on it for quite a while, which is a good sign that you probably shouldn't.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:03.000\nI don't know. I always tell the kids, don't throw that idea away, that one you've been thinking about since high school,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nbecause it's too precious.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:10.000\nIt's a recipe for writer's block, like focusing on that thing.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:20.000\nBut it also might be incumbent upon the elderly writers like myself to actually get around to that thing they always wanted to do.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nDo you feel elderly at 41?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nI'm in the second half of my life.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nI'm not about to blow anyone away as a wonder kind.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:41.000\nOr pronounce Wunderkind right.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nThere's certain words I've only ever seen in type. I've never heard anything like that.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nBaggle and wonder kind.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nHey, you know that Playboy liquor store over in Hollywood?\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nYeah, it says Playboy liquor.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nHow are they getting away with that?\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nThat's like crazy.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nBecause of a drive pass at Playboy liquor store, there's a liquor store in LA that's called Playboy liquor.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:10.000\nIt is dead on the font of Playboy magazine, but the Y is a martini glass.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nAnd it's just like Playboy liquor.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nLike, hey, you like Playboy?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nIt's rich tradition of high quality pornography.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nCome on in.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nIt's just a fucking dirtballs liquor store.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nYou can't do that. You can't have like a Nintendo grocery store.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nSpell Nintendo with a Y.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nYou can do whatever you want.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:38.000\nDon't let me get in your way. I'm half done living.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nSo Dan, you're getting married in what, November?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nYeah.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nAnd then you're a married fellow.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nYou're a husband.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nYeah.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nAnd then you're going to have a baby.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nYeah.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nOr as far as we know, it could be twins. We don't know.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nYou might suddenly be the father of twin girls.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:02.000\nAm I projecting onto Jeff or can anyone else sense that he doesn't want me to get married and have a baby?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nNo, you're projecting.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nYou're projecting.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:07.000\nOkay.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nWell, a couple people are getting that pheromone off of you.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nYou're projecting onto me.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.000\nOkay.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nI'm saying like, you're going to be a fucking father.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nYeah.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nThat's crazy cool.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nI'm all for it, man.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nImagine me replicating myself genetically.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nI know.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.000\nHorrifying.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nIt's going to be amazing.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:37.000\nImagine me, imagine me, imagine if you're a little kid and you want a bedtime story, then this motherfucker walks in.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nBest writer in the fucking world.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nWhoa.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nAll right.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nThat's like, all right, Dan, give me a bedtime story.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nI'm 18 months old.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:57.000\nMy name is Vanessa because Aaron named your first daughter Vanessa.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nOh man.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nShe's got worse in store.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nWhat are the names?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nShe got one last night that she really likes.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nScorpion.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nShe really likes that song.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:13.000\nIt's in that, it's in that, what's it, Pedro Amadovar movie.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:28.000\nThere's a musician in one of the movies and he sings that song.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nWhat's happening right now?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nIt's this song.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nIt's like a Spanish song or Mexican song.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nNo, in this song, what is it?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nOh no.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nWhat is Aaron want the baby to be called?\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nGod damn it.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nNow I forgot.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nAaron?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nNow I forgot.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nShe's not here, she's not here.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nOh.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:49.000\nShe's in that show.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nPaloma.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nWhat?\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nPaloma.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nPaloma.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nPaloma means dove.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nIt means dove, right?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nYeah.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nWho knew that?\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nWho's raising their hand?\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nI haven't heard yet.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nWho are you?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\nHis name is Darren McGathey.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nYour name is what?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nOh, okay.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nYou're just guessing that.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nBut you're right.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nPaloma.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:17.000\nBut you didn't have a conversation with me about this.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nYou guessed.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nYeah, Paloma.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nPaloma.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nThat's what it is.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nDidn't Picasso name his daughter Paloma?\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt means dove.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nFine.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nWhat?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nShe's a hack.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nI don't know.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nBut Paloma, I'd like to have a little daughter named Paloma.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:37.000\nI kind of, for somebody, I wonder if I'm sexist.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:43.000\nThen let's take it to the bank.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:48.000\nI think I must be sexist, or whatever the opposite of sexist is.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nI would really like to have a daughter, and I also don't care what her name is.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nAs much as I would care.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\nIs it just gender identity?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:05.000\nI'm more reticent to name my son something weird than my daughter.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:11.000\nI kind of feel like the daughter's name is just a fuck off.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nThat's misogynist.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\nOr is it like I'm already unconditionally loving my daughter, and I'm just going to make my\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nson's life a living hell, because I'm going to be thinking, that's a little me.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nThat's a little me.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd the daughter, because of my...\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nWhy wouldn't your daughter be a little you, too?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nYou know why, Jeff.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nI don't know why.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:35.000\nShe'll have a hole where her wiener should be.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:39.000\nAnd you just can't...\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:44.000\nShe's going to have her hands full with problems.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nNo, I'm very much...\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nWhat would you prefer?\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nIf you could make a choice, son or daughter?\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:58.000\nI think I would prefer a daughter, because I'm terrified of getting eaten by the kid.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:05.000\nIn a mythical sense, prom night, and your teenage kid comes after you drunk, and he's\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nlike, fuck you, old man.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nThat whole energy.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nSo you want a girl because she can't beat you up when she's 18?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nShe'll be an errand up.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nHer issues will be with...\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nShe'll be like, old lady, fuck you.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd I'll be like, now, now.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:29.000\nCome sit with daddy and watch Blazing Saddles.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nFetch my bifocals.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nDoes Aaron have a name for the boy, if it's a boy?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt's never been Saddles soap.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nI've heard her throw out Cormac.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nCormac?\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nKarthi?\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nI reckon.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\nConnor.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nConnor, is it just...\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'll see your names.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nI like biblical names, and I like my names Daniel.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nGod will be my judge.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nFor real?\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nYeah.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:04.000\nAnd I interpret that to mean, and only God.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nOnly God.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nThere's a dot after that.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nOnly God will tell you to tie her shoes.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nGod will be my judge.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nThat's it, motherfucker.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nYeah, the story of Daniel is great.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nNot Sony, not NBC.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:23.000\nDaniel was a dream interpreter for a king, and then his rival colleagues, the Hacks,\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:32.000\nthey turned him in for praying to the wrong God secretly.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:39.000\nAnd he was using his position as a dream interpreter to kind of move the king in a Yahweh direction.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:47.000\nAnd the king was kind of under his psychological thumb, because he was good at what he did.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.000\nHe was winning him with being good at his job.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:56.000\nAnd so his rivals tried to turn him in, and I can't remember how the rest of the story goes,\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:00.000\nexcept it ends with all of those right...\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nThey throw him in the lion's den, and then God closes the lion's mouths,\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:09.000\nand he pulled Daniel out, and they go, I guess you're on the winning team,\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nand then they throw all of the guys that fucked with him,\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nand all of their families, and all of their families' families into the lion's den,\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:21.000\nand the lions eat them.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nIt's a horrible story.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nGod will be my judge.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd also, he'll kick ass on your behalf.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:33.000\nYes, he's in my corner.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nSo I like that name.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:43.000\nI wouldn't mind just a straightforward Hebrew name for my kid.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nLike what?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nI have to look it up.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:53.000\nI want to look up all the stories and see what kind of myth I would like the kid to be able to delve into.\n\n12:53.000 --> 13:00.000\nDo you feel like your parents thought about Daniel as a name for you, and had foresight?\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nMy mom said that she chose the names based on...\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:10.000\nShe named me and my brother with these alliterative names, Doug and Dan.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nShe said at one point that the way she picked the names,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:20.000\nwas she imagined them being announced over the loudspeakers at a football arena?\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:26.000\nLike, quarterback Dan Harmon at Douglas.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:39.000\nYeah, there's the Harbin Brothers, Doug and Dan out there, flowing the football around.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:45.000\nAnyways, I want to see you as a father.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nYou're gonna.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nI know.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nI'm going to, and I want to.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:54.000\nI want to see you change your diaper.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nI'm gonna be good at that.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nWhat qualifies you to be changing your diaper?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nWell, I don't change my underwear very often.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:05.000\nSo when I do, it's gross.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nSo I'm prepared for...\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:11.000\nNo, no, you're not prepared for that.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nNo, I am.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nWhy is a guy that doesn't change his own underwear, qualify to change another human being's underwear?\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nBecause I take him off and I'm like, blech.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nAnd I throw him in the hamper, and that's what you do when you change a diaper.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nNo, you don't!\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nYou shit everywhere.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:29.000\nIt's about tidiness, it's about health.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:33.000\nI'll see you in the parental funny papers, baby.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nI'm gonna raise the fuck out of this kid.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nYou being a father, you're gonna get what you don't want.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:47.000\nYou're gonna get some, strangely, the person that you didn't want to raise, a human being.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:54.000\nAnd you'll be there giving it probably good bedtime stories.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nWhat would the bedtime stories be?\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.000\nThat opportunity went away.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:08.000\nChicken shit.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nYou're gonna have a child.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:16.000\nThis is the batting cages of learning how to tell a baby story.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:27.000\nI know Vanessa.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:36.000\nOnce there was this farmer, and he kept telling in his fields, say he could make little jelly bean plants.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:42.000\nAnd then one day one of the jelly bean plants looked up at her and said,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nplease don't harvest me, I have a magical jelly bean plant.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:54.000\nI don't want to be harvested, I need to stay here so that I can keep talking to you and hanging out.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nYou can have all the other jelly bean plants.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nThis is what I'm talking about.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nDon't cut me down.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:12.000\nSo the farmer, who was also a princess,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:17.000\nobliged the magic jelly bean plant, harvested all the others,\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:21.000\ntook them inside to her father and said, here's the jelly beans, he counted them up.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:33.000\nI count only seven jelly bean plants worth of jelly beans here, Rodriguez.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:36.000\nThat is because one of them was magical and asked me not to...\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nSilence!\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:44.000\nBring me my belt.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nWhy?\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nYou know why.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nWhere is it?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nIt's over there on the dresser.\n\n16:55.000 --> 17:01.000\nSlowly Rodriguez went and grabbed the belt off the dresser with trembling hands,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:11.000\nhanded it to her father, who put it on because his pants were just falling down a little.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:16.000\nAnd then he ran out to the field with Rodriguez and they talked to the jelly bean plant\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.000\nand they had an hour conversation about covering a wide range of topics\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:28.000\nand including how to irrigate better so that they ended up growing more jelly bean plants than ever.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:35.000\nSo the moral is go to sleep.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:41.000\nIt's Tarot episode one.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nYou're going to be a good dad.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nThank you.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nThanks everybody.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:52.000\nI'm just looking through the Playboy liquor.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nBumper stickers, I don't really...\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nOh dear.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nI wouldn't be the first person to not understand bumper stickers.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nI understand if you're in a band, you put your band's bumper sticker on your bumper\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:05.000\nbecause it's like, hey, it's my car, I'm going to promote my band with my bumper sticker.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:16.000\nI understand the clever ones, like the pithy ones, like here's a little something about me.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:20.000\nI don't get it, but we don't have to talk about it.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nWait, for instance, what was that?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nI can't remember.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nI don't know, I just saw...\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nWell, I mean, I don't know.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nI can't think of any really, honestly.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:36.000\nWhat about ones that espouse a political agenda?\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:42.000\nI think it's a bad idea to have a bumper sticker because it can't be so large\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nthat I could read it from far enough away to be safe to read your bumper sticker.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:52.000\nI have to get close enough to read your political philosophy and maybe hit you.\n\n18:52.000 --> 19:00.000\nI'm almost positive that no one on this earth has ever been converted to anything by a bumper sticker.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nSo I don't know what purpose.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.000\nIs it just the idea that it's just like, we'll whittle away at you.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nI saw a bumper sticker that said, honk if you're horny.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nYou like that one?\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nI honked.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.000\nYou ever see that guy on the corner outside the Vista Theater\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nand he's always holding a sign that says, honk for peace?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nYeah.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nAnd he keeps gesturing.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nHe seems really exasperated when people aren't honking.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd then people honk and then he just gives them a big thumb up.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:38.000\nI got 40 questions for that guy.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:45.000\nI just said, how do you know when you're finished?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nHow does that work?\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nWhy is he mad at people who don't honk?\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.000\nI can already see the anger on his face when he doesn't get the honks he wants.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:58.000\nSo I know that if he was in control of an army, he'd attack someone.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nBut he's just in control of a sign, so he just goes,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:06.000\nI've seen that guy, but before I see him, I hear a bunch of honking which makes you unhappy\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nbecause it's the sound of horns honking.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nYeah, it's like make your baby cry if you want world peace.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nPoke your baby in the eye.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:17.000\nIt's like a sound that distresses you.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nIsn't that wonderful how babies crying really makes us upset?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nLike on an airplane, you hear that sound and you're like,\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:28.000\nyou think you're a bad person because you're like, shut that fucking baby up.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:33.000\nBut really the reason you're upset is because you're having an instinctive reaction\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nto a human child in distress.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nAnd what you're frustrated by is the fact that you can't do anything about it.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:44.000\nYou're not allowed to do anything because we're not, we're a disenfranchised tribe.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nRyan Stiles is the coolest thing in the world.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nWe're on a plane and Ryan has three children.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:55.000\nAnd there's a woman that brought a baby on board in first class and the baby was just screaming.\n\n20:55.000 --> 21:05.000\nAnd like, probably a three-year-old boy just fucking absolutely abject pain, just screaming.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:09.000\nAnd Ryan said, can I take your baby?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nAnd Ryan took the child and he doesn't like to fly.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nRyan is a bad flyer.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nHe does not like flying.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:21.000\nHe took the child and walked out of first class down like all the way to the back of the plane\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nand the crying stops.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:27.000\nRyan killed that baby.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:31.000\nThe North Korean soldiers never got on the bus.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nAll we heard was a door open.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:43.000\nRyan came back with a quiet child and sat down and leaned his chair back and put the baby, the toddler, on his chest\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nand they went to sleep for the next four hours.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:50.000\nAnd the mother was like, when we landed, she's like, how did you do that?\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nHe goes, like, give it a change of scenery.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nLike, take the baby for a walk once in a while.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nLike, move it around and don't panic.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nIt was so cool.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:07.000\nIt's possible to take a crying baby in a plane and assuage the pain.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nYeah.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.000\nI always imagine the babies, like their ears aren't popping.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nI don't know how terrifying that must be for the baby.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nI always think about that too.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nPeople bring animals on the plane, like they're in the cargo bay or whatever.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:25.000\nThey must be back there like, what the fuck is going on?\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:30.000\nIsn't it weird how dogs love being in cars and cats are like, fuck you?\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nIt's so amazing.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nDogs are so comfortable with everything.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nLike, Aaron just puts fucking t-shirts on the dog.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nIt's a hat on his head.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nHe doesn't get it.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nHe just feels like, oh, this is my job.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nI'll just dress like a lizard now.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:52.000\nCats are like, you put something on a cat and it starts running around backwards like a crayfish,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:55.000\ntrying to back out from it.\n\n22:55.000 --> 23:02.000\nCats do not cotton to any kind of unnatural behavior or costuming.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nAll right.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:09.000\nLet's break the Kumail glass because to give this show a kick in the ass.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:13.000\nKumail Nanjiani!\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:19.000\nFa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:24.000\nI'm hungover, so the show's low energy, so I'm bringing out the big guns.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nThe show's been going great.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nI've been listening and watching.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nThese people love it.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nThey're like, yeah, Kumail.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nWe're on board kinda.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nKumail, is it just me or do you get sexier every time I see you?\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nI've been taking pills.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nWhat sort of pills?\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nJust like diet pills.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:50.000\nThey work, guys. Don't listen to what moms say.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nHere, I'm making you a drink.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nOh, thank you. Thank you.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nI'm just using my hand to put the ice in the cup.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nKumail, do you fancy yourself a father?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:05.000\nYou know, it's so weird that you guys are talking about this because we've been talking about it.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nLike, it's been like, we're...\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:13.000\nIt's hard. It's one of those things your whole life, you know, you think life's gonna be a certain way.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nYou're supposed to do certain things in my whole life.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nI've been like, I'll be a dad someday. I'll be a dad someday. My kid's gonna be great.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:24.000\nAnd then at a certain point, you're like, well, do I really want to be a dad?\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:30.000\nIt's hard to ask yourself a question that you thought the answer was made for you your whole life.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nAnd now in my 30s, I'm like, do I really want that?\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nI don't know. It's very hard to think about.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nI would imagine you being a good father.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nI don't think I'd be a bad father. I think I'd be a good father.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nI don't know if I want to be a father.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nI don't know. We've just started...\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:55.000\nCertainly we don't need that incumbent upon us to choke the planet with more flesh.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nYeah, but...\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nIf people are having certain thoughts about it...\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nThat's like the worst gynecologist ever, listen.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:09.000\nYou're gonna have a little thing that chokes the planet with more flesh.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:16.000\nYahweh said in the Old Testament, right? He said, go for it and choke the planet with more flesh.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:19.000\nIt's gonna hurt when you take a shit from now on.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:25.000\nDan, are you driven? Do you feel a part of you needs to be a father wants to be a father?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nWhy do you want to be a father?\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nDo you feel that way?\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:32.000\nI feel driven to it. I feel like...\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:40.000\nWhen I have to make a choice, I go best case, worst case and compare all the possibilities.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:46.000\nThe worst case scenario with having a kid is having a kid and just being like anybody else that has a kid.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:54.000\nLike, I had a kid and sometimes people with kids secretly warn you when no one's listening.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nDon't do it.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.000\nOh yeah, I've been pulled aside at parties.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:03.000\nBut it's always tongue and chit. They mean it, but it's truth and jest.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:15.000\nThat's the worst case scenario is regretting, is having a kid and wondering what it would be like to be a bachelor and play video games.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nOr just be with Aaron and not have a kid.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:23.000\nLike what Schrab and Kate are doing. They're not having kids, they're just hanging out.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:30.000\nThe worst case scenario is worrying about that. What am I missing?\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:36.000\nThe worst case scenario with not having a kid is far worse.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:42.000\nIt's like being 70 years old and going like, I've had a pretty good life.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nWe've had our ups and downs and our chuckles.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nI'm gonna die.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nBring in the people I'll say my final words to.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nThere is no one.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:58.000\nBring in little Danny Jr. You traded his soul in for playing Wolfenstein.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nThat sounds pretty good.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:09.000\nThat's the reason to have a child is that you feel like at your dying breath that you wished there was a version of you.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:13.000\nBut it's not just about my dying breath. I'm talking about all those years in between too.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:20.000\nWhat I'm trying to say is that wondering what it would have been like to have children\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:27.000\nis for me a more dire fate than wondering what it would be like to not have children.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:30.000\nSomething that I have 41 years of experience with.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:38.000\nI know the path that I've been on and I know that sometimes I wish it would last forever.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nYou're like, this is going great. Let's bring a couple children into this.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:50.000\nBut I also know that my hair is falling out and that my boobs are sagging and I have boobs.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:54.000\nI'm melting. I'm dying. I'm disintegrating.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:59.000\nSo are you combating mortality by having children? Is that what it is?\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:02.000\nNo, it's not like a pharaoh thing like I want my legacy.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.000\nIt's not.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nBecause it is for a lot of people.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:10.000\nNo, I would never put that whammy on a kid. I hope he's a garbage man.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nBe a garbage man. Be the best garbage man everybody works with.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nI don't give a shit what you do.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:21.000\nBecause who are we kidding? Everybody's been doing remarkable things for 6,000 years.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nWhere has it gotten them? Who gives a fuck?\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nJust have a good life, Harmon Jr.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.000\nThat was like inspiring and cynical at the same time.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:40.000\nThe awareness of my mortality is, I'm saying like, I want to tell a story with my life.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:44.000\nAnd I'm halfway through that story.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:50.000\nAnd for me, reproduction is the second half of a full life.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:55.000\nOh, I thought it was like setting up a sequel, you know, when Freddy's Hand comes out again.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nOh, that's more Harmon happening.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:01.000\nI don't even know how to think about this.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:06.000\nBecause for me, a reason that I always assumed I wanted kids was like, you know, that's how you,\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nbecause I have, you know, I've been thinking about death my whole life.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nAnd I'm like, that's how, for me, you combat it, you get a kid,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:16.000\nand then that person continues on the stuff you've done and you sort of live on through them.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:19.000\nBut now I'm like, well, I kind of want to live on through the stuff I do.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:26.000\nYou know, like you sort of, like the, you know, shows you right or whatever, that kind of stuff.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:31.000\nSo I think I would rather do that, but I don't know.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nI don't even know how to start thinking about it.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.000\nIt seems like so much.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:38.000\nDo your parents have an opinion about whether you should be a father or not?\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nMe?\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nYeah.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nDo they care about you being a father?\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nYeah, they have a very strong opinion.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nThey're very proud.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:50.000\nI'm like, now, I kind of want to be like, remember how difficult it was when I brought a white woman home?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:53.000\nNow I'm bringing a person, you can't even separate the person.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:56.000\nIt's like a swirl, like they're together.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nIt's going to be so much more complicated.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:04.000\nThis is like we went to fucking Cold Stone and mixed it all up.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nThere's no conversation now, so.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nDo you think they're excited about that or?\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:12.000\nYeah, I was just with them this weekend and they brought it up a lot.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:15.000\nSo, I mean, they're like, like, when you, you, you referenced,\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nyou were how difficult it was when I brought a white woman home,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nlike what was the family situation when you and Emily started going out,\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nwhen you, when it was time to meet the parents?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nWe thought, we've talked about your parents, like ambitions for you.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nWe wanted you to be a doctor.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nYeah.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:33.000\nI mean, they, so they had maybe ambitions for you in terms of your mate as well.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:39.000\nOh yeah, they used to send me pictures of women, like, because it's all arranged marriage, you know.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nSo it's all these women who, so this is how it's set up.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:46.000\nThere's like older women in the community who are always aware of like, oh, you know,\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:49.000\nthat they have a girl, she just there in the market.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:52.000\nSo they, they know the guys and they know the women in the market.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:56.000\nSo they show me these pictures that are obviously these old ladies taking pictures\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nof like these girls at weddings and stuff, like, you know, they're eating,\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nthey're like caught unaware.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nIt's completely true.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:07.000\nAnd my mom would send it over with like sort of like a resume, like she's, you know,\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nshe's pre-med, she's got a green card.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nSo that's not going to be a problem.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:17.000\nAnd I kept saying no to them and I swear the women got more and more attractive.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:20.000\nAnd the last one was like fucking Cleopatra.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nLike she was stunning.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:27.000\nSo if you're in Pakistan and you're listening to this podcast, like always, like, hold out.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nOh yeah.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nAnd, oh yeah, hold out.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nThey're bluffing, they're bluffing.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nEven if you're going to stay in the system.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nI wonder if it works that way for the, for the poor girls.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:38.000\nYeah.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nLike, do their men, choices get...\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nYeah, but it's like kind of when you go to a store and you're like,\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nhey, what, what's the shit in the back?\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nWhat do you have in the back?\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nWhat's that girl?\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nCleopatra is that girl.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nWhat's her stake in it?\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nLike, what is she?\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nShe's getting me, dude.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:58.000\nThey're merging the house Nanjiani with...\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nYeah.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nIt is like that.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nIt is like that.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nIt's the iron bank will...\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nYeah.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nWe will be so much stronger.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nYeah.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nNo, it totally is like that.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:15.000\nIt's more of a pact between two families rather than just love.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nWe actually have a term for a marriage that's not arranged.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nThey call it love marriage.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:23.000\nIt's called love marriage, which here seems so redundant.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nBut over there, and they say it's like a bad term.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:28.000\nLike, oh, she had a love marriage, you know.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.000\nWhat?\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nLove marriage, Google it.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nMeaning she had a say in the matter?\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nNo, you always have a say in the matter.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:38.000\nThe difference is whether you get set up, you sort of hang out.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nSo it'll be like the two families meet and then they're like,\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:43.000\nfind an excuse to leave and the guy and the girl are there and you talk.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.000\nAnd then you decide like, yeah, this is the person, the rest of my life.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nShe likes purple.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nIs it male driven or female driven?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nLike who's driving that car?\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nBoth people can say no.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:58.000\nIt's like in that, it's fairly even for how crazy a system it is.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nThe woman can say no when she doesn't have to get married\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nand the guy can say no when they don't have.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nBoth have to say yes.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nAll right.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nYeah.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nSo crazy.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nIt's a little charming.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:13.000\nDo you think it is too little charming?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:18.000\nWell, I mean, it's charming from the vantage point of not having a deal with it.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nI'm currently pissed off.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:24.000\nI mean, as I think we all are about that fucking douchebag that didn't get laid\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:28.000\nand killed a bunch of people and blames it on women.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:29.000\nAnd also there's two...\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nI'm just hungover.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nYou're bummed out about that guy?\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.000\nYeah.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:38.500\nThere's been two attacks from Griffith Park, girls just taking a walk and they can't take\n\n33:38.500 --> 33:42.000\na walk because a guy is going to fucking attack them.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:47.000\nIt's different being a woman than being a guy because men expect things\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nand when they don't get what they want, they actually do attack.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nIt's the worst fucking thing in the world.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nI used to...\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:58.000\nI made it into my late 20s before I knew that that was a real thing.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:03.300\nI would get mad at my girlfriends when they would come home and the first girlfriend that\n\n34:03.300 --> 34:11.000\ncame home and said like, the guy out there, the one on the corner that's selling me oranges,\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:14.000\nhe makes these fucking sounds when I walk by him.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nI'm like, what do you talk?\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nCome on.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nGuy's selling oranges.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nHe's sucking on oranges.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:21.000\nHe's just like, no, he happens all the time.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:27.000\nHe's just being angry that you're a woman and that doesn't happen the other way.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:34.000\nThey make kissy sounds and comments and stuff like that if a woman's not with a man sometimes,\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:38.000\nif she is.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:44.000\nThe crazy thing to me was when I was like 29, when I first was being introduced to that\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:53.000\nconcept in a secondhand fashion by one of my girlfriends, my immediate emotional response\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:57.000\nwas, knock it off, stop being dramatic.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:04.000\nI had a weird membrane there that was inherently misogynist.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:16.000\nThere was a Robocop directive in my programming where the idea of...\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nI just believed in my brain.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nI was like, you're making that up.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:24.000\nWomen don't walk around on the sidewalk and just constantly get harassed.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nIt's every day.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nIt's also an everyday thing.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nI can't speak for women.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:34.000\nThere's probably women here that would absolutely say it better.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:39.000\nYou're prepared for guys to be shitty to you at all times.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:42.000\nAnd knowing that they're riddled with testosterone.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:47.000\nLearn how to not get raped by what you wear, what you say, how you reject somebody.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:50.000\nYou say you have a boyfriend when you don't.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nYou give a fake phone number.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nGuys never have to do that.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:57.000\nIt's just the ugliest thing in the world.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:05.000\nI hope that the people that died because of that little asshole, I hope the conversation\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:09.000\nbecomes something so cool that guys change.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:14.000\nI actually grow up and learn that what they want isn't a mandate.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:19.000\nWomen aren't simply things that will get fucked.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nThey can say fuck you.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nI don't want to fuck you.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nThat's not who I am.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:30.000\nI don't want to be the guy who says it's over.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nNo more problems.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:36.000\nBut I want to be hopeful and say, I feel like when I monitor the younger generation,\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nI feel like they are...\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nIt's so far away from that.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nWomen got the vote.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nThey're moving too early.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nWay later than black people.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:49.000\nWe like to hate our women.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:52.000\nWe will be misogynist way after we fix racism.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nWe're terrible.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nAnd women are the coolest.\n\n36:56.000 --> 37:01.000\nThey have everything on us.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nNow I'm being misogynist.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nIt might even fucking going on.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nI just...\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nWe're going to start just grabbing their bodies.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nIs that what that was going?\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nWere you going to talk?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nGo ahead.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nSorry.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nHow was it going to get misogynistic?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nI want to know.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nIt's like a guy talking about what women should or should not get.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:21.000\nWhat they shouldn't be is treated like anything other than a person.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nAnd this little guy is saying...\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:26.000\nHe's probably crazy.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nWhatever the fuck was going on with him.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:33.000\nThe idea that because he's a 24-year-old virgin and he has to go kill blonde women.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:37.000\nAnd then on Twitter, people backing that guy up saying,\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nHey, it's Memorial Day, man.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:43.000\nStop your feminist bullshit and support our troops.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.000\nBecause it's fucking...\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:45.000\nWait, what?\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.000\nThat's a pretty big thing.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:52.000\nThat's a weird comment section to plant any flag.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.000\nThere were people...\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:56.000\nBecause it was the yes all women thing going on, right?\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:59.000\nAs opposed to the not all men are rapey.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nI'm the coolest guy.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nNot all men do that.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nBut women are saying no.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:10.000\nAll women have to learn how to not get raped when they walk through a parking garage.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:13.000\nWomen have to deal with it.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nAll women do.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nYes, not all men are bad people.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:21.000\nBut all women have to learn how to deal with guys being bad at rejection.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:31.000\nSo, I really wish I had met that little fucker the day before he did that.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:38.000\nWait, you didn't have like a psychic dream that this was going to happen?\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:41.000\nWhat's funny is that kind of bitch.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nWhat?\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:43.000\nWhat?\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nGo ahead.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:47.000\nYou have the floor.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nWhat was the psychic dream that I don't want to get off track?\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nJust let's do a quick sidebar.\n\n38:52.000 --> 39:00.000\nIt's almost like I feel like I wake up after things happen and feel like something subliminally happened.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:03.000\nSo you like sort of backtrack and you're like, oh yeah.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:09.000\nI did not have a dream that a guy was going to go punish women because he's an asshole.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:14.000\nThat would be a stupid dream because that should be the story of every movie that we make.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.000\nI didn't think we were going to talk about this guy because I imagine that all the podcasts are.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:23.000\nBut my goal as always is originality.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:28.000\nBut now that we're on the topic, I just watched the video in the green room.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:38.000\nAnd I was stricken by how strangely disingenuous he acted like he was acting when he's talking.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nBecause his father's a director.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:42.000\nOh, really?\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:43.000\nAre you joking?\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nNo, he's an AD.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:49.000\nIt was so weird he was acting like he's like Josh Hartnett or something.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nI'm so into it.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nYeah.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:53.000\nIt was fucking giggles.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nBut it was so weird.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nYou're being shitty at being a bad guy.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:58.000\nHe's acting.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:06.000\nYeah, but I didn't understand that because I was like, normally when somebody is acting that way and you feel like they're being dishonest,\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:11.000\nthere's something inside them that they're suppressing and keeping down.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:18.000\nLike for instance, I hate women because they don't love me and I want to kill all of them.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nThis guy's saying that.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:24.000\nYeah, so what was his secret?\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nYeah, and he seems so fake.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:28.000\nThe secret isn't genuine.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nHe's an asshole.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:35.000\nAnd he probably had everything going for him except the fact that nobody likes him.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nAnd he...\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nThat's what he says.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:42.000\nI bet he had a real shitty vibe at the point.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nI have a young lady raising her hand in the audience.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nSo he was acting.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nCome on, say it.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:53.000\nAdam, take it easy, buddy.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nAdam gets to bring her up.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:59.000\nHe's got, by the way, he has a chair for his laptop.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nOh, nobody's sat here.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:03.000\nI'm Annie.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:04.000\nHello, Annie.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.000\nHi.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:08.000\nSo I just read an article. It's not like I knew this guy or anything.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:11.000\nSo it turns out he was into pickup artistry.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:12.000\nOh, the game?\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:13.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nWell, like the thing we know how men try to get...\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nThe game?\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nSure.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nYeah, there was a book that a guy wrote that's like...\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nIt's a very specific thing.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.000\nHe was into that, but it didn't work for him.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:28.000\nSo he was a member of this group that was called Pua Haters,\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nor Pua Hate or something.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\nWait, Pua?\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nPua's pickup artistry is what they refer...\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nI know, right?\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nIt already sounds gross.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nThat can be a thing?\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nRight.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:43.000\nSo yeah, so he's a member of this online community of people\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:46.000\nwho hate pickup artistry because it didn't work for them.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:47.000\nSo they're like...\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nSo now not only are they already angry at women,\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nthey're now doubly angry because these techniques just didn't work for them.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nYeah, even science doesn't work for them.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nThat's how awful women are.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nEven the science of being just verbally abusive\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nand deceptive to women.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nIs that that friend zone thing?\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:02.000\nIs that part of that?\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nI don't think so.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nOn Twitter, there's a whole thing about like friend zoning.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:06.000\nI think that's separate.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:07.000\nI think friend zone...\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:08.000\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:09.000\nI thought friend zoning was like,\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nno, this is never going to happen.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:12.000\nYou've never been friend zone.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:13.000\nYeah.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:14.000\nYeah.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:17.000\nAnd the men being mad at the idea that women could possibly\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nsend you to the...\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nI don't have to fuck you, Cornfield.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.000\nIt's so crazy.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:27.000\nSo he got mad that there was a book that he read\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nthat didn't get him laid?\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nRight, that didn't get him laid.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:32.000\nAnd then he was part of this group of people.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nWhy did he stay out of those three Chinese guys?\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nThere were three...\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nHe also hated...\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nHe hated...\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.000\nThis is another part of it.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.000\nHe's biracial.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:42.000\nAnd so he's half...\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nI forget what kind of Asian, but half white.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:47.000\nAnd he hated Asian guys.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nOn message boards, he'd be like,\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nyou guys suck, girls don't want you.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nAnd he said that it was part Asian-ness\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nthat drove women away,\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nbecause women don't like Asian dudes.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:58.000\nHe was racist against himself?\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nYeah.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nWell, part of himself.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nWell, he was...\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nYeah, this guy had no shortage of...\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nA shortage of dick.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:08.000\nYeah, I mean, it's not a brave stance to...\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:09.000\nI mean, whatever.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nI don't know what...\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nWe know that this guy's a bad person.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nThank you, Annie.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:14.000\nAnnie.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nOh, that game stuff.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nWhat was her name?\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nDid you get it?\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:19.000\nAnnie.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:20.000\nShe had a night for the listeners.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:23.000\nShe had a pink sweater and a pink bow in her hair.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:24.000\nIt was like...\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nHi, Harry.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nVery...\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nAnnie, where are you from?\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nI came from El Segundo,\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nbut I'm originally from San Francisco.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nEl Segundo?\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:34.000\nYeah, very far away.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nI left my wallet there.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:38.000\nSomebody here came from New York,\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nand he was telling me outside\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:43.000\nthat Harmontown got him through Hurricane Sandy.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:44.000\nWhat?\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:47.000\nBecause they didn't have any power,\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:50.000\nand they just had a bunch of podcasts on the computer,\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:51.000\nand they would...\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:52.000\nMy question was like,\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nif you didn't have power,\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:57.000\nthey would go to an office,\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nor one of them worked, I think,\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:02.000\nand listened to Harmontown through,\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:05.000\nand it helped him survive.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nIt would be so great if you asked who it was,\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:08.000\nand it wasn't anybody.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nYou just, like, had, like,\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:13.000\nin your head you made it up and bought it.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nI was wondering if politicians do that.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nI talked to a plumber named Mike.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:18.000\nIt was like that.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nHe's got three kids.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nCamille, how's the...\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:28.000\nHave you become a street celebrity now?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nLike, from a...\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:34.000\nYeah, my horns count for twice the piece, actually.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nWhat a haunt for that guy.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nFor sure now, everybody, like,\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:42.000\nthe amount of people stopping you in the grocery store\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nmust have gone up by a tenfold, right?\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nYeah, people do recognize me.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nIt's kind of...\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:49.000\nIt's so cool.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:50.000\nEvery day, it happens every day.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nIt's like, people really like the show.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nSo, yeah, every, like...\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nNow, are you...\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nAre you free stuff?\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nWere you read for that?\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nI don't...\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nWe haven't talked about this.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nWhen you read for that,\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nwas that something that you thought\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nthat they had written kind of for you,\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nor that you were just auditioning for it?\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nLike...\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nWell, I didn't know I auditioned for two parts\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nthat I didn't get.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nTJ's part, TJ Miller, Erlich's part,\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:17.000\nand Big Head, and I didn't get them.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:20.000\nAnd they just liked the names.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nThey said, you're not right for these,\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nbut we'll write something for you.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:25.000\nAnd you always hear that.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.000\nWhenever you have a good audition,\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nyou don't get it.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:28.000\nDon't worry, we'll write it for you.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nAnd it's just like...\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nWe'll see you in heaven.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nWe'll see you in heaven.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:32.000\nYeah.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:35.000\nOr they'll bring the Chinese food one episode, you know?\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nBut then they were like,\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nyeah, we're gonna write something for you,\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nand I didn't hear anything for a while.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nAnd then the final round of auditions was happening,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nand I was out of town,\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:44.000\nand I was like,\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nI gotta fly back early,\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nbut I couldn't fly back early,\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:47.000\nso I was like,\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nall right, I'm gonna miss the final round of auditions.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nAnd then I landed,\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nand I had this phone call.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nThere was all my agents,\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nand manager, and everybody,\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nand I was like, oh, this is something.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nAnd they said that you...\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:58.000\nThey wrote a part for you,\n\n45:58.000 --> 45:59.000\nand that we...\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nI'm gonna be in the show.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:02.000\nAnd it was...\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nI did one audition just with Mike,\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:05.000\nand from that,\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:06.000\nlike, I didn't have to do, like,\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nthe whole round of testing and shit.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nI did one audition with Mike Judge,\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:11.000\nand then they just wrote a thing for me.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nOh, really?\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:13.000\nYou didn't have to do that\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:14.000\nfucking horrible thing\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:15.000\nwhere people are going in.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nNo.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:17.000\nIt was HBO.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:18.000\nThat's some kind of, like,\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\ndo their own thing.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:20.000\nSo Mike was like,\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:21.000\noh, I like this guy\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:22.000\nwhen I write something for him.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:23.000\nThey were like, okay, great.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:24.000\nIf you like him, use him.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:25.000\nFucking awesome.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nIt was awesome.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:27.000\nIt was the easiest, like...\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:28.000\nIt wasn't the easiest job to get.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:29.000\nI was fucking terrified\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:30.000\ngoing into the audition,\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nbecause it's Mike Judge, and, you know...\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nIt must be Carolyn Strauss, right?\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nShe must be some kind of mad genius,\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:40.000\nbecause she's been there forever at HBO,\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:43.000\nand HBO plays this really high-risk,\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nhigh-yield game in television.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:48.000\nThey bet all that they have\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:51.000\non shows hoping that they become\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nGame of Thrones, Sopranos.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nBecause their money's made from subscription.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nThey don't give a fuck about ratings.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:01.000\nThey want people to buy the product,\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:02.000\nand they have to actually make...\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.000\nThey have to create cultural phenomena\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:06.000\nas a business.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:07.000\nThey have...\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nThe buy-in is so much bigger.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nPeople aren't just giving them\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\na half hour of their time.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nPeople are giving them, you know,\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\n20 bucks a month or whatever.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:16.000\nSo you have to create shows\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nthat become part of the function.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:19.000\nBut make people on the subway\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nstart to just get humiliated\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.000\nthat they don't know\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nwhat they're ever talking about.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nYeah, like two objective Game of Thrones.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nYou have to make people...\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nYou have to bully people into like,\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:31.000\nokay, fine, I fucking subscribe to this.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nI'm so tired of hearing about these dragons.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:36.000\nYeah, for me, the...\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nThe wire was like that.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nYeah.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:40.000\nOh, God, I mean...\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:41.000\nOh, you haven't seen the wire?\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:42.000\nI'm gonna watch it just so I don't\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\never have to hear that sentence.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:45.000\nHBO's been in that business\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nfor decades now, and successfully.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nAnd it's like, that's not...\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nAnd all the other networks, they're like,\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\noh, we'll make 20 pilots,\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:55.000\nand then we'll, you know,\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:56.000\n90 people will be bad,\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:57.000\nand then the one that's good\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nalso, one out of 10,\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:00.000\nwon't make it past six episodes,\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nand it's like this ridiculous fuck-off\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nlike frog eggs being laid,\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nknowing that they're all gonna be eaten.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:10.000\nDan, you should do like an HBO kind of thing,\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:14.000\na scripted mythological...\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nMaybe my child will.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:20.000\nPerhaps that's what I'm gearing up to.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nI would like my child to have\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:23.000\nan overall deal at HBO.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nBut that is so interesting,\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nbecause the opposite approach,\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:28.000\nlike networks, like you said,\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nfrog eggs at an HBO,\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nthey've had like $100 million\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:35.000\nin the first season of Game of Thrones.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nThey would have been out $100 million.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nIf they didn't know what they were doing,\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nthat would be a horrible mistake.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:42.000\nThey did would,\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nand they ran out of money on debut, right?\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:45.000\nThey couldn't finish the season\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nbecause it was too expensive.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:48.000\nIs that what it was?\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:49.000\nRight?\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:50.000\nI thought it was like Milch got busy,\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:51.000\nand like bored.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:54.000\nI thought that they just like ran out of dough.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nBut HBO has dough.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:57.000\nRome.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:58.000\nRome?\n\n48:58.000 --> 48:59.000\nI never saw Rome.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:00.000\nAgain there have been\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:01.000\nsome of these television questions\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nanswered by entertainment expert\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nSpencer crittenden.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nMaster of Dungeons and\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nTelevision industry gossip.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:23.000\nI love the way they talk,\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:24.000\nlike when they say on the deadline,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nwhere they're like fesop,\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nor helver.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:30.040\nOh my God, I can't read that stuff.\n\n49:30.040 --> 49:30.880\nOh yeah.\n\n49:30.880 --> 49:32.760\nIt makes me feel so tiny.\n\n49:32.760 --> 49:37.320\nBecause everything being reduced to this actual industry,\n\n49:37.320 --> 49:39.240\nit makes me nervous.\n\n49:39.240 --> 49:41.840\nWhenever I'm in a waiting room and I\n\n49:41.840 --> 49:44.760\nsee the variety on the table, I'm like, ah, fuck.\n\n49:44.760 --> 49:47.800\nAnd I kind of glance at some of the headlines and I go, ah.\n\n49:47.800 --> 49:50.720\nIt's like walking through a casino.\n\n49:50.720 --> 49:52.120\nLike all of a sudden, I don't know.\n\n49:52.120 --> 49:56.560\nI got this far by denial of the world around me.\n\n49:56.560 --> 49:58.600\nLike I just do what I do.\n\n49:58.600 --> 50:00.240\nAnd then I read these headlines and I go,\n\n50:00.240 --> 50:01.800\nI want an overall deal.\n\n50:01.800 --> 50:02.240\nYeah.\n\n50:02.240 --> 50:06.320\nI want $11 million from scribe Pen Helm\n\n50:06.320 --> 50:09.560\nLaffer, Scripter, Scrippy.\n\n50:09.560 --> 50:11.600\nI want to be one of these guys.\n\n50:11.600 --> 50:15.360\nI want a photo that doesn't look like I have yellow teeth\n\n50:15.360 --> 50:17.480\nand tiny hands.\n\n50:17.480 --> 50:20.640\nSome of those you can't control.\n\n50:20.640 --> 50:22.520\nMy hand size is always going to be like this.\n\n50:22.520 --> 50:25.520\nNo, I met the other stuff.\n\n50:25.520 --> 50:27.920\nSpencer, what do you think about the television industry?\n\n50:27.920 --> 50:31.440\nYeah, Deadwood, too expensive.\n\n50:31.440 --> 50:37.600\nNo, television industry, it exists.\n\n50:37.600 --> 50:38.680\nJesus Christ, he's high again.\n\n50:38.680 --> 50:42.960\nNo, I just think that reality shows are bad.\n\n50:42.960 --> 50:45.200\nEvery time someone watches or every time\n\n50:45.200 --> 50:47.720\nanyone mentions a reality show by name,\n\n50:47.720 --> 50:51.080\nI always go through this mental process like Jesus Christ,\n\n50:51.080 --> 50:53.280\nsomeone watches reality shows.\n\n50:53.280 --> 50:55.200\nOh yeah, they're very popular.\n\n50:55.200 --> 50:56.680\nA lot of people like those.\n\n50:56.680 --> 50:58.400\nJesus Christ, I'm talking to someone\n\n50:58.400 --> 51:00.360\nwho watches reality shows.\n\n51:00.360 --> 51:03.440\nBut you're not counting Project Runway, right?\n\n51:03.440 --> 51:04.640\nYeah, I can't.\n\n51:04.640 --> 51:06.480\nI mean, I guess.\n\n51:06.480 --> 51:09.240\nThat was different because it's actual skill merit based.\n\n51:09.240 --> 51:10.600\nThose people are trying to be good\n\n51:10.600 --> 51:12.360\nand it's usually a pretty positive show.\n\n51:12.360 --> 51:14.600\nAaron just started binge watching Project Runway\n\n51:14.600 --> 51:20.360\nand I now know I'm starting to learn about fashion, I think.\n\n51:20.360 --> 51:21.840\nTell me what you know about fashion.\n\n51:21.840 --> 51:23.960\nThis is what I know.\n\n51:23.960 --> 51:30.480\nIf your outfit can be compared to a pop cultural reference,\n\n51:30.480 --> 51:31.840\nit's bad.\n\n51:31.840 --> 51:35.200\nSo if a gay man can look at what you're wearing\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:42.080\nand reasonably compare it to Pac-Man or Strawberry Shortcake,\n\n51:42.080 --> 51:44.840\nif you can say anything while you're looking at it\n\n51:44.840 --> 51:49.240\nthat makes everyone go, ah, it's sort of like playing\n\n51:49.240 --> 51:51.760\nthe dozens fashion.\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:53.360\nThe person comes out and then it's\n\n51:53.360 --> 51:56.120\nlike the bad outfit is the one that it's\n\n51:56.120 --> 51:59.480\ntoo evocative of like, I don't know.\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:02.640\nI'm looking at this, she seems like a housewife from Tron.\n\n52:02.640 --> 52:03.640\nYeah.\n\n52:03.640 --> 52:06.160\nAnd then fucking you're eliminated, you're gone.\n\n52:06.160 --> 52:07.040\nIt's also interesting.\n\n52:07.040 --> 52:09.920\nEvery time that one guy, I don't know who the guy is.\n\n52:09.920 --> 52:11.800\nI love that Tim Gunn guy.\n\n52:11.800 --> 52:12.600\nI don't know why.\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:13.760\nTim Gunn's great.\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:16.160\nBut then there's the other guy.\n\n52:16.160 --> 52:18.560\nI'm gesturing with my hands.\n\n52:18.560 --> 52:20.520\nJust do a face.\n\n52:20.520 --> 52:23.080\nTo mime a giant head.\n\n52:23.080 --> 52:24.040\nThat's that one guy.\n\n52:24.040 --> 52:26.480\nHe's the guy that, what's his name?\n\n52:26.480 --> 52:27.040\nMichael.\n\n52:27.040 --> 52:28.560\nThat's Michael Corris.\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:33.760\nIf he can say that your outfit looks like blank,\n\n52:33.760 --> 52:34.960\nthen you're fucked.\n\n52:34.960 --> 52:36.040\nIt's interesting.\n\n52:36.040 --> 52:40.520\nDo any of his references go beyond the 80s?\n\n52:40.520 --> 52:43.480\nOh, you hear Game of Thrones sometimes.\n\n52:43.480 --> 52:45.640\nI get all of his references.\n\n52:45.640 --> 52:47.680\nI always get all of them.\n\n52:47.680 --> 52:49.160\nHe looks at the thing and goes like,\n\n52:49.160 --> 52:52.840\nMalak's like a lucky charm.\n\n52:52.840 --> 52:55.000\nCould you do his impression of me coming on stage,\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.640\ndressed like I'm dressed?\n\n52:56.640 --> 52:58.440\nI can't really do an impression of him.\n\n52:58.440 --> 53:01.840\nIt'll just sound like a homophobic stereotype.\n\n53:01.840 --> 53:03.680\nTim Gunn, I think I was doing pretty good at.\n\n53:03.680 --> 53:04.680\nI can't remember.\n\n53:04.680 --> 53:06.480\nGive me some Tim Gunn.\n\n53:06.480 --> 53:10.560\nGive Kumail the Tim Gunn treatment.\n\n53:10.560 --> 53:13.320\nWait, no, I don't want that.\n\n53:13.320 --> 53:14.440\nI just got really nervous.\n\n53:14.440 --> 53:17.440\nFive minutes, designers.\n\n53:17.440 --> 53:24.520\nI have to tell you, I'm starting to get very concerned.\n\n53:24.520 --> 53:27.640\nOK, so this is an average A line.\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:31.880\nIs she thin-waisted, your model?\n\n53:31.880 --> 53:33.320\nOh, she's high-waisted.\n\n53:33.320 --> 53:35.880\nWell, then you're going to put the shawl on.\n\n53:35.880 --> 53:36.800\nWell, that's her relief.\n\n53:36.800 --> 53:39.720\nI have to tell you, I'm very excited about this.\n\n53:39.720 --> 53:40.640\nKeep going.\n\n53:40.640 --> 53:43.840\nKeep doing what you're doing.\n\n53:43.840 --> 53:46.400\nHe is like that.\n\n53:46.400 --> 53:49.760\nIt's interesting, because Emily watches that show,\n\n53:49.760 --> 53:51.280\nand I was like, fuck this show.\n\n53:51.280 --> 53:53.160\nAnd then I watched like three episodes later.\n\n53:53.160 --> 53:55.280\nI'm like, yeah, we know you can drape, Brahmi.\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:59.080\nShow us something new.\n\n53:59.080 --> 54:02.840\nLike, I know what they're going to say before they say it.\n\n54:02.840 --> 54:06.360\nIt's also interesting how far down the list being wearable\n\n54:06.360 --> 54:07.880\nis in their criteria.\n\n54:07.880 --> 54:10.120\nLike, when they say, oh, and that's wearable.\n\n54:10.120 --> 54:11.960\nYou hear that once every three episodes.\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:16.160\nYeah, it's made out of tires, and the model's holding the hem\n\n54:16.160 --> 54:19.280\nbecause if she lets go, she'll be naked.\n\n54:19.280 --> 54:20.200\nI love what you did.\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:20.760\nIt's bold.\n\n54:20.760 --> 54:21.520\nIt's dangerous.\n\n54:21.520 --> 54:22.680\nIt's aggressive.\n\n54:22.680 --> 54:25.560\nIt's like a total random adjective.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:28.240\nIf all they could come up with is random adjectives that\n\n54:28.240 --> 54:29.960\nsound like you're describing like a car.\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:30.760\nAggressive.\n\n54:30.760 --> 54:31.760\nYeah.\n\n54:31.760 --> 54:33.120\nIt's sneaky.\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:34.080\nIt's suspicious.\n\n54:34.080 --> 54:35.600\nIt's sworthy.\n\n54:35.600 --> 54:36.720\nI love it.\n\n54:36.720 --> 54:38.720\nIt's dependable.\n\n54:38.720 --> 54:42.840\nBut if they can say, oh, boy, it looks like Popeye's\n\n54:42.840 --> 54:51.360\ngoing to the spaghetti factory, I mean, I am what I am,\n\n54:51.360 --> 54:52.800\nbut this is not what I am.\n\n54:58.920 --> 55:00.480\nI love that you guys both have girlfriends\n\n55:00.480 --> 55:01.920\nor wives watch that show.\n\n55:01.920 --> 55:03.720\nIt's a great show.\n\n55:03.720 --> 55:05.520\nI mean, watching quotes, man.\n\n55:05.520 --> 55:06.240\nI'm sitting there.\n\n55:06.240 --> 55:08.000\nI'm playing Wolfenstein on my laptop.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:09.680\nHey, Wolfenstein is pretty good, right?\n\n55:09.680 --> 55:10.400\nYeah, I'm loving it.\n\n55:10.400 --> 55:12.160\nYeah, I've been playing that, too.\n\n55:12.160 --> 55:12.960\nIt's a fun game.\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:15.640\nWhat's Wolfenstein, baby, Spencer?\n\n55:15.640 --> 55:19.480\nNo, I don't game on my laptop.\n\n55:19.480 --> 55:22.160\nBut you're aware of Wolfenstein, I so.\n\n55:22.160 --> 55:24.720\nOf course.\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:27.600\nIt's the premier Nazi shooting game.\n\n55:27.600 --> 55:28.880\nThat's exactly right.\n\n55:28.880 --> 55:30.280\nIt's an anti-Nazi game.\n\n55:30.280 --> 55:33.840\nWhat did German people feel like when they buy that game?\n\n55:33.840 --> 55:35.960\nThe German version actually is kind of different.\n\n55:35.960 --> 55:38.600\nThey have like not swastikas and stuff.\n\n55:38.600 --> 55:40.360\nIt's all like censored and stuff.\n\n55:40.360 --> 55:41.000\nAre you joking?\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.640\nOh, yeah, they hate swastikas over there now.\n\n55:43.640 --> 55:45.520\nYeah, the Nazis have these little eagle\n\n55:45.520 --> 55:47.720\ninsignias or something like that.\n\n55:47.720 --> 55:50.520\nJust because of the actual visual,\n\n55:50.520 --> 55:53.000\nlike the image of a swastika is like the N-word.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.160\nLike it's just a thing that's inflammatory.\n\n55:55.160 --> 55:55.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n55:55.920 --> 55:57.680\nIt's not like the Germans don't know\n\n55:57.680 --> 55:59.760\nthat they're watching German soldiers get\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:01.000\nknifed in the face.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:02.600\nI think they get it.\n\n56:02.600 --> 56:04.920\nAnd it's such a brutal thing.\n\n56:04.920 --> 56:07.400\nOh, yeah, they get knifed in the face.\n\n56:07.400 --> 56:08.720\nTyler's raising his hand.\n\n56:08.720 --> 56:10.640\nI don't know whether it's cultural or actually\n\n56:10.640 --> 56:12.200\nto buy a law, but there is something\n\n56:12.200 --> 56:14.520\nthat's like you aren't allowed to have like swastikas in here.\n\n56:14.520 --> 56:15.960\nYou know what it's like, I think?\n\n56:15.960 --> 56:18.840\nIt's like I smoked so much for so many years,\n\n56:18.840 --> 56:19.840\nand then I quit.\n\n56:19.840 --> 56:24.520\nAnd now that I, whenever I smell smoke, I get like queasy.\n\n56:24.520 --> 56:26.000\nI think that's how they are with swastika.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.480\nNo, I know that.\n\n56:28.480 --> 56:29.480\nYeah, I know that they smell.\n\n56:29.480 --> 56:31.920\nThey were like, we were way into it.\n\n56:31.920 --> 56:33.720\nThat was the mistake.\n\n56:33.720 --> 56:37.160\nOh, yeah, when I drink gin, if I taste gin, I'm like, ugh.\n\n56:37.160 --> 56:38.160\nYeah.\n\n56:38.160 --> 56:39.280\nGin, you're high.\n\n56:39.280 --> 56:39.920\nYeah.\n\n56:39.920 --> 56:43.040\nI had a horrible Yeager night, one night, and I can never.\n\n56:43.040 --> 56:44.360\nThat's how they are with swastika.\n\n56:44.360 --> 56:47.960\nI immediately can picture the playground where I puked my guts\n\n56:47.960 --> 56:52.440\nout, like I drank a bottle of gin because it was the only thing\n\n56:52.440 --> 56:53.080\nin the country.\n\n56:53.080 --> 56:54.160\nOn a playground?\n\n56:54.160 --> 56:58.800\nWell, it wasn't like I wasn't there as a student.\n\n56:58.800 --> 57:00.520\nIt was a playground in a park near my home.\n\n57:00.520 --> 57:01.520\nThat's way worse.\n\n57:01.520 --> 57:04.320\nYou're a grown man drinking gin, looking at children playing.\n\n57:04.320 --> 57:07.920\nI was not a grown man, and I wasn't watching children play.\n\n57:07.920 --> 57:09.840\nIt was night time.\n\n57:09.840 --> 57:10.560\nOh, way better.\n\n57:10.560 --> 57:13.160\nIt was an abandoned playground.\n\n57:13.160 --> 57:14.320\nNight time.\n\n57:14.320 --> 57:16.200\nOh, good.\n\n57:16.200 --> 57:17.040\nWhere do you want me to go?\n\n57:17.040 --> 57:18.080\nThe Russian tea room?\n\n57:18.080 --> 57:20.040\nOr am I supposed to drink gin when I'm 15?\n\n57:22.720 --> 57:27.280\nNo, I know the Germans are pulled a 180, for sure.\n\n57:27.280 --> 57:30.400\nBut I'm saying, I wonder how they feel when they,\n\n57:30.400 --> 57:35.000\nbecause we, meanwhile, we don't, it's kind of a funny thing\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:39.640\nin this world of like, hey, watch what you say.\n\n57:39.640 --> 57:41.760\nI know how you do it, and this long-standing thing\n\n57:41.760 --> 57:44.480\nthat's been accepted as a way of expressing ourselves.\n\n57:44.480 --> 57:46.720\nLike, let's take a second look at that.\n\n57:46.720 --> 57:49.920\nAnd we're definitely never going to,\n\n57:49.920 --> 57:53.960\nyou can always just have, you know, just show Nazis\n\n57:53.960 --> 57:56.720\nand then just fucking stab them in the eyes\n\n57:56.720 --> 58:00.080\nand go like, you fucking Nazi cocksucker, fucking fucker,\n\n58:00.080 --> 58:02.960\nyou fucking Nazi piece of shit.\n\n58:02.960 --> 58:05.480\nWhether it's just a guy taking a pee, like, in this game,\n\n58:05.480 --> 58:09.560\nyou're just like, you know, I mean, like, they're just soldiers\n\n58:09.560 --> 58:13.880\nwalking around, like, and there's actual references\n\n58:13.880 --> 58:17.800\nto their wives and families, like, it's like a joke\n\n58:17.800 --> 58:20.720\nhow cruel it is, like, there's, you're listening to them\n\n58:20.720 --> 58:23.000\ntalk about their, my wife is pregnant.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:24.320\nYeah, like, this is just a job for me,\n\n58:24.320 --> 58:26.320\nI haven't actually killed anybody.\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:28.560\nAnd then you fucking like, slit their throat\n\n58:28.560 --> 58:31.800\nand like, drink their blood because, you know, they're Nazis.\n\n58:31.800 --> 58:35.840\nAnd I just, I just picture like a German 16-year-old\n\n58:35.840 --> 58:38.840\nbuying the game and being like, man, I have a fucking hand.\n\n58:38.840 --> 58:40.840\nI didn't even know what any of this is about, man.\n\n58:40.840 --> 58:43.960\nI was like, yeah, I really got handed a fucking,\n\n58:43.960 --> 58:47.160\nshit, a fucking lot of karma.\n\n58:47.160 --> 58:49.560\nThere's a lot of baggage.\n\n58:49.560 --> 58:51.760\nIt must be so fucking weird to...\n\n58:51.760 --> 58:53.160\nIt's also interesting that in games\n\n58:53.160 --> 58:54.440\nwhen they want to be super violent,\n\n58:54.440 --> 58:56.200\nthey just make the bad guys Nazis\n\n58:56.200 --> 58:58.000\nbecause then you can do anything to them\n\n58:58.000 --> 58:59.640\nand everyone's kind of on board.\n\n58:59.640 --> 59:03.840\nI mean, is it, is it, is it, is it trite or inflammatory\n\n59:03.840 --> 59:07.480\nto point out that that's a very Nazi-istic way\n\n59:07.480 --> 59:12.480\nof dealing with our, our feelings about things?\n\n59:12.560 --> 59:14.880\nLike, that you pick a scapegoat and you...\n\n59:14.880 --> 59:18.000\nYeah, you make them the other and then you fucking murder them.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:21.400\nLike, British people or Russians\n\n59:21.400 --> 59:22.880\nare always our bad guys in films\n\n59:22.880 --> 59:25.920\nbecause they're, they're, they're our, the other, our foe.\n\n59:25.920 --> 59:27.800\nLike, yeah, our xenophobic bullshit.\n\n59:27.800 --> 59:32.800\nLike, Germany, like, when the Nazi party came to power,\n\n59:34.160 --> 59:35.800\nthey didn't have the majority.\n\n59:35.800 --> 59:38.120\nThey got, they got like a lot of the vote\n\n59:38.120 --> 59:41.120\nand Hitler became the chancellor.\n\n59:41.120 --> 59:42.760\nA lot of people didn't like the Nazi party.\n\n59:42.760 --> 59:44.640\nWhen they became powerful,\n\n59:44.640 --> 59:48.280\nthere was the SA and the SD and this police force\n\n59:48.280 --> 59:49.880\nthat if you didn't like them,\n\n59:49.880 --> 59:52.520\nyou were sent to a fucking concentration camp.\n\n59:52.520 --> 59:56.440\nAnd if you're intellectual, if you were smart, Jewish, gay,\n\n59:56.440 --> 59:58.560\nlike lots of other interesting things,\n\n59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.920\nyou were simply pushed away.\n\n01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.680\nMost of Germany, like most of Europe at that time,\n\n01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.000\nwere very anti-Semitic.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.560\nLike, there was lots of countries.\n\n01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.800\nOh, sure, yeah.\n\n01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.560\nLike, like Jews weren't welcome in most countries back then.\n\n01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.680\nThat's fucking terrifying, man.\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.240\nWhen you were in the history, high school history books,\n\n01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.760\nlike they always just, you know, they throw that aside.\n\n01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.280\nLike, it's always just this formula with dictatorships\n\n01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.240\nis that, is that that stage where they round up\n\n01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.720\nthe intellectuals, they round up the doctors\n\n01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.880\nand the, like everyone in this room is fucking dead.\n\n01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.840\nYeah, that's a, like if some shit goes down\n\n01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.920\nin this country, like if the economy collapses\n\n01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.600\nand then there's like this, you know,\n\n01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.960\nthis is what happens, like economic turmoil\n\n01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.560\nis the potting soil for fascism.\n\n01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.320\nBecause some guy in a uniform is gonna come out\n\n01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.240\nand he's gonna tell everybody in the mainstream\n\n01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.080\nthat they're gonna be safe as long as we make\n\n01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.920\nour new business blowing shit up.\n\n01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.760\nYeah.\n\n01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.160\nAnd that is exactly what happens over and over and over again.\n\n01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.800\nAnd then I'm gone.\n\n01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.640\nI'm in the first fucking bus out.\n\n01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.840\nFor whatever reason in my head,\n\n01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.840\nand you guys know our Jeff Fox where these,\n\n01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.560\nyou might be a retina.\n\n01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.680\nI mean, just in my head, I was like,\n\n01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.320\nyou might be a dictator, like if you're rounding up\n\n01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.200\nall the intellectuals, you might be a dictator.\n\n01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.200\nIf you think reason is a reasonable thing,\n\n01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.240\nyou might be a dictator.\n\n01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.080\nYou might be a dictator.\n\n01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.880\nAlso, they called it fascism,\n\n01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.640\nthey called it dictatorships and people were cool with that.\n\n01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.960\nLike, that was a thing.\n\n01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960\nWell, but that wasn't a bad-\n\n01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.800\nIt was an absolute back then.\n\n01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.040\nThat wasn't a bad word then.\n\n01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.760\nAlso, women, absolutely marginalized.\n\n01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760\nWomen were simply-\n\n01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.000\nStop trying to get laid.\n\n01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.960\nStop trying to make my feminism about me getting laid.\n\n01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.920\nThe misogynist code,\n\n01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.080\njeez, now you're calling yourself a

with that thought\n\n01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.720\nand seeing how long you can go with it\n\n01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.920\nuntil the women stop clapping\n\n01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.400\nbecause you would be like,\n\n01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.680\nwe live in a world where women are objects first,\n\n01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.280\nthey're animals, they're pieces of shit,\n\n01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.600\nthey're human garbage.\n\n01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.440\nNo one gives a fuck about women.\n\n01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.800\nYou see what he's doing?\n\n01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.040\nLadies, you see what he's doing, man.\n\n01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.960\nAnd you just keep going until the women are like,\n\n01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960\nthey would be like, yay, yay.\n\n01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.480\nAnd then after a while, they're like, wait, wait a minute.\n\n01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.760\nHe's thought about this too much.\n\n01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.120\nThis feels prepared.\n\n01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.280\nHow many women does it take\n\n01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.360\nto screw a lightbulb for God's sake?\n\n01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.200\nYou were doing exactly what I was talking about.\n\n01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.400\nAs a feminist, I wonder why it's three instead of one.\n\n01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.400\nThat's not even a thing people say, Dan.\n\n01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.520\nYou're just naturally being misogynist right now.\n\n01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.920\nIt's a natural thing.\n\n01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.280\nAs with alcoholism and racism,\n\n01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.640\nI will agree first so that people stop accusing me.\n\n01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.640\nI know, conversations about whether you're an ism,\n\n01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.720\nthe big secret is fucking say yes, I am.\n\n01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.760\nAnd then it's done.\n\n01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.040\nBecause then what are they gonna do?\n\n01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.920\nHelp you?\n\n01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.520\nThey're not putting in that elbow grease.\n\n01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.320\nYou're racist, you're racist.\n\n01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.720\nOkay, I'm racist.\n\n01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.840\nWhat are we gonna do about this?\n\n01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.160\nYou're racist.\n\n01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.600\nAnd I am going over there for a drink\n\n01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.680\nto tell other people that you're racist.\n\n01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.960\nThat's the approach like Jennifer Lawrence, who's awesome,\n\n01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.600\nwho was in like a ton of stuff coming out.\n\n01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.160\nAnd before she was like,\n\n01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.560\nthere's gonna be a backlash soon\n\n01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.920\nand it's just gonna be fine.\n\n01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920\nAnd then because she said that,\n\n01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.280\npeople were like, well, now we can't do the backlash\n\n01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.000\nbecause you told us that's what we were gonna do.\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.040\nIt's the best thing to do.\n\n01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.920\nYou think what I'm like with like, yep, you're right.\n\n01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.080\nLet's bring up race and gender expert, Demorge Brown.\n\n01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:26.920\nYeah.\n\n01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.760\nYeah.\n\n01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.600\nYeah.\n\n01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.440\nYeah.\n\n01:05:29.440 -->

expert.\n\n01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.560\nDemorge.\n\n01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.600\nHello, this is surprising.\n\n01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.920\nWhen did you get that arsenal shirt, sweater,\n\n01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.120\nwhatever you, what is it?\n\n01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.960\nThis is from two years ago.\n\n01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.800\nWhere did they come in?\n\n01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.640\nFourth?\n\n01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.480\nThis year, fourth.\n\n01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.800\nFourth place.\n\n01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.000\nThey won the cup last week, but they did.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nJeff and Demorge had to talk about soccer.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.680\nHow did they win the cup last week\n\n01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.880\nand then this week, they're fourth?\n\n01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.000\nThe league, they were fourth.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.080\nThe cup is a separate tournament.\n\n01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.640\nWhere all the teams in England play each other\n\n01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.280\nover the course of the season.\n\n01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.200\nThe FA Cup?\n\n01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.040\nFA Cup, yeah.\n\n01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.720\nAnd you can't use your hands?\n\n01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.320\nDemorge, tell them why.\n\n01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.360\nSo what is this?\n\n01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.840\nThis is like the teleports or anything.\n\n01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840\nWhat are they doing?\n\n01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840\nAre there bats?\n\n01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.520\nWait, what?\n\n01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.000\nWhat do you say?\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.360\nIt's not cricket.\n\n01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.200\nI do like cricket.\n\n01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.240\nDo you watch the Madrid, the Champions League?\n\n01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.240\nI watched that yesterday on the patio of La Cita\n\n01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.560\nwith, there was no English being spoken.\n\n01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.280\nThere was a lot of Asada being grilled.\n\n01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.120\nPeople were screaming.\n\n01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.120\nThey were up and down.\n\n01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.320\nAnd when Madrid won in overtime, I think I was lifted over\n\n01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.000\nlike five people's heads.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.600\nYou were?\n\n01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.160\nI was hot like a beach ball, yeah.\n\n01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.200\nThey were that happy.\n\n01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.320\nBut why you?\n\n01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.400\nBecause I was there.\n\n01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.600\nI didn't lift anybody, but everybody got lifted at a certain\n\n01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.440\npoint.\n\n01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.720\nJesus, that's terrifying.\n\n01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.760\nI'm going to a Dodgers game next week.\n\n01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.000\nThe Kettle One Alliance invited me.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:02.840\nDid they really?\n\n01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.280\nAnd they sent me a new backpack.\n\n01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.200\nOh, it's in the trunk of my car.\n\n01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.600\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600\nI have it in the trunk of my car.\n\n01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.480\nAnd I registered the tracking chip.\n\n01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.720\nSo I know it's in the trunk of your car.\n\n01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.120\nMy car is being followed right now?\n\n01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.200\nBy the Kettle One Alliance.\n\n01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.080\nOh, god damn it.\n\n01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.080\nThey're not good drivers.\n\n01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.680\nI want it out of my car immediately.\n\n01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.480\nDoes Burnett have an alliance?\n\n01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.760\nIf Burnett did have an alliance, I would be the fucking\n\n01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.200\nambassador for it.\n\n01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.120\nAll right, who brought this?\n\n01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.480\nOr Rafael?\n\n01:07:37.480 -->

haven't cut it yet.\n\n01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360\nThat's why I'm keeping the Cornell West hair.\n\n01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.080\nDude, so now people just have you do the Cornell

01:08:49.960\nIt's just a character, it's not a discussion.\n\n01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.600\nYeah, it's like, I kind of write out bullet points.\n\n01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.880\nAnd then it's more physical than it is memorized speech.\n\n01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.440\nKind of just jump out and wave my arms around widely.\n\n01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.440\nI can't ask you to do Cornell West.\n\n01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.360\nI can do Barak as a voice, but I can't do it.\n\n01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360\nYou can do Barak?\n\n01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.600\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.320\nBarak Hussain?\n\n01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880\nEasy.\n\n01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880\nEasy.\n\n01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.640\nWhat?\n\n01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.480\nThat's his name.\n\n01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480\nCamille?\n\n01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:27.000\nIf, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if I may be so bold as\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.160\nto call you Camille, you're a great citizen.\n\n01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:39.040\nAnd, and, and what, what I want to get to is something\n\n01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.280\nemblematic in, in, in, in young people and good folks all\n\n01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.440\nacross this country.\n\n01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.160\nSomething emblematic in good people and good folks.\n\n01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.640\nThat was so good, I almost teared up.\n\n01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.040\nThat's the episode title right now.\n\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.280\nSomething emblematic.\n\n01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.320\nIt reminded me of why I voted for him, because I was so\n\n01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.440\nrelieved that a president, I could understand every sentence\n\n01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.400\nhe was saying.\n\n01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.440\nHe could, you, like, like Bush couldn't summon the word\n\n01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.600\nemblematic.\n\n01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.320\nAll politicians are parasitic pieces of shit.\n\n01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.920\nAnd Obama speaks and says nothing.\n\n01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.560\nBut, but God, he can speak.\n\n01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.040\nIt's such a fucking relief.\n\n01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.120\nYeah, he has a command of the English language, which is\n\n01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.560\nmagical.\n\n01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560\nSo gorgeous.\n\n01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.920\nFolksy sometimes, too, though, when he talks to people and\n\n01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.960\ntalks about anecdotes and things.\n\n01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.600\nSo he can downplay it, just like Bush used to go places and\n\n01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.440\nall of a sudden have a twang in his voice that he didn't\n\n01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.880\nhave the day before.\n\n01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.960\nYeah, Spencer, what do you think about race,\n\n01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.040\npolitics, Obama, or gender and the TV industry?\n\n01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.960\nI'm pro all those things.\n\n01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.160\nWell, why don't we, what a bold stance.\n\n01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.240\nYeah, I'm a hero.\n\n01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.520\nSpencer, can we include DeMorge into, like, an NPC\n\n01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.200\ncharacter?\n\n01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.600\nWell, I thought if you could play Aaron's character.\n\n01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.280\nOh.\n\n01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.760\nYeah, I mean, sweet.\n\n01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.120\nWait, so we have my eye on the road ahead.\n\n01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.560\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.480\nWe rail against gender inequality, then we get a dude to\n\n01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.840\nplay a woman.\n\n01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.760\nBut he's a black piece.\n\n01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.600\nHe's black.\n\n01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.280\nThat's right.\n\n01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.280\nThat's right.\n\n01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.760\nHe's black.\n\n01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.080\nTristar Pictures presents.\n\n01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.560\nHe's black.\n\n01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.280\nWeekend at DeMorge is two.\n\n01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.840\nYeah, I'm calling him black.\n\n01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.920\nSomebody called me one time.\n\n01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.400\nThey're like, you're not going to believe this.\n\n01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.440\nWe were all laughing like crazy last night.\n\n01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.000\nWe were hanging around, Dan, and he just kept saying, black\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.360\npeople.\n\n01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.880\nWait, I have no reason.\n\n01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.600\nLast night?\n\n01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.560\nNo, no, this is a while ago.\n\n01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.880\nOh, OK.\n\n01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.720\nBlack people.\n\n01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.960\nI love the phrase black people.\n\n01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.600\nI think it's so funny.\n\n01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.760\nBecause it's so weird.\n\n01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.680\nLike, it's so ticklish.\n\n01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.760\nIt's not inherently offensive.\n\n01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.000\nBut it sounds so fucking weird.\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.880\nIt's just such a weird thing to say.\n\n01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.720\nIt's so juvenile.\n\n01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.360\nIt's like you're like action figures.\n\n01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.400\nLike, where are my black people?\n\n01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.040\nLike, I don't know.\n\n01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.480\nIt's just something so weird about it.\n\n01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.680\nLeg, leg, leg.\n\n01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.560\nBlack people.\n\n01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.320\nWrapping strong.\n\n01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.960\nWrapping all day long.\n\n01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.840\nIt's racist to connotate black with rap.\n\n01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.720\nNot going to do it.\n\n01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.320\nSit in my lyrical lap.\n\n01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.680\nI'm Dan Harmon wrapping up a storm.\n\n01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.280\nFuck your mama like Cheers was Norm.\n\n01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.600\nFuck your mama.\n\n01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.960\nFuck Osama.\n\n01:12:35.960 -->

thing.\n\n01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.360\nWe're going to pull up a ring.\n\n01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.800\nI bought a ring for my wife, Michelle.\n\n01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.600\nI bought a dog.\n\n01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.720\nAnd I tried to sell him.\n\n01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.040\nBut we wanted another dog.\n\n01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.800\nSo we brought him out onto the lawn.\n\n01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.160\nWe got the exact same one.\n\n01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.080\nWe actually cloned it.\n\n01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.720\nIt's a full experiment.\n\n01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.440\nYou know, folks, you have to understand.\n\n01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.360\nIf we don't advance the science as further,\n\n01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.520\nI'm proposing internships for students all across this nation.\n\n01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.880\nIf you want to volunteer, if you want to go to Namibia,\n\n01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.920\nif you want to go to Ghana, if you\n\n01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.320\nwant to go to Lisbon or Lisboa, is to call it there.\n\n01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.520\nLanguages are important.\n\n01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.040\nYou have to speak forward and backward.\n\n01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.960\nYou have to want to believe.\n\n01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.040\nBecause this moment, this shining moment, in this time,\n\n01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.360\nin this hour, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.120\nThat was Obama rapping in the middle of my rap.\n\n01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:28.920\nThat was the best.\n\n01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.400\nBlack people.\n\n01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.360\nBlack people.\n\n01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360\nBlack people.\n\n01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.240\nYeah!\n\n01:13:36.240 -->

myself.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.480\nHe's black!\n\n01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.240\nI remember we used to freestyle at parties,\n\n01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.360\nand I would fucking, I was very liberal with my use\n\n01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.200\nof the n-word.\n\n01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.640\nAnd I can't stop it.\n\n01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.440\nD-Morgen always walked by right when you said it.\n\n01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.520\nAnd I was saying it a lot.\n\n01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.320\nI was casting a white net.\n\n01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.840\nBut then D-Morgen walked by on the red solo cup,\n\n01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.120\nand it was just, it wasn't like.\n\n01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120\nWhy did it have to be a red solo?\n\n01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.480\nIt wasn't like you were, it was just,\n\n01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.320\nI just always felt so fucking bad,\n\n01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.440\nbecause it would be like, ah man,\n\n01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.160\nhe's

kid, do you know\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nwhat Felatio is?\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nHow old is this kid?\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nThe kid flips up the Mask, and he's like six.\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nAnd he says,\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nno, no, no, I don't,\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nflips the Mask down.\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nAnd then the driver says, hey kid,\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000\ndo you know what\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nasotomy is?\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nAnd the kid flips the Mask up,\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nand says,\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nand the driver says, hey kid,\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000\ndo you know what a pedophile is?\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nAnd the kid flips up the Mask,\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nexasperated, and says, look, I've got to be honest with you, sir,\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nI'm not a real welder.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nEh? Eh?\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nPretty good.\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nHe has to keep flipping the Mask up and down, right?\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nIsn't that a thing?\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nNo, I like that.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nIt has to work in threes.\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nYou made it work in fours.\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nSo what happens with this kid at the end?\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nI'm worried, because that kid is still with the pedophile.\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nThe kid wins.\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nI like it just work.\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nThe kid wins, this guy's like, oh, this kid.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nOh, you're not a real welder.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nAnd then he drops him off.\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nIs that how it ends? He just wants to fuck kid welders?\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nHe says, mister, I've got to be honest with you,\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nI'm not really a welder.\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nThe end, the guy goes, okay.\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nFor the kid?\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nNo, yeah, for everybody.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nNot for everybody.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nThe kid wins.\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nThat is the kid wins.\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nYeah, how does the kid win?\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nThe kid wins by being guileless.\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nThe kid gets a chuckle in before he's taken back\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nto a basement later.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nI like the thing, the guy goes, oh, but I'll tell you why.\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nI've been outsmarted.\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nI'll drop you off here.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nI've been outsmarted.\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nHe's not outsmarted.\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nHe's been out-domed.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nYeah, same thing.\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nSo the guy's not turned on by the kid anymore?\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nNo, because he wanted to fuck a welder.\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nHe wanted a welder?\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nHe doesn't like kids.\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nHe wanted to fuck a welder.\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nAnd the kid says, sir, you're off the hook.\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nI'm not a welder.\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nSo it turns out the guy really was on the prowl for a child welder.\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nHe wanted to fuck a young welder.\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nI like to think that it was just any welder,\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nand it was kind of hurting him that it was a kid,\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nbecause he knows it's wrong.\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nThe kid didn't know what Felicia inside of me was.\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nOh, I'm going to have to peach this kid.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nI'm confused about the part where he asks him\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nwho knows what a pedophile is.\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nWhy is he asking any answer to that question\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nthat's going to benefit the guy?\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nHe's saying, let's put our cars in the table.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nSo do you think he was hoping the kid would say,\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nI do know what one is, and I'm into it?\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nNot only do I know what a pedophile is,\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nI'm all for it.\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nAnd he goes, good.\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nBut what kind of kid that's into pedophiles doesn't know what Felicia is?\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nA welder.\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nAlright, alright, come on now.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nSorry Spencer.\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nNo, I'm having a great time.\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nI just think the joke's a real bummer.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nYou leave the world, you pull,\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nyour camera pulls out of that truck, pickup truck van.\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nWhy is the truck is a cart?\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nI always pictured it as an orange pickup truck.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nThat makes you rapey.\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nWith propane tanks in the bag.\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nWhy?\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nBecause he's got a day job.\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nHe's going to get his propane tanks refilled,\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nand a successful pedophile doesn't put all his eggs in Pedophilia's basket.\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nIt's not a job.\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nHe's going to make it a side mission,\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nlike in Grand Theft Auto.\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nIt's like a bonus mission.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nHe's got an A story going on.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nHe's got a whole, he's getting married in June.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nI don't know, I think if you're a pedophile, that is your A story.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nWell, I mean, it'll all be revealed in my new movie, Daedalus.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nDaedalus?\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nDaedalus.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nYou flew too close to the sun?\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nI'm a guy.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nOh my god.\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nOh wow, Jesus Christ.\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nTo the sun of a guy.\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nDaedalus.\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nDoes this joke going to make sense to people outside this room?\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nI don't think anybody likes it, but Daedalus,\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nabout a pedophile who flew too close to the sun of a guy.\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nToo close to his neighbor's son.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nAll right, so Spencer.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nWe just became the writing staff for Hustler Magazine.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nWe can write a Hustler cartoon now.\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nSpencer, I asked Flisdame, is Flisdame the guy we're talking to right now?\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nNo, you're talking to Yomiji, the guardian of paradise.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nOh shit, Yomiji.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nYomiji?\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nWhat?\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nYomiji?\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nWhat up?\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nWe seek the pterogon of virtue.\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nYou got some?\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nOh yeah, man.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nWe got all sorts of shit, man.\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nWe got bacon bush, we got liquor vines, dragon whisper, utopia fruit,\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000\npotion potatoes, miracle clover.\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nCan I go back to bacon bush?\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nYeah, bacon bush.\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nYeah, man.\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nBecause there could be a couple different kinds of bush.\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nWe must have met before in like the last episode or something,\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nbut I've never met you, Christopher.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nWhat's up, dude?\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nWhat's up, dude?\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nHey, Chris.\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nWhat's your deal?\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nYou look fucked up.\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nHe wrote Lady and Red.\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nOh, also he's...\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nOh yeah, he's cursed.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nOh, he's cursed.\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nI've been cursed for a while.\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nYou look all evil.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nYeah, he keeps trying to kill us and barf on people.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nThat's why we need the pterogon.\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nHow do we fix this?\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nIt was a good joke.\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nYeah, well the pterogon of virtue, I assume.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nI'm not much into cooking.\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nI'm gonna be honest.\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nBut I love bacon.\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nBacon bush?\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nBacon bushin'.\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nBacon bushin'.\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nWhat is it?\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nWhat is what?\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nWhat is bacon bush?\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nIt's bacon on a bush.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nIt grows?\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nIs the whole bush...\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nBacon grows out of the bush?\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nYeah, baby, check it out.\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nHe reaches into a bush and pulls out cooked bacon.\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nWhoa!\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nMagic motherfuckers!\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nBut this is pig meat.\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nIt's meat from a pig, and it grows out of a bush?\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nMagic motherfuckers!\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nDid a pig die to make this?\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nNo.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nWell, probably for the wizard who invented bacon bush,\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nthat probably killed a lot of pigs, I'd imagine.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nBut now, that's passed.\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nIs there an eggplant?\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nMmm, like a tree?\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nI think there might be.\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nJust like a breakfast tree?\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nThere's a breakfast cocktail tree.\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nYeah, it's spliced together.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nBut do you have pterogon of virtue?\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nYeah, yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nIt's the leafy one, right?\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nYou have it.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nWe got it.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nYou totally have it.\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nCan we have it?\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nIt looks like, though.\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nWe came all the way to the fucking Isle of Paradise.\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nCool, your role.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nLittle gnome one.\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nHonestly, if I had a bunch of stuff and one of the things was bacon bush,\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nI'm not going to look at anything.\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nYou're cursed, Christopher.\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nYou don't fucking know what you're talking about.\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nWhat's your name again?\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nYomiji.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nYomiji, we came up to the fucking Isle of Paradise\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nbecause we wanted the pterogon of virtue.\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nWord.\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nDo you have it or not?\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nParadise has it, man.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nI just guard this ship.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nDo you know anybody who has it?\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nI just work here, man.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nHow do we get it?\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nIt's on the Isle.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nThis is all around you.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nYou said you just work here.\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nThat's exactly the guy we were talking to.\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nWe get stuff.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nThat's a good point.\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nCan't argue that logic.\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nYou work here?\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nI don't sell the stuff.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nI just guard it, man.\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nCan we talk to your manager?\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nThere is no manager.\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nThere's no bureaucracy.\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nIt's paradise.\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nIt's got to be guarded.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nI guard it.\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nWell, I'm going to walk in a random direction, Mr. Yomiji.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nGood call.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nYeah, let's go around looking for the pterogon.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nI pick up a blade of egg grass,\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nand I let it point in a direction.\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nI demarcate one of the ends as the pointing end,\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nand then I let it fall, and then I follow the direction that it points.\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nIt points towards Charles Hoffman,\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nwho stands cradling and exploded in gnome.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nWell, let's spin again.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nWho's Charles Hoffman?\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nSuch senseless death.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nI go over to Charles Hoffman.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nI'm assuming the game version of me isn't an alcoholic\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nand can remember who he is?\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nProbably.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nHe's the leader of the seekers of paradise.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nIs he the guy whose bathroom I shit in?\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nWhat happens?\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nCharles, we're here.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nI'm sorry for your loss.\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nThat's...\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nOne step forward, dot, dot, dot, as Springsteen said.\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nWe could have never guessed that that would happen\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nwhen you pressed that red button.\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nYou know, we dabbled in God's domain,\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nand we got a warning shot across our bow,\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nbut the important thing is to move on\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nand get this tarragon of virtue.\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nWhat do you say?\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nThat sounds good.\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nYou think you know where it might be around here?\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nHave you ever been around here?\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nNo, I haven't.\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nI just keep walking past him.\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nI just keep walking in that direction.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nYeah, we follow you.\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nSee you later, man.\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nSorry.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nYou walk away as he's talking.\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nAnd you just go.\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nWhere do you go?\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nI'm just walking in that direction.\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nI'm marching.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nYou come up to a tree.\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nIt looks like a massive tree.\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nIt's just an apple tree.\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nI shoot laser beams at the back of Quark's head.\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nWhy?\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nBecause I'm evil.\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nYeah, he's a curse.\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nHe's a curse.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nOh, sorry about that.\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nDid that hurt?\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nDon't I have a mobility or a trap sense?\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nLaser beams aren't a trap.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nYou take nine damage.\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nSorry.\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nSorry about what?\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nWhy are we helping this guy?\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nHe's an asshole.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nNo, I'm a nice guy.\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nI'm just cursed.\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nI got nine damage, you piece of shit.\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nI puked on him.\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nI used my numb.\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nThat doesn't do any damage.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nIt's just true.\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nWe could just kill him and then like this.\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nNo.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nYeah, because it would save us a lot of trouble.\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nListen, we're here.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nWhy do you fucking shot me with this?\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000\nI know.\n\n01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nAnd I feel horrible.\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nWell, not, yeah.\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nYeah, hindsight.\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000\n20, 20.\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nI feel horrible.\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nI do a, I don't know.\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nI'm a gnome.\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nI look around there.\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nI just sniff out where I think that the pteragon of virtue might be.\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nI sniff out the smell of pteragon.\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nYou sniff with your gnome-ish nose.\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nAnd you sniff out a strange scent.\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nBut it, uh, it smells rather bad to be honest.\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nIt's a foul odor.\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nIt kind of overtakes everything.\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nSorry.\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nIt smells, it smells like a plant, but not good.\n\n01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nNot like pteragon?\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nNot like pteragon.\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nPteragon smells bad.\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nI wouldn't say not normal pteragon.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nI think that smells just fine.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.000\nDoes anybody have knowledge of nature, anything like that, and their skill?\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000\nDeMorge you.\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nI'm a half-elf.\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nDoes Mulrainee have-\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nMulrainee does.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nShe's a ranger.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nMulrainee.\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nLook under your skills on the front page where your name's on it.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nSee if knowledge, parenthesis-\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nKnowledge of nature.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nKnowledge of nature.\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nHe's got it.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nOh, I have knowledge of nature.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nNine.\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nIt's all coming back to me now.\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nWell, now we're off to the races.\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nI have knowledge of nature, and I'm looking around this wooded glade, and I say pteragon\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nwould grow where the natural loam is.\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nSo what you smell if that is loam at the edge of that loam, I think there might be pteragon\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nand other herbs.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nNice.\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nAnd we should proceed another-\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nIf this works out, I'm going to be stoked.\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nDon't shoot me.\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nNo.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nIt's not my call.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nI'll stay behind you.\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nIt might happen, but it won't be behind you at all.\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nI'm not saying it's going to happen, but if it does, it won't be my fault.\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nAre you cool with that?\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nHe's cursed.\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nI have a whisper bow.\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nNo, don't attack me.\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nI'm just saying.\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nYou attacked me.\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nI feel horrible about it.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nSee?\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nI don't think you do.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nYou seem pretty cool.\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nNo, I'm like really bummed about it.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nOh, that was a horrible thing.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nAnyway, let's go.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nWe're marching.\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nLet's go to the loam.\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nI'm going to get you, Christopher.\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nI'm going to get you.\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nSo you look to the edge of the loam and there you see a small row of five to seven tender,\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nnarrow shoots, scabbing up out of the loam edge.\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nShoot.\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nShoot.\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nShoot.\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nShoot.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nShoot.\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nAll right.\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nI charge headlong towards the shoots.\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nYou do that.\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nYou arrive there.\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nI sniff the shoots.\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nThey smell, they smell just fine.\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nLike Tarragon, a virtue.\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nI take out one of my knives and I harvest them.\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nYou harvest the shoots.\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nAnd I feed them to Christopher and I shove them down his throat.\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nWell, okay.\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nIs this a good idea?\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nHold on.\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nLet's talk about this for one second.\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nYou're in no place to fucking negotiate right now.\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nDo you think it's a good idea to do we prepare them maybe?\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nIs it like you have to cook them or do you just eat them?\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nYou can dry them at that takes time.\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nYou can grind them to a powder, but then they lose their natural oils.\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nThey're better raw.\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nThe stronger the oils, the rarer they are.\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nAll right.\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nI eat them and then I shoot laser beam eyes at Quark.\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nIt didn't work.\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nRight.\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nHe has to roll first.\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nWe'll find out.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nOh.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nYeah, you missed those laser beam eyes.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nOh, is he okay?\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:02.000\nHe eats them and he starts vomiting violently and violently and violently.\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nYou double over in the fetal position on your floor and in the pool of your vomit, there\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nstarts to be a darkness, a blackness, an eerie corruption, a corruptive presence that hangs.\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nIt floats up in the air and hangs in the air like a ghostly spirit with a crazy face.\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nAnd it's all like, I don't remember eating that.\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nI take my mighty greatsword and attack the smoky presence.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nAttacking the smoky presence with your mighty greatsword.\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nYou seem to cleave into the flesh of this ghost and you do.\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nYou do.\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nI do.\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nLet's see how much damage.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nWhat's the damage on that?\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nSorry, everybody.\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nIt's...\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000\nYeah, you've really been fucking up to me.\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nIt's 11 plus 6 times 2.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000\n34.\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000\n34.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nDamage.\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nDamage.\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000\n2d8 plus 7.\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000\n2d8.\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nJesus.\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nIs that good?\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nPlus 7.\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nI mean, I'd say it's good.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nYou strike the ghost dealing 18 damage.\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nCausing him to emit a keening whale that hurts your ears and your souls.\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nWell, maybe it does.\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000\nLet's see.\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nIt hurts Quark's soul.\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000\nIt does?\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nIt hurts Mulrainee's soul.\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nIt doesn't hurt Christopher's soul.\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000\nWe've got an understanding.\n\n01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nAnd it doesn't hurt Sharpie's soul.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nHigh five.\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nBut Quark takes 5 damage and Mulrainee takes 1.\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nOh, did it hurt your guys' soul?\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nSorry.\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nI feel horrible about it.\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nYou're not cursed anymore.\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nThat's just a scratcher.\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nHe's not?\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nThis is my new vibe.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nWrite a new song.\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000\nOkay.\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nI will.\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nWrite a new hit.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nOkay.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nI got 14 damage.\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nYou write a new fucking hit.\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000\nChristopher, Lady and Red was a long time ago.\n\n01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nBut it's still around.\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nNo, in a way, it happened right now.\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nSing the bridge.\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nLady and Red is dancing with me cheek to cheek.\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000\nThe bridge.\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nI don't know what that means.\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nI just fucking sing, man.\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nI don't know your term.\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nHe doesn't know the fucking song.\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000\nIt's going to be even harder.\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nLittle known fact about Christopher, he was Nick Drake's schoolmate and taught him how\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nto play the blues in college.\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nIs that right?\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nOxford, I believe.\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000\nFor real?\n\n01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nYeah.\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nHe was an older guy.\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nNick Drake looked up to him.\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nHe was playing the blues then, only the blues.\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nMulraine.\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nYou're very different.\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nAnd he sold out.\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nShit.\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nI didn't sell out.\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nHave you heard Lady and Red?\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nGreat song.\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nGuys, attack this ghost emanation and let's finish this thing.\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nShocking grasp.\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nYou grasp into it, shockingly.\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nOr so it would seem, because your hands just sink through.\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nIt's ghostly flash and your crackling fingers do not discharge into it.\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nCan I use my whisper bow?\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nOh yeah.\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nAnd if I whisper in Elvish, will I create extra damage?\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nYeah, you definitely will.\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nYou never played before?\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nYou're better than all of us.\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000\nWe've never whispered into that bow.\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nErin just keeps making things.\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nShe thinks it's Minecraft.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nWeirding way, the fire is wielding, weirding way, and fearing for us.\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000\nI'm in heaven.\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000\nBlowing runes, light up on the bow's surface as you whisper in Elvish, and then you quickly\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000\nknock and loose four arrows in rapid succession, three of which sink into the, you know, I\n\n01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nwas going to call it a gnome, but it's more of a ghost, skin flesh.\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nSkin flesh.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nOrlando Bloom.\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nOne of them just kind of goes through it like an arrow through ghost.\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000\nBut the other two sink into its ghostly flesh and cause it to bleed ectoplasm, taking 12\n\n01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000\ndamage.\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000\nDamn.\n\n01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nBlack people.\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nBlack people.\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000\nThat's the title of my new song.\n\n01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nI just do colors.\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nLady in red, black people.\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nBlack people.\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000\nGive them a hand.\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nGive them a hand.\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nI take my...\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nIt's a call to action.\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nOkay.\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nGive them a hand.\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000\nGreat.\n\n01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nI take my poison dagger and...\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000\nTake that poison dagger and put it in my mouth.\n\n01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nHey, that would be a great song.\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nCan I have that?\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000\nNo, that's ABC.\n\n01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nFuck.\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nSo I take my poison dagger and I walk up to the thing and I go, never again!\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nAnd I stab it.\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nBecause he was inside me for so long.\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nI'm not a welder and then I stab him.\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.000\nStabbing him with your words at the same time, your knife plunges in and poison courses\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000\nthrough its blade into his ghostly form and he takes six damage.\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nAnd also is poisoned.\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nOh, he's poisoned.\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nNo, he wasn't flanked.\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000\nGhosts can't be flanked.\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nMaybe they can, I don't know.\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nLet's debate it.\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nWho's...\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000\nWho's turn is it?\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nIf you flanked a ghost, call into Harmontown.\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000\n1-800-366-HARMON.\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nIt's probably too many numbers.\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nThey do that sometimes where it's too long but it just starts dying.\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nBut if you're an idiot, you keep pressing the numbers.\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000\nIt used to be like that.\n\n01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000\n3-666-HARMON.\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nIt's the ghost's turn.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nIt screams and squeals again and then it kind of starts to shimmer and vibrate.\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nIts form becomes more immaterial and hazy as it does.\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nAnd then it shoots, it shoots directly towards Charles Hoffman.\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000\nI think I'm taking a break.\n\n01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000\nDodge that bullet.\n\n01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nIt enters his body and he goes...\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nOh no, oh shit.\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nAnd then his arms start moving about and he's like...\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nThis is cool.\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000\nAnd then he goes...\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:09.000\nAnd he casts black magic and black tentacles of Evard\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nsprout forth from the ground and try to grab at your legs.\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nThat one does.\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nThat one doesn't.\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nThat one doesn't.\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nOkay, so Quark is grappled by these tentacles.\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nThe rest of you men should stop.\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nI can't get a fucking break.\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nI can't either.\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nMissing all of my tentacles.\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nWhat we have to do is we have to feed Tarragon to this new guy now.\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000\nAre you saying so?\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nYeah, because that's how the thing comes out, right?\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000\nAlright, then do it.\n\n01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nOkay, well it's not my turn though.\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nNo, I pass.\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nReally?\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nYeah.\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nOkay.\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000\nIs there more Tarragon or do we feed it all to...\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nYou look more around with your half-elf eyes\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nand your knowledge of what Tarragon looks like\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nand you see maybe about 15 feet off there's some in the shade of a bacon bush.\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000\nOh right there.\n\n01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nNow I have to make one stop.\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nTarragon grows in the shade of a bacon bush.\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nSo then I rush toward the bush,\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nfending off this guy who wants the bacon,\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nand I rip up the Tarragon.\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000\nWhat's there in clumps?\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000\nYou grab several clumps.\n\n01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nI rush back to the tentacles.\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nFeed it to...\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nshove it down like this.\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nTo Charles Huffin.\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nOf this thing attacking me.\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000\nCharles Huffin and I make him eat it.\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nYou try to make him eat it.\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000\nHe's wrestling you, but you get him in a headlock\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nand you just stuff a clump of Tarragon in his mouth.\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000\nThat's right.\n\n01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nEat it.\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000\nEat it.\n\n01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000\nEat it.\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nEat it.\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000\nAnd he also goes into a fetal vomiting position\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nand vomits the ghost up again\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nand the ghost starts screaming and making all sorts of arachis.\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000\nAttack this ghost again.\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000\nAlright, everybody...\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nAttack this ghost.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nWell, also everybody grab a bunch of Tarragon.\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nI just have it in bushels around.\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nYeah, just fill your pockets with Tarragon.\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nDid you bring any extra?\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nDid he have any extra?\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nHe got several clumps worth.\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000\nAlright, I take one of the clumps.\n\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nI have a clump.\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nI'm bummed that my shocking grasp didn't work.\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nBut I'm not going to let it get to me.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nYour hands are still electric-y.\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nUse them.\n\n01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nWell...\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nBut it doesn't work on him.\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nYeah, it doesn't work.\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nCan I ask you about Bull's Strength?\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000\nIs that a beer?\n\n01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nYeah, it's a heffa-vison.\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000\nWhat is Bull's Strength?\n\n01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nThey love heffa-vison.\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000\nWas that a joke on heffa-ball?\n\n01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000\nOh, I guess it was.\n\n01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nYou didn't know, and you said that?\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000\nIt was the most comedic beer thing I could think of.\n\n01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000\nBut it also worked as a pun.\n\n01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000\nThat's the way you get for not going for a walker.\n\n01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000\nWhat is Bull's Strength?\n\n01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000\nIt gives one-touched target 1d4 plus one strength.\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nOh, don't give it to that guy.\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000\nI think, I mean, what we're doing is working.\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nI'm just going to...\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nAttack this ghost?\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nYeah, I'm going to...\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nIsn't it poisoned also?\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000\nOh, it's ghost poisoned.\n\n01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000\nI take my short bow,\n\n01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000\nand I tie the poison dagger to the tip of it.\n\n01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000\nAnd I whisper the same stuff that he whispered into his thing.\n\n01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000\nI'm like, I don't know if that's going to work.\n\n01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nBut...\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000\nHere it comes.\n\n01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000\nI say that too.\n\n01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000\nYou said you tied it to your bow, or an arrow.\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nYou know what I meant.\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nI mean, it's an important distinction.\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000\nOkay, you know what?\n\n01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nI call out to Yomichi to kill the ghost.\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000\nI'm on break.\n\n01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nOh.\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nI tie it to the arrow.\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000\nThat must be steak bills.\n\n01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000\nI'm knee deep in utopia fruits.\n\n01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nWhat?\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nI tie it to the arrow.\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nOkay.\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000\nAnd I aim up above it.\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nBut since I'm a master arrowsman, I know...\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nYou tie it to the arrow?\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nThe poison dagger.\n\n01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000\nYou tie the dagger to an arrow.\n\n01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nTie the poison dagger to my heart.\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000\nCan I have that?\n\n01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nOh, still.\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000\nWhat is the...\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000\nWhat is going to happen?\n\n01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nThe arrow is going to go into him,\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nand the dagger is going to...\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nhurt him.\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000\nHe can't...\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nOh, and I put tarragon on it too.\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000\nOn the arrow.\n\n01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nSomeone yelled this out.\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nSo I'm going right to the source with...\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nSo I got an arrow.\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nI got the poison dagger on the arrow.\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nI got tarragon on the...\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nIt's like the turducken of weapons.\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nThat's a big CNB.\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nSo you aim upwards to counterbalance\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nthe weight you're adding to this arrow,\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nand you loose it from your bow,\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nand it plunks right into the heart of this ghost.\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000\nYeah!\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nBut it slides through harmlessly\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000\nand just impacts the soil and the paradise below.\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nHe seems completely unharmed somehow.\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000\nCan I draw my speedy longbow?\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nYep.\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nAnd I use my power to heat up metal\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000\nto warm the shafts of the blade.\n\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nThe shafts of what?\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000\nThe shafts of the arrows?\n\n01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nThe heads would be metal.\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nThe heads.\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nSure.\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nYou just warmed my shaft.\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nThat comes later.\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000\nFirst I fire.\n\n01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000\nFive at once.\n\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000\nI think you can only do three\n\n01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000\nwithout the whispering.\n\n01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nWhisper the auto whispering.\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000\nYeah, you can only whisper once per day.\n\n01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000\nCan I show?\n\n01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000\nUntil you lose your voice, yeah.\n\n01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000\nSo three hours?\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nWe good? Sure.\n\n01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000\nAlright.\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nTwo of your arrows missed,\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000\nbut one hit some right in his ghost eye.\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nIt's a critical hit, and he takes...\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000\n23 damage.\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nBlack paper!\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nBlack people!\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000\nSo I think Quark has a move now.\n\n01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000\nWait, did you do yours?\n\n01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000\nI don't like that whenever Demorge gets a victory,\n\n01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000\nwe then take it away from him\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000\nby ascribing it to all black people.\n\n01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000\nNo, but I thought we were just doing that\n\n01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000\nevery time something good happened.\n\n01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000\nNot just like Demorge was doing.\n\n01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000\nBut I'm connecting the dots and I'm going like,\n\n01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000\nlet the guy have a victory.\n\n01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000\nCalling out black people every time\n\n01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000\nhe does something great.\n\n01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000\nIt's really...\n\n01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000\nI go into a barbarian rage,\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nand take my flaming sword\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000\nand attack the ghost.\n\n01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000\nAlright.\n\n01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000\nFlying into a barbarian rage,\n\n01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000\nrage settles over your face\n\n01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000\nand your body.\n\n01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000\nIt's comfortable.\n\n01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000\nSomehow.\n\n01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000\nThat's probably why you're a barbarian.\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000\nAnd you charge directly at the ghost\n\n01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nand slash with your great sword.\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000\nBut uh, you know, he...\n\n01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000\nYou don't hit.\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000\nHe seems to jump upwards\n\n01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000\nor hover upwards or ghost dodge\n\n01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000\nin some direction.\n\n01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000\nAnd he doesn't take any damage from your sword.\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000\nInstead, he starts shimmering\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000\nand vibrating again\n\n01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000\nand squealing.\n\n01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000\nYeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n\n01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:21.000\nAnd then he flies away from you guys. He goes straight past you, straight towards Yomeiji.\n\n01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nOh no. We don't care. No we do if he gets inside Yomeiji.\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000\nHe smacks him right in the face with his ghostness. And Yomeiji's like...\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nOh no! Why don't we want... We don't want to fight Yomeiji. He's in Yomeiji now.\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000\nWe could just run away, right? He's the leader of the...\n\n01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000\nHe's the guardian of the fucking... He's a giant.\n\n01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000\nThis is the last time you interfere with my plans.\n\n01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000\nGrab Terragon!\n\n01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.000\nWe have more, right? We all go grab Terragon.\n\n01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000\nWith this form, I will annihilate you.\n\n01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000\nHe says while you're grabbing extra Terragon.\n\n01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000\nCan I use Mage Hand to force feed Terragon to Yomeiji?\n\n01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000\nThat's what I want to try on my next trend.\n\n01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000\nI'm gonna float the Terragon over here.\n\n01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.000\nI'm gonna do the, here comes the airplane!\n\n01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000\nFloating with your Mage Hand, levitating this Terragon of virtue within the range of the spell,\n\n01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000\nyou fly it up to his face and he pokes it with his flaming shovel and burns it to his cinders.\n\n01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.000\nSomeone's cranky.\n\n01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nWe gotta fight this motherfucker.\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000\nI mean, we have to get Terragon into his system somehow.\n\n01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000\nAm I still in a rage?\n\n01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000\nI just go far sword, flaming far sword at him from a distance.\n\n01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000\nWait, we're not trying to feed him the food anymore.\n\n01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000\nNo, I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.\n\n01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000\nYou don't want to kill the angel guy.\n\n01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nTry to get some Terragon goo on your bleeding weapons.\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000\nYeah.\n\n01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000\nCan I do that?\n\n01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000\nPut it on an arrowhead.\n\n01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000\nYeah, I have a ribbon dagger.\n\n01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000\nDon't tie your knife to anything.\n\n01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000\nWhat was the attack you did?\n\n01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000\nFlaming far sword.\n\n01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000\nFlaming far sword attack, but you might have lost your footing or something.\n\n01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.000\nIt goes downward and starts, it hits the ground and starts a fire on Paradise.\n\n01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000\nEverything we touch turns to shit.\n\n01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000\nHow much fire armor can I create?\n\n01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000\nYou can create plenty for yourself, but none for other people.\n\n01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000\nWell, I create some for myself.\n\n01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000\nBlack prison?\n\n01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000\nSave the thing.\n\n01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000\nI create fire armor for myself.\n\n01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000\nBreathing yourself in flames, you feel that fire will no longer hurt you.\n\n01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:08.000\nCan I take my ribbon dagger and, as Sharpie suggested, rub some Terragon on it and then throw it at Yumichi and do the airplane thing.\n\n01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000\nWait, what's the airplane thing?\n\n01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000\nHere comes the airplane, hoping that he opens his mouth.\n\n01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:24.000\nSo, you do that, you tie it or you rub it or whatever, and then you start whipping around the assassin dagger to throw at your foe.\n\n01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000\nBut it also goes awry.\n\n01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000\nI think you let it go a bit too late when it's coming around and it smacks you in the face.\n\n01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000\nWhat?\n\n01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nI'm rolling a lot of ones today.\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000\nSo, it doesn't hurt me that much.\n\n01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000\nThat's good.\n\n01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000\nIt hurts you for too damage when it smacks you in the eye.\n\n01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nAvenger.\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000\nYou definitely got a black eye.\n\n01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000\nAvenger.\n\n01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000\nScrawl.\n\n01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nPier city leafy Terragon leaves with your talons, or as El Pacino calls them, talons.\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000\nAnd coat your talons in Terragon aloe.\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000\nScrawl.\n\n01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000\nScrawl.\n\n01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000\nAnd charge that demon.\n\n01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000\nIt charges that demon.\n\n01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:21.000\nIt charges that demon, but he's got thick skin or something.\n\n01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000\nIt's not working.\n\n01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nWhat the fuck, man?\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000\nDid you just want to go home?\n\n01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nNo, I'm just not rolling high enough.\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000\nWhat's a crazy shot?\n\n01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000\nWhat's up?\n\n01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000\nWhat's a crazy shot?\n\n01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nIs that a thing there?\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000\nIt says make up a name.\n\n01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000\nSounds like a Guy Ritchie movie.\n\n01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000\nIt sounds like a character.\n\n01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000\nSounds like a lot of whip hands and freeze frames.\n\n01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000\nIf I remember correctly, that's the special name.\n\n01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nI guess it's not a name, but it's the special name of use in the whisper bow.\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000\nSo that would have already been used up.\n\n01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000\nShit.\n\n01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000\nWhose turn is it?\n\n01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nMy turn.\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000\nYay.\n\n01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nSo Yomiji, his head starts spinning around like an exorcism, and he's spitting acid all over the place.\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nAll over all of yous in a circle.\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000\nHe's spitting acid at you.\n\n01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000\nSo, role reflexes.\n\n01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000\nLike sort of like a water sprinkler kind of thing?\n\n01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000\nYeah, except without that hammer that makes it go all the way back, you know?\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000\nSo everybody but Quark manages, or no, everybody but Quark gets hit by the acid.\n\n01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000\nQuark manages to dodge out of the way.\n\n01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000\nNo, you dodge this one.\n\n01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000\nThe firearm evaporate.\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000\nYeah, I said it fucked up all style.\n\n01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000\nI said that fucked up all style.\n\n01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000\nI said fucked up all style, like it's something that has meaning.\n\n01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000\nAlright.\n\n01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000\nMoraine takes two damage.\n\n01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000\nChristopher takes seven, and Sharpie takes four damage, as acid burns your skin.\n\n01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000\nOw!\n\n01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000\nI say we run.\n\n01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000\nYeah, I say we fucking run.\n\n01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000\nWe gotta go, we gotta get out of here.\n\n01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000\nNo, let's beat this motherfucker up.\n\n01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000\nHave you looked at him?\n\n01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000\nNothing is working.\n\n01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000\nHuh?\n\n01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000\nHe's a giant.\n\n01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000\nBecause we keep rolling ones, let's fucking, let's muscle up.\n\n01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000\nLet's fucking focus.\n\n01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000\nYour strategy is to get luckier?\n\n01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000\nYes.\n\n01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000\nLet's get lucky.\n\n01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000\nI use weapon focus and do a mighty sword attack.\n\n01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000\nAlright.\n\n01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000\nSwing with your mighty sword.\n\n01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000\nWatch this guys, it's gonna fucking work.\n\n01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000\nYou swing your mighty sword and he parries with his flaming shovel.\n\n01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000\nTimmy, you know what?\n\n01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000\nFuck off, let's get out of here.\n\n01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000\nLet me take one more shot.\n\n01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000\nWhat happens?\n\n01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000\nCan I take one more shot?\n\n01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000\nSure.\n\n01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000\nI still have firearm, right?\n\n01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000\nYep.\n\n01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:53.000\nSo with my boots of spry springing and several clumps of pteragon virtue,\n\n01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:04.000\nI, uh, uh, Ronaldo Nehemiah my way over to the beast, uh, leaping up and diving straight toward, uh, the ghost's mouth,\n\n02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000\nuh, flinging pteragon into the open crevasse.\n\n02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000\nCan you, can you try the, here comes the airplane line.\n\n02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000\nAnd can you say it as Barack Obama?\n\n02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000\nUh, do us a favor and open up.\n\n02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000\nSomeone's knocking at the door.\n\n02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000\nHe's folksy sometimes.\n\n02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000\nSomeone's knocking, buckle down, open up.\n\n02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:44.000\nHere comes the old airplane.\n\n02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000\nWith a sure foot and a measured tone, you leap into the air,\n\n02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000\nhurling pteragon of virtue at, at the blazing angel.\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000\nBut, uh, he closes his mouth.\n\n02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000\nDamn it, I wanna fucking die, I wanna kill myself.\n\n02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000\nLet's go, let's get out of here.\n\n02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000\nI wanna fucking run, I wanna leave, I don't like it.\n\n02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000\nYou guys stay, we run, we run away.\n\n02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000\nYou and I run away.\n\n02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000\nCan we do that?\n\n02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000\nThe show's about to end, we have to end on a cliffhanger.\n\n02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000\nYeah, let's run away.\n\n02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000\nWe're just running away.\n\n02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000\nRun away!\n\n02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000\nPowered us.\n\n02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000\nAn underestimated tactic.\n\n02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000\nDeMorris Brown, imagine if the Nazis had been more powerful.\n\n02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000\nGood afternoon, Mr. Grittenden.\n\n02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000\nI'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000\nThis show brought to you by a cowardice.\n\n02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000\nThank you, Annie, thank you, Tyler, B-Stick, Bill,\n\n02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000\nAdam Goldberg, all of your assistance.\n\n02:01:50.000 --> 02:02:00.000\nSee you next week.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[188918]}
