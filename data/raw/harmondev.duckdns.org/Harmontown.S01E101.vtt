00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
Zero audio.

00:04.620 --> 00:06.220
Dice and soup.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.600
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome one and all back again to the lockdown comics.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Hermontown is now in session!

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It gets better and better. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hermontown, Dan Harmon!

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Thank you, wow.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
What's with the big crowd, Jeff? What's going on?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Don't know. Maybe your show got canceled.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
It was canceled last time. I guess it was a big crowd last time, too.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
I guess this is all we got now, huh? This is all the people that were watching community.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
All 200 of them.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
What's next for you, Dan? Are you going to arrest on your laurels?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm really up in the air about that.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
My fantasy, as you probably know, is to be able to not write ever again.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
But there's this whole mortgage, and I want to have a baby, and baby need diapers.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Baby's got to go to college, because it'll probably be a fucking athlete.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Because that's just my karma.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
If baby is an athlete, it'll pay for itself, the scholarships and shit.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, you're right, you're right.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
Anyways, the money. Life is money. I'm in the second half of my life now. It's time for the selfless half of my life to begin.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I have met with my goddess. I now need to atone with the cosmos.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Are you prepared to be a father? Do you think that you're ready to bring a child into this world?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I mean, worse guys than me have done it.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
That's not an answer.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
The population of this planet is all you ever need, that it's not that hard a job.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
Project yourself into a three-year-old child of yours, and Aaron's.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
You're a father of a three-year-old.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Am I in the child?

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Project yourself into that reality.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
So you're a father of a three-year-old person.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
What's your day-to-day, your quotidian shit?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, I'm hoping, yeah, I hope I can work from home by that time.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
I hope I can be like a house husband and really put my full energy into the kid.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
That's why I don't know what I'm going to do next, because I could do a Fox deal.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
They had rolled that when I got my job back at Community.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
So there's that whole network sitcom world still waiting there.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But now I have this opportunity.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I could, without really burning any bridges, I could walk away from that.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I could write movies.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I could write a book.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I mean, I don't know.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
What's your fantasy about your next project?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
If you could have anything as your next thing, what would it be?

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, I really want to write this one movie that I've been trying to write for 15 years now.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Daedalus?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Do that one.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Can we talk about that, or would that be bad business?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, I don't know.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
No, I don't want to talk it out or anything.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, it's just a story I want to write.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Get off my dick.

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
But you and I used to go to the drawing room and talk about this movie, and you would cry and not write that movie.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, I've been working on it for quite a while, which is a good sign that you probably shouldn't.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't know. I always tell the kids, don't throw that idea away, that one you've been thinking about since high school,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
because it's too precious.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
It's a recipe for writer's block, like focusing on that thing.

04:10.000 --> 04:20.000
But it also might be incumbent upon the elderly writers like myself to actually get around to that thing they always wanted to do.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Do you feel elderly at 41?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Well, yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm in the second half of my life.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I'm not about to blow anyone away as a wonder kind.

04:30.000 --> 04:41.000
Or pronounce Wunderkind right.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
There's certain words I've only ever seen in type. I've never heard anything like that.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Baggle and wonder kind.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Hey, you know that Playboy liquor store over in Hollywood?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, it says Playboy liquor.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
How are they getting away with that?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
That's like crazy.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Because of a drive pass at Playboy liquor store, there's a liquor store in LA that's called Playboy liquor.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
It is dead on the font of Playboy magazine, but the Y is a martini glass.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And it's just like Playboy liquor.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Like, hey, you like Playboy?

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
It's rich tradition of high quality pornography.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Come on in.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
It's just a fucking dirtballs liquor store.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
You can't do that. You can't have like a Nintendo grocery store.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Spell Nintendo with a Y.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
You can do whatever you want.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
Don't let me get in your way. I'm half done living.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
So Dan, you're getting married in what, November?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And then you're a married fellow.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
You're a husband.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
And then you're going to have a baby.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Or as far as we know, it could be twins. We don't know.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
You might suddenly be the father of twin girls.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
Am I projecting onto Jeff or can anyone else sense that he doesn't want me to get married and have a baby?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
No, you're projecting.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
You're projecting.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Well, a couple people are getting that pheromone off of you.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
You're projecting onto me.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Okay.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm saying like, you're going to be a fucking father.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
That's crazy.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That's crazy cool.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm all for it, man.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Imagine me replicating myself genetically.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I know.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Horrifying.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It's going to be amazing.

06:26.000 --> 06:37.000
Imagine me, imagine me, imagine if you're a little kid and you want a bedtime story, then this motherfucker walks in.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Best writer in the fucking world.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Whoa.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
All right.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
That's like, all right, Dan, give me a bedtime story.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm 18 months old.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
My name is Vanessa because Aaron named your first daughter Vanessa.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh man.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
She's got worse in store.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
What are the names?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
She got one last night that she really likes.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Scorpion.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
She really likes that song.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
It's in that, it's in that, what's it, Pedro Amadovar movie.

07:13.000 --> 07:28.000
There's a musician in one of the movies and he sings that song.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
What's happening right now?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
It's this song.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
It's like a Spanish song or Mexican song.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
No, in this song, what is it?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Oh no.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
What is Aaron want the baby to be called?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
God damn it.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Now I forgot.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Aaron?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Now I forgot.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
She's not here, she's not here.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Oh.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
She's in that show.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Paloma.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
What?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Paloma.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Paloma.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Paloma means dove.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
It means dove, right?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Who knew that?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Who's raising their hand?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I haven't heard yet.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Who are you?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
His name is Darren McGathey.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Your name is what?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Oh, okay.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You're just guessing that.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
But you're right.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Paloma.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
But you didn't have a conversation with me about this.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You guessed.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah, Paloma.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Paloma.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
That's what it is.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Didn't Picasso name his daughter Paloma?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It means dove.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Fine.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
What?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
She's a hack.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I don't know.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
But Paloma, I'd like to have a little daughter named Paloma.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
I kind of, for somebody, I wonder if I'm sexist.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Then let's take it to the bank.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
I think I must be sexist, or whatever the opposite of sexist is.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I would really like to have a daughter, and I also don't care what her name is.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
As much as I would care.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Is it just gender identity?

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm more reticent to name my son something weird than my daughter.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
I kind of feel like the daughter's name is just a fuck off.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
That's misogynist.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I don't know.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Or is it like I'm already unconditionally loving my daughter, and I'm just going to make my

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
son's life a living hell, because I'm going to be thinking, that's a little me.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
That's a little me.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And the daughter, because of my...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Why wouldn't your daughter be a little you, too?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You know why, Jeff.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I don't know why.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
She'll have a hole where her wiener should be.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
And you just can't...

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
She's going to have her hands full with problems.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
No, I'm very much...

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
What would you prefer?

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
If you could make a choice, son or daughter?

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
I think I would prefer a daughter, because I'm terrified of getting eaten by the kid.

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
In a mythical sense, prom night, and your teenage kid comes after you drunk, and he's

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
like, fuck you, old man.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
That whole energy.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
So you want a girl because she can't beat you up when she's 18?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
She'll be an errand up.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Her issues will be with...

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
She'll be like, old lady, fuck you.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
And I'll be like, now, now.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
Come sit with daddy and watch Blazing Saddles.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Fetch my bifocals.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Does Aaron have a name for the boy, if it's a boy?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
It's never been Saddles soap.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I've heard her throw out Cormac.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Cormac?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Karthi?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I reckon.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Connor.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Connor, is it just...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'll see your names.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I like biblical names, and I like my names Daniel.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
What does that mean?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
God will be my judge.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
For real?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
And I interpret that to mean, and only God.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Only God.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
There's a dot after that.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Only God will tell you to tie her shoes.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
God will be my judge.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That's it, motherfucker.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah, the story of Daniel is great.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Not Sony, not NBC.

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
Daniel was a dream interpreter for a king, and then his rival colleagues, the Hacks,

11:23.000 --> 11:32.000
they turned him in for praying to the wrong God secretly.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
And he was using his position as a dream interpreter to kind of move the king in a Yahweh direction.

11:39.000 --> 11:47.000
And the king was kind of under his psychological thumb, because he was good at what he did.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
He was winning him with being good at his job.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
And so his rivals tried to turn him in, and I can't remember how the rest of the story goes,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
except it ends with all of those right...

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
They throw him in the lion's den, and then God closes the lion's mouths,

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
and he pulled Daniel out, and they go, I guess you're on the winning team,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
and then they throw all of the guys that fucked with him,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
and all of their families, and all of their families' families into the lion's den,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
and the lions eat them.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
It's a horrible story.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
God will be my judge.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
And also, he'll kick ass on your behalf.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Yes, he's in my corner.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
So I like that name.

12:35.000 --> 12:43.000
I wouldn't mind just a straightforward Hebrew name for my kid.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Like what?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I have to look it up.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
I want to look up all the stories and see what kind of myth I would like the kid to be able to delve into.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
Do you feel like your parents thought about Daniel as a name for you, and had foresight?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
My mom said that she chose the names based on...

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
She named me and my brother with these alliterative names, Doug and Dan.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
She said at one point that the way she picked the names,

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
was she imagined them being announced over the loudspeakers at a football arena?

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
Like, quarterback Dan Harmon at Douglas.

13:26.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah, there's the Harbin Brothers, Doug and Dan out there, flowing the football around.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Anyways, I want to see you as a father.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
You're gonna.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I know.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm going to, and I want to.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
I want to see you change your diaper.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm gonna be good at that.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
What qualifies you to be changing your diaper?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Well, I don't change my underwear very often.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
So when I do, it's gross.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
So I'm prepared for...

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
No, no, you're not prepared for that.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
No, I am.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Why is a guy that doesn't change his own underwear, qualify to change another human being's underwear?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Because I take him off and I'm like, blech.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And I throw him in the hamper, and that's what you do when you change a diaper.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
No, you don't!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You shit everywhere.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
It's about tidiness, it's about health.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
I'll see you in the parental funny papers, baby.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm gonna raise the fuck out of this kid.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
You being a father, you're gonna get what you don't want.

14:39.000 --> 14:47.000
You're gonna get some, strangely, the person that you didn't want to raise, a human being.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
And you'll be there giving it probably good bedtime stories.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
What would the bedtime stories be?

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
That opportunity went away.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
Chicken shit.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
You're gonna have a child.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
This is the batting cages of learning how to tell a baby story.

15:16.000 --> 15:27.000
I know Vanessa.

15:27.000 --> 15:36.000
Once there was this farmer, and he kept telling in his fields, say he could make little jelly bean plants.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
And then one day one of the jelly bean plants looked up at her and said,

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
please don't harvest me, I have a magical jelly bean plant.

15:46.000 --> 15:54.000
I don't want to be harvested, I need to stay here so that I can keep talking to you and hanging out.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
You can have all the other jelly bean plants.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
This is what I'm talking about.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Don't cut me down.

16:01.000 --> 16:12.000
So the farmer, who was also a princess,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
obliged the magic jelly bean plant, harvested all the others,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
took them inside to her father and said, here's the jelly beans, he counted them up.

16:21.000 --> 16:33.000
I count only seven jelly bean plants worth of jelly beans here, Rodriguez.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
That is because one of them was magical and asked me not to...

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Silence!

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
Bring me my belt.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Why?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
You know why.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Where is it?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
It's over there on the dresser.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
Slowly Rodriguez went and grabbed the belt off the dresser with trembling hands,

17:01.000 --> 17:11.000
handed it to her father, who put it on because his pants were just falling down a little.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
And then he ran out to the field with Rodriguez and they talked to the jelly bean plant

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
and they had an hour conversation about covering a wide range of topics

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
and including how to irrigate better so that they ended up growing more jelly bean plants than ever.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
So the moral is go to sleep.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
It's Tarot episode one.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You're going to be a good dad.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Thank you.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Thanks everybody.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm just looking through the Playboy liquor.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Bumper stickers, I don't really...

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Oh dear.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I wouldn't be the first person to not understand bumper stickers.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
I understand if you're in a band, you put your band's bumper sticker on your bumper

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
because it's like, hey, it's my car, I'm going to promote my band with my bumper sticker.

18:05.000 --> 18:16.000
I understand the clever ones, like the pithy ones, like here's a little something about me.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't get it, but we don't have to talk about it.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Wait, for instance, what was that?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
I can't remember.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't know, I just saw...

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I can't think of any really, honestly.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
What about ones that espouse a political agenda?

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
I think it's a bad idea to have a bumper sticker because it can't be so large

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
that I could read it from far enough away to be safe to read your bumper sticker.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
I have to get close enough to read your political philosophy and maybe hit you.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm almost positive that no one on this earth has ever been converted to anything by a bumper sticker.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
So I don't know what purpose.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Is it just the idea that it's just like, we'll whittle away at you.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
I saw a bumper sticker that said, honk if you're horny.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You like that one?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I honked.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
You ever see that guy on the corner outside the Vista Theater

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
and he's always holding a sign that says, honk for peace?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And he keeps gesturing.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
He seems really exasperated when people aren't honking.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
And then people honk and then he just gives them a big thumb up.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
I got 40 questions for that guy.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
I just said, how do you know when you're finished?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
How does that work?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Why is he mad at people who don't honk?

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I can already see the anger on his face when he doesn't get the honks he wants.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
So I know that if he was in control of an army, he'd attack someone.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
But he's just in control of a sign, so he just goes,

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
I've seen that guy, but before I see him, I hear a bunch of honking which makes you unhappy

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
because it's the sound of horns honking.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, it's like make your baby cry if you want world peace.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Poke your baby in the eye.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
It's like a sound that distresses you.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Isn't that wonderful how babies crying really makes us upset?

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Like on an airplane, you hear that sound and you're like,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
you think you're a bad person because you're like, shut that fucking baby up.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
But really the reason you're upset is because you're having an instinctive reaction

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
to a human child in distress.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And what you're frustrated by is the fact that you can't do anything about it.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
You're not allowed to do anything because we're not, we're a disenfranchised tribe.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Ryan Stiles is the coolest thing in the world.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
We're on a plane and Ryan has three children.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
And there's a woman that brought a baby on board in first class and the baby was just screaming.

20:55.000 --> 21:05.000
And like, probably a three-year-old boy just fucking absolutely abject pain, just screaming.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
And Ryan said, can I take your baby?

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
And Ryan took the child and he doesn't like to fly.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Ryan is a bad flyer.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
He does not like flying.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
He took the child and walked out of first class down like all the way to the back of the plane

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
and the crying stops.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Ryan killed that baby.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
The North Korean soldiers never got on the bus.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
All we heard was a door open.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
Ryan came back with a quiet child and sat down and leaned his chair back and put the baby, the toddler, on his chest

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
and they went to sleep for the next four hours.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
And the mother was like, when we landed, she's like, how did you do that?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
He goes, like, give it a change of scenery.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Like, take the baby for a walk once in a while.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Like, move it around and don't panic.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
It was so cool.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
It's possible to take a crying baby in a plane and assuage the pain.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
I always imagine the babies, like their ears aren't popping.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I don't know how terrifying that must be for the baby.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I always think about that too.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
People bring animals on the plane, like they're in the cargo bay or whatever.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
They must be back there like, what the fuck is going on?

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Isn't it weird how dogs love being in cars and cats are like, fuck you?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
It's so amazing.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Dogs are so comfortable with everything.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Like, Aaron just puts fucking t-shirts on the dog.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It's a hat on his head.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
He doesn't get it.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
He just feels like, oh, this is my job.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I'll just dress like a lizard now.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
Cats are like, you put something on a cat and it starts running around backwards like a crayfish,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
trying to back out from it.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
Cats do not cotton to any kind of unnatural behavior or costuming.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
All right.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
Let's break the Kumail glass because to give this show a kick in the ass.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Kumail Nanjiani!

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm hungover, so the show's low energy, so I'm bringing out the big guns.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
The show's been going great.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I've been listening and watching.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
These people love it.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
They're like, yeah, Kumail.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
We're on board kinda.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Kumail, is it just me or do you get sexier every time I see you?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
I've been taking pills.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
What sort of pills?

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Just like diet pills.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
They work, guys. Don't listen to what moms say.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Here, I'm making you a drink.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I'm just using my hand to put the ice in the cup.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Kumail, do you fancy yourself a father?

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
You know, it's so weird that you guys are talking about this because we've been talking about it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Like, it's been like, we're...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I don't know. I don't know.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
It's hard. It's one of those things your whole life, you know, you think life's gonna be a certain way.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
You're supposed to do certain things in my whole life.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I've been like, I'll be a dad someday. I'll be a dad someday. My kid's gonna be great.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
And then at a certain point, you're like, well, do I really want to be a dad?

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
It's hard to ask yourself a question that you thought the answer was made for you your whole life.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
And now in my 30s, I'm like, do I really want that?

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
I don't know. It's very hard to think about.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I would imagine you being a good father.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
I don't think I'd be a bad father. I think I'd be a good father.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
I don't know if I want to be a father.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I don't know. We've just started...

24:47.000 --> 24:55.000
Certainly we don't need that incumbent upon us to choke the planet with more flesh.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah, but...

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
If people are having certain thoughts about it...

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
That's like the worst gynecologist ever, listen.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
You're gonna have a little thing that chokes the planet with more flesh.

25:09.000 --> 25:16.000
Yahweh said in the Old Testament, right? He said, go for it and choke the planet with more flesh.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
It's gonna hurt when you take a shit from now on.

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
Dan, are you driven? Do you feel a part of you needs to be a father wants to be a father?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Why do you want to be a father?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Do you feel that way?

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
I feel driven to it. I feel like...

25:32.000 --> 25:40.000
When I have to make a choice, I go best case, worst case and compare all the possibilities.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
The worst case scenario with having a kid is having a kid and just being like anybody else that has a kid.

25:46.000 --> 25:54.000
Like, I had a kid and sometimes people with kids secretly warn you when no one's listening.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Don't do it.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Oh yeah, I've been pulled aside at parties.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
But it's always tongue and chit. They mean it, but it's truth and jest.

26:03.000 --> 26:15.000
That's the worst case scenario is regretting, is having a kid and wondering what it would be like to be a bachelor and play video games.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Or just be with Aaron and not have a kid.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
Like what Schrab and Kate are doing. They're not having kids, they're just hanging out.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
The worst case scenario is worrying about that. What am I missing?

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
The worst case scenario with not having a kid is far worse.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
It's like being 70 years old and going like, I've had a pretty good life.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
We've had our ups and downs and our chuckles.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I'm gonna die.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Bring in the people I'll say my final words to.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
There is no one.

26:49.000 --> 26:58.000
Bring in little Danny Jr. You traded his soul in for playing Wolfenstein.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
That sounds pretty good.

27:01.000 --> 27:09.000
That's the reason to have a child is that you feel like at your dying breath that you wished there was a version of you.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
But it's not just about my dying breath. I'm talking about all those years in between too.

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
What I'm trying to say is that wondering what it would have been like to have children

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
is for me a more dire fate than wondering what it would be like to not have children.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Something that I have 41 years of experience with.

27:30.000 --> 27:38.000
I know the path that I've been on and I know that sometimes I wish it would last forever.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
You're like, this is going great. Let's bring a couple children into this.

27:41.000 --> 27:50.000
But I also know that my hair is falling out and that my boobs are sagging and I have boobs.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
I'm melting. I'm dying. I'm disintegrating.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
So are you combating mortality by having children? Is that what it is?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
No, it's not like a pharaoh thing like I want my legacy.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
It's not.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Because it is for a lot of people.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
No, I would never put that whammy on a kid. I hope he's a garbage man.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Be a garbage man. Be the best garbage man everybody works with.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I don't give a shit what you do.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
Because who are we kidding? Everybody's been doing remarkable things for 6,000 years.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Where has it gotten them? Who gives a fuck?

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Just have a good life, Harmon Jr.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
That was like inspiring and cynical at the same time.

28:30.000 --> 28:40.000
The awareness of my mortality is, I'm saying like, I want to tell a story with my life.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
And I'm halfway through that story.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
And for me, reproduction is the second half of a full life.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
Oh, I thought it was like setting up a sequel, you know, when Freddy's Hand comes out again.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh, that's more Harmon happening.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
I don't even know how to think about this.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Because for me, a reason that I always assumed I wanted kids was like, you know, that's how you,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
because I have, you know, I've been thinking about death my whole life.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
And I'm like, that's how, for me, you combat it, you get a kid,

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
and then that person continues on the stuff you've done and you sort of live on through them.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
But now I'm like, well, I kind of want to live on through the stuff I do.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
You know, like you sort of, like the, you know, shows you right or whatever, that kind of stuff.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
So I think I would rather do that, but I don't know.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I don't even know how to start thinking about it.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
It seems like so much.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Do your parents have an opinion about whether you should be a father or not?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Me?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Do they care about you being a father?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah, they have a very strong opinion.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
They're very proud.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm like, now, I kind of want to be like, remember how difficult it was when I brought a white woman home?

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
Now I'm bringing a person, you can't even separate the person.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
It's like a swirl, like they're together.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
It's going to be so much more complicated.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
This is like we went to fucking Cold Stone and mixed it all up.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
There's no conversation now, so.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Do you think they're excited about that or?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah, I was just with them this weekend and they brought it up a lot.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
So, I mean, they're like, like, when you, you, you referenced,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
you were how difficult it was when I brought a white woman home,

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
like what was the family situation when you and Emily started going out,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
when you, when it was time to meet the parents?

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
We thought, we've talked about your parents, like ambitions for you.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
We wanted you to be a doctor.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
I mean, they, so they had maybe ambitions for you in terms of your mate as well.

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
Oh yeah, they used to send me pictures of women, like, because it's all arranged marriage, you know.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
So it's all these women who, so this is how it's set up.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
There's like older women in the community who are always aware of like, oh, you know,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
that they have a girl, she just there in the market.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
So they, they know the guys and they know the women in the market.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So they show me these pictures that are obviously these old ladies taking pictures

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
of like these girls at weddings and stuff, like, you know, they're eating,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
they're like caught unaware.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
It's completely true.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
And my mom would send it over with like sort of like a resume, like she's, you know,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
she's pre-med, she's got a green card.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
So that's not going to be a problem.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
And I kept saying no to them and I swear the women got more and more attractive.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
And the last one was like fucking Cleopatra.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Like she was stunning.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
So if you're in Pakistan and you're listening to this podcast, like always, like, hold out.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Oh yeah.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And, oh yeah, hold out.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
They're bluffing, they're bluffing.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Even if you're going to stay in the system.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I wonder if it works that way for the, for the poor girls.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Like, do their men, choices get...

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Yeah, but it's like kind of when you go to a store and you're like,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
hey, what, what's the shit in the back?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
What do you have in the back?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
What's that girl?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Cleopatra is that girl.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
What's her stake in it?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Like, what is she?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
She's getting me, dude.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
What the fuck?

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
They're merging the house Nanjiani with...

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
It is like that.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
It is like that.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
It's the iron bank will...

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
We will be so much stronger.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
No, it totally is like that.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
It's more of a pact between two families rather than just love.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
We actually have a term for a marriage that's not arranged.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
They call it love marriage.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
It's called love marriage, which here seems so redundant.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
But over there, and they say it's like a bad term.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Like, oh, she had a love marriage, you know.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
What?

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Love marriage, Google it.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Meaning she had a say in the matter?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
No, you always have a say in the matter.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
The difference is whether you get set up, you sort of hang out.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
So it'll be like the two families meet and then they're like,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
find an excuse to leave and the guy and the girl are there and you talk.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
And then you decide like, yeah, this is the person, the rest of my life.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
She likes purple.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Is it male driven or female driven?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Like who's driving that car?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Both people can say no.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
It's like in that, it's fairly even for how crazy a system it is.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
The woman can say no when she doesn't have to get married

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and the guy can say no when they don't have.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Both have to say yes.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
All right.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
So crazy.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It's a little charming.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
Do you think it is too little charming?

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
Well, I mean, it's charming from the vantage point of not having a deal with it.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
I'm currently pissed off.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
I mean, as I think we all are about that fucking douchebag that didn't get laid

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
and killed a bunch of people and blames it on women.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
And also there's two...

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
I'm just hungover.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
You're bummed out about that guy?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Yeah, I know.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.500
There's been two attacks from Griffith Park, girls just taking a walk and they can't take

33:38.500 --> 33:42.000
a walk because a guy is going to fucking attack them.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
It's different being a woman than being a guy because men expect things

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
and when they don't get what they want, they actually do attack.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It's the worst fucking thing in the world.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
I used to...

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
I made it into my late 20s before I knew that that was a real thing.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.300
I would get mad at my girlfriends when they would come home and the first girlfriend that

34:03.300 --> 34:11.000
came home and said like, the guy out there, the one on the corner that's selling me oranges,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
he makes these fucking sounds when I walk by him.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
I'm like, what do you talk?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Come on.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Guy's selling oranges.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
He's sucking on oranges.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
He's just like, no, he happens all the time.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
He's just being angry that you're a woman and that doesn't happen the other way.

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
They make kissy sounds and comments and stuff like that if a woman's not with a man sometimes,

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
if she is.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
The crazy thing to me was when I was like 29, when I first was being introduced to that

34:44.000 --> 34:53.000
concept in a secondhand fashion by one of my girlfriends, my immediate emotional response

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
was, knock it off, stop being dramatic.

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
I had a weird membrane there that was inherently misogynist.

35:04.000 --> 35:16.000
There was a Robocop directive in my programming where the idea of...

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I just believed in my brain.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I was like, you're making that up.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
That's crazy.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Women don't walk around on the sidewalk and just constantly get harassed.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
It's every day.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It's also an everyday thing.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I can't speak for women.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
There's probably women here that would absolutely say it better.

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
You're prepared for guys to be shitty to you at all times.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
And knowing that they're riddled with testosterone.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
Learn how to not get raped by what you wear, what you say, how you reject somebody.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
You say you have a boyfriend when you don't.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You give a fake phone number.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Guys never have to do that.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
It's just the ugliest thing in the world.

35:57.000 --> 36:05.000
I hope that the people that died because of that little asshole, I hope the conversation

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
becomes something so cool that guys change.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
I actually grow up and learn that what they want isn't a mandate.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
Women aren't simply things that will get fucked.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
They can say fuck you.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
I don't want to fuck you.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
That's not who I am.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
I don't want to be the guy who says it's over.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
No more problems.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
But I want to be hopeful and say, I feel like when I monitor the younger generation,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I feel like they are...

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It's so far away from that.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Women got the vote.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
They're moving too early.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Way later than black people.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
We like to hate our women.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
We will be misogynist way after we fix racism.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
We're terrible.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And women are the coolest.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
They have everything on us.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Now I'm being misogynist.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
It might even fucking going on.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I just...

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
We're going to start just grabbing their bodies.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Is that what that was going?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Were you going to talk?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Go ahead.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Sorry.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
How was it going to get misogynistic?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
I want to know.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
It's like a guy talking about what women should or should not get.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
What they shouldn't be is treated like anything other than a person.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And this little guy is saying...

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
He's probably crazy.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Whatever the fuck was going on with him.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
The idea that because he's a 24-year-old virgin and he has to go kill blonde women.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
And then on Twitter, people backing that guy up saying,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Hey, it's Memorial Day, man.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Stop your feminist bullshit and support our troops.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Because it's fucking...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Wait, what?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Oh, yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
That's a pretty big thing.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
That's a weird comment section to plant any flag.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
There were people...

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Because it was the yes all women thing going on, right?

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
As opposed to the not all men are rapey.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
I'm the coolest guy.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Not all men do that.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
But women are saying no.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
All women have to learn how to not get raped when they walk through a parking garage.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Women have to deal with it.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
All women do.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Yes, not all men are bad people.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
But all women have to learn how to deal with guys being bad at rejection.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

38:23.000 --> 38:31.000
So, I really wish I had met that little fucker the day before he did that.

38:31.000 --> 38:38.000
Wait, you didn't have like a psychic dream that this was going to happen?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
What's funny is that kind of bitch.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
What?

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
What?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Go ahead.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
You have the floor.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
What was the psychic dream that I don't want to get off track?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Just let's do a quick sidebar.

38:52.000 --> 39:00.000
It's almost like I feel like I wake up after things happen and feel like something subliminally happened.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
So you like sort of backtrack and you're like, oh yeah.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
I did not have a dream that a guy was going to go punish women because he's an asshole.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
That would be a stupid dream because that should be the story of every movie that we make.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
I didn't think we were going to talk about this guy because I imagine that all the podcasts are.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
But my goal as always is originality.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
But now that we're on the topic, I just watched the video in the green room.

39:28.000 --> 39:38.000
And I was stricken by how strangely disingenuous he acted like he was acting when he's talking.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Because his father's a director.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Oh, really?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Are you joking?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
No, he's an AD.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
It was so weird he was acting like he's like Josh Hartnett or something.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I'm so into it.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Yeah.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
It was fucking giggles.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
But it was so weird.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You're being shitty at being a bad guy.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
He's acting.

39:58.000 --> 40:06.000
Yeah, but I didn't understand that because I was like, normally when somebody is acting that way and you feel like they're being dishonest,

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
there's something inside them that they're suppressing and keeping down.

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
Like for instance, I hate women because they don't love me and I want to kill all of them.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
This guy's saying that.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
Yeah, so what was his secret?

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, and he seems so fake.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
The secret isn't genuine.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
He's an asshole.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
And he probably had everything going for him except the fact that nobody likes him.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And he...

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
That's what he says.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
I bet he had a real shitty vibe at the point.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
I have a young lady raising her hand in the audience.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
So he was acting.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Come on, say it.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
Adam, take it easy, buddy.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Adam gets to bring her up.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
He's got, by the way, he has a chair for his laptop.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Oh, nobody's sat here.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
What's your name?

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I'm Annie.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Hello, Annie.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Hi.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
So I just read an article. It's not like I knew this guy or anything.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
So it turns out he was into pickup artistry.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Oh, the game?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
No, no, no.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Well, like the thing we know how men try to get...

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
The game?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Sure.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, there was a book that a guy wrote that's like...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
It's a very specific thing.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
He was into that, but it didn't work for him.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
So he was a member of this group that was called Pua Haters,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
or Pua Hate or something.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Wait, Pua?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Pua's pickup artistry is what they refer...

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
I know, right?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
It already sounds gross.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That can be a thing?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Right.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
So yeah, so he's a member of this online community of people

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
who hate pickup artistry because it didn't work for them.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
So they're like...

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
So now not only are they already angry at women,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
they're now doubly angry because these techniques just didn't work for them.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah, even science doesn't work for them.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah, exactly.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
That's how awful women are.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Even the science of being just verbally abusive

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
and deceptive to women.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Is that that friend zone thing?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Is that part of that?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
I don't think so.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
On Twitter, there's a whole thing about like friend zoning.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I think that's separate.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I think friend zone...

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
I thought friend zoning was like,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
no, this is never going to happen.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
You've never been friend zone.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Yeah.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
And the men being mad at the idea that women could possibly

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
send you to the...

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I don't have to fuck you, Cornfield.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
It's so crazy.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
So he got mad that there was a book that he read

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
that didn't get him laid?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Right, that didn't get him laid.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
And then he was part of this group of people.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Why did he stay out of those three Chinese guys?

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
There were three...

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
He also hated...

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
He hated...

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
This is another part of it.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
He's biracial.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
And so he's half...

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I forget what kind of Asian, but half white.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
And he hated Asian guys.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
On message boards, he'd be like,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
you guys suck, girls don't want you.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
And he said that it was part Asian-ness

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
that drove women away,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
because women don't like Asian dudes.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
He was racist against himself?

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Yeah.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Well, part of himself.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Well, he was...

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah, this guy had no shortage of...

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
A shortage of dick.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Yeah, I mean, it's not a brave stance to...

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
I mean, whatever.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
I don't know what...

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
We know that this guy's a bad person.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Thank you, Annie.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Annie.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Oh, that game stuff.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
What was her name?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Did you get it?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Annie.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
She had a night for the listeners.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
She had a pink sweater and a pink bow in her hair.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
It was like...

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Hi, Harry.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Very...

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Annie, where are you from?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I came from El Segundo,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
but I'm originally from San Francisco.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
El Segundo?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Yeah, very far away.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
I left my wallet there.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Somebody here came from New York,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
and he was telling me outside

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
that Harmontown got him through Hurricane Sandy.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
What?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Because they didn't have any power,

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
and they just had a bunch of podcasts on the computer,

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
and they would...

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
My question was like,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
if you didn't have power,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
they would go to an office,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
or one of them worked, I think,

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
and listened to Harmontown through,

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
and it helped him survive.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
It would be so great if you asked who it was,

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
and it wasn't anybody.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
You just, like, had, like,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
in your head you made it up and bought it.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I was wondering if politicians do that.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I talked to a plumber named Mike.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
It was like that.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
He's got three kids.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Camille, how's the...

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
Have you become a street celebrity now?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Like, from a...

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
Yeah, my horns count for twice the piece, actually.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
What a haunt for that guy.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
For sure now, everybody, like,

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
the amount of people stopping you in the grocery store

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
must have gone up by a tenfold, right?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Yeah, people do recognize me.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
It's kind of...

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
It's so cool.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Every day, it happens every day.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
It's like, people really like the show.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
It's a good show.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
It's a good show.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Oh, thank you.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
So, yeah, every, like...

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Now, are you...

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Are you free stuff?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Were you read for that?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't...

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
We haven't talked about this.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
When you read for that,

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
was that something that you thought

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
that they had written kind of for you,

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
or that you were just auditioning for it?

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Like...

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Well, I didn't know I auditioned for two parts

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
that I didn't get.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
TJ's part, TJ Miller, Erlich's part,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
and Big Head, and I didn't get them.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
And they just liked the names.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
They said, you're not right for these,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
but we'll write something for you.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
And you always hear that.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Whenever you have a good audition,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
you don't get it.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Don't worry, we'll write it for you.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
And it's just like...

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
We'll see you in heaven.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
We'll see you in heaven.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Or they'll bring the Chinese food one episode, you know?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
But then they were like,

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
yeah, we're gonna write something for you,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
and I didn't hear anything for a while.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And then the final round of auditions was happening,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
and I was out of town,

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
and I was like,

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
I gotta fly back early,

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
but I couldn't fly back early,

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
so I was like,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
all right, I'm gonna miss the final round of auditions.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
And then I landed,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
and I had this phone call.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
There was all my agents,

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
and manager, and everybody,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
and I was like, oh, this is something.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And they said that you...

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
They wrote a part for you,

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
and that we...

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I'm gonna be in the show.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
And it was...

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I did one audition just with Mike,

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
and from that,

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
like, I didn't have to do, like,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
the whole round of testing and shit.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I did one audition with Mike Judge,

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
and then they just wrote a thing for me.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Oh, really?

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
You didn't have to do that

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
fucking horrible thing

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
where people are going in.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
No.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
It was HBO.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
That's some kind of, like,

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
do their own thing.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
So Mike was like,

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
oh, I like this guy

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
when I write something for him.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
They were like, okay, great.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
If you like him, use him.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Fucking awesome.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
It was awesome.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
It was the easiest, like...

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
It wasn't the easiest job to get.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
I was fucking terrified

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
going into the audition,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
because it's Mike Judge, and, you know...

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
It must be Carolyn Strauss, right?

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
She must be some kind of mad genius,

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
because she's been there forever at HBO,

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
and HBO plays this really high-risk,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
high-yield game in television.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
They bet all that they have

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
on shows hoping that they become

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Game of Thrones, Sopranos.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Because their money's made from subscription.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
They don't give a fuck about ratings.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
They want people to buy the product,

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
and they have to actually make...

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
They have to create cultural phenomena

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
as a business.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
They have...

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
The buy-in is so much bigger.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
People aren't just giving them

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
a half hour of their time.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
People are giving them, you know,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
20 bucks a month or whatever.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
So you have to create shows

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
that become part of the function.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
But make people on the subway

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
start to just get humiliated

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
that they don't know

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
what they're ever talking about.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Yeah, like two objective Game of Thrones.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
You have to make people...

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
You have to bully people into like,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
okay, fine, I fucking subscribe to this.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I'm so tired of hearing about these dragons.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
Yeah, for me, the...

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
The wire was like that.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Oh, God, I mean...

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Oh, you haven't seen the wire?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
I'm gonna watch it just so I don't

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
ever have to hear that sentence.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
HBO's been in that business

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
for decades now, and successfully.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
And it's like, that's not...

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
And all the other networks, they're like,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
oh, we'll make 20 pilots,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
and then we'll, you know,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
90 people will be bad,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
and then the one that's good

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
also, one out of 10,

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
won't make it past six episodes,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and it's like this ridiculous fuck-off

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
like frog eggs being laid,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
knowing that they're all gonna be eaten.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Dan, you should do like an HBO kind of thing,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
a scripted mythological...

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Maybe my child will.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Perhaps that's what I'm gearing up to.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I would like my child to have

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
an overall deal at HBO.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
But that is so interesting,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
because the opposite approach,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
like networks, like you said,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
frog eggs at an HBO,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
they've had like $100 million

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
in the first season of Game of Thrones.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
They would have been out $100 million.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
If they didn't know what they were doing,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
that would be a horrible mistake.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
They did would,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and they ran out of money on debut, right?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
They couldn't finish the season

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
because it was too expensive.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Is that what it was?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Right?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
I thought it was like Milch got busy,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
and like bored.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
I thought that they just like ran out of dough.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
But HBO has dough.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Rome.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Rome?

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
I never saw Rome.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Again there have been

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
some of these television questions

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
answered by entertainment expert

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Spencer crittenden.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Master of Dungeons and

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Television industry gossip.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
I love the way they talk,

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
like when they say on the deadline,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
where they're like fesop,

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
or helver.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.040
Oh my God, I can't read that stuff.

49:30.040 --> 49:30.880
Oh yeah.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.760
It makes me feel so tiny.

49:32.760 --> 49:37.320
Because everything being reduced to this actual industry,

49:37.320 --> 49:39.240
it makes me nervous.

49:39.240 --> 49:41.840
Whenever I'm in a waiting room and I

49:41.840 --> 49:44.760
see the variety on the table, I'm like, ah, fuck.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.800
And I kind of glance at some of the headlines and I go, ah.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.720
It's like walking through a casino.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.120
Like all of a sudden, I don't know.

49:52.120 --> 49:56.560
I got this far by denial of the world around me.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.600
Like I just do what I do.

49:58.600 --> 50:00.240
And then I read these headlines and I go,

50:00.240 --> 50:01.800
I want an overall deal.

50:01.800 --> 50:02.240
Yeah.

50:02.240 --> 50:06.320
I want $11 million from scribe Pen Helm

50:06.320 --> 50:09.560
Laffer, Scripter, Scrippy.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.600
I want to be one of these guys.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.360
I want a photo that doesn't look like I have yellow teeth

50:15.360 --> 50:17.480
and tiny hands.

50:17.480 --> 50:20.640
Some of those you can't control.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.520
My hand size is always going to be like this.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.520
No, I met the other stuff.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.920
Spencer, what do you think about the television industry?

50:27.920 --> 50:31.440
Yeah, Deadwood, too expensive.

50:31.440 --> 50:37.600
No, television industry, it exists.

50:37.600 --> 50:38.680
Jesus Christ, he's high again.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.960
No, I just think that reality shows are bad.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.200
Every time someone watches or every time

50:45.200 --> 50:47.720
anyone mentions a reality show by name,

50:47.720 --> 50:51.080
I always go through this mental process like Jesus Christ,

50:51.080 --> 50:53.280
someone watches reality shows.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.200
Oh yeah, they're very popular.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.680
A lot of people like those.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.400
Jesus Christ, I'm talking to someone

50:58.400 --> 51:00.360
who watches reality shows.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.440
But you're not counting Project Runway, right?

51:03.440 --> 51:04.640
Yeah, I can't.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.480
I mean, I guess.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.240
That was different because it's actual skill merit based.

51:09.240 --> 51:10.600
Those people are trying to be good

51:10.600 --> 51:12.360
and it's usually a pretty positive show.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.600
Aaron just started binge watching Project Runway

51:14.600 --> 51:20.360
and I now know I'm starting to learn about fashion, I think.

51:20.360 --> 51:21.840
Tell me what you know about fashion.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.960
This is what I know.

51:23.960 --> 51:30.480
If your outfit can be compared to a pop cultural reference,

51:30.480 --> 51:31.840
it's bad.

51:31.840 --> 51:35.200
So if a gay man can look at what you're wearing

51:35.200 --> 51:42.080
and reasonably compare it to Pac-Man or Strawberry Shortcake,

51:42.080 --> 51:44.840
if you can say anything while you're looking at it

51:44.840 --> 51:49.240
that makes everyone go, ah, it's sort of like playing

51:49.240 --> 51:51.760
the dozens fashion.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.360
The person comes out and then it's

51:53.360 --> 51:56.120
like the bad outfit is the one that it's

51:56.120 --> 51:59.480
too evocative of like, I don't know.

51:59.480 --> 52:02.640
I'm looking at this, she seems like a housewife from Tron.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.640
Yeah.

52:03.640 --> 52:06.160
And then fucking you're eliminated, you're gone.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.040
It's also interesting.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.920
Every time that one guy, I don't know who the guy is.

52:09.920 --> 52:11.800
I love that Tim Gunn guy.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.600
I don't know why.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.760
Tim Gunn's great.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.160
But then there's the other guy.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.560
I'm gesturing with my hands.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.520
Just do a face.

52:20.520 --> 52:23.080
To mime a giant head.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.040
That's that one guy.

52:24.040 --> 52:26.480
He's the guy that, what's his name?

52:26.480 --> 52:27.040
Michael.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.560
That's Michael Corris.

52:28.560 --> 52:33.760
If he can say that your outfit looks like blank,

52:33.760 --> 52:34.960
then you're fucked.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.040
It's interesting.

52:36.040 --> 52:40.520
Do any of his references go beyond the 80s?

52:40.520 --> 52:43.480
Oh, you hear Game of Thrones sometimes.

52:43.480 --> 52:45.640
I get all of his references.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.680
I always get all of them.

52:47.680 --> 52:49.160
He looks at the thing and goes like,

52:49.160 --> 52:52.840
Malak's like a lucky charm.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.000
Could you do his impression of me coming on stage,

52:55.000 --> 52:56.640
dressed like I'm dressed?

52:56.640 --> 52:58.440
I can't really do an impression of him.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.840
It'll just sound like a homophobic stereotype.

53:01.840 --> 53:03.680
Tim Gunn, I think I was doing pretty good at.

53:03.680 --> 53:04.680
I can't remember.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.480
Give me some Tim Gunn.

53:06.480 --> 53:10.560
Give Kumail the Tim Gunn treatment.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.320
Wait, no, I don't want that.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.440
I just got really nervous.

53:14.440 --> 53:17.440
Five minutes, designers.

53:17.440 --> 53:24.520
I have to tell you, I'm starting to get very concerned.

53:24.520 --> 53:27.640
OK, so this is an average A line.

53:27.640 --> 53:31.880
Is she thin-waisted, your model?

53:31.880 --> 53:33.320
Oh, she's high-waisted.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.880
Well, then you're going to put the shawl on.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.800
Well, that's her relief.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.720
I have to tell you, I'm very excited about this.

53:39.720 --> 53:40.640
Keep going.

53:40.640 --> 53:43.840
Keep doing what you're doing.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.400
He is like that.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.760
It's interesting, because Emily watches that show,

53:49.760 --> 53:51.280
and I was like, fuck this show.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.160
And then I watched like three episodes later.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.280
I'm like, yeah, we know you can drape, Brahmi.

53:55.280 --> 53:59.080
Show us something new.

53:59.080 --> 54:02.840
Like, I know what they're going to say before they say it.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.360
It's also interesting how far down the list being wearable

54:06.360 --> 54:07.880
is in their criteria.

54:07.880 --> 54:10.120
Like, when they say, oh, and that's wearable.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.960
You hear that once every three episodes.

54:11.960 --> 54:16.160
Yeah, it's made out of tires, and the model's holding the hem

54:16.160 --> 54:19.280
because if she lets go, she'll be naked.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.200
I love what you did.

54:20.200 --> 54:20.760
It's bold.

54:20.760 --> 54:21.520
It's dangerous.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.680
It's aggressive.

54:22.680 --> 54:25.560
It's like a total random adjective.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.240
If all they could come up with is random adjectives that

54:28.240 --> 54:29.960
sound like you're describing like a car.

54:29.960 --> 54:30.760
Aggressive.

54:30.760 --> 54:31.760
Yeah.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.120
It's sneaky.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.080
It's suspicious.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.600
It's sworthy.

54:35.600 --> 54:36.720
I love it.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.720
It's dependable.

54:38.720 --> 54:42.840
But if they can say, oh, boy, it looks like Popeye's

54:42.840 --> 54:51.360
going to the spaghetti factory, I mean, I am what I am,

54:51.360 --> 54:52.800
but this is not what I am.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.480
I love that you guys both have girlfriends

55:00.480 --> 55:01.920
or wives watch that show.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.720
It's a great show.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.520
I mean, watching quotes, man.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.240
I'm sitting there.

55:06.240 --> 55:08.000
I'm playing Wolfenstein on my laptop.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.680
Hey, Wolfenstein is pretty good, right?

55:09.680 --> 55:10.400
Yeah, I'm loving it.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.160
Yeah, I've been playing that, too.

55:12.160 --> 55:12.960
It's a fun game.

55:12.960 --> 55:15.640
What's Wolfenstein, baby, Spencer?

55:15.640 --> 55:19.480
No, I don't game on my laptop.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.160
But you're aware of Wolfenstein, I so.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.720
Of course.

55:24.720 --> 55:27.600
It's the premier Nazi shooting game.

55:27.600 --> 55:28.880
That's exactly right.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.280
It's an anti-Nazi game.

55:30.280 --> 55:33.840
What did German people feel like when they buy that game?

55:33.840 --> 55:35.960
The German version actually is kind of different.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.600
They have like not swastikas and stuff.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.360
It's all like censored and stuff.

55:40.360 --> 55:41.000
Are you joking?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.640
Oh, yeah, they hate swastikas over there now.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.520
Yeah, the Nazis have these little eagle

55:45.520 --> 55:47.720
insignias or something like that.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.520
Just because of the actual visual,

55:50.520 --> 55:53.000
like the image of a swastika is like the N-word.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.160
Like it's just a thing that's inflammatory.

55:55.160 --> 55:55.920
Oh, yeah.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.680
It's not like the Germans don't know

55:57.680 --> 55:59.760
that they're watching German soldiers get

55:59.760 --> 56:01.000
knifed in the face.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.600
I think they get it.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.920
And it's such a brutal thing.

56:04.920 --> 56:07.400
Oh, yeah, they get knifed in the face.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.720
Tyler's raising his hand.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.640
I don't know whether it's cultural or actually

56:10.640 --> 56:12.200
to buy a law, but there is something

56:12.200 --> 56:14.520
that's like you aren't allowed to have like swastikas in here.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.960
You know what it's like, I think?

56:15.960 --> 56:18.840
It's like I smoked so much for so many years,

56:18.840 --> 56:19.840
and then I quit.

56:19.840 --> 56:24.520
And now that I, whenever I smell smoke, I get like queasy.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.000
I think that's how they are with swastika.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.480
No, I know that.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.480
Yeah, I know that they smell.

56:29.480 --> 56:31.920
They were like, we were way into it.

56:31.920 --> 56:33.720
That was the mistake.

56:33.720 --> 56:37.160
Oh, yeah, when I drink gin, if I taste gin, I'm like, ugh.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.160
Yeah.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.280
Gin, you're high.

56:39.280 --> 56:39.920
Yeah.

56:39.920 --> 56:43.040
I had a horrible Yeager night, one night, and I can never.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.360
That's how they are with swastika.

56:44.360 --> 56:47.960
I immediately can picture the playground where I puked my guts

56:47.960 --> 56:52.440
out, like I drank a bottle of gin because it was the only thing

56:52.440 --> 56:53.080
in the country.

56:53.080 --> 56:54.160
On a playground?

56:54.160 --> 56:58.800
Well, it wasn't like I wasn't there as a student.

56:58.800 --> 57:00.520
It was a playground in a park near my home.

57:00.520 --> 57:01.520
That's way worse.

57:01.520 --> 57:04.320
You're a grown man drinking gin, looking at children playing.

57:04.320 --> 57:07.920
I was not a grown man, and I wasn't watching children play.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.840
It was night time.

57:09.840 --> 57:10.560
Oh, way better.

57:10.560 --> 57:13.160
It was an abandoned playground.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.320
Night time.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.200
Oh, good.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.040
Where do you want me to go?

57:17.040 --> 57:18.080
The Russian tea room?

57:18.080 --> 57:20.040
Or am I supposed to drink gin when I'm 15?

57:22.720 --> 57:27.280
No, I know the Germans are pulled a 180, for sure.

57:27.280 --> 57:30.400
But I'm saying, I wonder how they feel when they,

57:30.400 --> 57:35.000
because we, meanwhile, we don't, it's kind of a funny thing

57:35.000 --> 57:39.640
in this world of like, hey, watch what you say.

57:39.640 --> 57:41.760
I know how you do it, and this long-standing thing

57:41.760 --> 57:44.480
that's been accepted as a way of expressing ourselves.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.720
Like, let's take a second look at that.

57:46.720 --> 57:49.920
And we're definitely never going to,

57:49.920 --> 57:53.960
you can always just have, you know, just show Nazis

57:53.960 --> 57:56.720
and then just fucking stab them in the eyes

57:56.720 --> 58:00.080
and go like, you fucking Nazi cocksucker, fucking fucker,

58:00.080 --> 58:02.960
you fucking Nazi piece of shit.

58:02.960 --> 58:05.480
Whether it's just a guy taking a pee, like, in this game,

58:05.480 --> 58:09.560
you're just like, you know, I mean, like, they're just soldiers

58:09.560 --> 58:13.880
walking around, like, and there's actual references

58:13.880 --> 58:17.800
to their wives and families, like, it's like a joke

58:17.800 --> 58:20.720
how cruel it is, like, there's, you're listening to them

58:20.720 --> 58:23.000
talk about their, my wife is pregnant.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.320
Yeah, like, this is just a job for me,

58:24.320 --> 58:26.320
I haven't actually killed anybody.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.560
And then you fucking like, slit their throat

58:28.560 --> 58:31.800
and like, drink their blood because, you know, they're Nazis.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.840
And I just, I just picture like a German 16-year-old

58:35.840 --> 58:38.840
buying the game and being like, man, I have a fucking hand.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.840
I didn't even know what any of this is about, man.

58:40.840 --> 58:43.960
I was like, yeah, I really got handed a fucking,

58:43.960 --> 58:47.160
shit, a fucking lot of karma.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.560
There's a lot of baggage.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.760
It must be so fucking weird to...

58:51.760 --> 58:53.160
It's also interesting that in games

58:53.160 --> 58:54.440
when they want to be super violent,

58:54.440 --> 58:56.200
they just make the bad guys Nazis

58:56.200 --> 58:58.000
because then you can do anything to them

58:58.000 --> 58:59.640
and everyone's kind of on board.

58:59.640 --> 59:03.840
I mean, is it, is it, is it, is it trite or inflammatory

59:03.840 --> 59:07.480
to point out that that's a very Nazi-istic way

59:07.480 --> 59:12.480
of dealing with our, our feelings about things?

59:12.560 --> 59:14.880
Like, that you pick a scapegoat and you...

59:14.880 --> 59:18.000
Yeah, you make them the other and then you fucking murder them.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.400
Like, British people or Russians

59:21.400 --> 59:22.880
are always our bad guys in films

59:22.880 --> 59:25.920
because they're, they're, they're our, the other, our foe.

59:25.920 --> 59:27.800
Like, yeah, our xenophobic bullshit.

59:27.800 --> 59:32.800
Like, Germany, like, when the Nazi party came to power,

59:34.160 --> 59:35.800
they didn't have the majority.

59:35.800 --> 59:38.120
They got, they got like a lot of the vote

59:38.120 --> 59:41.120
and Hitler became the chancellor.

59:41.120 --> 59:42.760
A lot of people didn't like the Nazi party.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.640
When they became powerful,

59:44.640 --> 59:48.280
there was the SA and the SD and this police force

59:48.280 --> 59:49.880
that if you didn't like them,

59:49.880 --> 59:52.520
you were sent to a fucking concentration camp.

59:52.520 --> 59:56.440
And if you're intellectual, if you were smart, Jewish, gay,

59:56.440 --> 59:58.560
like lots of other interesting things,

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.920
you were simply pushed away.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.680
Most of Germany, like most of Europe at that time,

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.000
were very anti-Semitic.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.560
Like, there was lots of countries.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.800
Oh, sure, yeah.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.560
Like, like Jews weren't welcome in most countries back then.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.680
That's fucking terrifying, man.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.240
When you were in the history, high school history books,

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.760
like they always just, you know, they throw that aside.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.280
Like, it's always just this formula with dictatorships

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.240
is that, is that that stage where they round up

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.720
the intellectuals, they round up the doctors

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.880
and the, like everyone in this room is fucking dead.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.840
Yeah, that's a, like if some shit goes down

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.920
in this country, like if the economy collapses

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.600
and then there's like this, you know,

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.960
this is what happens, like economic turmoil

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.560
is the potting soil for fascism.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.320
Because some guy in a uniform is gonna come out

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.240
and he's gonna tell everybody in the mainstream

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.080
that they're gonna be safe as long as we make

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.920
our new business blowing shit up.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.760
Yeah.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.160
And that is exactly what happens over and over and over again.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.800
And then I'm gone.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.640
I'm in the first fucking bus out.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.840
For whatever reason in my head,

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.840
and you guys know our Jeff Fox where these,

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.560
you might be a retina.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.680
I mean, just in my head, I was like,

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.320
you might be a dictator, like if you're rounding up

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.200
all the intellectuals, you might be a dictator.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.200
If you think reason is a reasonable thing,

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.240
you might be a dictator.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.080
You might be a dictator.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.880
Also, they called it fascism,

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.640
they called it dictatorships and people were cool with that.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.960
Like, that was a thing.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960
Well, but that wasn't a bad-

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.800
It was an absolute back then.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.040
That wasn't a bad word then.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.760
Also, women, absolutely marginalized.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760
Women were simply-

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.000
Stop trying to get laid.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.960
Stop trying to make my feminism about me getting laid.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.920
The misogynist code,

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.080
jeez, now you're calling yourself a feminist,

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.920
you really are trying to get laid.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.480
It's also like, there was some fucking,

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.120
fucking fuck wit on the internet that said it,

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.440
because like-

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.560
This is like a fucking Andy Rooney rant right now.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.320
Somebody said like, Jeff hates men.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.840
They're like, no, I said a nice thing about women,

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.320
and that's me being like anti-men,

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.120
like, that's fucked up.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.960
Like, men need to grow the fuck up

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.960
and start, like, I'm not trying to be sexy,

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.520
I'm not trying to get laid by men.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.280
I'm not trying to be sexy.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.800
This shit comes naturally.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.280
This is just how I am, man.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.560
You're the saginist asshole.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.640
I just make feminism look good.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.680
Also, there should be more women in our show.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.520
How about that?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.360
There should be a-

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.080
What do you think about this?

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:45.920
Three fucking-

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.800
I agree.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.640
Women.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.480
Yay.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.760
No, it's, Jeff, you were like,

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.640
there was a tragic shooting not too long ago,

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.920
but Jeff's like,

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.200
there's a guy who says, I hate men.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.440
That's fucked up.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.600
Yeah.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.560
That's what's fucked up.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560
Incredibly fucked up.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.320
We live in a world where women aren't people,

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.320
they're objects first and people second,

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.600
so that's fucking crazy.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.120
It's absolutely crazy.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.120
I like your thing that I do

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.680
if we're gonna, like, disagree with you.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.520
No.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520
I don't know, man.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.360
Maybe they should be.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.680
But that, hey, that's absolutely-

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.320
I know, I hear what you're saying.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.160
I like the idea of-

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.760
Let me play devil's advocate here.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.520
I'm not trying to be provocative.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.120
I'll just say, it's the case,

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.280
that's a fucking-

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.960
I like the idea of going with that thought

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.720
and seeing how long you can go with it

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.920
until the women stop clapping

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.400
because you would be like,

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.680
we live in a world where women are objects first,

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.280
they're animals, they're pieces of shit,

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.600
they're human garbage.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.440
No one gives a fuck about women.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.800
You see what he's doing?

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.040
Ladies, you see what he's doing, man.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.960
And you just keep going until the women are like,

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960
they would be like, yay, yay.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.480
And then after a while, they're like, wait, wait a minute.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.760
He's thought about this too much.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.120
This feels prepared.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.280
How many women does it take

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.360
to screw a lightbulb for God's sake?

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.200
You were doing exactly what I was talking about.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.400
As a feminist, I wonder why it's three instead of one.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.400
That's not even a thing people say, Dan.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.520
You're just naturally being misogynist right now.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.920
It's a natural thing.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.280
As with alcoholism and racism,

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.640
I will agree first so that people stop accusing me.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.640
I know, conversations about whether you're an ism,

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.720
the big secret is fucking say yes, I am.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.760
And then it's done.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.040
Because then what are they gonna do?

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.920
Help you?

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.520
They're not putting in that elbow grease.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.320
You're racist, you're racist.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.720
Okay, I'm racist.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.840
What are we gonna do about this?

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.160
You're racist.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.600
And I am going over there for a drink

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.680
to tell other people that you're racist.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.960
That's the approach like Jennifer Lawrence, who's awesome,

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.600
who was in like a ton of stuff coming out.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.160
And before she was like,

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.560
there's gonna be a backlash soon

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.920
and it's just gonna be fine.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920
And then because she said that,

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.280
people were like, well, now we can't do the backlash

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.000
because you told us that's what we were gonna do.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.040
It's the best thing to do.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.920
You think what I'm like with like, yep, you're right.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.080
Let's bring up race and gender expert, Demorge Brown.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:26.920
Yeah.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.760
Yeah.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.600
Yeah.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.440
Yeah.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.280
Yeah.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.120
Yeah.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:31.960
Yeah.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.800
Yeah.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.040
And soccer expert.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.560
Demorge.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.600
Hello, this is surprising.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.920
When did you get that arsenal shirt, sweater,

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.120
whatever you, what is it?

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.960
This is from two years ago.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.800
Where did they come in?

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.640
Fourth?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.480
This year, fourth.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.800
Fourth place.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.000
They won the cup last week, but they did.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Jeff and Demorge had to talk about soccer.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.680
How did they win the cup last week

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.880
and then this week, they're fourth?

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.000
The league, they were fourth.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.080
The cup is a separate tournament.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.640
Where all the teams in England play each other

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.280
over the course of the season.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.200
The FA Cup?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.040
FA Cup, yeah.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.720
And you can't use your hands?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.320
Demorge, tell them why.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.360
So what is this?

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.840
This is like the teleports or anything.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840
What are they doing?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840
Are there bats?

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.520
Wait, what?

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.000
What do you say?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.360
It's not cricket.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.200
I do like cricket.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.240
Do you watch the Madrid, the Champions League?

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.240
I watched that yesterday on the patio of La Cita

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.560
with, there was no English being spoken.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.280
There was a lot of Asada being grilled.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.120
People were screaming.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.120
They were up and down.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.320
And when Madrid won in overtime, I think I was lifted over

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.000
like five people's heads.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.600
You were?

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.160
I was hot like a beach ball, yeah.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.200
They were that happy.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.320
But why you?

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.400
Because I was there.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.600
I didn't lift anybody, but everybody got lifted at a certain

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.440
point.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.720
Jesus, that's terrifying.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.760
I'm going to a Dodgers game next week.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.000
The Kettle One Alliance invited me.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:02.840
Did they really?

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.280
And they sent me a new backpack.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.200
Oh, it's in the trunk of my car.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.600
Oh, thank you.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600
I have it in the trunk of my car.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.480
And I registered the tracking chip.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.720
So I know it's in the trunk of your car.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.120
My car is being followed right now?

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.200
By the Kettle One Alliance.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.080
Oh, god damn it.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.080
They're not good drivers.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.680
I want it out of my car immediately.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.480
Does Burnett have an alliance?

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.760
If Burnett did have an alliance, I would be the fucking

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.200
ambassador for it.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.120
All right, who brought this?

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.480
Or Rafael?

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.360
Rafael, he's lovely.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.960
More Fernette Brogher.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.160
When's DeMorge going to get his Silicon Valley?

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.400
That's what I want to know.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.920
This guy's been working his ass off.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.920
DeMorge is a Channel 101 alumni, alumnus.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:58.000
Go to channel101.com and watch the award-winning record

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.160
setting show, Gumball.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.000
And DeMorge, you're the perennial best actor and best

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.800
supporting actor, everything on Channel 101.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.040
That's just for two years.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.160
Three years, something like that.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.400
It's been there for 10 years, though.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.360
I will say 101 has been a great thing because.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.360
Can I say that your hair is becoming more and more

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.960
magnificent as days go by?

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.760
I want that hair.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.280
Cool.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.280
You.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.360
I want to wake up tomorrow with your hair.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.360
I'm going to cut it off.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:24.840
For real?

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.360
And I'll give it to you.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:25.880
No.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.640
At the end of the month.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.240
Don't cut it off.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.880
Mike Bush is doing a show that he did at Bridgetown at the

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.680
end of the month.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.680
And I play Cornell West.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.360
And that's the only reason I haven't cut it yet.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360
That's why I'm keeping the Cornell West hair.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.080
Dude, so now people just have you do the Cornell West

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.400
impression, like just, is that getting annoying or?

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.280
It's not a, because it's not, it's just a, it's, it's.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.960
It's just a character, it's not a discussion.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.600
Yeah, it's like, I kind of write out bullet points.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.880
And then it's more physical than it is memorized speech.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.440
Kind of just jump out and wave my arms around widely.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.440
I can't ask you to do Cornell West.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.360
I can do Barak as a voice, but I can't do it.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360
You can do Barak?

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.600
Yeah, sure.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.320
Barak Hussain?

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Easy.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880
Easy.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.640
What?

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.480
That's his name.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480
Camille?

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:27.000
If, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if I may be so bold as

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.160
to call you Camille, you're a great citizen.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:39.040
And, and, and what, what I want to get to is something

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.280
emblematic in, in, in, in young people and good folks all

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.440
across this country.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.160
Something emblematic in good people and good folks.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.640
That was so good, I almost teared up.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.040
That's the episode title right now.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.280
Something emblematic.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.320
It reminded me of why I voted for him, because I was so

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.440
relieved that a president, I could understand every sentence

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.400
he was saying.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.440
He could, you, like, like Bush couldn't summon the word

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.600
emblematic.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.320
All politicians are parasitic pieces of shit.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.920
And Obama speaks and says nothing.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.560
But, but God, he can speak.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.040
It's such a fucking relief.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.120
Yeah, he has a command of the English language, which is

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.560
magical.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560
So gorgeous.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.920
Folksy sometimes, too, though, when he talks to people and

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.960
talks about anecdotes and things.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.600
So he can downplay it, just like Bush used to go places and

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.440
all of a sudden have a twang in his voice that he didn't

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.880
have the day before.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.960
Yeah, Spencer, what do you think about race,

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.040
politics, Obama, or gender and the TV industry?

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.960
I'm pro all those things.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.160
Well, why don't we, what a bold stance.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.240
Yeah, I'm a hero.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.520
Spencer, can we include DeMorge into, like, an NPC

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.200
character?

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.600
Well, I thought if you could play Aaron's character.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.280
Oh.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.760
Yeah, I mean, sweet.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.120
Wait, so we have my eye on the road ahead.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.560
What's happening?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.480
We rail against gender inequality, then we get a dude to

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.840
play a woman.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.760
But he's a black piece.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.600
He's black.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.280
That's right.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.280
That's right.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.760
He's black.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.080
Tristar Pictures presents.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.560
He's black.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.280
Weekend at DeMorge is two.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.840
Yeah, I'm calling him black.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.920
Somebody called me one time.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.400
They're like, you're not going to believe this.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.440
We were all laughing like crazy last night.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.000
We were hanging around, Dan, and he just kept saying, black

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.360
people.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.880
Wait, I have no reason.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.600
Last night?

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.560
No, no, this is a while ago.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.880
Oh, OK.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.720
Black people.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.960
I love the phrase black people.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.600
I think it's so funny.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.760
Because it's so weird.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.680
Like, it's so ticklish.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.760
It's not inherently offensive.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.000
But it sounds so fucking weird.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.880
It's just such a weird thing to say.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.720
It's so juvenile.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.360
It's like you're like action figures.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.400
Like, where are my black people?

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.040
Like, I don't know.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.480
It's just something so weird about it.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.680
Leg, leg, leg.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.560
Black people.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.320
Wrapping strong.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.960
Wrapping all day long.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.840
It's racist to connotate black with rap.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.720
Not going to do it.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.320
Sit in my lyrical lap.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.680
I'm Dan Harmon wrapping up a storm.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.280
Fuck your mama like Cheers was Norm.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.600
Fuck your mama.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.960
Fuck Osama.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.360
Fuck Obama.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.440
Obama.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.800
Breakdown.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.880
Oh, look.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.960
Here's the thing.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.360
We're going to pull up a ring.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.800
I bought a ring for my wife, Michelle.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.600
I bought a dog.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.720
And I tried to sell him.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.040
But we wanted another dog.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.800
So we brought him out onto the lawn.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.160
We got the exact same one.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.080
We actually cloned it.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.720
It's a full experiment.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.440
You know, folks, you have to understand.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.360
If we don't advance the science as further,

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.520
I'm proposing internships for students all across this nation.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.880
If you want to volunteer, if you want to go to Namibia,

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.920
if you want to go to Ghana, if you

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.320
want to go to Lisbon or Lisboa, is to call it there.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.520
Languages are important.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.040
You have to speak forward and backward.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.960
You have to want to believe.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.040
Because this moment, this shining moment, in this time,

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.360
in this hour, yeah, yeah.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.120
That was Obama rapping in the middle of my rap.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:28.920
That was the best.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.400
Black people.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.360
Black people.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360
Black people.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.240
Yeah!

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.160
That must have been in my 20s, I was still yelling out

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.880
at the top of my lungs, black people.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.360
That must have been an old, I did not understand the world

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:46.880
yet.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.000
It's like a graphic novel.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Entertaining myself.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.480
He's black!

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.240
I remember we used to freestyle at parties,

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.360
and I would fucking, I was very liberal with my use

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.200
of the n-word.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.640
And I can't stop it.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.440
D-Morgen always walked by right when you said it.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.520
And I was saying it a lot.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.320
I was casting a white net.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.840
But then D-Morgen walked by on the red solo cup,

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.120
and it was just, it wasn't like.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120
Why did it have to be a red solo?

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.480
It wasn't like you were, it was just,

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.320
I just always felt so fucking bad,

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.440
because it would be like, ah man,

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.160
he's still doing it over here in the corner.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.400
He's still, still just yelling out the,

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.120
I would just stand in the corner and people would go,

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:29.280
now, now, cross, now.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.520
He's gonna say it, now, go.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.000
Yeah.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.160
Dan Merle with a hand signal.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.080
He just said figure, so go now.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.960
He's gonna rhyme that.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.560
All right, Spencer, did you, did you,

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.800
did you come prepared to do any role-playing with us,

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.240
or did you just want to hang out and chat

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.720
about entertainment gossip and fashion?

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.880
Reality TV?

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.480
I really did just want to talk about some fashion gossip.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.320
All right.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:59.440
Can you believe what Kim was wearing at her wedding?

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.120
I mean, you knew it was never gonna be classy, but.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:04.960
No, I don't know.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.480
I was concerned, I thought,

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.480
I was looking at the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.040
Oh, are you talking about young Smith,

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.800
who was dressed all in a white Batman costume?

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.000
He looked a bit like a Stay Puff Marshmallow Man.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.440
I think he's truly a monster.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.040
I really think he, who?

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.480
The young Jayden Smith, he was at the wedding,

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.120
and he was wearing an all-white, all-pure white Batman costume.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.920
Like a full mask, like, you know what,

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.400
it's the wedding and it's their day,

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.520
he shows up as the son of Will Smith

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.520
in a white Batman costume.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.360
No.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.440
That's, that sounds awesome, though.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.720
How old is he, though?

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.240
He's like, he's a grown man now.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.000
Yeah, he's, how old is he?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.560
He knows better, or even if he's four,

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.360
the parents should be like, no, it's their day.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.840
Well, it's the parent, but it's the thing,

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.200
if the parent said, let's go to the Batman store

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.880
and get you fitted out.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.200
Yeah, so how old is he?

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.040
That's what's important.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.520
I bet he's like 16, right?

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.360
Oh, that's fine.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.320
Then he went to his dad and said,

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.760
I want to be Batman at the wedding,

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.320
and he's like, well, 16 is fine?

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.520
Well, fine for dressing like Batman at a wedding?

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.680
Yeah.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.160
16?

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.000
Well, when?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.800
16 year olds are doing amazing things.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.600
16 year olds have grown up.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.240
I think that dressing like Batman at a wedding

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.600
is an amazing thing.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.160
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.120
You know what's weird?

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.560
You just convinced me.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.920
Now I'm like, Jane is awesome.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.920
I don't think he was trying to draw focus.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.000
Why do I even have an opinion about this?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.240
You don't think he was trying to draw focus at a wedding

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.840
in a complete white Batman,

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.120
it's not just a regular Batman outfit.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.320
That wouldn't have been enough.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.320
He had a cowl?

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.600
Yeah, he had a cowl.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.160
I think that's awesome.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.160
I think that sounds awesome.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.240
I want to see a white Batman costume.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.880
You seeing a picture of it right now?

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.080
Well, that looks creepy.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.960
This is a black and white photo someone's showing me

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.800
and it just looks like.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.640
No, that's just Jane.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.960
He looks like a Mexican wrestler.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.800
Black people.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.000
Hey, he's black.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.640
Rochester.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.480
Wait, what?

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.040
Yeah, look at how he looks.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.200
Jesus Christ.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.040
That's what he looks like.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.400
It's a white.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.240
Oh my God.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.680
It doesn't look as cool.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.400
I thought I pictured body armor.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.920
It's raw asparagus.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.360
Wow.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.960
A villain in a BET commercial.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:31.800
A BET show.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.400
All right.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.360
So, who's wedding was this, Spencer?

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.400
It was the Kimye wedding in Florence.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.240
Wait, they're not married?

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.200
They just got married?

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.040
I don't know.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.360
Probably.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.560
Hey, what do you think made Solange get so mad

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.720
in that elevator?

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.920
Oh, Spencer.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.200
I just had a good, they're like,

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.640
you cannot let him wear a white Batman costume.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.240
Jay-Z?

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.080
Yeah.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.040
Oh, okay.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.720
Because, you know, Jay didn't call the head.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.920
Jay-Z was fine with it.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.560
We were there in that hotel, the standard.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.400
Oh, really?

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.720
That's why Aaron brought that up.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.800
Like, do you know anything about this?

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.720
It's like, oh, we're in the elevator

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.440
where Solange tried to kick Jay-Z.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.280
Oh, wow.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.960
And I like to frustrate Aaron

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.720
by having really specific opinions

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.960
about pop culture things.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.800
Yeah.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.720
And to make making her meet me on logical ground

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.440
about the stuff until she finally goes like,

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.280
would you, you don't even know these people and I go,

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.840
exactly, what are we doing?

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.840
Why are we talking about why these people do anything?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.720
Did you know that Seal married Heidi Klum at one point?

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.320
I just found that out last night.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.720
They were married forever.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.560
I know.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.400
Oh, wow.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.240
They were like a couple.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.880
And he proposed to her on an iceberg, I heard.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:50.720
What?

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.560
Yeah, the helicopter.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.400
Is that a seal joke?

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.120
I don't know if it's an iceberg.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.880
Is he just doing a seal joke?

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.440
Wait, was that a joke you made,

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.760
or is that really what you heard?

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.080
The iceberg thing I heard.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.200
I heard they went clubbing afterwards, hang on.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.040
Oh.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.400
I'm sorry.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.920
Don't apologize to me.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.840
Spencer, take it away.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.680
It's okay.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.520
What?

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.040
Someone will explain to Demorge what we're doing

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:17.880
at some point.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.200
D&D.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.160
Are we doing D&D?

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.000
Yes.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.200
We're doing fucking D&D.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.520
Certainly sounds wrong.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.920
Give Mulraine to Demorge.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.480
Demorge, you're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.760
Have you ever played it before?

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.320
A long time ago.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.240
Nice.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.440
This is your character sheet.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.120
I never read mine either, don't worry about it.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:37.960
Okay.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.800
You're Aaron McAthage's character.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.200
He's a jumping off point.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.720
He's a jumping off point.

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.160
Last time on Heartin' Town,

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.760
after recovering from curses and evading law enforcement,

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.600
our heroes had found themselves

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.840
in a Bill Martigan's bathroom.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.320
There they relieved themselves

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.560
and met with Flizdam, a scared but friendly chap.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.000
And after calming him down,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.160
he revealed he was a member of a secret order,

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.400
the Seekers of Paradise,

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.080
and took our heroes to meet with this order.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.800
After a tense introduction.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.240
Charles Hoffman revealed an ancient relic

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.000
recovered from ruins.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.280
Quark heartily activated the relic by pressing red

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.120
and opened a deadly and consuming vortex

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.960
that sucked our party to the magical Isle of Paradise.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.800
There they met Yomiji, the guardian over Paradise,

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.040
who demanded our heroes determine their worth

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.200
by telling a joke.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.360
And Quark did so and told a great joke.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.920
But would it cause Yomiji to raffle as Ayo?

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.000
Let's find out.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I guess strictly speaking, it did already.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
In the past, last time on Heartin' Town.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
He chuckled, he was chuckling, and he said,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
that's a nice joke.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Yeah, he did do that.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
All right, so...

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So, are we in the Isle of Paradise?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You stand in the unfiltered sunlight

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
on the floating Isle of Paradise.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Green, green, green, green, green, green.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You stand in the unfiltered sunlight

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
on the floating Isle of Paradise.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Green grass and gorgeous flowers and plants

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
all in bloom coat the island,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
which is bordered by fluffy white clouds adrift in the sky.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
You feel life and vibrance all around you,

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and hear the rolling laughter of the massive angel

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
rolling around on the ground.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
He finishes laughing and gets up and grabs his flaming shovel.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
He lights a cigarette and starts smoking it.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
You know where the Tarragon of Virtue is?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
That's our objective, Tarragon of Virtue.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
We're looking for it.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Yeah, yeah, you guys seem pretty worthy.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Ah, this is a good joke, man, this is a good joke, man.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yeah.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
What was the joke?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
The Welder's Mask.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The what?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I'll tell it, I'll tell it.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
What was the joke?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Sharpie, Sharpie, tell the Welder's Mask.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
His kid finds a Welder's Mask,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
and then he's like walking around with it,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
and he's like, ah, what an interesting Welder's Mask.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And then a pickup truck comes by,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
and the pickup driver says...

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Why is there a pickup truck?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's just a guy in a car.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But he's painting a specific picture.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
D'Morge has a red solo cup.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
This is a pickup truck.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And he goes like, hey kid, do you want to ride?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And the kid goes like, flips up the Welder's Mask,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
goes, ah, yeah, sure, I could use a ride.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
The Welder's Mask is heavy, so...

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Even though I walked this far,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
now I'm encumbered.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So, gets in the car, truck, van,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and they start driving,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
and the driver says, hey kid,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
do you like...

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
That's my fault.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Hey kid, do you like candy?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
The kid flips up the Mask, and it's like,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I like candy, it's like,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
flips the Mask down.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
This is a joke, you know?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I told it right.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The driver says, hey kid, do you know

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
what Felatio is?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
How old is this kid?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
The kid flips up the Mask, and he's like six.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And he says,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
no, no, no, I don't,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
flips the Mask down.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And then the driver says, hey kid,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
do you know what

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
asotomy is?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And the kid flips the Mask up,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
and says,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
and the driver says, hey kid,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
do you know what a pedophile is?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And the kid flips up the Mask,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
exasperated, and says, look, I've got to be honest with you, sir,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'm not a real welder.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Eh? Eh?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Pretty good.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
He has to keep flipping the Mask up and down, right?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Isn't that a thing?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
No, I like that.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
It has to work in threes.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
You made it work in fours.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So what happens with this kid at the end?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm worried, because that kid is still with the pedophile.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
The kid wins.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I like it just work.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
The kid wins, this guy's like, oh, this kid.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Oh, you're not a real welder.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And then he drops him off.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Is that how it ends? He just wants to fuck kid welders?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
He says, mister, I've got to be honest with you,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I'm not really a welder.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
The end, the guy goes, okay.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
For the kid?

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
No, yeah, for everybody.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Not for everybody.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
The kid wins.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
That is the kid wins.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Yeah, how does the kid win?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
The kid wins by being guileless.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
The kid gets a chuckle in before he's taken back

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
to a basement later.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I like the thing, the guy goes, oh, but I'll tell you why.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I've been outsmarted.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I'll drop you off here.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I've been outsmarted.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
He's not outsmarted.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
He's been out-domed.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah, same thing.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So the guy's not turned on by the kid anymore?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000
No, because he wanted to fuck a welder.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
He wanted a welder?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
He doesn't like kids.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
He wanted to fuck a welder.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
And the kid says, sir, you're off the hook.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I'm not a welder.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So it turns out the guy really was on the prowl for a child welder.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
He wanted to fuck a young welder.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I like to think that it was just any welder,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
and it was kind of hurting him that it was a kid,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
because he knows it's wrong.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
The kid didn't know what Felicia inside of me was.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Oh, I'm going to have to peach this kid.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I'm confused about the part where he asks him

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
who knows what a pedophile is.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Why is he asking any answer to that question

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
that's going to benefit the guy?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
He's saying, let's put our cars in the table.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So do you think he was hoping the kid would say,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I do know what one is, and I'm into it?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Not only do I know what a pedophile is,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I'm all for it.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And he goes, good.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
But what kind of kid that's into pedophiles doesn't know what Felicia is?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
A welder.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Alright, alright, come on now.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Sorry Spencer.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
No, I'm having a great time.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I just think the joke's a real bummer.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You leave the world, you pull,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
your camera pulls out of that truck, pickup truck van.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Why is the truck is a cart?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I always pictured it as an orange pickup truck.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
That makes you rapey.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
With propane tanks in the bag.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Why?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Because he's got a day job.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
He's going to get his propane tanks refilled,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:01.000
and a successful pedophile doesn't put all his eggs in Pedophilia's basket.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It's not a job.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
He's going to make it a side mission,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
like in Grand Theft Auto.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It's like a bonus mission.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
He's got an A story going on.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
He's got a whole, he's getting married in June.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I don't know, I think if you're a pedophile, that is your A story.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Well, I mean, it'll all be revealed in my new movie, Daedalus.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Daedalus?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Daedalus.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
You flew too close to the sun?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Yeah.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I'm a guy.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Oh my god.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Oh wow, Jesus Christ.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
To the sun of a guy.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Daedalus.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Does this joke going to make sense to people outside this room?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I don't think anybody likes it, but Daedalus,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000
about a pedophile who flew too close to the sun of a guy.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Too close to his neighbor's son.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
All right, so Spencer.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000
We just became the writing staff for Hustler Magazine.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We can write a Hustler cartoon now.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Spencer, I asked Flisdame, is Flisdame the guy we're talking to right now?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
No, you're talking to Yomiji, the guardian of paradise.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Oh shit, Yomiji.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Yomiji?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
What?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Yomiji?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
What up?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
We seek the pterogon of virtue.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
You got some?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Oh yeah, man.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
We got all sorts of shit, man.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We got bacon bush, we got liquor vines, dragon whisper, utopia fruit,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
potion potatoes, miracle clover.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Can I go back to bacon bush?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Yeah, bacon bush.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Yeah, man.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Because there could be a couple different kinds of bush.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
We must have met before in like the last episode or something,

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
but I've never met you, Christopher.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
What's up, dude?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
What's up, dude?

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Hey, Chris.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Nice to meet you.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
What's your deal?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You look fucked up.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
He wrote Lady and Red.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Oh, also he's...

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Oh yeah, he's cursed.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Oh, he's cursed.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I've been cursed for a while.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
You look all evil.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Yeah.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Yeah, he keeps trying to kill us and barf on people.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
That's why we need the pterogon.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
How do we fix this?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
It was a good joke.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Yeah, well the pterogon of virtue, I assume.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I'm not much into cooking.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I'm gonna be honest.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But I love bacon.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Bacon bush?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Bacon bushin'.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Bacon bushin'.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
What is it?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
What is what?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
What is bacon bush?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It's bacon on a bush.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
It grows?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Is the whole bush...

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Bacon grows out of the bush?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Yeah, baby, check it out.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
He reaches into a bush and pulls out cooked bacon.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Whoa!

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Magic motherfuckers!

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
But this is pig meat.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It's meat from a pig, and it grows out of a bush?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yeah.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Magic motherfuckers!

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Did a pig die to make this?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
No.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Well, probably for the wizard who invented bacon bush,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
that probably killed a lot of pigs, I'd imagine.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But now, that's passed.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Is there an eggplant?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Mmm, like a tree?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I think there might be.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Just like a breakfast tree?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
There's a breakfast cocktail tree.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Yeah, it's spliced together.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
But do you have pterogon of virtue?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Yeah, yeah, that sounds familiar.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
It's the leafy one, right?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Yeah.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Yeah.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
You have it.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
We got it.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
You totally have it.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Can we have it?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
It looks like, though.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
We came all the way to the fucking Isle of Paradise.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Cool, your role.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Little gnome one.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Honestly, if I had a bunch of stuff and one of the things was bacon bush,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I'm not going to look at anything.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You're cursed, Christopher.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You don't fucking know what you're talking about.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
What's your name again?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I'm sorry.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yomiji.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Yomiji, we came up to the fucking Isle of Paradise

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
because we wanted the pterogon of virtue.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Word.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
All right.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Do you have it or not?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Paradise has it, man.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I just guard this ship.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Do you know anybody who has it?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I just work here, man.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
How do we get it?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It's on the Isle.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
This is all around you.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
You said you just work here.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
That's exactly the guy we were talking to.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
We get stuff.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
That's a good point.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Can't argue that logic.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
You work here?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Yeah.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I don't sell the stuff.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I just guard it, man.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Can we talk to your manager?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
There is no manager.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
There's no bureaucracy.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
It's paradise.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It's got to be guarded.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I guard it.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
All right.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Well, I'm going to walk in a random direction, Mr. Yomiji.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Good call.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Yeah, let's go around looking for the pterogon.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I pick up a blade of egg grass,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and I let it point in a direction.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I demarcate one of the ends as the pointing end,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and then I let it fall, and then I follow the direction that it points.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
It points towards Charles Hoffman,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000
who stands cradling and exploded in gnome.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Well, let's spin again.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Who's Charles Hoffman?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I don't know.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Such senseless death.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I go over to Charles Hoffman.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I'm assuming the game version of me isn't an alcoholic

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
and can remember who he is?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Probably.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
He's the leader of the seekers of paradise.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Is he the guy whose bathroom I shit in?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
No.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
What happens?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Charles, we're here.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Yeah.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
That's...

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Yeah.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
One step forward, dot, dot, dot, as Springsteen said.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
We could have never guessed that that would happen

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
when you pressed that red button.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
You know, we dabbled in God's domain,

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
and we got a warning shot across our bow,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
but the important thing is to move on

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and get this tarragon of virtue.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
What do you say?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
That sounds good.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
You think you know where it might be around here?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Have you ever been around here?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
No, I haven't.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I just keep walking past him.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I just keep walking in that direction.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Yeah, we follow you.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
See you later, man.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Sorry.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
You walk away as he's talking.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
And you just go.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Where do you go?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I'm just walking in that direction.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I'm marching.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
You come up to a tree.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It looks like a massive tree.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It's just an apple tree.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I shoot laser beams at the back of Quark's head.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
God damn it.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Why?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Because I'm evil.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Yeah, he's a curse.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
He's a curse.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Oh, sorry about that.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Did that hurt?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Don't I have a mobility or a trap sense?

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Laser beams aren't a trap.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Yeah.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You take nine damage.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Sorry.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Whoa.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Sorry about what?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Why are we helping this guy?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
He's an asshole.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
No, I'm a nice guy.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I'm just cursed.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I got nine damage, you piece of shit.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I puked on him.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I used my numb.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
That doesn't do any damage.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It's just true.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
We could just kill him and then like this.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Whoa.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
No.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Yeah, because it would save us a lot of trouble.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Listen, we're here.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Why do you fucking shot me with this?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I know.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And I feel horrible.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Well, not, yeah.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yeah, hindsight.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
20, 20.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I feel horrible.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I do a, I don't know.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I'm a gnome.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I look around there.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I just sniff out where I think that the pteragon of virtue might be.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I sniff out the smell of pteragon.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
You sniff with your gnome-ish nose.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And you sniff out a strange scent.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But it, uh, it smells rather bad to be honest.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It's a foul odor.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It kind of overtakes everything.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Sorry.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000
It smells, it smells like a plant, but not good.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Not like pteragon?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Not like pteragon.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Oh, shit.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Pteragon smells bad.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I wouldn't say not normal pteragon.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I think that smells just fine.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Does anybody have knowledge of nature, anything like that, and their skill?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
No.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
DeMorge you.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I'm a half-elf.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Does Mulrainee have-

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Mulrainee does.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
She's a ranger.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Mulrainee.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Look under your skills on the front page where your name's on it.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
See if knowledge, parenthesis-

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Knowledge of nature.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Knowledge of nature.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
He's got it.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Oh, I have knowledge of nature.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Nine.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
It's all coming back to me now.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
All right.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Well, now we're off to the races.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I have knowledge of nature, and I'm looking around this wooded glade, and I say pteragon

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
would grow where the natural loam is.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
So what you smell if that is loam at the edge of that loam, I think there might be pteragon

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
and other herbs.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Nice.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And we should proceed another-

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
If this works out, I'm going to be stoked.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Don't shoot me.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
No.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
It's not my call.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I'll stay behind you.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It might happen, but it won't be behind you at all.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I'm not saying it's going to happen, but if it does, it won't be my fault.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Are you cool with that?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
He's cursed.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I have a whisper bow.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
No, don't attack me.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm just saying.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
You attacked me.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Yeah, I know.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I feel horrible about it.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
See?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I don't think you do.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
You seem pretty cool.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
No, I'm like really bummed about it.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Oh, that was a horrible thing.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Anyway, let's go.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
We're marching.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Let's go to the loam.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I'm going to get you, Christopher.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I'm going to get you.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So you look to the edge of the loam and there you see a small row of five to seven tender,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
narrow shoots, scabbing up out of the loam edge.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Shoot.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Shoot.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Shoot.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Shoot.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Shoot.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
All right.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I charge headlong towards the shoots.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
You do that.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
You arrive there.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I sniff the shoots.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
They smell, they smell just fine.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Like Tarragon, a virtue.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I take out one of my knives and I harvest them.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
You harvest the shoots.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
And I feed them to Christopher and I shove them down his throat.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Well, okay.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Is this a good idea?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Hold on.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Let's talk about this for one second.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
You're in no place to fucking negotiate right now.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Do you think it's a good idea to do we prepare them maybe?

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Is it like you have to cook them or do you just eat them?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I don't know.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You can dry them at that takes time.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
You can grind them to a powder, but then they lose their natural oils.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
They're better raw.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
The stronger the oils, the rarer they are.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
All right.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I eat them and then I shoot laser beam eyes at Quark.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It didn't work.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Right.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
He has to roll first.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
We'll find out.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Oh.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Yeah, you missed those laser beam eyes.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Oh, is he okay?

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:02.000
He eats them and he starts vomiting violently and violently and violently.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You double over in the fetal position on your floor and in the pool of your vomit, there

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.000
starts to be a darkness, a blackness, an eerie corruption, a corruptive presence that hangs.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000
It floats up in the air and hangs in the air like a ghostly spirit with a crazy face.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And it's all like, I don't remember eating that.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I take my mighty greatsword and attack the smoky presence.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Attacking the smoky presence with your mighty greatsword.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
You seem to cleave into the flesh of this ghost and you do.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You do.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I do.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Let's see how much damage.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
What's the damage on that?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Sorry, everybody.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I'm so sorry.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
It's...

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Yeah, you've really been fucking up to me.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
It's 11 plus 6 times 2.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
34.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
34.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Damage.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Damage.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
2d8 plus 7.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
2d8.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Jesus.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Is that good?

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Plus 7.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Yeah.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I mean, I'd say it's good.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Yeah.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
You strike the ghost dealing 18 damage.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Yeah.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Causing him to emit a keening whale that hurts your ears and your souls.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Well, maybe it does.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Let's see.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
It hurts Quark's soul.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
It does?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
It hurts Mulrainee's soul.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It doesn't hurt Christopher's soul.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Fuck yeah.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
We've got an understanding.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And it doesn't hurt Sharpie's soul.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Yeah.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
High five.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
But Quark takes 5 damage and Mulrainee takes 1.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Oh, did it hurt your guys' soul?

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Sorry.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I feel horrible about it.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
You're not cursed anymore.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Yeah.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
That's just a scratcher.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
He's not?

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
This is my new vibe.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Write a new song.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Okay.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I will.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Write a new hit.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Okay.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Yeah.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Don't worry about it.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I got 14 damage.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
You write a new fucking hit.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Christopher, Lady and Red was a long time ago.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
But it's still around.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
No, in a way, it happened right now.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Sing the bridge.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Lady and Red is dancing with me cheek to cheek.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
The bridge.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I don't know what that means.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I just fucking sing, man.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I don't know your term.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
He doesn't know the fucking song.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It's going to be even harder.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Little known fact about Christopher, he was Nick Drake's schoolmate and taught him how

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
to play the blues in college.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Is that right?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Oxford, I believe.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
For real?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Yeah.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
He was an older guy.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Nick Drake looked up to him.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
He was playing the blues then, only the blues.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Mulraine.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
You're very different.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And he sold out.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Shit.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I didn't sell out.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
What are you talking about?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Have you heard Lady and Red?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Great song.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Guys, attack this ghost emanation and let's finish this thing.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Shocking grasp.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:05.000
You grasp into it, shockingly.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Or so it would seem, because your hands just sink through.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It's ghostly flash and your crackling fingers do not discharge into it.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Can I use my whisper bow?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Oh yeah.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And if I whisper in Elvish, will I create extra damage?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Yeah, you definitely will.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
You never played before?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
You're better than all of us.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
We've never whispered into that bow.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Erin just keeps making things.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
She thinks it's Minecraft.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Weirding way, the fire is wielding, weirding way, and fearing for us.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
What the fuck?

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I'm in heaven.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Blowing runes, light up on the bow's surface as you whisper in Elvish, and then you quickly

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000
knock and loose four arrows in rapid succession, three of which sink into the, you know, I

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
was going to call it a gnome, but it's more of a ghost, skin flesh.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Skin flesh.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Orlando Bloom.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:23.000
One of them just kind of goes through it like an arrow through ghost.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But the other two sink into its ghostly flesh and cause it to bleed ectoplasm, taking 12

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
damage.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Damn.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Black people.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Black people.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
That's the title of my new song.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I just do colors.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Lady in red, black people.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Black people.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Give them a hand.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Give them a hand.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I take my...

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It's a call to action.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Okay.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Give them a hand.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Great.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I take my poison dagger and...

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Take that poison dagger and put it in my mouth.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Hey, that would be a great song.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Can I have that?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
No, that's ABC.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Fuck.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So I take my poison dagger and I walk up to the thing and I go, never again!

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And I stab it.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Because he was inside me for so long.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I'm not a welder and then I stab him.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Stabbing him with your words at the same time, your knife plunges in and poison courses

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
through its blade into his ghostly form and he takes six damage.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And also is poisoned.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Oh, he's poisoned.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
No, he wasn't flanked.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Ghosts can't be flanked.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Maybe they can, I don't know.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Let's debate it.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Who's...

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Who's turn is it?

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
If you flanked a ghost, call into Harmontown.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
1-800-366-HARMON.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
It's probably too many numbers.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
They do that sometimes where it's too long but it just starts dying.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
But if you're an idiot, you keep pressing the numbers.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
It used to be like that.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
3-666-HARMON.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
It's the ghost's turn.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
It screams and squeals again and then it kind of starts to shimmer and vibrate.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Its form becomes more immaterial and hazy as it does.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000
And then it shoots, it shoots directly towards Charles Hoffman.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I think I'm taking a break.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Dodge that bullet.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
It enters his body and he goes...

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Oh no, oh shit.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And then his arms start moving about and he's like...

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
This is cool.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And then he goes...

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:09.000
And he casts black magic and black tentacles of Evard

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
sprout forth from the ground and try to grab at your legs.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
That one does.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
That one doesn't.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
That one doesn't.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Okay, so Quark is grappled by these tentacles.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
The rest of you men should stop.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I can't get a fucking break.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I can't either.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Missing all of my tentacles.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
What we have to do is we have to feed Tarragon to this new guy now.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Are you saying so?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Yeah, because that's how the thing comes out, right?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Alright, then do it.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Okay, well it's not my turn though.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
No, I pass.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Really?

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Yeah.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Okay.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Is there more Tarragon or do we feed it all to...

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000
You look more around with your half-elf eyes

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
and your knowledge of what Tarragon looks like

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
and you see maybe about 15 feet off there's some in the shade of a bacon bush.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Oh right there.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Now I have to make one stop.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Tarragon grows in the shade of a bacon bush.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
So then I rush toward the bush,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
fending off this guy who wants the bacon,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
and I rip up the Tarragon.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
What's there in clumps?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You grab several clumps.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I rush back to the tentacles.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Feed it to...

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
shove it down like this.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
To Charles Huffin.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Of this thing attacking me.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Charles Huffin and I make him eat it.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
You try to make him eat it.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
He's wrestling you, but you get him in a headlock

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
and you just stuff a clump of Tarragon in his mouth.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
That's right.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Eat it.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Eat it.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Eat it.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Eat it.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And he also goes into a fetal vomiting position

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
and vomits the ghost up again

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
and the ghost starts screaming and making all sorts of arachis.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Attack this ghost again.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Alright, everybody...

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Attack this ghost.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Well, also everybody grab a bunch of Tarragon.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I just have it in bushels around.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Yeah, just fill your pockets with Tarragon.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Did you bring any extra?

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Did he have any extra?

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
He got several clumps worth.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Alright, I take one of the clumps.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I have a clump.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I'm bummed that my shocking grasp didn't work.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
But I'm not going to let it get to me.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Your hands are still electric-y.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Yeah.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Use them.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Well...

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
But it doesn't work on him.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah, it doesn't work.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Can I ask you about Bull's Strength?

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Yeah.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Is that a beer?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Yeah, it's a heffa-vison.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
What is Bull's Strength?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
They love heffa-vison.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Was that a joke on heffa-ball?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Oh, I guess it was.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
You didn't know, and you said that?

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
It was the most comedic beer thing I could think of.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
But it also worked as a pun.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Yeah.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
That's the way you get for not going for a walker.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
What is Bull's Strength?

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
It gives one-touched target 1d4 plus one strength.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Oh, don't give it to that guy.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I think, I mean, what we're doing is working.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I'm just going to...

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Attack this ghost?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Yeah, I'm going to...

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Isn't it poisoned also?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Oh, it's ghost poisoned.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I take my short bow,

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
and I tie the poison dagger to the tip of it.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
And I whisper the same stuff that he whispered into his thing.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I'm like, I don't know if that's going to work.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
But...

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Here it comes.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I say that too.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
You said you tied it to your bow, or an arrow.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
You know what I meant.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I mean, it's an important distinction.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Okay, you know what?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I call out to Yomichi to kill the ghost.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I'm on break.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Oh.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I tie it to the arrow.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
That must be steak bills.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I'm knee deep in utopia fruits.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
What?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I tie it to the arrow.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Okay.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And I aim up above it.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
But since I'm a master arrowsman, I know...

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
You tie it to the arrow?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
The poison dagger.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
You tie the dagger to an arrow.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Tie the poison dagger to my heart.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Can I have that?

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Oh, still.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
What is the...

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
What is going to happen?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
The arrow is going to go into him,

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
and the dagger is going to...

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
hurt him.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
He can't...

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Oh, and I put tarragon on it too.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
On the arrow.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Someone yelled this out.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
So I'm going right to the source with...

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
So I got an arrow.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I got the poison dagger on the arrow.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I got tarragon on the...

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
It's like the turducken of weapons.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
That's a big CNB.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
So you aim upwards to counterbalance

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
the weight you're adding to this arrow,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
and you loose it from your bow,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
and it plunks right into the heart of this ghost.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Yeah!

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
But it slides through harmlessly

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and just impacts the soil and the paradise below.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
He seems completely unharmed somehow.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Can I draw my speedy longbow?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Yep.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And I use my power to heat up metal

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
to warm the shafts of the blade.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
The shafts of what?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
The shafts of the arrows?

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
The heads would be metal.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
The heads.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Sure.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
You just warmed my shaft.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
That comes later.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
First I fire.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Five at once.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I think you can only do three

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
without the whispering.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Whisper the auto whispering.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Yeah, you can only whisper once per day.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Can I show?

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Until you lose your voice, yeah.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
So three hours?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:23.000
We good? Sure.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Alright.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Two of your arrows missed,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
but one hit some right in his ghost eye.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
It's a critical hit, and he takes...

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
23 damage.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Black paper!

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Black people!

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
So I think Quark has a move now.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Wait, did you do yours?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I don't like that whenever Demorge gets a victory,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
we then take it away from him

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
by ascribing it to all black people.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
No, but I thought we were just doing that

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
every time something good happened.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Not just like Demorge was doing.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
But I'm connecting the dots and I'm going like,

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
let the guy have a victory.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Calling out black people every time

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
he does something great.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
It's really...

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I go into a barbarian rage,

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
and take my flaming sword

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
and attack the ghost.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Alright.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Flying into a barbarian rage,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
rage settles over your face

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
and your body.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
It's comfortable.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Somehow.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
That's probably why you're a barbarian.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And you charge directly at the ghost

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
and slash with your great sword.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
But uh, you know, he...

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
You don't hit.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
He seems to jump upwards

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
or hover upwards or ghost dodge

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
in some direction.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
And he doesn't take any damage from your sword.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Instead, he starts shimmering

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
and vibrating again

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
and squealing.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:21.000
And then he flies away from you guys. He goes straight past you, straight towards Yomeiji.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Oh no. We don't care. No we do if he gets inside Yomeiji.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
He smacks him right in the face with his ghostness. And Yomeiji's like...

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Oh no! Why don't we want... We don't want to fight Yomeiji. He's in Yomeiji now.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
We could just run away, right? He's the leader of the...

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
He's the guardian of the fucking... He's a giant.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
This is the last time you interfere with my plans.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Grab Terragon!

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.000
We have more, right? We all go grab Terragon.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000
With this form, I will annihilate you.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
He says while you're grabbing extra Terragon.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Can I use Mage Hand to force feed Terragon to Yomeiji?

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Yeah.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
That's what I want to try on my next trend.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I'm gonna float the Terragon over here.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I'm gonna do the, here comes the airplane!

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Floating with your Mage Hand, levitating this Terragon of virtue within the range of the spell,

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
you fly it up to his face and he pokes it with his flaming shovel and burns it to his cinders.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Someone's cranky.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
We gotta fight this motherfucker.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I mean, we have to get Terragon into his system somehow.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Am I still in a rage?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Yeah.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I just go far sword, flaming far sword at him from a distance.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Wait, we're not trying to feed him the food anymore.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
No, I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
You don't want to kill the angel guy.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Try to get some Terragon goo on your bleeding weapons.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Yeah.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Can I do that?

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Put it on an arrowhead.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Yeah, I have a ribbon dagger.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Don't tie your knife to anything.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
What was the attack you did?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Flaming far sword.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Flaming far sword attack, but you might have lost your footing or something.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Jesus Christ.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.000
It goes downward and starts, it hits the ground and starts a fire on Paradise.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Everything we touch turns to shit.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
How much fire armor can I create?

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000
You can create plenty for yourself, but none for other people.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Well, I create some for myself.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Black prison?

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Save the thing.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I create fire armor for myself.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Breathing yourself in flames, you feel that fire will no longer hurt you.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Can I take my ribbon dagger and, as Sharpie suggested, rub some Terragon on it and then throw it at Yumichi and do the airplane thing.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Wait, what's the airplane thing?

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Here comes the airplane, hoping that he opens his mouth.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:24.000
So, you do that, you tie it or you rub it or whatever, and then you start whipping around the assassin dagger to throw at your foe.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
But it also goes awry.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I think you let it go a bit too late when it's coming around and it smacks you in the face.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Jesus Christ.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
What?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
I'm rolling a lot of ones today.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
So, it doesn't hurt me that much.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
That's good.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000
It hurts you for too damage when it smacks you in the eye.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Avenger.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
You definitely got a black eye.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Avenger.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Scrawl.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Pier city leafy Terragon leaves with your talons, or as El Pacino calls them, talons.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And coat your talons in Terragon aloe.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Scrawl.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Scrawl.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
And charge that demon.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
It charges that demon.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:21.000
It charges that demon, but he's got thick skin or something.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
It's not working.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
What the fuck, man?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Did you just want to go home?

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
No, I'm just not rolling high enough.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
What's a crazy shot?

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
What's up?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
What's a crazy shot?

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Is that a thing there?

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000
It says make up a name.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Sounds like a Guy Ritchie movie.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
It sounds like a character.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Sounds like a lot of whip hands and freeze frames.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
If I remember correctly, that's the special name.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I guess it's not a name, but it's the special name of use in the whisper bow.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
So that would have already been used up.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Shit.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Whose turn is it?

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
My turn.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Yay.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000
So Yomiji, his head starts spinning around like an exorcism, and he's spitting acid all over the place.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
All over all of yous in a circle.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
He's spitting acid at you.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
So, role reflexes.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Like sort of like a water sprinkler kind of thing?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Yeah, except without that hammer that makes it go all the way back, you know?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000
So everybody but Quark manages, or no, everybody but Quark gets hit by the acid.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Quark manages to dodge out of the way.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
No, you dodge this one.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
The firearm evaporate.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Yeah, I said it fucked up all style.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I said that fucked up all style.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I said fucked up all style, like it's something that has meaning.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Alright.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Moraine takes two damage.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Christopher takes seven, and Sharpie takes four damage, as acid burns your skin.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Ow!

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I say we run.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Yeah, I say we fucking run.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
We gotta go, we gotta get out of here.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
No, let's beat this motherfucker up.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Have you looked at him?

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Nothing is working.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Huh?

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
He's a giant.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Because we keep rolling ones, let's fucking, let's muscle up.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
What does that mean?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Let's fucking focus.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Your strategy is to get luckier?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Yes.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Let's get lucky.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I use weapon focus and do a mighty sword attack.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Alright.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Swing with your mighty sword.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Watch this guys, it's gonna fucking work.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
You swing your mighty sword and he parries with his flaming shovel.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Timmy, you know what?

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Fuck off, let's get out of here.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Let me take one more shot.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
What happens?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Can I take one more shot?

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Sure.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I still have firearm, right?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Yep.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:53.000
So with my boots of spry springing and several clumps of pteragon virtue,

01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I, uh, uh, Ronaldo Nehemiah my way over to the beast, uh, leaping up and diving straight toward, uh, the ghost's mouth,

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000
uh, flinging pteragon into the open crevasse.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Can you, can you try the, here comes the airplane line.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
And can you say it as Barack Obama?

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Uh, do us a favor and open up.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Someone's knocking at the door.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
He's folksy sometimes.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Someone's knocking, buckle down, open up.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Here comes the old airplane.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
With a sure foot and a measured tone, you leap into the air,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
hurling pteragon of virtue at, at the blazing angel.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
But, uh, he closes his mouth.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Damn it, I wanna fucking die, I wanna kill myself.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Let's go, let's get out of here.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I wanna fucking run, I wanna leave, I don't like it.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
You guys stay, we run, we run away.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
You and I run away.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Can we do that?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
The show's about to end, we have to end on a cliffhanger.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Yeah, let's run away.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
We're just running away.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Run away!

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Powered us.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000
An underestimated tactic.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
DeMorris Brown, imagine if the Nazis had been more powerful.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Good afternoon, Mr. Grittenden.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.000

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
