WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.720
Oh, shit! Yeah! How's everybody doing tonight? Yeah! My name's Rob Schrab. I'm controlling

00:17.720 --> 00:24.880
tonight. Who cares? You care. Thank you very much. Welcome to Dynasty Typewriter, and we

00:24.880 --> 00:30.720
are going to be doing Harmontown is now in Sanctuary! Let's give it up for our

00:30.720 --> 00:39.880
Dungeon Master, Spencer Crittenden. Look, it's so nice tonight. How you doing, Spencer?

00:39.880 --> 00:53.880
I'm good. Oh, man. It's been a while. Has it? No! Let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown.

00:53.880 --> 01:08.960
Dan Harmon.Town! Look at him! Yeah! Thank you. Thank you very much. From the bottom of my hip to the hop to the

01:08.960 --> 01:24.960
hip to the heart. Damn! Back in the day, I used to fuck your mama in a bell. Hey, and I used to milk her like a cow.

01:24.960 --> 01:35.960
Alright, sorry. Thank you very much. You got a little dill in there. I used to fuck her. Like a cow! Like a cow! I fucked your mama.

01:35.960 --> 01:46.960
I was talking about my UTI backstage, and Rob was like... You used to be represented by them.

01:46.960 --> 02:01.960
It's true. Yeah, it's true. Twenty years. Urinary talent. International. I'm talking about my UTI, and

02:01.960 --> 02:07.960
Rob's like squinting at me and listening, and then in between sentences he goes,

02:07.960 --> 02:16.960
Are you going to be low energy tonight? Well, I haven't been around for a while. I want to make it worth my while.

02:16.960 --> 02:26.960
Yeah, we're here to serve. That's good. It'll be worth my while. You having a fun time working on my show?

02:26.960 --> 02:32.960
Don't you know? I don't know. Sometimes I'm not there. I went on vacation for a week. You were in there.

02:32.960 --> 02:38.960
I mean, I did already ask you offstage. I don't know. I'm just asking in front of people. Yeah, I'm having a great time.

02:38.960 --> 02:46.960
Alright, let's talk to Spencer. It's a great show. Spencer. Hey, hey Dan. Do you like what I'm doing on the show?

02:46.960 --> 02:57.960
This one or the Rick and Morty? The Rick and Morty show. Am I pulling my weight? I think so. You don't weigh that much.

02:57.960 --> 03:08.960
I'm on that noon till eight fast. Have you heard of this? It's a new fast where you only eat from noon till 8 p.m.

03:08.960 --> 03:19.960
Really? Intermittent fasting? What's that? You're talking about intermittent fasting? Why is it intermittent? It's intermittent because fasting would mean you aren't eating at all.

03:19.960 --> 03:27.960
See, Dan? Yeah. This is weird for two reasons. First of all, breakfast, fast, is right in the name. I've never understood that.

03:27.960 --> 03:36.960
Oh, well, it means breaking the fast probably from sleeping all night. But this is now in a world where I'm rarely surprised anymore about these new dietary fads.

03:36.960 --> 03:45.960
This is the one I really thought they'd never... Breakfast now is out. Is it the most important meal of the day, the one that sets your metabolism?

03:45.960 --> 03:51.960
You know that the breakfast is the most important meal of the day is a marketing slogan invented to sell bacon.

03:51.960 --> 04:04.960
Alright. Just bacon? Just bacon. It turns out that people weren't liking all these lean cuts of pork and they were like, let's make all this fatty pork

04:04.960 --> 04:11.960
and no one knew what bacon was, no one wanted bacon. Also, then they were making the lean cuts of pork because people were like, fat!

04:11.960 --> 04:19.960
Oh, no! Not fat! We gotta have carbs and shit! And then so they were like, but bacon. And then that got people into bacon.

04:19.960 --> 04:26.960
And then they're like, bacon. And that's where bacon culture came from, was just trying to sell this shitty scrap of pork that weren't selling as lean.

04:26.960 --> 04:33.960
It's funny the idea of me being disappointed to find out where bacon culture came from. Like there's a purer place.

04:33.960 --> 04:40.960
I thought farmers made it up around the breakfast table and handed it down like pagans.

04:40.960 --> 04:47.960
In a world where Coke invented Santa Claus. Right.

04:47.960 --> 04:53.960
I like that stuff. I just wish that we wouldn't ruin it by then taking it too seriously. That's what Campbell always said.

04:53.960 --> 05:00.960
He was like, all ceremony is great. He was a Catholic choir boy. He was into the Boy Scouts.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.960
He loved ceremony. He loved ritual. He thought it was so important.

05:04.960 --> 05:12.960
You know, Campbell recommended that he's like, you know, in a lot of like the more grounded tribal societies that we can still observe today,

05:12.960 --> 05:19.960
they maintain this thing where if you make it to middle age, there's a point where you should change your name. Doesn't that sound organic?

05:19.960 --> 05:20.960
Yeah, that does.

05:20.960 --> 05:26.960
And when Cody proposed to me and she was like, you know, she put Dan Heller on the ring, I'm like, I think I'm going to commit to that.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.960
Not because I respect women because I hate myself.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
Yeah.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.960
And like, it was really thought about because they really haven't even been noticing.

05:33.960 --> 05:38.960
I've been kind of like a real gooberious schnook, you know, in this show.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.960
I hate doing the show. I hate myself. It's myself. I hate. I don't hate you guys.

05:42.960 --> 05:43.960
Yeah.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.960
It would definitely cut down on the Google like trauma.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.960
Yeah, it's like it's both simultaneously. It hits the chicken shit spot.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.960
But for like this noble, exciting reason, doesn't Daniel Heller sound like a writer?

05:56.960 --> 05:57.960
Sure.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.960
Partially because there's Hellers that are famous writers.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.960
How about Danny?

06:03.960 --> 06:06.960
Danny. Well, okay, I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm not going to poop.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.960
Danny Elizabeth Heller.

06:08.960 --> 06:14.960
But I think I think the mistake that I made when I was in eighth grade, I started, I would hit, you know, those puberty hormones.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.960
I started going like, don't call me. Stop calling me Daniel. Call me Dan.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.960
I thought that was such a manly move.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.960
No offense to Dan's out there. I'm one of you.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.960
But it was just like, I was already a Daniel and I threw that shit away.

06:27.960 --> 06:35.960
I had this amazing biblical name that was like steeped in blood and fucking like conquering and like through through your art.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.960
You know, like like the story of Daniel such a great one.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.960
Yeah, Daniel in the lion's den.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
Yeah.

06:41.960 --> 06:47.960
He was an interpreter of dreams and then like his competitors were like, let's catch him being a Jew or whatever.

06:47.960 --> 06:53.960
And they they like they ratted him out and then we're a Christian.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.960
I don't even know what I don't even know which Bible the Daniel story is in.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.960
I think it's Old Testament, right? It's a Hebrew name.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.960
But they so so I can't remember.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.960
I saw veggie tales about it.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.960
Hell yeah.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.960
And played by a carrot.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
Yeah, sure.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.960
I eat it.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.960
And then I read the the actual story and whatever Bible it was.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.960
And it was like, wow, this is like they yeah, they threw him in the den.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.960
And but then the God was like, fuck you.

07:21.960 --> 07:28.960
And then but then and then it was like all of the people who betrayed him and conspired against him.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.960
I think all of them and all of their families got thrown in the lion's den.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.960
They live that part of the veggie tales, even though they're vegetables.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.960
So lions eating him wouldn't even be it would be good for them.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
I wonder if the lions were vegetables.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.960
Did the lions kill the family?

07:43.960 --> 07:44.960
Oh, yeah.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.960
They couldn't they couldn't spread that miracle.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.960
No, I mean, if God made the lions not eat the families of the betrayers,

07:52.960 --> 07:57.960
then only thing God would be succeeding demonstrating would be people who just euthanized the lions ago.

07:57.960 --> 07:58.960
These lions are worn out.

07:58.960 --> 07:59.960
Right.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
Not eating anybody.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
And God was like, nope, flip the script.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.960
Those lions are eating non Christians.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
Non Christians.

08:07.960 --> 08:16.960
I guess it was like Daniel was like he got this gig like as basically the king's therapist and it wasn't a Christian empire.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.960
And the king would say, hey, Daniel, I had this dream.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.960
Can you interpret it?

08:20.960 --> 08:26.960
And Daniel would basically take every dream and interpret it as like sounds like you should be Christian.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.960
And the king was like nibbling on that hook.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.960
And that's why his peeps were like, we got to get rid of this Daniel.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
They fucked with the wrong guy.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.960
So what did God put the lion and made the lion sleep?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.960
He shut their mouths.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
He shut their mouths.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.960
He shut the lion's mouth.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.960
He said, shut your mouth.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.960
And then Daniel fell asleep too.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.960
And they woke up and then like the guards woke up.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.960
He probably pretended to be asleep just to like show off.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.960
The guards the next morning going, oh, we better clean up all that blood and stuff.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.960
Oh, what's up guys?

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
Can I have a late check out?

08:59.960 --> 09:02.960
Hey, that guy's sleeping with the lions.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.960
All right.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.960
Anyways, but I would name myself Legubrius Schnook.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.960
Are you are you a imperial bounty hunter?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
Yeah, I'm certainly like a wizarding bureaucrat.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
Okay.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.960
So tell me about the bees.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.960
Let me tell you about these bees.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.960
So some ex start from the start from.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
I interrupted you starting to tell you to start from the beginning.

09:29.960 --> 09:35.960
Some portion of time ago I was in Dan's backyard, you know, just snooping around looking for clues.

09:35.960 --> 09:40.960
And I'm noticing, man, there's some bees.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.960
There's not like a lot of bees, but there's bees.

09:43.960 --> 09:48.960
And normally you see like a bee, you know, two bees didn't think about it.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.960
Fast forward to these dudes doing stuff in Dan's house.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.960
They're putting wires places and such and they're like, oh, there's a beehive in this wall.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.960
And we can't, we can't put cords through the wall because the bees.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.960
And I was like, oh, that explains those bees I saw.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.960
And so then I started trying to figure out how to deal with the bees.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.960
I called a bee company.

10:09.960 --> 10:10.960
A bee guy estimate came by.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
He's like, here's what we do.

10:12.960 --> 10:17.960
We open up the wall, we get out the bees, we close up the wall, bang, bang, boom.

10:17.960 --> 10:18.960
Sounds great.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
We'll come next Thursday.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.960
And I'm like, next Thursday, how about this Thursday?

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
And they're like, eh.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.960
And then so I was like, okay, I'll see what I could do.

10:25.960 --> 10:30.960
And so I'm looking around for a different bee guy, found a different bee guy.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.960
And then I was like, okay, we got a bee guy to give us an estimate,

10:33.960 --> 10:37.960
but we need a bee guy to come this Thursday, this Friday, something like that.

10:37.960 --> 10:38.960
Can you do that?

10:38.960 --> 10:39.960
And they're like, yeah.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.960
And so then we make the appointment.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.960
Then like two hours late, the bee guy calls me.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
He's like, I'm on my way.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.960
And then a half hour later, he shows up.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.960
And then he's not prepared to do the job.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
He just tells me what the last estimate guy told me.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
I'm like, yeah, no, I know.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.960
That's why I called you.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.960
You said you would be able to take care of the bees.

10:56.960 --> 10:57.960
You can't.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.960
And so he's like, yeah, yeah, I'll come back.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
Come back on Monday.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.960
He comes back on Monday.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.960
I see the guy.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.960
Oh, one of the things he says, like, oh, they're in this wall.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
I've got to break open the wall.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.960
But man, if that wall is made with cinder blocks,

11:12.960 --> 11:17.960
like the only thing walls are made out of, that's going to be a problem.

11:17.960 --> 11:18.960
And I'm like, it is.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.960
That seems like that's the whole job, really.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.960
We didn't know it was made out of cinder blocks.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.960
But I was like, I think it's a cinder block wall.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
It is outdoors.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.960
And that's like, and then you look at these walls,

11:29.960 --> 11:30.960
they're cinder block walls.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.960
Looks like a cinder block wall.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.960
You know, it's about the thickness of a cinder block.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.960
And so, but he's like, yeah, I can do it.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
And then so he comes back.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
He comes back today.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.960
Again, two hours late.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.960
And not two hours like, not they give you a two hour window

11:46.960 --> 11:48.960
and it's at the end of the two hours window,

11:48.960 --> 11:51.960
two hours after the end of the window.

11:51.960 --> 11:59.960
And I see this guy and he's not carrying like a giant drill

11:59.960 --> 12:03.960
or a jackhammer or like a handheld impact hammer.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.960
Any of these things that I would expect to be necessary

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
to take out a wall.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.960
And then I'm starting to understand this is why

12:09.960 --> 12:11.960
cinder block walls would pose a problem

12:11.960 --> 12:14.960
because he's not prepared to deal with what those are.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.960
And he does he have.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.960
Oh, so he had nothing.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.960
He had a bee smoker.

12:19.960 --> 12:20.960
A bee smoker.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.960
Yeah, I'm like, that's not going to do the job.

12:22.960 --> 12:28.960
And he starts gathering up dried leaves from your yard

12:28.960 --> 12:30.960
to put the bee smoker.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
Didn't even bring his own smoke.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.960
Yeah, he didn't even have like smoke chips

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
or whatever the fuck or liquid smoke.

12:35.960 --> 12:36.960
I don't know how it works.

12:36.960 --> 12:41.960
But so he so he doesn't have wall opening tools.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.960
And so he comes and looks at the wall and he's like,

12:43.960 --> 12:44.960
I'm going to have to open the wall.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.960
And I was like, yeah, that's what you said last time.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
That's what I told you over the phone before you showed up

12:48.960 --> 12:49.960
in the first place.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.960
Anyway, he goes back to his car and he comes back

12:51.960 --> 12:55.960
with a drill and a hammer, just like not even a big hammer,

12:55.960 --> 12:58.960
like a normal sized hammer.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.960
And like, I think we're done here.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.960
But he gets at it.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.960
And I'm watching because he starts smoking the bees.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.960
The bees are getting pissed, which I mean,

13:08.960 --> 13:10.960
the bees get pissed before he starts smoking.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
I think he was hitting the wall with a hammer

13:12.960 --> 13:15.960
and you could hear how ineffective the hammer was being

13:15.960 --> 13:18.960
on the wall because it doesn't sound like anything's happening.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.960
It just sounds like if you hit the sidewalk with a hammer.

13:21.960 --> 13:28.960
And so the plan is to pound the walls of the bees home

13:28.960 --> 13:31.960
with a hammer that demonstrates its fortitude.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.960
And then when they come out to kill him,

13:34.960 --> 13:39.960
he's going to start up the smoker with the homegrown leaves in it.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.960
And he wasn't aiming the smoker.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.960
I think the smoker had a spout, kind of like a tea kettle,

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
like a camping tea kettle.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
But he didn't have it aimed that way.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.960
He just had it above the area so it was like an incense stick

13:51.960 --> 13:54.960
just kind of burning the general vicinity of outdoors.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.960
I would have tried to pour smoke into the hole

13:57.960 --> 13:59.960
and then hit the hole with a hammer or something.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.960
Who knows? Anyway.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.960
So then he pulls out his drill.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.960
It's a cordless drill, which don't have a ton of...

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
I mean, cordless drills have come a long way.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.960
Don't get me wrong.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.960
But it did not look like the cordless drill.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.960
It didn't have a horse power to it.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
So I could hear him.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.960
He's drilling a hole in the wall to try and break it open

14:19.960 --> 14:22.960
to try and get something that he could stab a hammer into or something.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.960
And I could hear the drill either running out of batteries

14:25.960 --> 14:28.960
or reaching the limit of its power.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.960
Torque.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.960
Yeah, torque capabilities.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.960
And I'm like, yeah, no, this is definitely what I was expecting.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
I mean, not what I was expecting initially.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.960
Like when he showed up, I was like, this is just a disaster.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.960
And so then he tries for a while.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.960
And he's like, yeah, I can't get the wall open.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.960
I'm like, yeah, you don't say.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.960
And he's like, well, what do you want to do?

14:49.960 --> 14:51.960
You could kill the bees.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.960
And I'm like, yeah, no, that was always on the table.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.960
That's not what I was going for.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.960
I could have killed the bees.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.960
I don't even need an apiarist outfit.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.960
But so eventually we...

15:03.960 --> 15:05.960
He was like, you got to get someone...

15:05.960 --> 15:07.960
You need a jackhammer to open.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.960
And I was like, yeah, that's why I was so surprised

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
that I had to bring one.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
And then I don't know.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.960
I was like, OK, so it sounds like one thing I'm going to have to do

15:15.960 --> 15:17.960
is find someone who can open the wall.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.960
Then when that happens, we'll get you back in.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.960
I'm just trying to make them feel better.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.960
And then we'll see about actually solving the problem.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.960
And if I can't get someone to open the wall,

15:27.960 --> 15:31.960
I'll spit a bunch of bleach in there or something.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
With your mouth?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.960
Yeah, with my mouth.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.960
The number one spitting thing.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.960
Careful, don't swallow it.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.960
You might cure your autism.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.960
It's a little joke for our UK listeners.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.960
My mom was...

15:45.960 --> 15:47.960
I was talking to my mom the other day and she's like,

15:47.960 --> 15:49.960
you know, I hear if you dilute bleach,

15:49.960 --> 15:51.960
it's good for your health.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.960
And I was like, no, no, no.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
Get off the internet.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.960
Like a big thing in the UK there.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.960
Like, it's...

15:59.960 --> 16:01.960
Man, it's just awful.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.960
What are you talking about?

16:03.960 --> 16:09.960
We are in our 30th, 40th, 50th year of mistreating autism in kids.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.960
Even though we know what it is now,

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
very good at diagnosing it,

16:13.960 --> 16:16.960
but the more parents know what it is,

16:16.960 --> 16:19.960
the more they just don't want their kids to have autism.

16:19.960 --> 16:25.960
So in the 70s, they were cattle prodding kids into...

16:25.960 --> 16:28.960
Like, you know, you cattle prod an autistic kid enough.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.960
If they're, depending on where they are in the spectrum,

16:30.960 --> 16:33.960
you can train them to hug.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.960
It's just fucking brutal, man.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.960
Like late 70s, this was happening in the United States.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.960
And people knowing that the kids...

16:41.960 --> 16:43.960
It wasn't like they didn't know the kids were autistic.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.960
It's like that was the big treatment for autism,

16:46.960 --> 16:48.960
was this guy was like a guru.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.960
It's like zapping kids to make them hug their parents.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.960
And anyways, but in the UK now,

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
because we've evolved so much,

16:56.960 --> 17:00.960
now there's a new wave of guru,

17:00.960 --> 17:04.960
like somebody that's just younger the better.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.960
Just give them a little British cup of bleach.

17:08.960 --> 17:09.960
Just a little bleach drink.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.960
And you know how many ounces are in those.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.960
It cleans out all those vaccines

17:13.960 --> 17:15.960
that those fucking doctors filled them with.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.960
Get those vaccines out of there with the bleach.

17:18.960 --> 17:23.960
And then go outside and enjoy that sweet, flat earth.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.960
Just roll forever.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.960
Or don't roll forever.

17:28.960 --> 17:29.960
No, God, I'm sorry.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.960
No, that's what those idiots think.

17:31.960 --> 17:32.960
You can roll forever.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.960
Just roll very carefully around outside,

17:35.960 --> 17:37.960
depending on where you are.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.960
People are actually drinking bleach.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.960
No, they're making kids drink it.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.960
The kids...

17:44.960 --> 17:46.960
If the kids...

17:46.960 --> 17:47.960
Isn't that killing?

17:47.960 --> 17:48.960
Yeah, back in my day,

17:48.960 --> 17:50.960
telling someone to drink bleach

17:50.960 --> 17:52.960
was just telling them to kill themselves.

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
Right.

17:53.960 --> 17:54.960
I'm sure they're diluting it,

17:54.960 --> 17:56.960
but what they're doing is they're stripping

17:56.960 --> 17:59.960
the esophageal mucus membranes, probably,

17:59.960 --> 18:01.960
probably permanently damaging the kids

18:01.960 --> 18:03.960
in their developmental stages.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.960
So they'll be autistic.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.960
And when they learn...

18:08.960 --> 18:11.960
At the age when you usually already learn

18:11.960 --> 18:13.960
everyone's an idiot,

18:13.960 --> 18:15.960
imagine these poor kids is like,

18:15.960 --> 18:16.960
why can't I breathe?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.960
Oh, you're a fucking idiot.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.960
That's horrible.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.960
And you tried to make me hug you

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
by poisoning me.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.960
Why am I...

18:25.960 --> 18:28.960
You know, autistic people invented the internet.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.960
The next generation of autistic people

18:30.960 --> 18:32.960
are just going to all be Lex Luthor.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.960
They're all going to kill us.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.960
They're going to be like,

18:35.960 --> 18:37.960
I can't blame them.

18:37.960 --> 18:38.960
I'm not going to blame them.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.960
ASPD says autistic people are meant to

18:41.960 --> 18:43.960
create the virtual reality of the future,

18:43.960 --> 18:44.960
and that's why they exist.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.960
Well, that's fully...

18:46.960 --> 18:50.960
I love ASPD's evolutionary...

18:50.960 --> 18:51.960
Futurism.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.960
Theories and stuff.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.960
Let's bring them up and have them talk about it.

18:55.960 --> 18:56.960
Is he here?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.960
Are you here, ASPD?

18:58.960 --> 19:00.960
I heard someone say, yeah, man.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.960
Ryan Kraus, host of Cold Case Murder Mystery Files,

19:04.960 --> 19:06.960
is here with us.

19:06.960 --> 19:07.960
Damn.

19:07.960 --> 19:08.960
Oh, okay.

19:08.960 --> 19:09.960
Hey.

19:09.960 --> 19:10.960
Hey.

19:10.960 --> 19:11.960
I guess it was really him saying,

19:11.960 --> 19:15.960
hey, so welcome to the show.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.960
Welcome to the show.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.960
It'll be on at some point.

19:19.960 --> 19:20.960
Hey, welcome.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
Hey.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Welcome.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
So you were...

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
You ghosted us.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
You were in the...

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
I was stalking you.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
You were stalking us.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
Yeah.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.960
You were in the writer's room all day.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
That's true.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
Yeah.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.960
Pretty cool, huh?

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
Yeah, this was very cool.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
Hollywood.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.960
Great experience.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.960
Got to sit with Hollywood in a room.

19:38.960 --> 19:39.960
Right.

19:39.960 --> 19:40.960
Yeah.

19:40.960 --> 19:41.960
What was that like?

19:41.960 --> 19:42.960
Did you like it?

19:42.960 --> 19:45.960
I think I was this far from you.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.960
That's too close.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.960
Yeah.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.960
How was that experience?

19:50.960 --> 19:51.960
Yeah.

19:51.960 --> 19:52.960
It was a great experience.

19:52.960 --> 19:53.960
Spoiling anything.

19:53.960 --> 19:54.960
Yeah.

19:54.960 --> 19:55.960
I mean, great.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
I enjoyed watching you do your work.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.960
And everybody talking beforehand.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.960
It was amazing.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
Yeah.

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
I like this little shadow program.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.960
As long as the writers don't mind it.

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
There's a table.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.960
And then there's a whole couch area that we're not using anyway.

20:07.960 --> 20:08.960
Yeah.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.960
You can just sit there and listen to us.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.960
As long as it's someone I trust that's not going to...

20:13.960 --> 20:17.960
You're going to hear like beyond spoilers.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.960
I mean, you're going to hear spoilers that we...

20:19.960 --> 20:20.960
Yeah.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
I mean...

20:21.960 --> 20:22.960
You want to...

20:22.960 --> 20:26.960
What spoilers did you hear today?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.960
Oh, let's see.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
The People's Basketball Court.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
Yeah.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.960
Don't tell them what we're going to do with Wenwolf.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Yeah.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.960
I mean, I can't talk about that, right?

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
Yeah.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
I think I'm going to have...

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
I'm trying to coordinate.

20:40.960 --> 20:44.960
Maybe I should just tell him to come into whatever he wants now.

20:44.960 --> 20:49.960
But John Singleton's kid, Masai, who also graduated from USC,

20:49.960 --> 20:51.960
is kind of following his dad's footsteps.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.960
He...

20:52.960 --> 20:58.960
Like the last conversation I had with his dad was about how his kid was so into Rick and Morty

20:58.960 --> 21:00.960
and wanted to know more about writing TV.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.960
And I want to get him in there to...

21:05.960 --> 21:07.960
I feel like we're not...

21:07.960 --> 21:10.960
It's just like this story, I've babbled about this before,

21:10.960 --> 21:13.960
but the craft of story breaking,

21:13.960 --> 21:20.960
it seems like such a waste that even I still feel like I'm doing it for the first time every time

21:20.960 --> 21:23.960
because it's like there's no...

21:23.960 --> 21:28.960
We need to record and figure out.

21:28.960 --> 21:33.960
There needs to be a time life book for breaking stories

21:33.960 --> 21:41.960
at some point so that we can stop wasting time and keep evolving.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.960
But it's like you sit in a room and you're like,

21:43.960 --> 21:45.960
oh, how come this doesn't feel like an episode of Small Wonder yet?

21:45.960 --> 21:47.960
And then you talk for six hours,

21:47.960 --> 21:50.960
like what if Small Wonder had an STD?

21:50.960 --> 21:52.960
And then you're like, oh, we got it, we got it.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.960
Now that sounds like an episode of Small Wonder,

21:54.960 --> 21:56.960
but what you're not doing is...

21:56.960 --> 21:58.960
Look, I've said this before,

21:58.960 --> 22:01.960
but it's like if you're a carpenter and you go like,

22:01.960 --> 22:03.960
okay, this is called a joist.

22:03.960 --> 22:04.960
We figured this out.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
This has a function, it holds a certain amount of weight,

22:06.960 --> 22:08.960
and so you use it this way,

22:08.960 --> 22:10.960
you put this in at 90 degrees and stuff.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.960
Then you write it down and carpenters don't have to fucking every time they build a house,

22:14.960 --> 22:17.960
go like, huh, so you want to contain people?

22:17.960 --> 22:19.960
I don't do that joist.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.960
And then they have to reinvent the joist.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.960
That's what writers have been doing in TV writer's rooms for basically 60 years

22:25.960 --> 22:30.960
is every single season of almost every episode,

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960
they reinvent the story joist.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.960
And that includes me because I just kind of...

22:35.960 --> 22:40.960
I took photos of every whiteboard when we would work on community.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.960
I'm sure those are around somewhere in some digital box.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.960
I always wanted to do a book or something that would like...

22:47.960 --> 22:49.960
Try to figure this out.

22:49.960 --> 22:57.960
Just so that a subsequent generation can be like, okay, so our goal isn't joists.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.960
It doesn't make us Frank Lloyd Wright.

23:01.960 --> 23:05.960
That's just architecture 101.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.960
Let's finish that.

23:07.960 --> 23:13.960
It's deconstructed, it's reconstructed, it's done, it's geometry, foundations, basic shit.

23:13.960 --> 23:18.960
So let's use those principles to either A,

23:18.960 --> 23:22.960
once you understand them, you can then defy them.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.960
I'm not a pedant.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
I've been like, oh, so that they always know what to do.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.960
But also, you can just...

23:29.960 --> 23:32.960
It's like, okay, we understand chords now, so let's write a song.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
I don't know, whatever.

23:34.960 --> 23:39.960
I'm sure there is an answer to this question, but hearing all that, there are books on screenwriting.

23:39.960 --> 23:45.960
So what don't those do to formalize the process to the extent you're talking about?

23:45.960 --> 23:49.960
I don't know of any books, and I'm sure there are some,

23:49.960 --> 23:55.960
but I don't know of any books that are basically more like manuals for collaborative

23:55.960 --> 24:01.960
and mass-produced, like no bullshit, like,

24:01.960 --> 24:05.960
television TV writers' rooms, basically.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.960
Gee, I wonder why there aren't books...

24:08.960 --> 24:11.960
We were sold 900 copies by now.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.960
But I also think that the principles that...

24:15.960 --> 24:20.960
If you tried to write a textbook for TV writers' rooms on how to break stories,

24:20.960 --> 24:25.960
that I believe that the principles therein would make everybody better at everything.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.960
Yeah, no, I'd agree.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.960
Because really, it's like, at the core of it is,

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
everything that I do wrong when I try to write by myself,

24:33.960 --> 24:35.960
I'm doing because I'm not talking to other people,

24:35.960 --> 24:38.960
and then everything I'm doing wrong when I'm working with other writers,

24:38.960 --> 24:44.960
everything that's being done right or wrong is happening verbally

24:44.960 --> 24:46.960
in an exchange between people.

24:46.960 --> 24:51.960
But that's what makes that place the right place to MRI the process,

24:51.960 --> 24:55.960
because, oh, we have transcripts from the writer's assistant,

24:55.960 --> 24:59.960
we have results, we have things going from idea to episode.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.960
That's why I'm so...

25:01.960 --> 25:08.960
I've been screaming and pulling my hair out about the development of interactive whiteboard technology,

25:08.960 --> 25:10.960
because it's like...

25:10.960 --> 25:14.960
We have the technology, but no one makes it because there's no specific need

25:14.960 --> 25:20.960
for the exact technology that a writer's room would need.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.960
But it's like, if we had that 10 years ago,

25:22.960 --> 25:26.960
you'd now have 10 years on a hard drive of community story breaking and stuff,

25:26.960 --> 25:33.960
including McKenna and Gans and Andrew Guest working on multiple story circles

25:33.960 --> 25:37.960
for every character in the dice episode.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.960
I'm a big fan of my work.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.960
And I just think it should be stored for all time.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.960
I mean, I'm getting ready to retire here.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.960
You guys are gonna...

25:46.960 --> 25:50.960
Remember when Gandalf had to fight that ball rock?

25:50.960 --> 25:55.960
Imagine if he bought a house instead of coming back and clean her robe.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.960
Can we throw out some cold case files?

25:58.960 --> 25:59.960
Okay, yeah, sorry.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.960
I don't know what got me on that.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.960
Oh, it's because you were in the room today, which I was thrilled about,

26:02.960 --> 26:05.960
because you're such a smart guy, and you expressed interest in it,

26:05.960 --> 26:08.960
and I trust you implicitly had dinner with you when you were on the show,

26:08.960 --> 26:13.960
and I was like, this guy's definitely not gonna run into the street and go,

26:13.960 --> 26:17.960
Beth is a clone!

26:17.960 --> 26:20.960
The...

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
You'll see.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.960
She's a meeseeks.

26:25.960 --> 26:31.960
Evil Morty made her out of a clone box.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.960
But also, I think that...

26:34.960 --> 26:38.960
I don't want to make people hate you by saying this, but I do think that...

26:38.960 --> 26:40.960
A lot of people already do, it's fine.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.960
Like who? Like who hates you?

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
Have you ever been getting...

26:43.960 --> 26:45.960
I mean, do you get hate mail?

26:45.960 --> 26:46.960
Oh, definitely, yeah.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.960
People are like, hey, you should say that.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.960
Stop doing that.

26:50.960 --> 26:51.960
Do you ever get that?

26:51.960 --> 26:52.960
I actually...

26:52.960 --> 26:55.960
I get those from people who pay to listen to my podcast, yeah.

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
I have a lot of hate lists.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.960
What's like the worst, like, hey, you should stop?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
Like, in that area?

27:02.960 --> 27:07.960
I think there was one person who left a review for me on Apple Podcast

27:07.960 --> 27:12.960
that suggested one of my episodes was going to

27:12.960 --> 27:15.960
lead a lot of people to commit suicide.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.960
Which episode, do you remember one episode?

27:17.960 --> 27:19.960
The Jameson family.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.960
So it's a mystery where this family in...

27:22.960 --> 27:26.960
I think it was Oklahoma, drove off into the wilderness in a pickup truck.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.960
They've been behaving very strangely beforehand, and it was on camera.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.960
And so no one really knows if they succumbed to mental illness

27:34.960 --> 27:39.960
and it was a murder suicide, or if they were stopped somewhere and murdered.

27:39.960 --> 27:43.960
And, you know, I suggested that I thought based upon their behavior

27:43.960 --> 27:49.960
prior to leaving that they actually were involved in a murder suicide.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.960
And so this person just took it from there.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.960
When you say they were acting strangely, what do you mean?

27:55.960 --> 27:56.960
What were they just...

27:56.960 --> 28:01.960
There's this video of them packing their vehicle,

28:01.960 --> 28:07.960
and it's just really something you have to check out, but...

28:07.960 --> 28:09.960
They kind of look like Sims.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.960
Yeah, I mean, it almost looks like they're robots.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.960
I mean, you don't see any emotion.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.960
It doesn't look like they're interacting in any way whatsoever.

28:19.960 --> 28:25.960
They're packing for a trip, but it's just this very monotonous movement

28:25.960 --> 28:31.960
that just doesn't actually lead to anything involving emotion, I guess.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.960
And behind the scenes, they already...

28:34.960 --> 28:38.960
They were expressing in what ways...

28:38.960 --> 28:43.960
They felt like they were in the midst of some supernatural grip or something.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.960
How do we know that about them before they died?

28:45.960 --> 28:49.960
Yeah, well, they made a lot of suggestions to people at their church.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.960
And so that didn't go over very well.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.960
Churchy folk.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.960
See, that's a good reason not to be religious.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.960
If there's fucking demons in your actual life,

28:59.960 --> 29:02.960
and you tell people at Hardee's...

29:02.960 --> 29:05.960
Oh, Hardee's was a restaurant. What am I doing?

29:05.960 --> 29:07.960
If you tell people you were...

29:07.960 --> 29:09.960
It's like anywhere but church.

29:09.960 --> 29:10.960
At church, they're probably just like,

29:10.960 --> 29:13.960
oh, yeah, just drink more fluids.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.960
And I was like, no, man, you gotta tell people that you're being haunted by demons.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.960
You get the right treatment.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.960
Even if that's demonology, I don't care.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.960
You gotta tell somebody other than your congregation,

29:23.960 --> 29:25.960
and they're not gonna give a shit.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
Well, that was essentially the things.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.960
They were looking for a gun,

29:29.960 --> 29:32.960
because they had some sort of a problem with a demon or something like that.

29:32.960 --> 29:37.960
And a pastor, I probably don't have to ask.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.960
Special bullets, I assume.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
Demon bullets.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.960
Well, they did get the gun,

29:43.960 --> 29:47.960
and strangely, they found a hole in the skull of the father's head

29:47.960 --> 29:49.960
when they found the remains.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.960
So we don't know if that's a bullet hole, but it could be.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.960
This is what confused me about it

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
when I was listening from what I remember of your episode,

29:56.960 --> 30:02.960
is that the gun was not there, right?

30:02.960 --> 30:05.960
No, they didn't find the gun.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.960
When they first searched for the bodies,

30:07.960 --> 30:09.960
they didn't find anything in that area,

30:09.960 --> 30:12.960
and then the skeletons were out wide open,

30:12.960 --> 30:17.960
just sitting there for anyone to see at a later point.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.960
They just believed that they might have been moved,

30:19.960 --> 30:21.960
but they could have just missed it.

30:21.960 --> 30:25.960
I thought they were laid flat.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.960
They were huddled next to each other.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.960
I don't know how flat they were,

30:30.960 --> 30:32.960
but they were huddled right next to each other.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.960
This is one that you did not solve, correct?

30:35.960 --> 30:37.960
I would lean toward a murder-suicide,

30:37.960 --> 30:39.960
because of their behavior.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.960
But how can you do murder-suicide without...

30:41.960 --> 30:44.960
You're saying a coyote came and took the gun,

30:44.960 --> 30:46.960
or whoever moved the bodies.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.960
Somebody maybe found the gun.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.960
I would take a gun from a bunch of dead bodies.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.960
Yeah, I mean...

30:53.960 --> 30:55.960
Why would you do that?

30:55.960 --> 30:59.960
Well, I don't have a gun, and they're not using it.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.960
I would probably tell the police,

31:01.960 --> 31:04.960
I'm taking this gun, but I found it off a bunch of dead bodies.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.960
It wasn't me, by the way.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
You didn't even want a gun from a gun store.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.960
You're not going to take one from the absolute billboard

31:11.960 --> 31:13.960
for non-gun ownership.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.960
I absolutely would.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.960
I would have turned if you find it on a quest.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.960
You'd be silly not to take it from a bunch of skeletons.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.960
I mean, I probably would have defeated the skeletons first.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.960
Go on, sorry, you got it.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.960
Yeah, sorry.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.960
Because obviously, it goes without saying you can't...

31:35.960 --> 31:37.960
But if he thought they were afflicted by a demon,

31:37.960 --> 31:40.960
he might have thought that was the only way to stop the demon,

31:40.960 --> 31:42.960
was to kill it while it was possessing his family,

31:42.960 --> 31:46.960
or he might have been delusional enough to think that he was possessed by the demon,

31:46.960 --> 31:49.960
so he might be taken by violence and then realized what he'd done.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.960
But were there only holes in his head?

31:52.960 --> 31:54.960
Or were there holes in everybody's head?

31:54.960 --> 31:56.960
No, they just found a hole in his head.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.960
But what was interesting is that there was a very large envelope of cash

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
underneath the seat in his truck.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.960
So if it had been foul play,

32:04.960 --> 32:07.960
it stands to reason that somebody probably would have looked for his truck.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.960
Or not, but I would assume you would.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.960
Assuming that the money was the motivator for the foul play

32:14.960 --> 32:16.960
and that they knew about the money,

32:16.960 --> 32:20.960
which they would have probably because they were driving around

32:20.960 --> 32:24.960
ostensibly looking for property and saying they had the cash to buy it.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.960
So Occam's razor would say if it was foul play,

32:27.960 --> 32:31.960
it would be related to someone who heard they had a bunch of cash.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.960
And the cash wouldn't have been found in such a simple location.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.960
But also just like killing someone is a dangerous thing.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.960
So if you're not going to get anything from it,

32:40.960 --> 32:42.960
you might just look.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.960
And the money was not like in a hidden Han Solo compartment.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.960
It was like where if you were willing to kill,

32:48.960 --> 32:52.960
you would be willing to look, which was under the seat of their car.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.960
And it's not like deliverance where there was like a hut nearby

32:55.960 --> 32:59.960
where people lived that might have killed them just because killing's fun.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.960
That's been suggested as well.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.960
But I mean, they think that the truck might have been moved from the last place

33:04.960 --> 33:07.960
that the father drove it, but we just don't know.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
That one's just creepy, man.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.960
There's video footage of them like just loading up their car.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.960
How many family members?

33:14.960 --> 33:15.960
Just three.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.960
And they're all in on it.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.960
How old were the kids?

33:19.960 --> 33:20.960
I forget.

33:20.960 --> 33:21.960
I think it was just one.

33:21.960 --> 33:22.960
I think they just had a daughter.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.960
I can't recall.

33:24.960 --> 33:28.960
Yeah, it's terrible because I'm cracking funnies,

33:28.960 --> 33:30.960
but there's victims here.

33:30.960 --> 33:34.960
I mean, it's not like the Heaven's Gate thing.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.960
There's victims there, too, if they believed they were going to get in a flying saucer.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.960
But I mean, you're a dependent in your family,

33:40.960 --> 33:44.960
and you end up, regardless of what combination of murder, suicide, it was,

33:44.960 --> 33:45.960
she's a victim.

33:45.960 --> 33:52.960
And I mean, it's like supernatural theories aside,

33:52.960 --> 33:57.960
that makes me really upset to think that she was so captive, for instance,

33:57.960 --> 34:02.960
that she's like loading a car that she possibly knows.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.960
But you talked about how they didn't think,

34:06.960 --> 34:10.960
whatever, listen to the episode, will you?

34:10.960 --> 34:19.960
You did like a four or five hour one on this dude who wanted to commit quantum suicide with his girlfriend.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.960
Oh yeah, that was pretty crazy.

34:21.960 --> 34:27.960
And you hooked into a little bit of Dan Harmon's story circle of magic there.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.960
I appreciated that.

34:29.960 --> 34:30.960
That's not why I like you.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.960
I'm not a flattery person.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.960
What is a quantum suicide?

34:36.960 --> 34:40.960
So the quantum suicide, the idea is that you're going to commit suicide,

34:40.960 --> 34:44.960
but when you die in this world, you're going to transcend to another,

34:44.960 --> 34:48.960
where you made a better decision and you have a better existence moving forward.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.960
Didn't work out too well.

34:51.960 --> 34:56.960
So the idea is he's going to kill himself to go to a better place.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.960
Yeah, he's going to jump off a cliff to go to a better place.

34:59.960 --> 35:00.960
The ground.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.960
Yeah, that's what happened.

35:02.960 --> 35:07.960
But the cliff he chose to jump off of was like 30 feet.

35:07.960 --> 35:14.960
So it was like when Batman drops Falcone off of the thing,

35:14.960 --> 35:19.960
he's like, hey, pick a better spot.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.960
It was like a fall that looked like it was guaranteed to just horribly injure you

35:23.960 --> 35:25.960
if you fell off of it.

35:25.960 --> 35:30.960
That's fucked up with Batman.

35:30.960 --> 35:31.960
Yeah.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.960
You know, he used to use a gun.

35:34.960 --> 35:35.960
Did he ever?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.960
Yeah, he shot some people before.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.960
And then it's like Batman doesn't use guns.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.960
Wait, like in the comic book?

35:42.960 --> 35:45.960
Yeah, yeah, no, he used to have, you know, back in the olden days,

35:45.960 --> 35:48.960
when he wasn't very well established, he would just sometimes shoot people.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.960
A guy with ears on his hat that would show up at crime scenes.

35:51.960 --> 35:52.960
Right.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
I'm sure, yeah.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.960
I love that that's how Batman started.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.960
I'm a detective.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.960
What were they called?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.960
What did the gun shoot?

36:04.960 --> 36:07.960
Just batlets.

36:07.960 --> 36:12.960
That's why he stopped using it because of the...

36:12.960 --> 36:15.960
I'm gonna fill you full of batlets.

36:15.960 --> 36:16.960
What?

36:16.960 --> 36:17.960
I don't think he was that.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.960
I don't know if he even had like the Batarang or anything back then.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.960
He was just capping people, just running around.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.960
He used like a regular rope.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.960
So he's just a maniac shooting people.

36:27.960 --> 36:28.960
Oh, yeah.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.960
Imagine being a cop and there's this guy that keeps showing up

36:30.960 --> 36:32.960
and he's wearing a trench coat and he's dressed like a bat.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.960
And he's like, I can hope.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
Damn it, Jesus.

36:37.960 --> 36:38.960
Just to take off the...

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
What are you doing?

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
You're a detective.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.960
Do you have any Batman stories?

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
No.

36:48.960 --> 36:49.960
Oh, okay.

36:49.960 --> 36:50.960
Well, you gotta ask.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.960
That's how we find out things.

36:53.960 --> 36:57.960
Uh, let's see here.

36:57.960 --> 37:02.960
Can you solve the case of these bees in my backyard?

37:02.960 --> 37:03.960
I don't know about that.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.960
What's going on with the bees?

37:04.960 --> 37:07.960
We should shoot them with your gun.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.960
It'd be amazing if he broke open the wall and the bees started attacking him,

37:11.960 --> 37:14.960
but then the coyotes came and saved him.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
Whoa.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.960
They're like the eagles from War of the Rings.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.960
Yeah, the coyotes haven't been a problem, huh?

37:20.960 --> 37:25.960
I got kind of a money pit situation brewing over at my old house.

37:25.960 --> 37:26.960
Oh man, yeah.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.960
Sorry, I was just getting excited about the money pit.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.960
You guys know about the money pit?

37:30.960 --> 37:33.960
The Shelly Long movie?

37:33.960 --> 37:37.960
Uh, I not, I mean, maybe it was inspired by the money pit,

37:37.960 --> 37:40.960
but the money pits like a real physical thing.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.960
It's a real pit.

37:42.960 --> 37:43.960
Okay.

37:43.960 --> 37:44.960
You guys go.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.960
Okay.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.960
There's these, there's this island where they like someone was convinced that

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
there's treasure there and they started digging down,

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
but the whole kept falling up with water.

37:52.960 --> 37:56.960
And then, then, uh, they became a money pit because they spent like,

37:56.960 --> 38:00.960
like they spent multiple fortunes and businesses went bankrupt for

38:00.960 --> 38:03.960
generations trying to like get to the bottom of this money pit.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.960
And they never really found anybody, anything.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.960
They eventually got this giant drill and the giant drill drilled through

38:09.960 --> 38:12.960
a bunch of layers of shit and like drilled through a bunch of silver.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.960
So it probably just punched through whatever silver cash was down there

38:15.960 --> 38:18.960
or whatever, but they never really got it.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.960
Anyway, I think I know how, how to solve the money pit,

38:21.960 --> 38:22.960
but it's too late now.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.960
So let's just move on.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.960
No, the money pit, it's like, it was sunk with water,

38:27.960 --> 38:30.960
but presumably whoever actually like created it had a,

38:30.960 --> 38:32.960
had a solution to get there.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.960
And there was these giant boulders that were found off the island.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.960
And I think that there was these secret water channels that were

38:38.960 --> 38:40.960
covered by dirt, but if you knew where they were,

38:40.960 --> 38:43.960
you were supposed to put the boulders on top of it and that would

38:43.960 --> 38:46.960
stop the water from pouring in and then you could just dig through

38:46.960 --> 38:48.960
it without it being flooded all the time.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.960
But one of the first things they did was just excavate the shit out of

38:51.960 --> 38:54.960
one of these water channels so it just absolutely couldn't be, uh,

38:54.960 --> 38:58.960
plugged, and then from then on it was just done, son.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
The money pit.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.960
What do you think was down there?

39:02.960 --> 39:03.960
It was just like silver.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.960
I don't even think it was that much, but it was cool to the people

39:06.960 --> 39:08.960
who like had a whole lifetime to do shit.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.960
You know, back when there was like, yeah, let's build a pyramid.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.960
That seems like a good use of time.

39:12.960 --> 39:16.960
They found fragments of silver through the drill because they were

39:16.960 --> 39:19.960
just kind of like drilling down and seeing what they found.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.960
There was like a pretty thin layer of silver.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.960
Then at the very bottom, there was these huge subterranean caverns

39:23.960 --> 39:25.960
that didn't seem to have anything of value.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.960
And I think those are flooded too.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
Spencer knows so much stuff.

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
And it's all useless.

39:30.960 --> 39:31.960
No, no.

39:31.960 --> 39:37.960
The other day I called them up and I go, why do pirates wear patches

39:37.960 --> 39:39.960
over their eyes?

39:39.960 --> 39:42.960
Why do pirates wear patches over their eyes?

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
That's a good question.

39:43.960 --> 39:44.960
Why do they wear them over their eyes?

39:44.960 --> 39:47.960
Because I thought, oh, it's because they've lost their eye

39:47.960 --> 39:48.960
and it looks gross.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.960
But then I was like, well, these...

39:51.960 --> 39:52.960
Right, exactly.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
It's more intimidating.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.960
They're supposed to be badasses.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.960
Oh, I don't want you to see how it's really icky underneath here.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.960
So I'm going to put this over there just so when we're talking

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
face to face, I don't, you know, gross you out.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.960
I'm kind of embarrassed about it.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
So I'm going to cover it up.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.960
I was like, ooh, you guys are supposed to be tough.

40:07.960 --> 40:10.960
But then I called my friend Spencer.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
And just to be clear, I might be wrong about these.

40:12.960 --> 40:13.960
I was going off of memory.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.960
Yeah, but this tracks for me.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.960
So let's just make it history.

40:18.960 --> 40:19.960
Sure.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.960
Don't at me.

40:21.960 --> 40:28.960
Do you want me to say it or you should say it?

40:28.960 --> 40:29.960
No, no, no.

40:29.960 --> 40:30.960
No, I'm done.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.960
I don't want to talk.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.960
I said, don't at me to the people on Twitter who are going to tell me

40:34.960 --> 40:37.960
that's not why pirates had badges.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.960
Yeah, well, you know.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.960
Just to keep airborne infections out of...

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
No, no, Spencer, go ahead.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.960
You tell them.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.960
You're so much better at it.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.960
No, I...

40:47.960 --> 40:50.960
Okay, so what I told Trob was that I think for one,

40:50.960 --> 40:51.960
pirates were superstitious.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.960
So I think that they believed stuff.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.960
Like I think one of the reasons they wore earrings was because they just thought

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
that made them here better.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.960
They had superstitions involving that.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.960
And I think that eyepatches were part of that to the extent that I think they

41:03.960 --> 41:05.960
sometimes just wore them as a superstition.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.960
The other thing, what was the other thing I said?

41:08.960 --> 41:11.960
The other thing was like they thought back then if you squinted,

41:11.960 --> 41:16.960
if you had one eye open, it would see stronger or whatever.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.960
Then squinting both eyes.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.960
Instead of doing this, you just like had one eye completely closed

41:22.960 --> 41:23.960
and you could do that.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.960
And that's why Popeye is like this too.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.960
Right, because he's a sailor man.

41:27.960 --> 41:32.960
And also like you were saying like because it's like bright lights outside during

41:32.960 --> 41:36.960
the day and then you go below deck, your eye has to adjust or whatever,

41:36.960 --> 41:37.960
you know, when you go below deck.

41:37.960 --> 41:40.960
But if you have like this, you can...

41:40.960 --> 41:41.960
You flip it up.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.960
You flip it up and you compensate.

41:42.960 --> 41:47.960
And it's done today as a joke where there's nothing wrong with your eye.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.960
But it's actually...

41:49.960 --> 41:51.960
Oh, you're saying these guys didn't...

41:51.960 --> 41:52.960
I was sorry.

41:52.960 --> 41:53.960
They didn't lose their eye.

41:53.960 --> 41:54.960
They didn't lose their eye.

41:54.960 --> 41:55.960
No, no, no.

41:55.960 --> 41:56.960
I'm just for no reason.

41:56.960 --> 41:57.960
Well, some of them did.

41:57.960 --> 41:58.960
I mean, they were wearing them for like weird cyborg reasons.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:59.960 --> 42:00.960
Like they thought they were super powering themselves.

42:00.960 --> 42:01.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.960
Wow.

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
Like it's like a fingerless glove.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.960
It's like a piece of equipment.

42:05.960 --> 42:06.960
Yeah.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.960
A nautical like road warrior.

42:07.960 --> 42:08.960
Now you're getting it.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.960
Yeah.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
Yeah, you're catching on.

42:10.960 --> 42:11.960
Huh.

42:11.960 --> 42:12.960
Yeah.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.960
But also I think I said that, you know, they didn't have good antiseptic technology

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
back then.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.960
But probably did, you know, help.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.960
The technology of antiseptic wasn't as...

42:20.960 --> 42:21.960
It was urine.

42:21.960 --> 42:22.960
They used urine.

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
Yeah.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.960
Yeah, they used urine, damn.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.960
Damn, don't use my urine for antiseptic.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.960
There's some shit in there that'll fuck you up.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.960
I don't know what the hell's going on with me.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.960
My dick feels like a lightsaber.

42:35.960 --> 42:36.960
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.960
That sounds good.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.960
I haven't seen you in a while.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.960
And I think you look very healthy.

42:41.960 --> 42:42.960
You've lost some weight.

42:42.960 --> 42:43.960
Your skin is good.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.960
I got lab results from my regular doctor.

42:45.960 --> 42:46.960
You cleaned up your acne.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.960
Kidney, liver, prostate, everything's great.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.960
You're wearing a belt.

42:50.960 --> 42:51.960
I don't even know.

42:51.960 --> 42:52.960
I already talked about this.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.960
I think I was pretty drunk last time, but I assume I talked about this.

42:55.960 --> 42:58.960
My vitamin D levels are stabilized.

42:58.960 --> 42:59.960
I was, you know...

42:59.960 --> 43:00.960
How'd you do that?

43:00.960 --> 43:01.960
Are you taking vitamins?

43:01.960 --> 43:02.960
I just took a couple.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.960
Okay.

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
I didn't even take that many.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.960
I usually forget to take them.

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
My vitamin D sucks.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.960
I hear mushrooms are good.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.960
But a little vitamin D goes a long way.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.960
Isn't that right, SPD?

43:12.960 --> 43:13.960
Yeah.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.960
Do you have any vitamin Ds?

43:15.960 --> 43:16.960
I'm in perfect health.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.960
I get these results from my regular Beverly Hills doctor.

43:19.960 --> 43:23.960
And then I get this burning cock and weird vitamin D.

43:23.960 --> 43:24.960
Does it hurt right now?

43:24.960 --> 43:25.960
Right now?

43:25.960 --> 43:26.960
It's not.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.960
It feels like I have a...

43:29.960 --> 43:32.960
It feels like I just jerked off an hour ago.

43:32.960 --> 43:33.960
Uh-huh.

43:33.960 --> 43:35.960
I kind of did.

43:35.960 --> 43:36.960
That makes sense.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.960
And then I didn't pee afterwards.

43:38.960 --> 43:43.960
It feels like there's maybe something...

43:43.960 --> 43:44.960
Sorry.

43:44.960 --> 43:45.960
Ladies.

43:45.960 --> 43:46.960
I was going to say sorry ladies.

43:46.960 --> 43:47.960
Sorry everyone.

43:47.960 --> 43:53.960
The men are like, don't tell us more about your dick.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.960
And the women are like, only me.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.960
Only I don't want to hear this.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
It's probably the opposite, right?

44:00.960 --> 44:02.960
The women are like, what's going on?

44:02.960 --> 44:06.960
What is with you people?

44:06.960 --> 44:10.960
But it just feels like, no, there's no pain.

44:10.960 --> 44:14.960
Certain positions, like if I put pressure on a certain foot or something.

44:14.960 --> 44:16.960
But sitting isn't a problem.

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
Like you're not in pain right now.

44:17.960 --> 44:18.960
Right now, fine.

44:18.960 --> 44:19.960
No.

44:19.960 --> 44:20.960
It's just like random positions.

44:20.960 --> 44:27.960
I think there's something in my bladder that is floating around and maybe is like...

44:27.960 --> 44:30.960
And you don't know where you got this from.

44:30.960 --> 44:31.960
A toilet seat?

44:31.960 --> 44:32.960
Maybe.

44:32.960 --> 44:33.960
Wait.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.960
You honestly don't know where you got this.

44:35.960 --> 44:36.960
What do you mean?

44:36.960 --> 44:38.960
I don't even know where you got a UTI.

44:38.960 --> 44:39.960
What do you mean?

44:39.960 --> 44:41.960
Well, I'm saying we got a detective here.

44:41.960 --> 44:42.960
We could probably...

44:42.960 --> 44:44.960
Oh, should we do a 911 call?

44:44.960 --> 44:45.960
Yeah.

44:45.960 --> 44:52.720
If we give him some facts, maybe we could back into where you got this thing so you could

44:52.720 --> 44:58.960
prevent it and maybe some listeners out there prevent it from happening to them or you again.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.960
I don't know what I did.

44:59.960 --> 45:00.960
Cody's convinced.

45:00.960 --> 45:06.960
She's like, okay, now will you shower not just after workouts?

45:06.960 --> 45:07.960
She doesn't...

45:07.960 --> 45:09.960
Have you ever gotten a UTI before?

45:09.960 --> 45:10.960
No.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
Okay.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.960
So, well, you don't shower a lot.

45:13.960 --> 45:14.960
So it doesn't...

45:14.960 --> 45:17.960
I know, but as you get older, I'm sure your immune system goes down or whatever.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.960
I mean, I got to shower every day now.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.960
When did you first start getting the...

45:21.960 --> 45:25.960
And jump in anytime with any detective questions?

45:25.960 --> 45:26.960
Again.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.960
So, okay, I'm going to figure this out.

45:29.960 --> 45:30.960
Okay.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
All right.

45:31.960 --> 45:37.960
So when did you first start feeling UTI in your dick?

45:37.960 --> 45:39.960
Yeah, like several weeks ago.

45:39.960 --> 45:40.960
Several.

45:40.960 --> 45:41.960
Yeah.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.960
So just before going to Disneyland.

45:43.960 --> 45:49.260
It was because I went to the doctor because I didn't want to have to worry about my crotch

45:49.260 --> 45:50.260
during the vacation.

45:50.260 --> 45:51.960
Because you were going to do some...

45:51.960 --> 45:53.960
But the confusing thing is that I also...

45:53.960 --> 45:56.960
Well, I didn't diagnose it as anything.

45:56.960 --> 46:00.960
I didn't tell that doctor there's something wrong with my pee-pee tract because I didn't

46:00.960 --> 46:02.960
know that's what was going on.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.960
I simultaneously...

46:04.960 --> 46:09.960
I think I put a little strain on one of my groin muscles or something.

46:09.960 --> 46:14.960
So you got like a tinge in your taint from doing leg lifts a little too hard.

46:14.960 --> 46:15.960
Yeah.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.960
I work out like a fucking...

46:17.960 --> 46:18.960
I've seen it.

46:18.960 --> 46:19.960
Yeah.

46:19.960 --> 46:20.960
I've seen it.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.960
I blast my glutes.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.960
That's what you want to do to them.

46:25.960 --> 46:31.960
I blast anybody's glutes after the show.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
Glutes blasted.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.960
This is unisex things.

46:34.960 --> 46:35.960
Non-binary.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
I'll blast your glutes.

46:37.960 --> 46:38.960
Everyone's got glutes.

46:38.960 --> 46:39.960
I'm a blaster.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.960
So you're blasting glutes.

46:41.960 --> 46:42.960
You're blasting glutes.

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
You're blasting glutes.

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
You're blasting glutes.

46:44.960 --> 46:45.960
And I had this...

46:45.960 --> 46:47.960
I think I pulled my taint or something.

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
Right.

46:48.960 --> 46:49.960
The doctor was kind of like...

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
There's names for those muscles anyways.

46:51.960 --> 46:56.960
In the meantime, at the exact same time around the time, I'm like, I feel this little itty-bitty

46:56.960 --> 46:59.960
tinge in like the tippy-tip of my weenus.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.960
And I'm assuming...

47:01.960 --> 47:07.960
I'm going like, you did something with your taint while you're doing leg lifts and benching.

47:07.960 --> 47:15.960
I bench like 135.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.960
That's 245 plates, right?

47:17.960 --> 47:18.960
One on each side?

47:18.960 --> 47:19.960
Yeah.

47:19.960 --> 47:20.960
Damn.

47:20.960 --> 47:27.960
Whoever plays Minnie Mouse at the Disney park easily without the costume.

47:27.960 --> 47:28.960
I don't know.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.960
Whoever's in there seems like they're probably about...

47:30.960 --> 47:31.960
Okay.

47:31.960 --> 47:32.960
So you're blasting taint.

47:32.960 --> 47:33.960
You're blasting taint.

47:33.960 --> 47:34.960
You're blasting taint.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.960
All of a sudden, you get up and you're like, oh, there's a little twinge?

47:38.960 --> 47:39.960
Yeah.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.960
And so I'm associating that with the tip of the penis thing, right?

47:43.960 --> 47:44.960
Because I'm like...

47:44.960 --> 47:46.960
You ever poke your belly button too hard and you're like...

47:46.960 --> 47:49.960
It's like a nerve ending that shoots to the tip of your dick.

47:49.960 --> 47:50.960
Because that's your insights.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
Yeah.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.960
I don't know if everyone has that or not.

47:53.960 --> 47:54.960
A belly button?

47:54.960 --> 47:57.960
Does anybody here have a belly button?

47:57.960 --> 47:58.960
Okay.

47:58.960 --> 47:59.960
Yeah.

47:59.960 --> 48:00.960
No, that happens.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.960
Yeah.

48:01.960 --> 48:02.960
That sounds like just basically everybody.

48:02.960 --> 48:03.960
Okay, yeah.

48:03.960 --> 48:04.960
You don't go digging around in there real hard.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.960
And then there's a nerve that goes to the tip of your wiener, right?

48:07.960 --> 48:08.960
Yeah.

48:08.960 --> 48:09.960
Okay.

48:09.960 --> 48:10.960
So that's kind of...

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
I was kind of feeling that.

48:11.960 --> 48:14.960
I was like, whatever's going on down there, first of all, I got to figure...

48:14.960 --> 48:15.960
I got to make sure it's not cancer.

48:15.960 --> 48:16.960
Got to make sure.

48:16.960 --> 48:17.960
Got to make sure.

48:17.960 --> 48:18.960
Because I'm not going to sit here.

48:18.960 --> 48:19.960
You didn't think you just pulled your...

48:19.960 --> 48:20.960
You thought it was...

48:20.960 --> 48:21.960
That's exactly what I thought.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
I went to the doctor.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.960
I said, I think I probably just pulled a muscle while I was working out.

48:25.960 --> 48:30.960
But will you please stick your finger up my asshole and feel my balls in that order.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.960
Just smear it all over.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.960
And then all of a sudden I got a UTI and I don't know how.

48:36.960 --> 48:40.960
Now, he checked my balls.

48:40.960 --> 48:44.960
My doctor keeps saying something like...

48:44.960 --> 48:47.960
My doctors check my balls a couple of times.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.960
Every time he does, he says...

48:50.960 --> 48:53.960
I told you the story about how one time I actually caught myself reaching up for my

48:53.960 --> 48:54.960
nipple.

48:54.960 --> 48:55.960
What?

48:55.960 --> 49:00.960
It wasn't because I was turned out.

49:00.960 --> 49:01.960
It was just like...

49:01.960 --> 49:05.960
I felt my balls being touched and I just...

49:05.960 --> 49:06.960
I was like, wow.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.960
Can you put a pin in that?

49:08.960 --> 49:09.960
Can you put a pin in that?

49:09.960 --> 49:10.960
Put a pin in that.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.960
Put a pin in that.

49:11.960 --> 49:12.960
Put a pin in that.

49:12.960 --> 49:13.960
Put a pin in that because I...

49:13.960 --> 49:14.960
Okay.

49:14.960 --> 49:18.960
My doctor's like, just a guy my age is great.

49:18.960 --> 49:22.960
I have a great doctor.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
I know he's checked my balls at least.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.960
I think this is the third time.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.960
I'm a middle-aged man.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.960
Check yourself.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.960
And he says...

49:32.960 --> 49:36.960
He emphasizes how easy it is to check every time he does it.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.960
And I think subtextually what he's saying is stop making me touch your balls.

49:40.960 --> 49:45.960
That's like when you go to the vet and they're like, you can express their anal glands at

49:45.960 --> 49:46.960
home.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.960
It's like, I know I can.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.960
It's like he's going on.

49:53.960 --> 49:58.960
He's kind of like, you know, like I said before, it's all you got to do.

49:58.960 --> 50:02.960
It's just feel here and here and here and that's all there is to it.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.960
And I'm like, yeah, you're doing great.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.960
I'm not touching those fucking things.

50:08.960 --> 50:11.960
You want me to start rubbing my nipples right here?

50:11.960 --> 50:21.960
I went to get my balls and the finger up the butt procedure.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.960
It was like one early...

50:23.960 --> 50:26.960
It was an early morning in March.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.960
It was like cold.

50:28.960 --> 50:35.960
And I'm sitting there and my doctor comes in, Dr. Logan Rose.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.960
And he's Lord Rose.

50:38.960 --> 50:39.960
Logan Rose.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.960
Dr. Logan Rose.

50:41.960 --> 50:42.960
Bounty Hunter.

50:42.960 --> 50:43.960
Exactly.

50:43.960 --> 50:44.960
Yeah.

50:44.960 --> 50:49.960
And he's like this older African-American gentleman with long dreadlocks.

50:49.960 --> 50:52.960
And he's just like, he's a great doctor.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.960
He comes in and it's like cold.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.960
So, you know, and I'm, you know, in the gown and I'm sitting there like all by myself

50:59.960 --> 51:05.960
and he's like, okay, now it's time to do the procedure.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.960
And I turn around and his hands are...

51:07.960 --> 51:09.960
And he's like, I'm sorry, my hands are really cold.

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
And they're freezing.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
And I start laughing and he's laughing.

51:12.960 --> 51:13.960
And we're just...

51:13.960 --> 51:14.960
He's like...

51:14.960 --> 51:17.960
And I'm like...

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
And he's laughing.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.960
Is this on your balls or your butthole?

51:20.960 --> 51:21.960
Both.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.960
Wait, that's not at the same time.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.960
And he's just like, I'm sorry, my hands are...

51:26.960 --> 51:28.960
He says it.

51:28.960 --> 51:33.960
He touches my balls and I go...

51:33.960 --> 51:34.960
And then he starts...

51:34.960 --> 51:35.960
He backs up.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.960
He's like, I'm sorry, my hands are really cold.

51:37.960 --> 51:38.960
I'm like, it's okay.

51:38.960 --> 51:39.960
Just keep going.

51:39.960 --> 51:42.960
And we start laughing at this situation.

51:42.960 --> 51:43.960
And I'm like...

51:43.960 --> 51:47.960
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
I'm sorry.

51:48.960 --> 51:49.960
He says, no, it's okay.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.960
It's okay.

51:50.960 --> 51:51.960
You're fine.

51:51.960 --> 51:53.960
We're just sitting there laughing.

51:53.960 --> 51:58.960
And it's like, you're fine, okay, here's whatever's assigned this piece of paper.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.960
And he left and I got dressed.

52:00.960 --> 52:04.960
And I went out and Ryan Ridley was in the waiting room.

52:04.960 --> 52:11.960
And he was going in to see the same doctor to have the same procedure.

52:11.960 --> 52:14.960
And I said, hey, I warmed him up for you.

52:14.960 --> 52:19.960
Go enjoy yourself.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.960
That would be funny even if his hands weren't cold.

52:23.960 --> 52:24.960
Warmed him up for him.

52:24.960 --> 52:25.960
But you literally warmed him up.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.960
You gave him your hot bottles and your ass.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.960
And his hands are now ready to go.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.960
What are you doing here?

52:31.960 --> 52:35.960
Well, you know, it's that time of the year and we're that age.

52:35.960 --> 52:38.960
So have at it, son.

52:38.960 --> 52:40.960
16,000 miles.

52:40.960 --> 52:43.960
You're very like when you go into a public restroom.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.960
I'm not a germaphobe about public restrooms.

52:46.960 --> 52:51.960
I think it's disgusting when the seats are visibly anything.

52:51.960 --> 52:56.960
But provided there's no visible anything on the seat,

52:56.960 --> 52:59.960
if you ever like, you know, nobody wants to like,

52:59.960 --> 53:03.960
nobody wants to contact each other or, you know, like,

53:03.960 --> 53:05.960
we'd all prefer if when we went to the bathroom,

53:05.960 --> 53:09.960
nobody else was involved or that there was just that the timing worked for everybody

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
so that everyone had their privacy.

53:11.960 --> 53:16.960
And, you know, nature of the beast.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.960
Sometimes the storyboard artist is just coming out.

53:19.960 --> 53:20.960
You're going in.

53:20.960 --> 53:23.960
Have you ever like, you know, the seats like nice and clean?

53:23.960 --> 53:28.960
You sit down and take a poop and it's like the seats all warm.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.960
And you're kind of like, I made eye contact with the man

53:31.960 --> 53:34.960
who right now I'm so grateful for.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.960
Oh, a lot of people really don't like that.

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
But you like it.

53:37.960 --> 53:43.960
I'm like, it's a weird duality thing where I'm like, I'm like, ah, gross.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.960
But like with a big smile on my face because it's like,

53:46.960 --> 53:48.960
like it's only intellectually gross.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.960
It's physically comforting.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.960
It's a heated toilet seat.

53:52.960 --> 53:55.960
I mean, it's only if you think about why that it's like gross.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.960
And then you kind of like, you're like, boy, this species, you know,

53:58.960 --> 54:06.960
the Rick and Morty toilet system is needs to there needs to be something

54:06.960 --> 54:09.960
because there's like, how many employees do you have?

54:09.960 --> 54:10.960
You don't even know.

54:10.960 --> 54:12.960
I think it's a human rights violation.

54:12.960 --> 54:16.960
And then there's like one urinal and two toilets.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.960
And then when squash games moves in, there's going to be double.

54:20.960 --> 54:25.960
It's like so much waiting to go to the old building, which you were never at.

54:25.960 --> 54:29.960
The old building, we just kept going, well, we're going to go to a new building.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.960
At the old building, everybody had to be given.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.960
I have to shit on the third floor.

54:34.960 --> 54:38.960
I'm going to go down in the elevator solution to go shit in the first,

54:38.960 --> 54:43.960
because it's just, you know, in the afternoon, when you, when you get the,

54:43.960 --> 54:48.960
when you get the after lunch, ready to go after lunch bubble.

54:48.960 --> 54:49.960
Yeah.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.960
You know, reverse pez, baby.

54:51.960 --> 54:52.960
Yeah, you got to go there.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.960
Have a little privacy.

54:54.960 --> 54:55.960
Yeah.

54:55.960 --> 55:01.960
So you can, because otherwise you just, there's no, I'm dancing around the issue.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.960
Well, yeah, we don't want to be a gross podcast.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.960
No, we don't want to be a gross podcast.

55:05.960 --> 55:06.960
We're classy.

55:06.960 --> 55:11.960
I don't, I'm just saying it's embarrassing because you're saying like,

55:11.960 --> 55:14.960
cause you could, you could like, okay.

55:14.960 --> 55:15.960
Can I tell you something?

55:15.960 --> 55:18.960
We all know what we're doing in the stall, right?

55:18.960 --> 55:19.960
I mean, come on.

55:19.960 --> 55:20.960
Let's be adults here.

55:20.960 --> 55:21.960
Yeah.

55:21.960 --> 55:22.960
So if you hear something.

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
We're reading scripts.

55:23.960 --> 55:24.960
Right.

55:24.960 --> 55:25.960
Okay.

55:25.960 --> 55:26.960
But then you make all the...

55:26.960 --> 55:27.960
Instagramming.

55:27.960 --> 55:28.960
All right.

55:28.960 --> 55:29.960
Go ahead.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.960
What?

55:30.960 --> 55:31.960
No, go ahead.

55:31.960 --> 55:33.960
I mean, I don't know.

55:33.960 --> 55:34.960
Yeah.

55:34.960 --> 55:35.960
Go ahead.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.960
You wanted him to have energy.

55:37.960 --> 55:38.960
Just go.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.960
I just, I was making like two, man.

55:40.960 --> 55:41.960
All right.

55:41.960 --> 55:42.960
Yeah.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.960
No, it's the worst.

55:43.960 --> 55:44.960
Yeah.

55:44.960 --> 55:47.960
And then you open the door and then there's the new show runner, you know, and it's like,

55:47.960 --> 55:48.960
huh, that's what it sounds like.

55:48.960 --> 55:51.960
All these guys, like everyone knows what my shoes look like.

55:51.960 --> 55:54.960
And like, you know what's worst about that bathroom?

55:54.960 --> 56:00.960
It's arguable that the two stalls, cause there was one stall in the old building, one year

56:00.960 --> 56:04.960
and one stall, and then it was like everyone had to poop on different floors.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.960
Now there's two stalls one year and all.

56:07.960 --> 56:08.960
I think it's worse.

56:08.960 --> 56:09.960
Here's why.

56:09.960 --> 56:14.960
First stall, handicap stall, whatever we call it now.

56:14.960 --> 56:15.960
Handicap.

56:15.960 --> 56:16.960
Proud stall.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.960
Super power stall.

56:18.960 --> 56:19.960
I don't know.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.960
Free speech zone.

56:21.960 --> 56:26.960
It's the one you're not supposed to use if you have, if both are available.

56:26.960 --> 56:27.960
I've never heard...

56:27.960 --> 56:29.960
I've recently heard about this.

56:29.960 --> 56:31.960
They could just use it forever.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
And then now I'm hearing like it's like a rude thing to do.

56:33.960 --> 56:34.960
Well, it's like the fast lane.

56:34.960 --> 56:36.960
Well, just on the off chance.

56:36.960 --> 56:37.960
No, I get the logic.

56:37.960 --> 56:39.960
It makes perfect sense.

56:39.960 --> 56:48.960
But, you know, so the door on that stall has resting locked face.

56:48.960 --> 56:54.960
You can't tell if anyone's in there without pushing on it.

56:54.960 --> 56:58.960
Which is everyone's nightmare if they're in there.

56:58.960 --> 56:59.960
Yeah.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.960
All the more I imagine if they're differently abled.

57:01.960 --> 57:04.960
But everyone's differently abled when they're pooping.

57:04.960 --> 57:06.960
Don't, don't quote me on that.

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
Episode's title.

57:07.960 --> 57:10.960
Don't use that as the title.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.960
That's because it's going to, people are going to still see the title and they go,

57:13.960 --> 57:17.960
oh, this is Jordan Peterson-ing about it, like handicap stalls.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.960
Everyone's differently abled when they're pooping.

57:20.960 --> 57:24.960
If you think about it, like and subscribe.

57:24.960 --> 57:27.960
I've never watched any of his videos, I'm sure.

57:27.960 --> 57:30.960
You can't, you didn't get his voice.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.960
He has a, he has like a kermit.

57:32.960 --> 57:37.960
So you got to like go in there and like, like big bad wolf on somebody's, some little

57:37.960 --> 57:40.960
piggies poop session.

57:40.960 --> 57:43.960
And then once you've done that, so now they hate you.

57:43.960 --> 57:50.960
So if they're in there, now you're like rattle, rattle, and they're, and they're like,

57:50.960 --> 57:51.960
read the room.

57:51.960 --> 57:53.960
Like they're just going to sit there and be quiet.

57:53.960 --> 57:55.960
They're not going to go occupado.

57:55.960 --> 58:04.960
Like sorry, buddy, almost.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.960
Make them feel bad.

58:06.960 --> 58:09.960
You mean, so you mean it's like, you're almost done.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.960
You're like close, but no cigar.

58:11.960 --> 58:15.960
No, I do mean I'm almost done, even if I'm not.

58:15.960 --> 58:16.960
Here's another thing.

58:16.960 --> 58:19.960
You miss 100% of the shots, you don't take, you know.

58:19.960 --> 58:24.960
Here's another thing, the non-differently abled stall.

58:24.960 --> 58:25.960
The small stall.

58:25.960 --> 58:27.960
The small stall doesn't lock.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.960
No, it doesn't lock.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
It doesn't lock.

58:30.960 --> 58:36.960
That one, you got to hook your foot under the door, lift with your strained groin until

58:36.960 --> 58:38.960
the bolt mechanism will slide in.

58:38.960 --> 58:40.960
So now you're rattling everything.

58:40.960 --> 58:44.960
That took me a week to figure out that until Brandon told me.

58:44.960 --> 58:45.960
These are the cinder block walls.

58:45.960 --> 58:46.960
Yeah.

58:46.960 --> 58:47.960
All the walls are just shaking.

58:47.960 --> 58:51.960
So the person, if it's their first poop in this building, they're going like, who is

58:51.960 --> 58:53.960
this maniac?

58:53.960 --> 58:59.960
He better poop nice and quiet, or I'm going to judge him by his new balances.

58:59.960 --> 59:04.960
When we go back out there and I'm drawing his fucking dumb ideas that he's going to

59:04.960 --> 59:13.960
change in a week, if those shoes walk by me, I'm going to spill the tea in the fucking

59:13.960 --> 59:14.960
break room.

59:14.960 --> 59:15.960
I'll tell you that.

59:15.960 --> 59:17.960
Dan Harmon's a shaky pooper.

59:17.960 --> 59:18.960
He's loud too.

59:18.960 --> 59:19.960
There's no break room.

59:19.960 --> 59:24.960
We're all working for a fucking loud poopin maniac.

59:24.960 --> 59:29.960
That was so title.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.960
It's just awful.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.960
I'll tell you what's worse than that.

59:34.960 --> 59:40.960
I went to Dino's house for fried chicken on Sunday.

59:40.960 --> 59:44.960
Sidebar, because we like to give you a little bit of good news in these podcasts.

59:44.960 --> 59:54.960
If you crush pork rinds and use those in lieu of breadcrumbs, zero carb fried chicken.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.960
All right.

59:56.960 --> 59:59.960
God be with you.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.960
It's probably not healthy, but it's zero carbs.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960
There's no bread.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960
It's fucking pork rinds.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960
Why don't we think of this?

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.960
You could crush up the pork rinds, put a roll of chicken in them and fry that.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960
For God's sake.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960
It tasted great.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.960
Yeah, so then, time to do it.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.960
Another guy goes in Dino's bathroom.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.960
I'm like, ugh, he had the right idea.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.960
Dino goes, I got two bathrooms.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960
No, you don't.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.960
You live in a P.O. box.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.960
The guest house.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.960
There's kids in there.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.960
It's a guest house to a P.O. box.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.960
It's a tiny, tiny, tiny, it's a bird house.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.960
And there's a TV in it where usually if people got kids, the kids will go in there and they'll

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.960
watch like fucking Peppa Pig or whatever.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.960
That show fucking sucks.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.960
I watched it for like two hours with my soon-to-be niece for the Disneyland trip.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.960
Did I talk about this when I was black out?

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960
Not to me.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.960
Did you know, have you seen this fucking thing?

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.960
Dino's house?

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960
No, Peppa Pig.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.960
You know, the pigs, all of their heads are drawn identically.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.960
If you asked a six-year-old to draw a penis as fast as they could, that's what all the pigs,

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.960
their heads are dicks and balls.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.960
Yeah.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.960
But I think there's satanic magic happening with that show because the three-year-old,

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960
she loves Peppa Pig.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960
So I wanted to be a good uncle, get on her good side.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960
I'm like, maybe we'll watch Peppa Pig.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.960
She's like, I want to sleep with Aunt Cody and Uncle Doodoo Bear.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960
That's what they call me.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960
Why?

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.960
I kind of came up with it because I knew if I had a nickname that, when we had, we had

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.960
Walkie Talkies in the desert and I'm like, I'm an interloper.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960
I'm an outsider.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.960
I gotta, I gotta be fun, you know, and I'm not a naturally fun person.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.960
And I don't want to put any energy into being fun.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960
What if I had a fun name?

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.960
Well, you can't just name yourself.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960
Walkie Talkies.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.960
I was just like, Breaker Breaker.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.960
And it gave it like an improvisational sound.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.960
I was like, this is Doodoo Bear.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.960
Oh boy, they think they've, you know, they're hacking the system, calling me that.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960
I'm like, you've been manipulated.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.960
I'm Ronald McDonald, a zero effort.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.960
I'm like a fucking star.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960
I might have kids.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960
I didn't know how easy it was.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:36.960
So, so, so, so, so Dino goes, I go, I go, I'm not going to shit in the tiny guest house

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.960
where the kids lay in the, in the, in the fold out bed and watch TV.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960
And Dino goes, it's just Finn.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.960
That's IO's kid, ex-girlfriend of mine.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.960
He's like, how old do you think Finn is?

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960
He's like eight or something.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
I've never met him.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.960
He's sentient, but it's just him.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.960
And I was, we're kind of like, yeah, he's like a, he's kind of like the feral kid in Road Warrior.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.960
He's really smart, but he's just like, he's like an animal person.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.960
And I mean, like, like, like in a good way, like we just, we make fun of him.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.960
It's like, you know, bad mother, bad mother.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960
No, I'm kidding.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960
All right.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.960
But he's laying there.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960
He's watching some things.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
He's zoned out.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.960
But this is like, I walked in and like 46 year old man, I walk in.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960
I got to walk past him.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.960
There's this tiny little bathroom.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.960
The whole place is like six cubic feet.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960
He's watching Peppa Pig.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
He's watching God.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.960
I don't know what he's watching.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.960
I'm too, I got too much anxiety.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960
Dragon Riders.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.960
Like he's watching some garbage that kids think is weird.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960
Dino Riders.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960
Yeah.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.960
Like some fucking time, time warriors or some shit.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960
Time Riders.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.960
And so I get, I get, I get to the bathroom door.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.960
It's like this thin sliding door.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960
Do you say anything to him?

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960
Because I was like, what am I doing?

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.960
I stopped and I paused and I'm like, why are you pausing?

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.960
And then I like turned around and he's like sitting there.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.960
There's like long haired eight year old California kid like glassy eyed watching his goddamn fucking

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960
robots or whatever.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:19.960
And then he looks at me and I go, I'm going to take a huge dump.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.960
And, and I go in and that's exactly what I did.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960
But it was loud.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.960
So I like ran the sink, but I'm like, not fooling anybody.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960
What do you think?

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.960
You think he thinks you're like washing your hands for an hour?

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.960
I ran it anyway.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.960
Like, do you know what I think?

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960
I wipe my ass.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960
I wash my hands.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.960
They fucking finish up.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.960
Check, check the Instagram.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960
Got a lot of likes.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.960
I come out of the thing ago and I give him a thumbs up.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.960
And, and he, look, I could lie at this point in the story and say that he said anything

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.960
so that he deserved this, but it was really just my own shame.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.960
It just, he's just kind of like, like an eye roll.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.960
And I, and I, and I, and then I, and I got all the way to the exit door and I was like,

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:22.960
yeah, well, I have a car.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.960
What did he do then?

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960
I'm not going to fucking stick around.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.960
So they call that the, the wit of the staircase in French, you know, that's fucking like,

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.960
I came up with a comeback on the way out.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960
I was like, well, get out of here.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.960
He's going to fucking slay me if I stick around because he'll be like, who cares?

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.960
And I'll be, I won't have a comeback for that.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960
Nope.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.960
I took a big shit.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960
Okay.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960
Yeah.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960
Go ahead.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960
Judge it.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.960
I fucking, I've kissed girls.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.960
That would have been better.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960
I have beer in my fridge.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.960
I can't even pronounce.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960
I don't know.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960
You're fucking eight.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960
Good luck.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.960
You're fucking eight would have been good.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.960
Here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a couple of tips for you, buddy.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
Grow gills.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:18.960
I mean, I had a pretty heavy carbon footprint.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.960
Exactly.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.960
Grow gills.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960
Yeah.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.960
Why?

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.960
Yeah.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.960
Cause I ain't leaving him any ice caps.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.960
I thought it was related to the shit.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960
No.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960
Grow gills.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.960
Cause that's going to start overflowing any seconds.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.960
Cause of the girth of my stool.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960
Better grow some gills.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960
I wasn't bragging about my big shit.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.960
It was just like, I kind of just spoke bad.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.960
I mean, it just, I, if it was an adult, there's a thing is if it was an adult, I wouldn't

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.960
have shit in there.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.960
Cause I'd be like, well, no one wants to shit that close to their face.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.960
So you would have went in there.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.960
You would have closed the door and just sat there for a couple of minutes.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960
I've done this.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.960
So cause it was a kid, I felt like well the kids getting like, he's getting like abused,

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960
you know, he mistreated.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.960
Like it's like, he doesn't have power.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.960
He's like, where are the only TV is.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.960
So I was like, I was like, all right, well, at least, at least I can do is level with

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960
him.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.960
I'm going to take a big shit.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:17.960
That was my thought process.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.960
I'm like, I don't like being part of the, the elder orarchy.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.960
You know, it's like, oh, you're eight.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.960
You can't vote to fuck off.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.960
Like that's, you know, you try to respect these people a little bit.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.960
Like, hey, big poop coming.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.960
I don't know if you want to just like prepare for it or you're going to hear some shit.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960
Like it's fucked up.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960
Like if you were 40, I wouldn't do it.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.960
But if you're 40, you wouldn't be watching fucking stupid ass hologram dinosaurs.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960
Whatever.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.960
Saving teddy bears.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.960
Fucking idiot.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.960
What is this shit?

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960
What are you watching?

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960
It's dumb.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.960
How do you know when you're finished?

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:06.960
Yeah, you're, you're giving him shit for you watching this animated hologram robot

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.960
show.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.960
Your show has some holograms and robots and happens to be animated.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.960
I think I've seen a teddy bear in it.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960
Yeah.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.960
And you kind of bear sites kind of leavey.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.960
Can you send somebody?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960
Come on.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960
Oh yeah.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960
No, no, no ice thingy.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960
Leavey, bring the ice thingy.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.960
I mean, if I, if I leave this stage, this show, I'll go right into the, right into the dumpster.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.960
I run a tight ship.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960
All right.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.960
So thanks, leavey.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960
So isn't there any more?

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960
Thank you.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960
I think he's sick.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:51.960
Is there more to quantum suicide than, than just because what you're describing is just

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960
religion.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.960
He thought he was going to die and by dying.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960
Okay, I get it now.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.960
So he wasn't going, oh, I hate my life.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960
I'm going to kill myself.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.960
He goes, um, I'm okay.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.960
But what if I was taller and then jumped off a cliff?

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960
Well, he thought he was getting out of the matrix.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960
Like he thought he was breaking through.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960
He found a hack.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960
Right.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.960
He thought like it was almost like a creepy pasta ritual or something because he brought

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960
his pets.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.960
Yeah, he brought it.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960
He brought some caged animals.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960
He brought his pets dog.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960
Yeah, no, you wouldn't like it.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.960
He left them out there in the freezing cold like carriers.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960
Yeah, it was bad.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960
He was a dick.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.960
Well, he's dead.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960
Usually you'll be happy to know.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960
I am.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:36.960
Um, but it's, it is the crez, one of the craziest stories in a genre of that is just riddled

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.960
with WTFs and, and OMGs.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:46.960
Yeah, I think he had a psychotic break and he, uh, he like, he like, he like invited this

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.960
girl that wasn't even his girlfriend.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.960
It's like they, they had dated, then they weren't, they're not.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960
I call it a Moby.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.960
Um, he had talked to her a little bit.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.960
There's a applause from the, from the movies.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960
Movies got it bad enough.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960
What are we doing?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.960
What am I trying to, like what was it like when the white nighting Moby is like everyone's

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960
just drowning in the same pool.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.960
I'm like shoving his head under like that's like that's like that's going to keep me safe.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.960
I already got me one and a half.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960
All right.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960
Okay.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960
I only have to get me point five.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.960
Me one and a half.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.960
Uh, fucking idiot.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:38.960
So he dated a lady and then then then then he stopped dating a lady and he invited her

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.960
out.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960
So you want to do something cool?

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.960
You want to supervise my suicide.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.960
Um, he had made sure to leave her.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.960
Like it was clear to her that when he died, she was going to get some money.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960
Yeah.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960
It was $180,000.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960
I think.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:04.960
Um, but your theory based on the various clues, uh, is that he always fully intended for her

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.960
to do it with him.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.960
And, uh, and then he was, he knew he, he could only lure anyone out.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.960
Even, I mean, he, yeah, he could, he could, you, you, you, you, you, you, the only way

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.960
he could get someone to attend his suicide was to bribe them, especially if your plan

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960
is for them to join.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.960
Yeah.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.960
I mean, it was, it was, that was the amount of money it was going to take to be able to

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.960
manipulate her through the process of that ritual all the way to the end.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.960
So he basically like grabbed her hand on the way down, right?

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960
Yeah.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.960
I mean, so basically the whole way he's telling, he's taking her farther and farther through

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.960
it, um, knowing that he has the leverage of the money because otherwise he's asking her

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.960
to do some very crazy things and there's no benefit to her whatsoever.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960
She wasn't suicidal.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.960
But she had a knife which put a pit in why, but, um, uh,

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960
Well, it came from his apartment.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.960
So we assume he brought it.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.960
It was like, it was like, ostensibly like, Oh, I'll bring that knife.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.960
Cause then if I jump, it's weird though that he would be planning for the jump to be unsuccessful.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.960
If I don't, if I don't, if the jump doesn't finish me, I'll start stabbing myself.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.960
I mean,

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960
Yeah.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.960
Well, I think, I think the part of that is the fact that he's trying to solve an emotional

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960
problem physically.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.960
And so what's happening is he's jumping off this cliff, but he's chosen a short cliff

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.960
because he doesn't really want to die, but he thinks this quantum suicide thing is a great

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960
thing because he's falling into this mental illness.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.960
But, um, it's an interesting process, but, um, yeah, very disturbing.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960
But basically he jumps, neither of them die.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960
He pulls her down.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.960
She's got a knife.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960
She's so pissed.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.960
She kills him.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.960
I'm sorry.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:38.960
I'm laughing, but it's okay.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960
Uh, she's in prison.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.960
Yeah.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960
She got life in prison.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.960
Yeah.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960
That's just self-defense.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960
Well, she, well, she didn't, she didn't.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.960
There's more to the story.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.960
Yeah.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960
I mean, she, she, she slit his throat.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960
Like, yeah.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.960
So long story short, they go, they go off the cliff.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.960
Um, he has pulled her off the cliff by grabbing her hand and kill anyone.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960
They have the knife.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.960
They assume the knife was to finish the job on either one of them.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.960
If they lived, um, he got up first, he helped her to her feet according to her.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960
And they walked about a mile and a half into the forest.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960
Now they're completely nude.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960
It's the middle of the winter.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960
It's raining.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960
It's freezing cold and temperatures right about freezing.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.960
And, um, they basically get about a mile and a half and they get to a creek and they're

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.960
about to cross this creek and then suddenly her story gets a little fuzzy and he ends

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960
down in the creek with his throat cut and it's not just cut.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960
I mean, he's almost decapitated.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.960
So, um, it looks like he was cut between three to seven times and she suggested that he was

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.960
the one who cut his own throat.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960
Right.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.960
It's kind of, yeah.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.960
It almost, well, I guess that she would probably only serve a couple of years if in fact it

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960
was just bottom of the cliff.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.960
She stabbed him to death, like, because then she could tell all of the truth and be like,

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.960
this dick and the judge would be like, yeah, or the jury would go like, okay, I mean, no

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.960
one's in their right mind when someone who they think they're just helping commit suicide

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.960
grabs their hand, pulls them down and you had a knife and he sounds like a real jerk.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.960
He left his pets in a fucking box up there.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.960
And when he pulled you down with him, that meant he was fine with his fucking animals

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.960
freezing to death.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960
Yeah.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.960
But anyways, but the weird thing is that she's a life in prison because of the, just because

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:32.960
it took her a while and also her insistence that it was his, that not only that he demanded

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.960
that she kill him, but that he physically told her to put, to stand behind him and put

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.960
the knife up to his throat and in her version of the story, she's like, and I wasn't sure

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960
what he was up to at that point.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:51.460
And then he took my hand and started sawing and it's like, like, geez, I mean, well, you're

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.960
asking us to believe like, it would be easier to believe you were mad at, at a dick.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.960
Well, I think the toughest part of it for the, you know, for the jury and for the police as

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:07.960
well, is that when they found her, she started telling one story.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.960
And as they moved through the paramedics to the police, to multiple interviews with detectives,

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.960
she told a different story about his death each time.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.560
And so it just kept evolving to a point where she had more and more involvement.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.640
And so once she told the story about five times, her hand was on the knife with his.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.960
And so at that point, she can't go any farther and concede anything more.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.960
But we know that there is more that she actually killed him because her story has.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960
Okay.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.960
So she started with the simplest thing, which is like, she walked for a while and he slit

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960
his own throat.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.960
And she first, oh no, she first says that he died from injuries when he fell off the

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960
cliff.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960
No, obviously.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960
Okay.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960
Yeah.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.960
That's what she told the paramedics.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960
And they testified to that.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.960
And so she, she, that's what she first said.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.640
And obviously that's not true.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.260
And then she said that he fell on a knife in the woods.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.240
And obviously that's not going over too well.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:05.400
So from there, it became that she was actually at the creek and he killed himself.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.040
But then due to the number of slices across the throat, they assumed that he wouldn't

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.640
be able to do that.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.080
And she started to concede a little more with each detective interview.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.920
And finally, once they had her hand on the knife, then they didn't bother to go any farther.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.720
It felt like they had enough.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.720
Yeah.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.920
So did he believe in multiple universes or realities or whatever?

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.920
Yeah.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.960
I mean, that was the, it was basically quantum mysticism.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.600
And so he was thinking that there was another version of him somewhere else.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.920
And in a parallel universe or alternate reality where he was going to die from this quantum

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:45.040
suicide and then assume that other life where he made different decisions and he was going

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.040
to be happier.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.040
And obviously that adds him.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.320
Did you think he thought she was going to die or do you think she, like, he thought like,

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.240
oh, she'll be like, grist for the mill.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240
Like.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240
Yeah.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.640
I think he fully intended for her to die and to transcend this world with him.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.400
I think he wanted to take someone with him.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400
Right.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400
Like, yeah.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400
Okay.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400
And then she was not aware of that.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.520
She was like, promising her that money to get her up on the cliff.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.480
And then, and then they're like wandering around the metaphysical realm together or in some

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.920
world that's made of pizza.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.920
And she's like, why am I here?

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.640
And he's like, I pulled you down.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.000
And she's like, you son of a bitch, I'll take pepperoni.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.120
Tell me about your day.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.600
It's the Chris Pratt passengers movie relationship.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.600
You did what?

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.920
You life ruin her.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.920
Give me that dick.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.360
I can't stay mad at you.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.160
I haven't seen past that movie is hysterical.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.840
I've told you, I've said this before and nobody laughed when I said this, but I'm telling

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.000
you, you got to watch the movie and you got to give me some fucking credit because it

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.280
was so like, and I'm sorry, it's a, it's a, it's a crass area.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:55.920
But obviously, like what he's doing is, is essentially like, like it's like a, a, a,

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.520
it's a, it's a, it's a non consensual, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.760
abduction, uh, uh, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, yeah, he's assaulting her life.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760
Um, right.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.640
He kind of, you know, way sentences her to death.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640
Right.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.440
And then I made the joke and it, you know, we kept using the R word.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.360
I'm going to use the R word as infrequently as possible in my hilarious like appraisal

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.600
of the movie, but, but, but, but, but like Cody and I are using it.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.760
It's like, it's like, this is, it's like, geez, it's like, okay.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.160
And then I made the joke.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:32.400
I was like, well, there's only one way out of this feature film story, like third, the

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:38.560
bottom of the second act, the, the spaceship's going to need to be raped and he'll somehow

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.560
do it.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.160
It's absolutely what happened.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.080
There's a hole on the ship that he had to go into that didn't want you in it, that it's

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.120
all explained, like there's a hole and he has to like go in it, force his way up it.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.520
And it's just so, it's like the ship won't want you in that hole and it'll try to blast

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520
you out.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.520
But if you can just stay in there and stay alive long enough to pull this lever, you'll

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.240
save everybody and, and that's the act that he does that, of course, when you come back

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:12.120
from that, she's like, you know, it all comes out in the wash, like, you know, because I'm

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.880
mad at you for doing the first thing, but then you, then you've, then you, you've saved

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.600
the ship and then they plant a tree and grow old together.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Nobody's laughing again.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:28.400
Sometimes it's, it's just a man, I mean, I, like, I did like to watch a movie and you're

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.000
like, I, like, there's, I, to make that joke and then they have the joke that you made

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.880
that you did not expect, but it was like fucking actually what they wrote.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880
It's fantastic.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.760
It'd be like if you were watching Monster House and I was like, well, there's only one

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.400
way out of this, probably find out the house is like a sad fat person and they just, just

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.400
have tea and tell the story without houses waiting across the street.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.400
Yeah.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:03.520
Making of a murderer.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.920
You watched that documentary.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.920
I have.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.920
Yeah.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920
Yeah.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.920
What do you think?

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920
Do you hate it?

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920
I'm not big on doc.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.920
I mean, I love documentaries for the purpose of entertainment, but as far as investigating

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.800
a crime, they're definitely not the best thing to look at.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:22.520
I mean, just for the fact that it's edited and it's, you know, it's a created narrative,

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.640
whether it's, you know, entirely true or not, it's generally edited in a way that makes

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640
it the most entertaining.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.280
But if you studied that case, yeah, what do you think?

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280
Do you have?

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.280
I definitely think he's guilty.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.280
You definitely think he's guilty.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.280
Absolutely.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.760
What about the kid?

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.280
I believe he was involved, but I don't know to what extent.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.280
Yeah.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.040
I mean, there, I mean, that, yeah, that aspect of is a little difficult because the biggest

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040
bummer.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040
Yeah.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:53.000
Because obviously he was mistreated very badly and so we don't really get a good sense

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
of the truth.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Right.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Right.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So why do you think that he did it?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
What was it?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.040
Because I mean, I watched it and I went, oh, this poor guy, but you're just, it's consistent

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.760
with his character and he also on the day that it happened, I mean, he actually set

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:12.320
her up to come there under false pretenses and he had already harassed her and so that's

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.320
really the next step.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.600
And if you look at people who commit murders in that way, they generally start with things

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.200
like that and it escalates.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.200
Yeah.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.200
So that lie in particular.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:28.480
I mean, that's the, the, the idea that you have, the, that's the problem, like the police

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.560
want to do their job really well.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.920
They want to save the world from evil people and they like, they can't stand the idea of

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.200
somebody getting away with it or they become certain somebody did something and then maybe

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.440
sometimes they'll put their thumbs on some scales or they'll like overlook some clerical

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.440
Miranda business or something and or they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll be like, well, maybe

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.320
we can get this confession or, you know, through this means or that because they got their

01:21:53.320 --> 01:22:00.520
eyes on the final prize and it's exactly that mentality that we have to abandon when we

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:06.800
watch these like cereal kind of things because it's like people go, oh, I, I'm going to debunk

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.880
cereal because I think Adnan did it.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.920
But it's like, well, that's not really the point is rule of law.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.920
The point is the terrible investigating, terrible law enforcement, terrible trials done terribly

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:28.960
where whether the person did it or not, they shouldn't be in prison by any of our definition,

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.800
our standards of jurisprudence, whatever that word means.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.640
Like you agree, I assume, like it's like, like you can still enjoy these documentaries

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.240
without having, you know, I think people think they're ruining when they go, you know, that

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.240
guy's a bag of dicks.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.240
He did it.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.600
I'm like, well, still they shafted them.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.320
I think guilt and police misconduct are not mutually exclusive.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.320
I think most of the, most of the really interesting cases involve not only somebody who's guilty

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.800
and pretending to be innocent, but also a case where that person is making strides in

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.440
that sense because there's a lot of police misconduct.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.840
We do see a lot of cases like that, and they're very interesting.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.160
It's unfortunate that it takes place, but yeah, that's why I, my mind is blown by like

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:18.160
good, good, by the book homicide detectives, like the guys that Yardley's always having

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.840
as guests, like just like, geez, how can you suspend that dramatic part of your brain that's

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.360
like, you'd, you'd, you'd, you'd, you'd do it.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.360
Your Asperger detective.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.400
He'd be like, let me look around this scene.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.400
You guys see Caddyshack?

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.000
I'm like, Caddyshack, what are you talking about?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.760
It's a movie about resources and redirection of light.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:41.760
Oh, what?

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.920
We got a fucking psycho on our hands.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.080
Hey, he's a psycho that gets results.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.520
The captain said, this guy came from Paris.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520
He's Interpol.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520
Watch him.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:57.720
And then you just like follow like this and you're like, you're like laying down sunflower

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:04.600
seeds and follow the trail of them to a, a cellar door and a body falls out.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:09.200
Holy shit.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:17.400
This guy's got serious ass burgers and the, and the chief's chief's like, yeah, he's

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.160
got them all the way to the bank.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.080
I've never cleared so many cases in my life.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.840
Hey, hello to your new partner, uh, Rhea Perlman.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.600
Yeah, I don't know.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.840
It seems to simply be good casting.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:42.320
Yeah, I, I, you and ready to, it's just in my iCloud as my ex-wife called it, as it

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320
probably goes.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.960
I had dinner with a, a DeVito, I thinking about Rhea Perlman somewhere in the back

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.920
of my head for casting, I don't know.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.240
Which DeVito?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.680
There were several DeVito's at the dinner, dick.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.120
There's a lot of DeVito's.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120
So fuck you.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.680
Shit.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:08.440
So which DeVito?

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.440
Two, two of them, including the big one.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.960
Frank DeVito.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.640
No, baby, double D.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.920
Yeah, and you know fucking Batman walked in.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920
Yeah, I know.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.920
You listened to the show.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.920
You like it.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.440
Fucking Michael Keaton came in.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.440
Yeah.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.360
Remember when we met, we met Michael Keaton like 20 years ago?

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.600
It was like the first famous person we ever like saw.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.320
After Stiller.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.320
Yeah.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.320
Are you sure?

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320
Yeah.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320
Yeah.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.320
Yeah.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.320
Yeah.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.320
Cause we made Heat Fusion a jacket.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320
That's why Michael Keaton wanted to meet us.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:54.320
Yeah, and it was just like, we're like standing, standing outside his Santa Monica office.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.520
Like, and I just, I thought I was going to pass out.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520
I was that nervous.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.240
Cause it was like, what are we doing?

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.480
Why are we meeting Michael Keaton?

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480
What does he want?

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.000
It's like a Saturday.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.400
Yeah.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.760
And then we saw a car drive by and we're like, do you think that was Michael Keaton's car?

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.960
Like what is he, does he come up on a scooter?

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.520
We're like on that ocean drive or whatever where it's just like, there's people are just

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520
rollerblading.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.520
Like there's no way to.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.520
It's almost like a dream.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520
I can't, I don't.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.120
Was he going to paraglide in?

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.040
Is Michael Keaton already in there and he's just hiding?

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.760
But I think he, I think he drove in and like parked.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.000
That's how fucking good that script was.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Yeah.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Batman said, hey, come over to my house on a Sunday.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.500
Let me be with these guys.

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.600
I want to meet with these guys.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.840
You know, I read this script.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.840
I want these guys to come in.

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.320
Let me, let me talk to them.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320
Let me pick their brain.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.560
I think that's a pretty good Michael Keaton.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.680
Norm MacDonald does a pretty good Michael Keaton impression.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.040
Better than that?

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040
Who are you doing?

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.040
Let me meet these guys.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040
Let me meet these guys.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.040
Yeah.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040
Now I lost it.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.440
I always, I do, I do great first impressions.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440
Michael Keaton.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440
Michael Keaton.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.440
Anyways.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.640
So what, wait, wait, wait, but remember, remember how he opened the door?

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.520
He was just like, he opened it so fast.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520
You remember, right?

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.000
You remember the moment of meeting Michael Keaton?

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I'm vaguely, vaguely remembering.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Oh, you know what?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.600
I thought that you and I shared that it was like, that's implanted in our memory.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600
Like, who could...

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600
It isn't, it isn't.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600
I mean, but...

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.600
Our standard was sidewalk.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.600
We're like, how is Michael Keaton going to arrive?

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600
I was seriously frying out.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600
I was freaking out.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.040
And then he just like, the door just flew open, just flew open and he had just had this look

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.040
and he was like, hey.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040
Yeah.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040
Yeah.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.600
Like he was, like he had been in there and he was worried, he was late and it was

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:47.000
like, the door couldn't open fast enough and it was just like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.680
And then we just, you think we blew that meeting?

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.760
Well, we...

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.520
If the goal was to develop with Michael Keaton, we blew it.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520
We blew it, yeah.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.600
Yeah, we walked out without...

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.800
I think, I think, you know, I mean, I was like, yeah, meeting Michael Keaton.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:08.440
I mean, like I was, you probably did all the talking and I just sat there going, but yeah,

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.760
I hardly remember any of it because I was probably freaking out.

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.480
Well, the conclusion of it was that we were both kind of like, because he was basically

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.240
saying to us, I mean, he said a lot about a lot of stuff, like the kinds of characters

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240
he likes to play.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.880
I mean, it's like, I look back on it and go like, geez, should be so lucky.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.640
It's not that we thought we weren't, it's not like we were looking down at it, but we just,

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:35.200
I mean, it was like, it's like, like, he was basically like kind of saying, write something

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:44.640
for me and I'll use my name and thing, you know, or he wasn't actually saying, write

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640
something for me.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640
That's the thing.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.720
He was one of those things because he was a movie star, he was like, oh, you know, I'll

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:54.960
EP it and I'll do a part in it.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.680
He wanted to do what Stiller was doing with Heat Vision and Jack.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:04.120
So then we were kind of just like, well, if you have any ideas, let us know.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.520
That was like, all right, because we were like from Wisconsin, we're kind of like, well,

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.240
we don't just tell Michael Keaton what to say he created.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.800
Like that doesn't make any sense.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.680
We're like, well, fucking think about something and call us, Jesus Christ, let's get out of

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.680
here.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:23.040
Fucking Batman, call us down here on Saturday.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.440
I think we were like, we did act a little like, oh boy, what's up with him, he's kind

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.440
of weird.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.920
But I think that was all about just being insecure.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.200
I mean, from my point of view, it was being insecure, like going, oh, geez, well, we were

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.200
insecure.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200
Yeah.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.200
Wait, wait, wait, me more than you.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200
I was like, fuck.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.920
Yeah, we were like, how do you do a Michael Keaton meeting, right?

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.200
And then, and then the easier path was to go like, well, he did it wrong.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.360
Hey, you in the mood for pretzels, buddy, get out of my brain.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.360
Best friends.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.360
Yeah.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.440
I think I was driving.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.440
Yeah.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:12.200
Oh, well, you don't know which guy was you in that exchange, but, but, but he was, he

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.520
was being very vulnerable, communicative, like, like, uh, loquacious.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.520
He was like, enthusiastic.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.480
We could have done that meeting better.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.720
I wish we could have easily turned it into a job.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720
Yeah.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.760
I, we, we fucked up.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:27.760
We fucked.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.200
We fucked up the quantum world out there where we fucking went from Stiller to Keaton.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.500
It was quantum suicide.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500
Yeah.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.040
Well, well, well, no, that's the gateway is quantum suicide.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.920
I'm, we got to get there.

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.840
Schrab, would you accompany me for how much to Griffith Park?

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840
There's a certain wall.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:57.680
Would you go in the bushes with me in Griffith Park and have a, what, what, this is your

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.680
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.680
Wow. Okay. Well?

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:09.680
I hear that Godzilla movie didn't do as well as they thought it would.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.680
I don't know. Is that another Godzilla movie now?

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680
No.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.680
Oh.

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.680
Yeah.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.680
I don't know the difference between jokes.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.680
It was like three weeks ago or something like that.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.680
All I heard from it was like,

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:27.680
well, that Godzilla movie didn't do as well as they thought it would. Have you seen the new Godzilla movie?

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.680
Didn't even know it existed.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:30.680
Okay.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.680
And you're a detective.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.680
The creature is 700 feet tall.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.680
You haven't found him.

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:43.680
What was he hiding in Madison Square Garden?

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.680
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.680
Have they ever made a good one?

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.680
Shit yeah, man.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.680
I mean, recently?

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.680
Shit fuck yeah, man.

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.680
Yeah? Which one?

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.680
Yeah. The first one is awesome. The first one's great.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:59.680
And Godzilla vs. Violenta is great.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.680
It's from the 90s. That one's fucking good.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.680
You know what else is good?

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:05.680
Blade.

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.680
Blade's a fucking good movie, man.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680
Fucking Wesley Snipes.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.680
Yup.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.680
Fucking Blade is great.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680
Yup.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.680
Prove me wrong.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.680
Can't.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.680
Won't.

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.680
You can't.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.680
Hey, can we do a Kai B blade and you'll be a whistler?

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.680
Sure.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.680
And I'm going to come home from a rave where I killed all the vampires.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.680
Just going to check in with you.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.680
Riding my blade car into the warehouse.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.680
Those nun chucks you gave me.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.680
You gave me out of garlic.

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.680
I'm just mixing up some more garlic for you right now.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.680
It's more blood suckers out there than ever before.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.680
It's better be open season on suck heads because we're in the suck head killing business.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.680
I'm thinking of getting out.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.680
This shit's too deep.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.680
Blade, you can't get out.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.680
You're, you can't.

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.680
How's that cure coming?

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.680
I'm working on it.

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.680
I'm working on it.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.680
Wait, I don't want a cure, do I?

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.680
Because I have all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.680
That's what I keep telling you.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.680
I don't want a cure.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.680
Do I like what I do?

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.680
Are we both on the same page?

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.680
I hope so.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.680
Okay, that's refreshing.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.680
I'm here because of you.

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.680
You know how Alfred's always fucking bitching at Batman.

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.680
It's like Jesus fucking Christ.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:54.680
Go to a couples therapist.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.680
Okay, same page club.

01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680
All right.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.680
Let's see what you got.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.680
Sorry about my comment.

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.680
I thought I was saying what you wanted to hear.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.680
So check this out.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.680
Sit down at the dinner table.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.680
I think you're going to like this.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.680
It's a new recipe.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:14.680
Oh.

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.680
And I know it's not as spicy.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.680
Oh.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.680
Because you don't like it when it's spicy.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.680
No, no, sir.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680
Yeah.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680
Yeah.

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680
Okay.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680
I thought maybe weapons.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680
Yeah, take it, take it.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.680
Okay.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.680
Take a taste of that.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.680
See what you think?

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:29.680
You like that?

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680
That aftertaste.

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.680
Oh, god damn.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.680
Cilantro.

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.680
Shit.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680
Yeah.

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680
God damn.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680
Yeah.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.680
Yeah.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680
The shit you get up to.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680
Yeah.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.680
Make Jack, Jack rabbit slap the bear, man.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680
Yeah.

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.680
Oh, so colloquial.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.680
Yeah.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.680
Hey, remember when you found me?

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.680
Yeah.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.680
You, you were just a little blade.

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.680
Who came up with blade?

01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.680
Was that you?

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.680
I don't remember.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.680
Kara, you told me everything needs a name.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.680
That's how you put it.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.680
Yeah, that's how you refer to things by their name.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:14.680
I didn't exactly get a lot of schooling.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:22.680
I relied on you for not only education, but also just a basic framework of thought.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:28.680
Like literally nobody told me how to speak or read or learn.

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:29.680
Nope.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.680
You always told me everything needs a name.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.680
Yep.

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.680
Yep.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680
That's very true.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:40.680
I taught you well then, because name one thing that doesn't have one.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.680
You can't do it.

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.680
You can't do it.

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:47.680
You can't name a single thing without one.

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.680
And that's the first lesson.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.680
That's why we named you blade.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680
All right.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.680
All right.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680
Listen to me talking.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680
All right.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680
Instead of eating this soup.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680
Here, try some of this bread I made.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.680
It's full of wheat germ.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.680
God damn.

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.680
I'm too good for you.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.680
I'm afraid you agree.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.680
I wake up one day, see an open window with a curtain blowing in the breeze.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.680
And a little tear come down my cheek.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.680
Yeah.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680
Yeah.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680
Why?

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680
Why?

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680
Why are you crying?

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680
Why would you cry?

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680
Don't make me say it out loud.

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:21.680
Well, the window, there's a drape on it.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.680
You can close it.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.680
Are you crying because it's cold?

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.680
And there's no window?

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.680
Because did the window break in the scenario?

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.680
Did you break a window?

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.680
Are you sad because you broke a window?

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.680
Or because the drapes are open?

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.680
What's good?

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:39.680
Whoa.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:40.680
Okay.

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.680
Give me that.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.680
Give me that.

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.680
What?

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.680
Give me that.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.680
Taking my soup.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.680
Why are you crying?

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.680
What?

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.680
In the thing.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.680
Take my soup.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.680
Explain yourself.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.680
I think this is a deflection.

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.680
You know what I mean.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.680
No, I don't.

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.680
Afraid you'll leave me because I love you.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.680
Look at me like that.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.680
You pulled it out of me.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.680
Like a fang.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.680
I was happy to leave it edgy and muscular.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.680
Platonic.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.680
No homo as the hip hop community says.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680
I don't approve of it.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680
Find that problematic.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.680
You want to see the new Trident?

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.680
Yes.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.680
Look at that.

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:28.680
This Trident has four dents.

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.680
There's a hidden one.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:39.680
It's a quadrant.

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.680
Now, press the other button.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:49.680
You can press your teeth.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.680
You taught me how to do that.

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:59.680
Once a month you get a new battery.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.680
It doesn't seem to be vibrating very hard.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.680
I thought that a vibrating toothbrush,

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.680
I thought the whole point was for it to vibrate so hard

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.680
it shakes all the dirt off your teeth.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.680
Your teeth are so clean it doesn't need to shake that hard.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.680
How come it vibrates for two minutes and then stops

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.680
and then starts again?

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.680
You're supposed to do the other side.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.680
Oh, it's like a reminder.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.680
What a product.

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:34.680
Here, why don't you put this lotion on my feet?

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.680
Well, if you had to just give me a Trident,

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.680
I wouldn't be doing this.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.680
Yeah.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.680
That kind of makes a fart noise.

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.680
You know what that sounds like.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.680
Okay, put those gross ass fucking gremlins up here.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.680
Come on, you old man.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.680
Okay.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.680
Look like goddamn Billy Bob from showbiz pizza place.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.680
He fucking bare feet.

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.680
Still so ticklish.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.680
Ashy ass feet.

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:05.680
Look like a goddamn...

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.680
Well, they wouldn't be so ashy if you would put more cream on it.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.680
Put some more cream on it.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.680
What do you think I'm trying to do, you old man?

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.680
Put some more cream on it.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.680
God damn it, I love you.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.680
Stop tickling so much.

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.680
I'm not trying to tickle you.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.680
I'm trying to hydrate.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.680
God damn ashy ass, dry ass, wooden stumps you call feet.

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.680
You old poop.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:31.680
You want to watch it again?

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.680
Watch?

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.680
Yes.

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.680
I'll get the DVD player.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.680
Okay, great.

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.680
I'm going to walk across the linoleum.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680
What?

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.680
Oh, no.

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:52.680
Whistler!

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.680
Whistler!

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.680
Hold on.

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.680
What happened?

01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.680
My feet are so hydrated, I slipped on the linoleum.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.680
God damn it.

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.680
Why are we even walking over here?

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.680
Get me the med kit.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680
Shit.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.680
There's one in the trident.

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.680
I'll fly there.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.680
Did some flips.

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.680
Where are the band-aids in the stem?

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.680
Yeah, you unscrew it and then you put the band-aids on.

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.680
Oh, shit.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.680
Shit everywhere.

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.680
Oh, shit, I'm going.

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680
I'm going, Blade.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.680
What?

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:28.680
I'm going.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.680
No, this ain't how you go.

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.680
I'm going.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.680
No, I can't do this without you.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.680
No, I'm slipping down the hallway because of the thing.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.680
Look, help me.

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:37.680
I'm going.

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.680
I'm going.

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.680
Oh, shit.

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.680
There's nothing I can do.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:46.680
It's gone.

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:50.680
That's how I lost him.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:55.680
Anyways, that's how I lost him.

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.680
That's very, very interesting, Mr. Blade.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.680
And you're saying, I don't even have to fight vampires.

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.680
Only if you want to.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.680
Just feels wrong not to.

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.680
They killed my mom.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.680
Was it?

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.680
I mean, if that's, if making, if fighting vampires makes you feel good, then that's what you should do.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.680
As long as you're not hurting any non-vampire people.

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.680
That's hard.

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.680
I'm a daywalker.

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.680
I can be out during the day, but they can't.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:36.680
So if I sleep during the day like they do,

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.680
I'm just voluntarily being like one of them.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.680
But if I sleep at night, that's when they do their thing.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.680
It's like burning the candle at both ends.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680
Yeah.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680
I'm skating uphill.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.680
Yep.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.680
That's our time.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.680
All right.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.680
Do you want to give me a check?

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.680
You use Venmo?

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:03.680
Yeah, we can do that.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:04.680
We can do that.

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:07.680
I don't know how.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.680
Whistler used to do everything.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:17.680
Now I'll just walk around and increasingly dilapidated Kevlar vests.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.680
Little plastic buckles on them.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.680
Half of them don't work anymore.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.680
Got one katana.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:33.680
Half a greasy ass fucking biker bottle full of the active ingredient of garlic.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.680
Can't even remember the names.

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:38.680
Got a UV light.

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.680
It doesn't even look cool.

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.680
The only thing you can do with it is melt fat vampires.

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.680
They're in a basement.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:48.680
It's not what I want to do.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.680
I want to kick a bitch.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.680
I've wasted enough of your time.

01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:00.680
I'll try to get you the money in some way.

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.680
Can I keep sleeping in your basement?

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.680
Here's the stairs.

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.680
Thank you.

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.680
Here they are, right here.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:18.680
I'll try not to disturb you with your rest of your patience.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:26.680
Well, I've been waiting, waiting for so long.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.680
Well, thinking nothing.

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.680
DVD player.

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:33.680
Nothing could go wrong.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.680
But now I know.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.680
SpaghettiOs.

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:44.680
She has a built-in ability.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.680
Cylinder of fucking gross ass old spaghettiOs plopping on a plate.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.680
Dirty microwave.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.680
To take everything she sees.

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.680
Beep, beep.

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:55.680
God damn it.

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.680
What power, 10?

01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:59.680
What the fuck does that even mean?

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.680
And now I see I'm falling, falling for her.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.680
She seems to have an invisible touch.

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:15.680
He reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart.

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.680
Go away.

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:25.680
All right.

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.680
Beep.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.680
God fucking damn it.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.680
What the fuck, shitty spaghetti?

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.680
Fucking hot.

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:43.680
Damn.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.680
I tell the only person that knocks on my door to go away.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.680
Could have been anybody.

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:55.680
It's not like the problem I have is...

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.680
Who is it?

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.680
Did I catch you at a bad time?

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.680
Can't be.

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.680
If you're a mimic, one of seven classes of vampire,

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.680
you should know I got a gun on the other side of this door

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:18.680
that'll send you off blood-sucking ass all over the wallpaper.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.680
Just open the door, Blade.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:31.680
She seems to have an invisible touch.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:40.680
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.680
Do you still have the trident?

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.680
Oh shit, yeah.

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.680
Oh fuck.

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.680
God damn it.

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.680
There's a fourth trident.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.680
One of them is rubbing my teeth.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.680
I think I dropped my phone earlier.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:03.680
Oh shit, find it.

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.680
It's a good movie.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:12.680
See, you know, it is a great, great movie.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.680
All right, well, is there anything to plug?

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:21.680
Watch, go to the...

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.680
That's some lazy improv.

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:30.680
That is some lazy improv.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.680
Oh my god.

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:36.680
If I could beam that to us when we were like,

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.680
20, 24.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.680
And just go, is that working so hard?

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.680
You guys are just sitting?

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:44.680
You're not even standing up and running?

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:50.680
And you're still talking about the movie we just saw last week?

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.680
Like, isn't there like hologram television?

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.680
Like about teenagers doing weird drugs on HBO?

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.680
Like, have you guys even watched Atlanta yet?

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.680
No, just rewatching Blade.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.680
It's that good.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.680
In fact, nothing gets better.

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.680
It's a great movie.

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.680
You know who's in that movie?

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.680
Wesley Snipes.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.680
Who else?

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.680
Donald Logue.

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:24.680
Who would go on, who would build on that role to play me?

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.680
Oh shit, yeah, that's right.

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.680
All right, well, you know, I've never...

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:37.680
Anyway, Ryan's one of those guys that makes his own app for his podcast.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.680
You can get...

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.680
What is it, in the app store?

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.680
Yeah, the iOS version is in the app store.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:44.680
And that's when the shit really goes ham.

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.680
Is that a good thing to go ham?

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.680
Morty, Morty.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.680
Is it good to go ham, Morty?

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:56.680
Because, I mean, you're, you know, behind the paywall,

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.680
that's where the magic happens.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.680
You do spoken word shit.

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.680
You're just fucking like, you're crazy.

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.680
Oh yeah, definitely crazy, yeah.

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.680
It's great. It's fantastic.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.680
You know, I don't want to embarrass Spencer,

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.680
but he really, you got a lot out of listening to Ryan's podcast.

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.680
I got a lot out of listening to Ryan's podcast.

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.680
Why would you be embarrassed about that?

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.680
Because...

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.680
Well, I'll tell you why. Nobody wants to be...

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.680
Nobody wants to be referred to in the third person emotionally.

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:28.680
I do.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.680
I watched that happen a lot when we took the kids to Disneyland

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.680
and I was like, I know what's going on here.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:35.680
Like, yeah, she wanted to meet Minnie Mouse,

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.680
but, you know, she's overwhelmed.

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:39.680
She didn't know Minnie Mouse was a giant fucking thing.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.680
And then it's like, and then it's like,

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.680
adults having conversations about like,

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.680
I thought you liked Thunder Mountain.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.680
I thought you wanted this and it's kind of like,

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.680
you're overwhelmed and you want to be like,

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.680
stop talking about what I think and like.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.680
I need to fucking chill.

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.680
My little tiny little fucking four horsepower brain is like,

01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:58.680
like just fucking flooded by this corporate,

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:00.680
goddamn heroin trip.

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:03.680
Like, I gotta, I gotta fucking freak out.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.680
There was a, there were two,

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.680
three yetis on that, on that first roller coaster ride.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.680
What's the one that's bobsled themed?

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:12.680
Uh, that's...

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:13.680
You're running.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.680
And, uh...

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.680
Where are...

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.680
Hey!

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.680
Five-year-old Ryland was, he was in the front car.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.680
That was his first roller coaster ever.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.680
And I was like, in the car behind him

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:26.680
and I kept yelling.

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.680
I was like, what are you doing?

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.680
Because he was in the front car.

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:32.680
I was like, wait, no!

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:33.680
Did he think he was...

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.680
No way!

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.680
Do you think he was steering?

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.680
Well, I was acting like I thought he was steering.

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.680
But he might, he's five.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.680
He might have been like, fuck, he thinks I'm steering.

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:44.680
I'm sorry.

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.680
I was like, this isn't even bobsledding.

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.680
What do you, do you even know what you're doing?

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:51.680
Did you ever, did you go on Splash Mountain?

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:53.680
No.

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.680
Do you know Splash Mountain?

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.680
Yeah, I've gone on it.

01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.680
Do you know why it's called Splash Mountain?

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.680
Because a lady died on it?

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.680
No.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.680
It used to be a song of the south inspired ride.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.680
And then somebody went, oh my god, we can't do that anymore.

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.680
Yeah.

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.680
And then Splash, Darrell Hanna, Tom Hanks Splash,

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.680
came out.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.680
Shut up.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:19.680
They called it Splash Mountain.

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:20.680
Shut up.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.680
So if you go to Splash Mountain, I think there's like,

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.680
they've just played song of the south music.

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.680
No, there's, you know, the bears in there,

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.680
there's the rabbits and the briar patch and all that stuff.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.680
And Splash, but they call it Splash Mountain.

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680
Come on.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.680
It used to be called Racist Mountain.

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.680
What was it called?

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.680
Look it up.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.680
Look it up.

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:37.680
What was it called before?

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.680
You should know what it's called if the story's true.

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.680
No, I don't because it's called Splash Mountain.

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.680
It was called Uncle Tom's, like with the teacup.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.680
It was called something else.

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.680
The point of my story is that it's called Splash Mountain.

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:51.680
Then why isn't there a mermaid anywhere in there?

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.680
You've got bad information.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:54.680
It's not true.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.680
Okay.

01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:57.680
Well, all right.

01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:58.680
It's called what?

01:50:58.680 --> 01:50:59.680
Zippity River Run.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:01.680
Zippity River Run.

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.680
Right.

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.680
That sounds authentic.

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:04.680
Right.

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.680
Okay.

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.680
That person's not improvising.

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:07.680
Now it's called Splash Mountain.

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:08.680
Okay.

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.680
But really is it, do you know this or are you Googling it?

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.680
Do you know if it was named after the,

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:15.680
if the Splash connection is true?

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.680
Okay.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:19.680
I recognize the sound of Disney experts.

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.680
You don't, and you do not want to fuck with them.

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.680
So, okay.

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.680
I retreat.

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.680
All right.

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.680
Fascinating.

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.680
You're right.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:40.680
You're welcome for making it possible for you to be right about something.

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:43.680
Check out Cold Case Murder Mysteries.

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680
Oh shit.

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:46.680
We forgot, Ryan Reynolds was our guest tonight.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680
Should we bring him out?

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.680
I guess it's like two hours.

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680
Yeah.

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:50.680
Okay.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.680
All right.

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:52.680
Well, sorry guys.

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:53.680
We usually have a guest and sometimes I forget about them.

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:54.680
We did this time.

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:59.680
So we'll go to a dead pool for somewhere else.

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:04.680
He's the Merc with a mouth.

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:07.680
Dan likes him because they both break the fourth wall.

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.680
Yeah.

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.680
Who else does?

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.680
I do.

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:15.680
You just did by saying that.

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680
Yeah.

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.680
I don't know.

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:21.680
He's the mirth with the mark with the mouth.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.680
You know, like everyone shortens mercenary too.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:26.680
Yeah.

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:27.680
Merck.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.680
Yeah.

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.680
Just stop on that hard C like you do.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.680
Like just pretend you're saying the word mercenary and then just stop.

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.680
But he doesn't have a mouth.

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.680
He has a mouth.

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.680
But his face is a mask.

01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.680
His face is not a mask.

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:46.680
He wears a mask over his face.

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.680
Over his mouth.

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.680
Right.

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.680
Yeah, over the mouth that he absolutely has.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.680
Yeah.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:58.680
I haven't seen this movie.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.680
He hates Francis.

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.680
You haven't seen Deadpool?

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.680
You definitely haven't seen the movie.

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:07.680
You're such a fucking old, shitty fucking...

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.680
Colossus is in it.

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:11.680
I don't need...

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:12.680
What do you watch?

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:14.680
The Mentalist?

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:17.680
That's Donald Glover's joke.

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.680
Have fun being...

01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:22.680
Eating fiber and watching The Mentalist.

01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:25.680
Rob, what's his old ColecoVision commercials?

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:26.680
All right.

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:27.680
Okay.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.680
All right.

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.680
Dis.

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:30.680
That's not a dis.

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:31.680
Look, Jeff's not here.

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.680
He's the one that usually knows how to end the show.

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:36.680
Cliff Hanger.

01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.680
I guess he doesn't really know how to do it.

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680
Yeah.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:42.680
Okay, good night, everybody.

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:47.680
Ryan Kraus, Cold Case Murder Mystery Files.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:49.680
I got it right, right?

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:51.680
Cold Case Murder Mysteries.

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.680
Cold Case Murder Mysteries.

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:57.680
There's no files.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.680
Not Colgate like the toothpaste.

01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.680
Cold Case, right?

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.680
Not Colgate, yeah.

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.680
Thank you.

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.680
All right.

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:07.680
Spencer Crittenden on Bees, Rob Schrab.

01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:08.680
Thank you so much.

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.680
We'll see you next time.

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.680
Thanks for coming out.

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:11.680
Drive safe.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:14.680
Take a buddy to your car.

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:43.680
It's a terrible neighborhood.

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.680
Did you get any of that?

01:54:45.680 --> 01:55:13.680
Yeah.
