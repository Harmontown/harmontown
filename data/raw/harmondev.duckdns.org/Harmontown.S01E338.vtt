{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.720\nOh, shit! Yeah! How's everybody doing tonight? Yeah! My name's Rob Schrab. I'm controlling\n\n00:17.720 --> 00:24.880\ntonight. Who cares? You care. Thank you very much. Welcome to Dynasty Typewriter, and we\n\n00:24.880 --> 00:30.720\nare going to be doing Harmontown is now in Sanctuary! Let's give it up for our\n\n00:30.720 --> 00:39.880\nDungeon Master, Spencer Crittenden. Look, it's so nice tonight. How you doing, Spencer?\n\n00:39.880 --> 00:53.880\nI'm good. Oh, man. It's been a while. Has it? No! Let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:53.880 --> 01:08.960\nDan Harmon.Town! Look at him! Yeah! Thank you. Thank you very much. From the bottom of my hip to the hop to the\n\n01:08.960 --> 01:24.960\nhip to the heart. Damn! Back in the day, I used to fuck your mama in a bell. Hey, and I used to milk her like a cow.\n\n01:24.960 --> 01:35.960\nAlright, sorry. Thank you very much. You got a little dill in there. I used to fuck her. Like a cow! Like a cow! I fucked your mama.\n\n01:35.960 --> 01:46.960\nI was talking about my UTI backstage, and Rob was like... You used to be represented by them.\n\n01:46.960 --> 02:01.960\nIt's true. Yeah, it's true. Twenty years. Urinary talent. International. I'm talking about my UTI, and\n\n02:01.960 --> 02:07.960\nRob's like squinting at me and listening, and then in between sentences he goes,\n\n02:07.960 --> 02:16.960\nAre you going to be low energy tonight? Well, I haven't been around for a while. I want to make it worth my while.\n\n02:16.960 --> 02:26.960\nYeah, we're here to serve. That's good. It'll be worth my while. You having a fun time working on my show?\n\n02:26.960 --> 02:32.960\nDon't you know? I don't know. Sometimes I'm not there. I went on vacation for a week. You were in there.\n\n02:32.960 --> 02:38.960\nI mean, I did already ask you offstage. I don't know. I'm just asking in front of people. Yeah, I'm having a great time.\n\n02:38.960 --> 02:46.960\nAlright, let's talk to Spencer. It's a great show. Spencer. Hey, hey Dan. Do you like what I'm doing on the show?\n\n02:46.960 --> 02:57.960\nThis one or the Rick and Morty? The Rick and Morty show. Am I pulling my weight? I think so. You don't weigh that much.\n\n02:57.960 --> 03:08.960\nI'm on that noon till eight fast. Have you heard of this? It's a new fast where you only eat from noon till 8 p.m.\n\n03:08.960 --> 03:19.960\nReally? Intermittent fasting? What's that? You're talking about intermittent fasting? Why is it intermittent? It's intermittent because fasting would mean you aren't eating at all.\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:27.960\nSee, Dan? Yeah. This is weird for two reasons. First of all, breakfast, fast, is right in the name. I've never understood that.\n\n03:27.960 --> 03:36.960\nOh, well, it means breaking the fast probably from sleeping all night. But this is now in a world where I'm rarely surprised anymore about these new dietary fads.\n\n03:36.960 --> 03:45.960\nThis is the one I really thought they'd never... Breakfast now is out. Is it the most important meal of the day, the one that sets your metabolism?\n\n03:45.960 --> 03:51.960\nYou know that the breakfast is the most important meal of the day is a marketing slogan invented to sell bacon.\n\n03:51.960 --> 04:04.960\nAlright. Just bacon? Just bacon. It turns out that people weren't liking all these lean cuts of pork and they were like, let's make all this fatty pork\n\n04:04.960 --> 04:11.960\nand no one knew what bacon was, no one wanted bacon. Also, then they were making the lean cuts of pork because people were like, fat!\n\n04:11.960 --> 04:19.960\nOh, no! Not fat! We gotta have carbs and shit! And then so they were like, but bacon. And then that got people into bacon.\n\n04:19.960 --> 04:26.960\nAnd then they're like, bacon. And that's where bacon culture came from, was just trying to sell this shitty scrap of pork that weren't selling as lean.\n\n04:26.960 --> 04:33.960\nIt's funny the idea of me being disappointed to find out where bacon culture came from. Like there's a purer place.\n\n04:33.960 --> 04:40.960\nI thought farmers made it up around the breakfast table and handed it down like pagans.\n\n04:40.960 --> 04:47.960\nIn a world where Coke invented Santa Claus. Right.\n\n04:47.960 --> 04:53.960\nI like that stuff. I just wish that we wouldn't ruin it by then taking it too seriously. That's what Campbell always said.\n\n04:53.960 --> 05:00.960\nHe was like, all ceremony is great. He was a Catholic choir boy. He was into the Boy Scouts.\n\n05:00.960 --> 05:04.960\nHe loved ceremony. He loved ritual. He thought it was so important.\n\n05:04.960 --> 05:12.960\nYou know, Campbell recommended that he's like, you know, in a lot of like the more grounded tribal societies that we can still observe today,\n\n05:12.960 --> 05:19.960\nthey maintain this thing where if you make it to middle age, there's a point where you should change your name. Doesn't that sound organic?\n\n05:19.960 --> 05:20.960\nYeah, that does.\n\n05:20.960 --> 05:26.960\nAnd when Cody proposed to me and she was like, you know, she put Dan Heller on the ring, I'm like, I think I'm going to commit to that.\n\n05:26.960 --> 05:29.960\nNot because I respect women because I hate myself.\n\n05:29.960 --> 05:30.960\nYeah.\n\n05:30.960 --> 05:33.960\nAnd like, it was really thought about because they really haven't even been noticing.\n\n05:33.960 --> 05:38.960\nI've been kind of like a real gooberious schnook, you know, in this show.\n\n05:38.960 --> 05:42.960\nI hate doing the show. I hate myself. It's myself. I hate. I don't hate you guys.\n\n05:42.960 --> 05:43.960\nYeah.\n\n05:43.960 --> 05:46.960\nIt would definitely cut down on the Google like trauma.\n\n05:46.960 --> 05:51.960\nYeah, it's like it's both simultaneously. It hits the chicken shit spot.\n\n05:51.960 --> 05:56.960\nBut for like this noble, exciting reason, doesn't Daniel Heller sound like a writer?\n\n05:56.960 --> 05:57.960\nSure.\n\n05:57.960 --> 06:01.960\nPartially because there's Hellers that are famous writers.\n\n06:01.960 --> 06:03.960\nHow about Danny?\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:06.960\nDanny. Well, okay, I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm not going to poop.\n\n06:06.960 --> 06:08.960\nDanny Elizabeth Heller.\n\n06:08.960 --> 06:14.960\nBut I think I think the mistake that I made when I was in eighth grade, I started, I would hit, you know, those puberty hormones.\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:18.960\nI started going like, don't call me. Stop calling me Daniel. Call me Dan.\n\n06:18.960 --> 06:20.960\nI thought that was such a manly move.\n\n06:20.960 --> 06:23.960\nNo offense to Dan's out there. I'm one of you.\n\n06:23.960 --> 06:27.960\nBut it was just like, I was already a Daniel and I threw that shit away.\n\n06:27.960 --> 06:35.960\nI had this amazing biblical name that was like steeped in blood and fucking like conquering and like through through your art.\n\n06:35.960 --> 06:38.960\nYou know, like like the story of Daniel such a great one.\n\n06:38.960 --> 06:40.960\nYeah, Daniel in the lion's den.\n\n06:40.960 --> 06:41.960\nYeah.\n\n06:41.960 --> 06:47.960\nHe was an interpreter of dreams and then like his competitors were like, let's catch him being a Jew or whatever.\n\n06:47.960 --> 06:53.960\nAnd they they like they ratted him out and then we're a Christian.\n\n06:53.960 --> 06:57.960\nI don't even know what I don't even know which Bible the Daniel story is in.\n\n06:57.960 --> 06:59.960\nI think it's Old Testament, right? It's a Hebrew name.\n\n06:59.960 --> 07:02.960\nBut they so so I can't remember.\n\n07:02.960 --> 07:04.960\nI saw veggie tales about it.\n\n07:04.960 --> 07:06.960\nHell yeah.\n\n07:06.960 --> 07:09.960\nAnd played by a carrot.\n\n07:09.960 --> 07:10.960\nYeah, sure.\n\n07:10.960 --> 07:11.960\nI eat it.\n\n07:11.960 --> 07:15.960\nAnd then I read the the actual story and whatever Bible it was.\n\n07:15.960 --> 07:19.960\nAnd it was like, wow, this is like they yeah, they threw him in the den.\n\n07:19.960 --> 07:21.960\nAnd but then the God was like, fuck you.\n\n07:21.960 --> 07:28.960\nAnd then but then and then it was like all of the people who betrayed him and conspired against him.\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:31.960\nI think all of them and all of their families got thrown in the lion's den.\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:35.960\nThey live that part of the veggie tales, even though they're vegetables.\n\n07:35.960 --> 07:39.960\nSo lions eating him wouldn't even be it would be good for them.\n\n07:39.960 --> 07:41.960\nI wonder if the lions were vegetables.\n\n07:41.960 --> 07:43.960\nDid the lions kill the family?\n\n07:43.960 --> 07:44.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n07:44.960 --> 07:47.960\nThey couldn't they couldn't spread that miracle.\n\n07:47.960 --> 07:52.960\nNo, I mean, if God made the lions not eat the families of the betrayers,\n\n07:52.960 --> 07:57.960\nthen only thing God would be succeeding demonstrating would be people who just euthanized the lions ago.\n\n07:57.960 --> 07:58.960\nThese lions are worn out.\n\n07:58.960 --> 07:59.960\nRight.\n\n07:59.960 --> 08:00.960\nNot eating anybody.\n\n08:00.960 --> 08:02.960\nAnd God was like, nope, flip the script.\n\n08:02.960 --> 08:05.960\nThose lions are eating non Christians.\n\n08:05.960 --> 08:07.960\nNon Christians.\n\n08:07.960 --> 08:16.960\nI guess it was like Daniel was like he got this gig like as basically the king's therapist and it wasn't a Christian empire.\n\n08:16.960 --> 08:19.960\nAnd the king would say, hey, Daniel, I had this dream.\n\n08:19.960 --> 08:20.960\nCan you interpret it?\n\n08:20.960 --> 08:26.960\nAnd Daniel would basically take every dream and interpret it as like sounds like you should be Christian.\n\n08:26.960 --> 08:28.960\nAnd the king was like nibbling on that hook.\n\n08:28.960 --> 08:31.960\nAnd that's why his peeps were like, we got to get rid of this Daniel.\n\n08:31.960 --> 08:33.960\nThey fucked with the wrong guy.\n\n08:33.960 --> 08:38.960\nSo what did God put the lion and made the lion sleep?\n\n08:38.960 --> 08:40.960\nHe shut their mouths.\n\n08:40.960 --> 08:41.960\nHe shut their mouths.\n\n08:41.960 --> 08:43.960\nHe shut the lion's mouth.\n\n08:43.960 --> 08:45.960\nHe said, shut your mouth.\n\n08:45.960 --> 08:48.960\nAnd then Daniel fell asleep too.\n\n08:48.960 --> 08:50.960\nAnd they woke up and then like the guards woke up.\n\n08:50.960 --> 08:52.960\nHe probably pretended to be asleep just to like show off.\n\n08:52.960 --> 08:55.960\nThe guards the next morning going, oh, we better clean up all that blood and stuff.\n\n08:55.960 --> 08:57.960\nOh, what's up guys?\n\n08:57.960 --> 08:59.960\nCan I have a late check out?\n\n08:59.960 --> 09:02.960\nHey, that guy's sleeping with the lions.\n\n09:02.960 --> 09:03.960\nAll right.\n\n09:03.960 --> 09:08.960\nAnyways, but I would name myself Legubrius Schnook.\n\n09:08.960 --> 09:12.960\nAre you are you a imperial bounty hunter?\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:15.960\nYeah, I'm certainly like a wizarding bureaucrat.\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:17.960\nOkay.\n\n09:17.960 --> 09:20.960\nSo tell me about the bees.\n\n09:20.960 --> 09:22.960\nLet me tell you about these bees.\n\n09:22.960 --> 09:27.960\nSo some ex start from the start from.\n\n09:27.960 --> 09:29.960\nI interrupted you starting to tell you to start from the beginning.\n\n09:29.960 --> 09:35.960\nSome portion of time ago I was in Dan's backyard, you know, just snooping around looking for clues.\n\n09:35.960 --> 09:40.960\nAnd I'm noticing, man, there's some bees.\n\n09:40.960 --> 09:43.960\nThere's not like a lot of bees, but there's bees.\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:48.960\nAnd normally you see like a bee, you know, two bees didn't think about it.\n\n09:48.960 --> 09:52.960\nFast forward to these dudes doing stuff in Dan's house.\n\n09:52.960 --> 09:57.960\nThey're putting wires places and such and they're like, oh, there's a beehive in this wall.\n\n09:57.960 --> 10:01.960\nAnd we can't, we can't put cords through the wall because the bees.\n\n10:01.960 --> 10:04.960\nAnd I was like, oh, that explains those bees I saw.\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:08.960\nAnd so then I started trying to figure out how to deal with the bees.\n\n10:08.960 --> 10:09.960\nI called a bee company.\n\n10:09.960 --> 10:10.960\nA bee guy estimate came by.\n\n10:10.960 --> 10:12.960\nHe's like, here's what we do.\n\n10:12.960 --> 10:17.960\nWe open up the wall, we get out the bees, we close up the wall, bang, bang, boom.\n\n10:17.960 --> 10:18.960\nSounds great.\n\n10:18.960 --> 10:19.960\nWe'll come next Thursday.\n\n10:19.960 --> 10:22.960\nAnd I'm like, next Thursday, how about this Thursday?\n\n10:22.960 --> 10:23.960\nAnd they're like, eh.\n\n10:23.960 --> 10:25.960\nAnd then so I was like, okay, I'll see what I could do.\n\n10:25.960 --> 10:30.960\nAnd so I'm looking around for a different bee guy, found a different bee guy.\n\n10:30.960 --> 10:33.960\nAnd then I was like, okay, we got a bee guy to give us an estimate,\n\n10:33.960 --> 10:37.960\nbut we need a bee guy to come this Thursday, this Friday, something like that.\n\n10:37.960 --> 10:38.960\nCan you do that?\n\n10:38.960 --> 10:39.960\nAnd they're like, yeah.\n\n10:39.960 --> 10:41.960\nAnd so then we make the appointment.\n\n10:41.960 --> 10:44.960\nThen like two hours late, the bee guy calls me.\n\n10:44.960 --> 10:45.960\nHe's like, I'm on my way.\n\n10:45.960 --> 10:47.960\nAnd then a half hour later, he shows up.\n\n10:47.960 --> 10:50.960\nAnd then he's not prepared to do the job.\n\n10:50.960 --> 10:52.960\nHe just tells me what the last estimate guy told me.\n\n10:52.960 --> 10:53.960\nI'm like, yeah, no, I know.\n\n10:53.960 --> 10:54.960\nThat's why I called you.\n\n10:54.960 --> 10:56.960\nYou said you would be able to take care of the bees.\n\n10:56.960 --> 10:57.960\nYou can't.\n\n10:57.960 --> 11:00.960\nAnd so he's like, yeah, yeah, I'll come back.\n\n11:00.960 --> 11:01.960\nCome back on Monday.\n\n11:01.960 --> 11:03.960\nHe comes back on Monday.\n\n11:03.960 --> 11:05.960\nI see the guy.\n\n11:05.960 --> 11:08.960\nOh, one of the things he says, like, oh, they're in this wall.\n\n11:08.960 --> 11:09.960\nI've got to break open the wall.\n\n11:09.960 --> 11:12.960\nBut man, if that wall is made with cinder blocks,\n\n11:12.960 --> 11:17.960\nlike the only thing walls are made out of, that's going to be a problem.\n\n11:17.960 --> 11:18.960\nAnd I'm like, it is.\n\n11:18.960 --> 11:21.960\nThat seems like that's the whole job, really.\n\n11:21.960 --> 11:24.960\nWe didn't know it was made out of cinder blocks.\n\n11:24.960 --> 11:26.960\nBut I was like, I think it's a cinder block wall.\n\n11:26.960 --> 11:27.960\nIt is outdoors.\n\n11:27.960 --> 11:29.960\nAnd that's like, and then you look at these walls,\n\n11:29.960 --> 11:30.960\nthey're cinder block walls.\n\n11:30.960 --> 11:32.960\nLooks like a cinder block wall.\n\n11:32.960 --> 11:35.960\nYou know, it's about the thickness of a cinder block.\n\n11:35.960 --> 11:38.960\nAnd so, but he's like, yeah, I can do it.\n\n11:38.960 --> 11:39.960\nAnd then so he comes back.\n\n11:39.960 --> 11:40.960\nHe comes back today.\n\n11:40.960 --> 11:43.960\nAgain, two hours late.\n\n11:43.960 --> 11:46.960\nAnd not two hours like, not they give you a two hour window\n\n11:46.960 --> 11:48.960\nand it's at the end of the two hours window,\n\n11:48.960 --> 11:51.960\ntwo hours after the end of the window.\n\n11:51.960 --> 11:59.960\nAnd I see this guy and he's not carrying like a giant drill\n\n11:59.960 --> 12:03.960\nor a jackhammer or like a handheld impact hammer.\n\n12:03.960 --> 12:06.960\nAny of these things that I would expect to be necessary\n\n12:06.960 --> 12:07.960\nto take out a wall.\n\n12:07.960 --> 12:09.960\nAnd then I'm starting to understand this is why\n\n12:09.960 --> 12:11.960\ncinder block walls would pose a problem\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:14.960\nbecause he's not prepared to deal with what those are.\n\n12:14.960 --> 12:16.960\nAnd he does he have.\n\n12:16.960 --> 12:17.960\nOh, so he had nothing.\n\n12:17.960 --> 12:19.960\nHe had a bee smoker.\n\n12:19.960 --> 12:20.960\nA bee smoker.\n\n12:20.960 --> 12:22.960\nYeah, I'm like, that's not going to do the job.\n\n12:22.960 --> 12:28.960\nAnd he starts gathering up dried leaves from your yard\n\n12:28.960 --> 12:30.960\nto put the bee smoker.\n\n12:30.960 --> 12:31.960\nDidn't even bring his own smoke.\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:33.960\nYeah, he didn't even have like smoke chips\n\n12:33.960 --> 12:35.960\nor whatever the fuck or liquid smoke.\n\n12:35.960 --> 12:36.960\nI don't know how it works.\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:41.960\nBut so he so he doesn't have wall opening tools.\n\n12:41.960 --> 12:43.960\nAnd so he comes and looks at the wall and he's like,\n\n12:43.960 --> 12:44.960\nI'm going to have to open the wall.\n\n12:44.960 --> 12:46.960\nAnd I was like, yeah, that's what you said last time.\n\n12:46.960 --> 12:48.960\nThat's what I told you over the phone before you showed up\n\n12:48.960 --> 12:49.960\nin the first place.\n\n12:49.960 --> 12:51.960\nAnyway, he goes back to his car and he comes back\n\n12:51.960 --> 12:55.960\nwith a drill and a hammer, just like not even a big hammer,\n\n12:55.960 --> 12:58.960\nlike a normal sized hammer.\n\n12:58.960 --> 13:01.960\nAnd like, I think we're done here.\n\n13:01.960 --> 13:03.960\nBut he gets at it.\n\n13:03.960 --> 13:06.960\nAnd I'm watching because he starts smoking the bees.\n\n13:06.960 --> 13:08.960\nThe bees are getting pissed, which I mean,\n\n13:08.960 --> 13:10.960\nthe bees get pissed before he starts smoking.\n\n13:10.960 --> 13:12.960\nI think he was hitting the wall with a hammer\n\n13:12.960 --> 13:15.960\nand you could hear how ineffective the hammer was being\n\n13:15.960 --> 13:18.960\non the wall because it doesn't sound like anything's happening.\n\n13:18.960 --> 13:21.960\nIt just sounds like if you hit the sidewalk with a hammer.\n\n13:21.960 --> 13:28.960\nAnd so the plan is to pound the walls of the bees home\n\n13:28.960 --> 13:31.960\nwith a hammer that demonstrates its fortitude.\n\n13:31.960 --> 13:34.960\nAnd then when they come out to kill him,\n\n13:34.960 --> 13:39.960\nhe's going to start up the smoker with the homegrown leaves in it.\n\n13:39.960 --> 13:41.960\nAnd he wasn't aiming the smoker.\n\n13:41.960 --> 13:44.960\nI think the smoker had a spout, kind of like a tea kettle,\n\n13:44.960 --> 13:46.960\nlike a camping tea kettle.\n\n13:46.960 --> 13:48.960\nBut he didn't have it aimed that way.\n\n13:48.960 --> 13:51.960\nHe just had it above the area so it was like an incense stick\n\n13:51.960 --> 13:54.960\njust kind of burning the general vicinity of outdoors.\n\n13:54.960 --> 13:57.960\nI would have tried to pour smoke into the hole\n\n13:57.960 --> 13:59.960\nand then hit the hole with a hammer or something.\n\n13:59.960 --> 14:01.960\nWho knows? Anyway.\n\n14:01.960 --> 14:03.960\nSo then he pulls out his drill.\n\n14:03.960 --> 14:06.960\nIt's a cordless drill, which don't have a ton of...\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:08.960\nI mean, cordless drills have come a long way.\n\n14:08.960 --> 14:10.960\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n14:10.960 --> 14:12.960\nBut it did not look like the cordless drill.\n\n14:12.960 --> 14:15.960\nIt didn't have a horse power to it.\n\n14:15.960 --> 14:17.960\nSo I could hear him.\n\n14:17.960 --> 14:19.960\nHe's drilling a hole in the wall to try and break it open\n\n14:19.960 --> 14:22.960\nto try and get something that he could stab a hammer into or something.\n\n14:22.960 --> 14:25.960\nAnd I could hear the drill either running out of batteries\n\n14:25.960 --> 14:28.960\nor reaching the limit of its power.\n\n14:28.960 --> 14:30.960\nTorque.\n\n14:30.960 --> 14:32.960\nYeah, torque capabilities.\n\n14:32.960 --> 14:35.960\nAnd I'm like, yeah, no, this is definitely what I was expecting.\n\n14:35.960 --> 14:37.960\nI mean, not what I was expecting initially.\n\n14:37.960 --> 14:40.960\nLike when he showed up, I was like, this is just a disaster.\n\n14:40.960 --> 14:43.960\nAnd so then he tries for a while.\n\n14:43.960 --> 14:45.960\nAnd he's like, yeah, I can't get the wall open.\n\n14:45.960 --> 14:47.960\nI'm like, yeah, you don't say.\n\n14:47.960 --> 14:49.960\nAnd he's like, well, what do you want to do?\n\n14:49.960 --> 14:51.960\nYou could kill the bees.\n\n14:51.960 --> 14:53.960\nAnd I'm like, yeah, no, that was always on the table.\n\n14:53.960 --> 14:55.960\nThat's not what I was going for.\n\n14:55.960 --> 14:57.960\nI could have killed the bees.\n\n14:57.960 --> 15:00.960\nI don't even need an apiarist outfit.\n\n15:00.960 --> 15:03.960\nBut so eventually we...\n\n15:03.960 --> 15:05.960\nHe was like, you got to get someone...\n\n15:05.960 --> 15:07.960\nYou need a jackhammer to open.\n\n15:07.960 --> 15:09.960\nAnd I was like, yeah, that's why I was so surprised\n\n15:09.960 --> 15:11.960\nthat I had to bring one.\n\n15:11.960 --> 15:13.960\nAnd then I don't know.\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:15.960\nI was like, OK, so it sounds like one thing I'm going to have to do\n\n15:15.960 --> 15:17.960\nis find someone who can open the wall.\n\n15:17.960 --> 15:20.960\nThen when that happens, we'll get you back in.\n\n15:20.960 --> 15:22.960\nI'm just trying to make them feel better.\n\n15:22.960 --> 15:25.960\nAnd then we'll see about actually solving the problem.\n\n15:25.960 --> 15:27.960\nAnd if I can't get someone to open the wall,\n\n15:27.960 --> 15:31.960\nI'll spit a bunch of bleach in there or something.\n\n15:31.960 --> 15:33.960\nWith your mouth?\n\n15:33.960 --> 15:35.960\nYeah, with my mouth.\n\n15:35.960 --> 15:37.960\nThe number one spitting thing.\n\n15:37.960 --> 15:39.960\nCareful, don't swallow it.\n\n15:39.960 --> 15:41.960\nYou might cure your autism.\n\n15:41.960 --> 15:43.960\nIt's a little joke for our UK listeners.\n\n15:43.960 --> 15:45.960\nMy mom was...\n\n15:45.960 --> 15:47.960\nI was talking to my mom the other day and she's like,\n\n15:47.960 --> 15:49.960\nyou know, I hear if you dilute bleach,\n\n15:49.960 --> 15:51.960\nit's good for your health.\n\n15:51.960 --> 15:53.960\nAnd I was like, no, no, no.\n\n15:53.960 --> 15:55.960\nGet off the internet.\n\n15:55.960 --> 15:57.960\nLike a big thing in the UK there.\n\n15:57.960 --> 15:59.960\nLike, it's...\n\n15:59.960 --> 16:01.960\nMan, it's just awful.\n\n16:01.960 --> 16:03.960\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n16:03.960 --> 16:09.960\nWe are in our 30th, 40th, 50th year of mistreating autism in kids.\n\n16:09.960 --> 16:11.960\nEven though we know what it is now,\n\n16:11.960 --> 16:13.960\nvery good at diagnosing it,\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:16.960\nbut the more parents know what it is,\n\n16:16.960 --> 16:19.960\nthe more they just don't want their kids to have autism.\n\n16:19.960 --> 16:25.960\nSo in the 70s, they were cattle prodding kids into...\n\n16:25.960 --> 16:28.960\nLike, you know, you cattle prod an autistic kid enough.\n\n16:28.960 --> 16:30.960\nIf they're, depending on where they are in the spectrum,\n\n16:30.960 --> 16:33.960\nyou can train them to hug.\n\n16:33.960 --> 16:36.960\nIt's just fucking brutal, man.\n\n16:36.960 --> 16:39.960\nLike late 70s, this was happening in the United States.\n\n16:39.960 --> 16:41.960\nAnd people knowing that the kids...\n\n16:41.960 --> 16:43.960\nIt wasn't like they didn't know the kids were autistic.\n\n16:43.960 --> 16:46.960\nIt's like that was the big treatment for autism,\n\n16:46.960 --> 16:48.960\nwas this guy was like a guru.\n\n16:48.960 --> 16:51.960\nIt's like zapping kids to make them hug their parents.\n\n16:51.960 --> 16:54.960\nAnd anyways, but in the UK now,\n\n16:54.960 --> 16:56.960\nbecause we've evolved so much,\n\n16:56.960 --> 17:00.960\nnow there's a new wave of guru,\n\n17:00.960 --> 17:04.960\nlike somebody that's just younger the better.\n\n17:04.960 --> 17:08.960\nJust give them a little British cup of bleach.\n\n17:08.960 --> 17:09.960\nJust a little bleach drink.\n\n17:09.960 --> 17:11.960\nAnd you know how many ounces are in those.\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:13.960\nIt cleans out all those vaccines\n\n17:13.960 --> 17:15.960\nthat those fucking doctors filled them with.\n\n17:15.960 --> 17:18.960\nGet those vaccines out of there with the bleach.\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:23.960\nAnd then go outside and enjoy that sweet, flat earth.\n\n17:23.960 --> 17:26.960\nJust roll forever.\n\n17:26.960 --> 17:28.960\nOr don't roll forever.\n\n17:28.960 --> 17:29.960\nNo, God, I'm sorry.\n\n17:29.960 --> 17:31.960\nNo, that's what those idiots think.\n\n17:31.960 --> 17:32.960\nYou can roll forever.\n\n17:32.960 --> 17:35.960\nJust roll very carefully around outside,\n\n17:35.960 --> 17:37.960\ndepending on where you are.\n\n17:37.960 --> 17:39.960\nPeople are actually drinking bleach.\n\n17:39.960 --> 17:42.960\nNo, they're making kids drink it.\n\n17:42.960 --> 17:44.960\nThe kids...\n\n17:44.960 --> 17:46.960\nIf the kids...\n\n17:46.960 --> 17:47.960\nIsn't that killing?\n\n17:47.960 --> 17:48.960\nYeah, back in my day,\n\n17:48.960 --> 17:50.960\ntelling someone to drink bleach\n\n17:50.960 --> 17:52.960\nwas just telling them to kill themselves.\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:53.960\nRight.\n\n17:53.960 --> 17:54.960\nI'm sure they're diluting it,\n\n17:54.960 --> 17:56.960\nbut what they're doing is they're stripping\n\n17:56.960 --> 17:59.960\nthe esophageal mucus membranes, probably,\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:01.960\nprobably permanently damaging the kids\n\n18:01.960 --> 18:03.960\nin their developmental stages.\n\n18:03.960 --> 18:05.960\nSo they'll be autistic.\n\n18:05.960 --> 18:08.960\nAnd when they learn...\n\n18:08.960 --> 18:11.960\nAt the age when you usually already learn\n\n18:11.960 --> 18:13.960\neveryone's an idiot,\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:15.960\nimagine these poor kids is like,\n\n18:15.960 --> 18:16.960\nwhy can't I breathe?\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:18.960\nOh, you're a fucking idiot.\n\n18:18.960 --> 18:19.960\nThat's horrible.\n\n18:19.960 --> 18:21.960\nAnd you tried to make me hug you\n\n18:21.960 --> 18:23.960\nby poisoning me.\n\n18:23.960 --> 18:25.960\nWhy am I...\n\n18:25.960 --> 18:28.960\nYou know, autistic people invented the internet.\n\n18:28.960 --> 18:30.960\nThe next generation of autistic people\n\n18:30.960 --> 18:32.960\nare just going to all be Lex Luthor.\n\n18:32.960 --> 18:34.960\nThey're all going to kill us.\n\n18:34.960 --> 18:35.960\nThey're going to be like,\n\n18:35.960 --> 18:37.960\nI can't blame them.\n\n18:37.960 --> 18:38.960\nI'm not going to blame them.\n\n18:38.960 --> 18:41.960\nASPD says autistic people are meant to\n\n18:41.960 --> 18:43.960\ncreate the virtual reality of the future,\n\n18:43.960 --> 18:44.960\nand that's why they exist.\n\n18:44.960 --> 18:46.960\nWell, that's fully...\n\n18:46.960 --> 18:50.960\nI love ASPD's evolutionary...\n\n18:50.960 --> 18:51.960\nFuturism.\n\n18:51.960 --> 18:53.960\nTheories and stuff.\n\n18:53.960 --> 18:55.960\nLet's bring them up and have them talk about it.\n\n18:55.960 --> 18:56.960\nIs he here?\n\n18:56.960 --> 18:58.960\nAre you here, ASPD?\n\n18:58.960 --> 19:00.960\nI heard someone say, yeah, man.\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:04.960\nRyan Kraus, host of Cold Case Murder Mystery Files,\n\n19:04.960 --> 19:06.960\nis here with us.\n\n19:06.960 --> 19:07.960\nDamn.\n\n19:07.960 --> 19:08.960\nOh, okay.\n\n19:08.960 --> 19:09.960\nHey.\n\n19:09.960 --> 19:10.960\nHey.\n\n19:10.960 --> 19:11.960\nI guess it was really him saying,\n\n19:11.960 --> 19:15.960\nhey, so welcome to the show.\n\n19:15.960 --> 19:17.960\nWelcome to the show.\n\n19:17.960 --> 19:19.960\nIt'll be on at some point.\n\n19:19.960 --> 19:20.960\nHey, welcome.\n\n19:20.960 --> 19:21.960\nHey.\n\n19:21.960 --> 19:22.960\nWelcome.\n\n19:22.960 --> 19:23.960\nSo you were...\n\n19:23.960 --> 19:24.960\nYou ghosted us.\n\n19:24.960 --> 19:25.960\nYou were in the...\n\n19:25.960 --> 19:26.960\nI was stalking you.\n\n19:26.960 --> 19:27.960\nYou were stalking us.\n\n19:27.960 --> 19:28.960\nYeah.\n\n19:28.960 --> 19:29.960\nYou were in the writer's room all day.\n\n19:29.960 --> 19:30.960\nThat's true.\n\n19:30.960 --> 19:31.960\nYeah.\n\n19:31.960 --> 19:32.960\nPretty cool, huh?\n\n19:32.960 --> 19:33.960\nYeah, this was very cool.\n\n19:33.960 --> 19:34.960\nHollywood.\n\n19:34.960 --> 19:35.960\nGreat experience.\n\n19:35.960 --> 19:38.960\nGot to sit with Hollywood in a room.\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:39.960\nRight.\n\n19:39.960 --> 19:40.960\nYeah.\n\n19:40.960 --> 19:41.960\nWhat was that like?\n\n19:41.960 --> 19:42.960\nDid you like it?\n\n19:42.960 --> 19:45.960\nI think I was this far from you.\n\n19:45.960 --> 19:47.960\nThat's too close.\n\n19:47.960 --> 19:49.960\nYeah.\n\n19:49.960 --> 19:50.960\nHow was that experience?\n\n19:50.960 --> 19:51.960\nYeah.\n\n19:51.960 --> 19:52.960\nIt was a great experience.\n\n19:52.960 --> 19:53.960\nSpoiling anything.\n\n19:53.960 --> 19:54.960\nYeah.\n\n19:54.960 --> 19:55.960\nI mean, great.\n\n19:55.960 --> 19:57.960\nI enjoyed watching you do your work.\n\n19:57.960 --> 19:59.960\nAnd everybody talking beforehand.\n\n19:59.960 --> 20:00.960\nIt was amazing.\n\n20:00.960 --> 20:01.960\nYeah.\n\n20:01.960 --> 20:02.960\nI like this little shadow program.\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:04.960\nAs long as the writers don't mind it.\n\n20:04.960 --> 20:05.960\nThere's a table.\n\n20:05.960 --> 20:07.960\nAnd then there's a whole couch area that we're not using anyway.\n\n20:07.960 --> 20:08.960\nYeah.\n\n20:08.960 --> 20:10.960\nYou can just sit there and listen to us.\n\n20:10.960 --> 20:13.960\nAs long as it's someone I trust that's not going to...\n\n20:13.960 --> 20:17.960\nYou're going to hear like beyond spoilers.\n\n20:17.960 --> 20:19.960\nI mean, you're going to hear spoilers that we...\n\n20:19.960 --> 20:20.960\nYeah.\n\n20:20.960 --> 20:21.960\nI mean...\n\n20:21.960 --> 20:22.960\nYou want to...\n\n20:22.960 --> 20:26.960\nWhat spoilers did you hear today?\n\n20:26.960 --> 20:28.960\nOh, let's see.\n\n20:28.960 --> 20:30.960\nThe People's Basketball Court.\n\n20:30.960 --> 20:31.960\nYeah.\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:33.960\nDon't tell them what we're going to do with Wenwolf.\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:34.960\nYeah.\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:36.960\nI mean, I can't talk about that, right?\n\n20:36.960 --> 20:37.960\nYeah.\n\n20:37.960 --> 20:38.960\nI think I'm going to have...\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:40.960\nI'm trying to coordinate.\n\n20:40.960 --> 20:44.960\nMaybe I should just tell him to come into whatever he wants now.\n\n20:44.960 --> 20:49.960\nBut John Singleton's kid, Masai, who also graduated from USC,\n\n20:49.960 --> 20:51.960\nis kind of following his dad's footsteps.\n\n20:51.960 --> 20:52.960\nHe...\n\n20:52.960 --> 20:58.960\nLike the last conversation I had with his dad was about how his kid was so into Rick and Morty\n\n20:58.960 --> 21:00.960\nand wanted to know more about writing TV.\n\n21:00.960 --> 21:05.960\nAnd I want to get him in there to...\n\n21:05.960 --> 21:07.960\nI feel like we're not...\n\n21:07.960 --> 21:10.960\nIt's just like this story, I've babbled about this before,\n\n21:10.960 --> 21:13.960\nbut the craft of story breaking,\n\n21:13.960 --> 21:20.960\nit seems like such a waste that even I still feel like I'm doing it for the first time every time\n\n21:20.960 --> 21:23.960\nbecause it's like there's no...\n\n21:23.960 --> 21:28.960\nWe need to record and figure out.\n\n21:28.960 --> 21:33.960\nThere needs to be a time life book for breaking stories\n\n21:33.960 --> 21:41.960\nat some point so that we can stop wasting time and keep evolving.\n\n21:41.960 --> 21:43.960\nBut it's like you sit in a room and you're like,\n\n21:43.960 --> 21:45.960\noh, how come this doesn't feel like an episode of Small Wonder yet?\n\n21:45.960 --> 21:47.960\nAnd then you talk for six hours,\n\n21:47.960 --> 21:50.960\nlike what if Small Wonder had an STD?\n\n21:50.960 --> 21:52.960\nAnd then you're like, oh, we got it, we got it.\n\n21:52.960 --> 21:54.960\nNow that sounds like an episode of Small Wonder,\n\n21:54.960 --> 21:56.960\nbut what you're not doing is...\n\n21:56.960 --> 21:58.960\nLook, I've said this before,\n\n21:58.960 --> 22:01.960\nbut it's like if you're a carpenter and you go like,\n\n22:01.960 --> 22:03.960\nokay, this is called a joist.\n\n22:03.960 --> 22:04.960\nWe figured this out.\n\n22:04.960 --> 22:06.960\nThis has a function, it holds a certain amount of weight,\n\n22:06.960 --> 22:08.960\nand so you use it this way,\n\n22:08.960 --> 22:10.960\nyou put this in at 90 degrees and stuff.\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:14.960\nThen you write it down and carpenters don't have to fucking every time they build a house,\n\n22:14.960 --> 22:17.960\ngo like, huh, so you want to contain people?\n\n22:17.960 --> 22:19.960\nI don't do that joist.\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:21.960\nAnd then they have to reinvent the joist.\n\n22:21.960 --> 22:25.960\nThat's what writers have been doing in TV writer's rooms for basically 60 years\n\n22:25.960 --> 22:30.960\nis every single season of almost every episode,\n\n22:30.960 --> 22:32.960\nthey reinvent the story joist.\n\n22:32.960 --> 22:35.960\nAnd that includes me because I just kind of...\n\n22:35.960 --> 22:40.960\nI took photos of every whiteboard when we would work on community.\n\n22:40.960 --> 22:43.960\nI'm sure those are around somewhere in some digital box.\n\n22:43.960 --> 22:47.960\nI always wanted to do a book or something that would like...\n\n22:47.960 --> 22:49.960\nTry to figure this out.\n\n22:49.960 --> 22:57.960\nJust so that a subsequent generation can be like, okay, so our goal isn't joists.\n\n22:57.960 --> 23:01.960\nIt doesn't make us Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\n23:01.960 --> 23:05.960\nThat's just architecture 101.\n\n23:05.960 --> 23:07.960\nLet's finish that.\n\n23:07.960 --> 23:13.960\nIt's deconstructed, it's reconstructed, it's done, it's geometry, foundations, basic shit.\n\n23:13.960 --> 23:18.960\nSo let's use those principles to either A,\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:22.960\nonce you understand them, you can then defy them.\n\n23:22.960 --> 23:24.960\nI'm not a pedant.\n\n23:24.960 --> 23:27.960\nI've been like, oh, so that they always know what to do.\n\n23:27.960 --> 23:29.960\nBut also, you can just...\n\n23:29.960 --> 23:32.960\nIt's like, okay, we understand chords now, so let's write a song.\n\n23:32.960 --> 23:34.960\nI don't know, whatever.\n\n23:34.960 --> 23:39.960\nI'm sure there is an answer to this question, but hearing all that, there are books on screenwriting.\n\n23:39.960 --> 23:45.960\nSo what don't those do to formalize the process to the extent you're talking about?\n\n23:45.960 --> 23:49.960\nI don't know of any books, and I'm sure there are some,\n\n23:49.960 --> 23:55.960\nbut I don't know of any books that are basically more like manuals for collaborative\n\n23:55.960 --> 24:01.960\nand mass-produced, like no bullshit, like,\n\n24:01.960 --> 24:05.960\ntelevision TV writers' rooms, basically.\n\n24:05.960 --> 24:08.960\nGee, I wonder why there aren't books...\n\n24:08.960 --> 24:11.960\nWe were sold 900 copies by now.\n\n24:11.960 --> 24:15.960\nBut I also think that the principles that...\n\n24:15.960 --> 24:20.960\nIf you tried to write a textbook for TV writers' rooms on how to break stories,\n\n24:20.960 --> 24:25.960\nthat I believe that the principles therein would make everybody better at everything.\n\n24:25.960 --> 24:27.960\nYeah, no, I'd agree.\n\n24:27.960 --> 24:31.960\nBecause really, it's like, at the core of it is,\n\n24:31.960 --> 24:33.960\neverything that I do wrong when I try to write by myself,\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:35.960\nI'm doing because I'm not talking to other people,\n\n24:35.960 --> 24:38.960\nand then everything I'm doing wrong when I'm working with other writers,\n\n24:38.960 --> 24:44.960\neverything that's being done right or wrong is happening verbally\n\n24:44.960 --> 24:46.960\nin an exchange between people.\n\n24:46.960 --> 24:51.960\nBut that's what makes that place the right place to MRI the process,\n\n24:51.960 --> 24:55.960\nbecause, oh, we have transcripts from the writer's assistant,\n\n24:55.960 --> 24:59.960\nwe have results, we have things going from idea to episode.\n\n24:59.960 --> 25:01.960\nThat's why I'm so...\n\n25:01.960 --> 25:08.960\nI've been screaming and pulling my hair out about the development of interactive whiteboard technology,\n\n25:08.960 --> 25:10.960\nbecause it's like...\n\n25:10.960 --> 25:14.960\nWe have the technology, but no one makes it because there's no specific need\n\n25:14.960 --> 25:20.960\nfor the exact technology that a writer's room would need.\n\n25:20.960 --> 25:22.960\nBut it's like, if we had that 10 years ago,\n\n25:22.960 --> 25:26.960\nyou'd now have 10 years on a hard drive of community story breaking and stuff,\n\n25:26.960 --> 25:33.960\nincluding McKenna and Gans and Andrew Guest working on multiple story circles\n\n25:33.960 --> 25:37.960\nfor every character in the dice episode.\n\n25:37.960 --> 25:39.960\nI'm a big fan of my work.\n\n25:39.960 --> 25:42.960\nAnd I just think it should be stored for all time.\n\n25:42.960 --> 25:44.960\nI mean, I'm getting ready to retire here.\n\n25:44.960 --> 25:46.960\nYou guys are gonna...\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:50.960\nRemember when Gandalf had to fight that ball rock?\n\n25:50.960 --> 25:55.960\nImagine if he bought a house instead of coming back and clean her robe.\n\n25:55.960 --> 25:58.960\nCan we throw out some cold case files?\n\n25:58.960 --> 25:59.960\nOkay, yeah, sorry.\n\n25:59.960 --> 26:00.960\nI don't know what got me on that.\n\n26:00.960 --> 26:02.960\nOh, it's because you were in the room today, which I was thrilled about,\n\n26:02.960 --> 26:05.960\nbecause you're such a smart guy, and you expressed interest in it,\n\n26:05.960 --> 26:08.960\nand I trust you implicitly had dinner with you when you were on the show,\n\n26:08.960 --> 26:13.960\nand I was like, this guy's definitely not gonna run into the street and go,\n\n26:13.960 --> 26:17.960\nBeth is a clone!\n\n26:17.960 --> 26:20.960\nThe...\n\n26:20.960 --> 26:22.960\nYou'll see.\n\n26:22.960 --> 26:25.960\nShe's a meeseeks.\n\n26:25.960 --> 26:31.960\nEvil Morty made her out of a clone box.\n\n26:31.960 --> 26:34.960\nBut also, I think that...\n\n26:34.960 --> 26:38.960\nI don't want to make people hate you by saying this, but I do think that...\n\n26:38.960 --> 26:40.960\nA lot of people already do, it's fine.\n\n26:40.960 --> 26:42.960\nLike who? Like who hates you?\n\n26:42.960 --> 26:43.960\nHave you ever been getting...\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:45.960\nI mean, do you get hate mail?\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:46.960\nOh, definitely, yeah.\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:48.960\nPeople are like, hey, you should say that.\n\n26:48.960 --> 26:50.960\nStop doing that.\n\n26:50.960 --> 26:51.960\nDo you ever get that?\n\n26:51.960 --> 26:52.960\nI actually...\n\n26:52.960 --> 26:55.960\nI get those from people who pay to listen to my podcast, yeah.\n\n26:55.960 --> 26:56.960\nI have a lot of hate lists.\n\n26:56.960 --> 27:00.960\nWhat's like the worst, like, hey, you should stop?\n\n27:00.960 --> 27:02.960\nLike, in that area?\n\n27:02.960 --> 27:07.960\nI think there was one person who left a review for me on Apple Podcast\n\n27:07.960 --> 27:12.960\nthat suggested one of my episodes was going to\n\n27:12.960 --> 27:15.960\nlead a lot of people to commit suicide.\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:17.960\nWhich episode, do you remember one episode?\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:19.960\nThe Jameson family.\n\n27:19.960 --> 27:22.960\nSo it's a mystery where this family in...\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:26.960\nI think it was Oklahoma, drove off into the wilderness in a pickup truck.\n\n27:26.960 --> 27:30.960\nThey've been behaving very strangely beforehand, and it was on camera.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:34.960\nAnd so no one really knows if they succumbed to mental illness\n\n27:34.960 --> 27:39.960\nand it was a murder suicide, or if they were stopped somewhere and murdered.\n\n27:39.960 --> 27:43.960\nAnd, you know, I suggested that I thought based upon their behavior\n\n27:43.960 --> 27:49.960\nprior to leaving that they actually were involved in a murder suicide.\n\n27:49.960 --> 27:52.960\nAnd so this person just took it from there.\n\n27:52.960 --> 27:55.960\nWhen you say they were acting strangely, what do you mean?\n\n27:55.960 --> 27:56.960\nWhat were they just...\n\n27:56.960 --> 28:01.960\nThere's this video of them packing their vehicle,\n\n28:01.960 --> 28:07.960\nand it's just really something you have to check out, but...\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:09.960\nThey kind of look like Sims.\n\n28:09.960 --> 28:13.960\nYeah, I mean, it almost looks like they're robots.\n\n28:13.960 --> 28:16.960\nI mean, you don't see any emotion.\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:19.960\nIt doesn't look like they're interacting in any way whatsoever.\n\n28:19.960 --> 28:25.960\nThey're packing for a trip, but it's just this very monotonous movement\n\n28:25.960 --> 28:31.960\nthat just doesn't actually lead to anything involving emotion, I guess.\n\n28:31.960 --> 28:34.960\nAnd behind the scenes, they already...\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:38.960\nThey were expressing in what ways...\n\n28:38.960 --> 28:43.960\nThey felt like they were in the midst of some supernatural grip or something.\n\n28:43.960 --> 28:45.960\nHow do we know that about them before they died?\n\n28:45.960 --> 28:49.960\nYeah, well, they made a lot of suggestions to people at their church.\n\n28:49.960 --> 28:51.960\nAnd so that didn't go over very well.\n\n28:51.960 --> 28:53.960\nChurchy folk.\n\n28:53.960 --> 28:56.960\nSee, that's a good reason not to be religious.\n\n28:56.960 --> 28:59.960\nIf there's fucking demons in your actual life,\n\n28:59.960 --> 29:02.960\nand you tell people at Hardee's...\n\n29:02.960 --> 29:05.960\nOh, Hardee's was a restaurant. What am I doing?\n\n29:05.960 --> 29:07.960\nIf you tell people you were...\n\n29:07.960 --> 29:09.960\nIt's like anywhere but church.\n\n29:09.960 --> 29:10.960\nAt church, they're probably just like,\n\n29:10.960 --> 29:13.960\noh, yeah, just drink more fluids.\n\n29:13.960 --> 29:17.960\nAnd I was like, no, man, you gotta tell people that you're being haunted by demons.\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:19.960\nYou get the right treatment.\n\n29:19.960 --> 29:21.960\nEven if that's demonology, I don't care.\n\n29:21.960 --> 29:23.960\nYou gotta tell somebody other than your congregation,\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:25.960\nand they're not gonna give a shit.\n\n29:25.960 --> 29:27.960\nWell, that was essentially the things.\n\n29:27.960 --> 29:29.960\nThey were looking for a gun,\n\n29:29.960 --> 29:32.960\nbecause they had some sort of a problem with a demon or something like that.\n\n29:32.960 --> 29:37.960\nAnd a pastor, I probably don't have to ask.\n\n29:37.960 --> 29:40.960\nSpecial bullets, I assume.\n\n29:40.960 --> 29:41.960\nDemon bullets.\n\n29:41.960 --> 29:43.960\nWell, they did get the gun,\n\n29:43.960 --> 29:47.960\nand strangely, they found a hole in the skull of the father's head\n\n29:47.960 --> 29:49.960\nwhen they found the remains.\n\n29:49.960 --> 29:52.960\nSo we don't know if that's a bullet hole, but it could be.\n\n29:52.960 --> 29:54.960\nThis is what confused me about it\n\n29:54.960 --> 29:56.960\nwhen I was listening from what I remember of your episode,\n\n29:56.960 --> 30:02.960\nis that the gun was not there, right?\n\n30:02.960 --> 30:05.960\nNo, they didn't find the gun.\n\n30:05.960 --> 30:07.960\nWhen they first searched for the bodies,\n\n30:07.960 --> 30:09.960\nthey didn't find anything in that area,\n\n30:09.960 --> 30:12.960\nand then the skeletons were out wide open,\n\n30:12.960 --> 30:17.960\njust sitting there for anyone to see at a later point.\n\n30:17.960 --> 30:19.960\nThey just believed that they might have been moved,\n\n30:19.960 --> 30:21.960\nbut they could have just missed it.\n\n30:21.960 --> 30:25.960\nI thought they were laid flat.\n\n30:25.960 --> 30:28.960\nThey were huddled next to each other.\n\n30:28.960 --> 30:30.960\nI don't know how flat they were,\n\n30:30.960 --> 30:32.960\nbut they were huddled right next to each other.\n\n30:32.960 --> 30:35.960\nThis is one that you did not solve, correct?\n\n30:35.960 --> 30:37.960\nI would lean toward a murder-suicide,\n\n30:37.960 --> 30:39.960\nbecause of their behavior.\n\n30:39.960 --> 30:41.960\nBut how can you do murder-suicide without...\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:44.960\nYou're saying a coyote came and took the gun,\n\n30:44.960 --> 30:46.960\nor whoever moved the bodies.\n\n30:46.960 --> 30:48.960\nSomebody maybe found the gun.\n\n30:48.960 --> 30:51.960\nI would take a gun from a bunch of dead bodies.\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:53.960\nYeah, I mean...\n\n30:53.960 --> 30:55.960\nWhy would you do that?\n\n30:55.960 --> 30:59.960\nWell, I don't have a gun, and they're not using it.\n\n30:59.960 --> 31:01.960\nI would probably tell the police,\n\n31:01.960 --> 31:04.960\nI'm taking this gun, but I found it off a bunch of dead bodies.\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:06.960\nIt wasn't me, by the way.\n\n31:06.960 --> 31:08.960\nYou didn't even want a gun from a gun store.\n\n31:08.960 --> 31:11.960\nYou're not going to take one from the absolute billboard\n\n31:11.960 --> 31:13.960\nfor non-gun ownership.\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:15.960\nI absolutely would.\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:18.960\nI would have turned if you find it on a quest.\n\n31:18.960 --> 31:22.960\nYou'd be silly not to take it from a bunch of skeletons.\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:25.960\nI mean, I probably would have defeated the skeletons first.\n\n31:28.960 --> 31:30.960\nGo on, sorry, you got it.\n\n31:30.960 --> 31:32.960\nYeah, sorry.\n\n31:33.960 --> 31:35.960\nBecause obviously, it goes without saying you can't...\n\n31:35.960 --> 31:37.960\nBut if he thought they were afflicted by a demon,\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:40.960\nhe might have thought that was the only way to stop the demon,\n\n31:40.960 --> 31:42.960\nwas to kill it while it was possessing his family,\n\n31:42.960 --> 31:46.960\nor he might have been delusional enough to think that he was possessed by the demon,\n\n31:46.960 --> 31:49.960\nso he might be taken by violence and then realized what he'd done.\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:52.960\nBut were there only holes in his head?\n\n31:52.960 --> 31:54.960\nOr were there holes in everybody's head?\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:56.960\nNo, they just found a hole in his head.\n\n31:56.960 --> 32:00.960\nBut what was interesting is that there was a very large envelope of cash\n\n32:00.960 --> 32:02.960\nunderneath the seat in his truck.\n\n32:02.960 --> 32:04.960\nSo if it had been foul play,\n\n32:04.960 --> 32:07.960\nit stands to reason that somebody probably would have looked for his truck.\n\n32:07.960 --> 32:10.960\nOr not, but I would assume you would.\n\n32:10.960 --> 32:14.960\nAssuming that the money was the motivator for the foul play\n\n32:14.960 --> 32:16.960\nand that they knew about the money,\n\n32:16.960 --> 32:20.960\nwhich they would have probably because they were driving around\n\n32:20.960 --> 32:24.960\nostensibly looking for property and saying they had the cash to buy it.\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:27.960\nSo Occam's razor would say if it was foul play,\n\n32:27.960 --> 32:31.960\nit would be related to someone who heard they had a bunch of cash.\n\n32:31.960 --> 32:34.960\nAnd the cash wouldn't have been found in such a simple location.\n\n32:34.960 --> 32:37.960\nBut also just like killing someone is a dangerous thing.\n\n32:37.960 --> 32:40.960\nSo if you're not going to get anything from it,\n\n32:40.960 --> 32:42.960\nyou might just look.\n\n32:42.960 --> 32:45.960\nAnd the money was not like in a hidden Han Solo compartment.\n\n32:45.960 --> 32:48.960\nIt was like where if you were willing to kill,\n\n32:48.960 --> 32:52.960\nyou would be willing to look, which was under the seat of their car.\n\n32:52.960 --> 32:55.960\nAnd it's not like deliverance where there was like a hut nearby\n\n32:55.960 --> 32:59.960\nwhere people lived that might have killed them just because killing's fun.\n\n32:59.960 --> 33:01.960\nThat's been suggested as well.\n\n33:01.960 --> 33:04.960\nBut I mean, they think that the truck might have been moved from the last place\n\n33:04.960 --> 33:07.960\nthat the father drove it, but we just don't know.\n\n33:07.960 --> 33:08.960\nThat one's just creepy, man.\n\n33:08.960 --> 33:11.960\nThere's video footage of them like just loading up their car.\n\n33:11.960 --> 33:14.960\nHow many family members?\n\n33:14.960 --> 33:15.960\nJust three.\n\n33:15.960 --> 33:17.960\nAnd they're all in on it.\n\n33:17.960 --> 33:19.960\nHow old were the kids?\n\n33:19.960 --> 33:20.960\nI forget.\n\n33:20.960 --> 33:21.960\nI think it was just one.\n\n33:21.960 --> 33:22.960\nI think they just had a daughter.\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:24.960\nI can't recall.\n\n33:24.960 --> 33:28.960\nYeah, it's terrible because I'm cracking funnies,\n\n33:28.960 --> 33:30.960\nbut there's victims here.\n\n33:30.960 --> 33:34.960\nI mean, it's not like the Heaven's Gate thing.\n\n33:34.960 --> 33:37.960\nThere's victims there, too, if they believed they were going to get in a flying saucer.\n\n33:37.960 --> 33:40.960\nBut I mean, you're a dependent in your family,\n\n33:40.960 --> 33:44.960\nand you end up, regardless of what combination of murder, suicide, it was,\n\n33:44.960 --> 33:45.960\nshe's a victim.\n\n33:45.960 --> 33:52.960\nAnd I mean, it's like supernatural theories aside,\n\n33:52.960 --> 33:57.960\nthat makes me really upset to think that she was so captive, for instance,\n\n33:57.960 --> 34:02.960\nthat she's like loading a car that she possibly knows.\n\n34:02.960 --> 34:06.960\nBut you talked about how they didn't think,\n\n34:06.960 --> 34:10.960\nwhatever, listen to the episode, will you?\n\n34:10.960 --> 34:19.960\nYou did like a four or five hour one on this dude who wanted to commit quantum suicide with his girlfriend.\n\n34:19.960 --> 34:21.960\nOh yeah, that was pretty crazy.\n\n34:21.960 --> 34:27.960\nAnd you hooked into a little bit of Dan Harmon's story circle of magic there.\n\n34:27.960 --> 34:29.960\nI appreciated that.\n\n34:29.960 --> 34:30.960\nThat's not why I like you.\n\n34:30.960 --> 34:33.960\nI'm not a flattery person.\n\n34:33.960 --> 34:36.960\nWhat is a quantum suicide?\n\n34:36.960 --> 34:40.960\nSo the quantum suicide, the idea is that you're going to commit suicide,\n\n34:40.960 --> 34:44.960\nbut when you die in this world, you're going to transcend to another,\n\n34:44.960 --> 34:48.960\nwhere you made a better decision and you have a better existence moving forward.\n\n34:48.960 --> 34:51.960\nDidn't work out too well.\n\n34:51.960 --> 34:56.960\nSo the idea is he's going to kill himself to go to a better place.\n\n34:56.960 --> 34:59.960\nYeah, he's going to jump off a cliff to go to a better place.\n\n34:59.960 --> 35:00.960\nThe ground.\n\n35:00.960 --> 35:02.960\nYeah, that's what happened.\n\n35:02.960 --> 35:07.960\nBut the cliff he chose to jump off of was like 30 feet.\n\n35:07.960 --> 35:14.960\nSo it was like when Batman drops Falcone off of the thing,\n\n35:14.960 --> 35:19.960\nhe's like, hey, pick a better spot.\n\n35:19.960 --> 35:23.960\nIt was like a fall that looked like it was guaranteed to just horribly injure you\n\n35:23.960 --> 35:25.960\nif you fell off of it.\n\n35:25.960 --> 35:30.960\nThat's fucked up with Batman.\n\n35:30.960 --> 35:31.960\nYeah.\n\n35:31.960 --> 35:34.960\nYou know, he used to use a gun.\n\n35:34.960 --> 35:35.960\nDid he ever?\n\n35:35.960 --> 35:37.960\nYeah, he shot some people before.\n\n35:37.960 --> 35:40.960\nAnd then it's like Batman doesn't use guns.\n\n35:40.960 --> 35:42.960\nWait, like in the comic book?\n\n35:42.960 --> 35:45.960\nYeah, yeah, no, he used to have, you know, back in the olden days,\n\n35:45.960 --> 35:48.960\nwhen he wasn't very well established, he would just sometimes shoot people.\n\n35:48.960 --> 35:51.960\nA guy with ears on his hat that would show up at crime scenes.\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:52.960\nRight.\n\n35:52.960 --> 35:54.960\nI'm sure, yeah.\n\n35:54.960 --> 35:57.960\nI love that that's how Batman started.\n\n35:57.960 --> 35:59.960\nI'm a detective.\n\n35:59.960 --> 36:02.960\nWhat were they called?\n\n36:02.960 --> 36:04.960\nWhat did the gun shoot?\n\n36:04.960 --> 36:07.960\nJust batlets.\n\n36:07.960 --> 36:12.960\nThat's why he stopped using it because of the...\n\n36:12.960 --> 36:15.960\nI'm gonna fill you full of batlets.\n\n36:15.960 --> 36:16.960\nWhat?\n\n36:16.960 --> 36:17.960\nI don't think he was that.\n\n36:17.960 --> 36:20.960\nI don't know if he even had like the Batarang or anything back then.\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:23.960\nHe was just capping people, just running around.\n\n36:23.960 --> 36:25.960\nHe used like a regular rope.\n\n36:25.960 --> 36:27.960\nSo he's just a maniac shooting people.\n\n36:27.960 --> 36:28.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n36:28.960 --> 36:30.960\nImagine being a cop and there's this guy that keeps showing up\n\n36:30.960 --> 36:32.960\nand he's wearing a trench coat and he's dressed like a bat.\n\n36:32.960 --> 36:35.960\nAnd he's like, I can hope.\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:37.960\nDamn it, Jesus.\n\n36:37.960 --> 36:38.960\nJust to take off the...\n\n36:38.960 --> 36:39.960\nWhat are you doing?\n\n36:39.960 --> 36:40.960\nYou're a detective.\n\n36:40.960 --> 36:43.960\nDo you have any Batman stories?\n\n36:47.960 --> 36:48.960\nNo.\n\n36:48.960 --> 36:49.960\nOh, okay.\n\n36:49.960 --> 36:50.960\nWell, you gotta ask.\n\n36:50.960 --> 36:53.960\nThat's how we find out things.\n\n36:53.960 --> 36:57.960\nUh, let's see here.\n\n36:57.960 --> 37:02.960\nCan you solve the case of these bees in my backyard?\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:03.960\nI don't know about that.\n\n37:03.960 --> 37:04.960\nWhat's going on with the bees?\n\n37:04.960 --> 37:07.960\nWe should shoot them with your gun.\n\n37:07.960 --> 37:11.960\nIt'd be amazing if he broke open the wall and the bees started attacking him,\n\n37:11.960 --> 37:14.960\nbut then the coyotes came and saved him.\n\n37:14.960 --> 37:15.960\nWhoa.\n\n37:15.960 --> 37:18.960\nThey're like the eagles from War of the Rings.\n\n37:18.960 --> 37:20.960\nYeah, the coyotes haven't been a problem, huh?\n\n37:20.960 --> 37:25.960\nI got kind of a money pit situation brewing over at my old house.\n\n37:25.960 --> 37:26.960\nOh man, yeah.\n\n37:26.960 --> 37:28.960\nSorry, I was just getting excited about the money pit.\n\n37:28.960 --> 37:30.960\nYou guys know about the money pit?\n\n37:30.960 --> 37:33.960\nThe Shelly Long movie?\n\n37:33.960 --> 37:37.960\nUh, I not, I mean, maybe it was inspired by the money pit,\n\n37:37.960 --> 37:40.960\nbut the money pits like a real physical thing.\n\n37:40.960 --> 37:42.960\nIt's a real pit.\n\n37:42.960 --> 37:43.960\nOkay.\n\n37:43.960 --> 37:44.960\nYou guys go.\n\n37:44.960 --> 37:45.960\nOkay.\n\n37:45.960 --> 37:48.960\nThere's these, there's this island where they like someone was convinced that\n\n37:48.960 --> 37:50.960\nthere's treasure there and they started digging down,\n\n37:50.960 --> 37:52.960\nbut the whole kept falling up with water.\n\n37:52.960 --> 37:56.960\nAnd then, then, uh, they became a money pit because they spent like,\n\n37:56.960 --> 38:00.960\nlike they spent multiple fortunes and businesses went bankrupt for\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:03.960\ngenerations trying to like get to the bottom of this money pit.\n\n38:03.960 --> 38:05.960\nAnd they never really found anybody, anything.\n\n38:05.960 --> 38:09.960\nThey eventually got this giant drill and the giant drill drilled through\n\n38:09.960 --> 38:12.960\na bunch of layers of shit and like drilled through a bunch of silver.\n\n38:12.960 --> 38:15.960\nSo it probably just punched through whatever silver cash was down there\n\n38:15.960 --> 38:18.960\nor whatever, but they never really got it.\n\n38:18.960 --> 38:21.960\nAnyway, I think I know how, how to solve the money pit,\n\n38:21.960 --> 38:22.960\nbut it's too late now.\n\n38:22.960 --> 38:25.960\nSo let's just move on.\n\n38:25.960 --> 38:27.960\nNo, the money pit, it's like, it was sunk with water,\n\n38:27.960 --> 38:30.960\nbut presumably whoever actually like created it had a,\n\n38:30.960 --> 38:32.960\nhad a solution to get there.\n\n38:32.960 --> 38:35.960\nAnd there was these giant boulders that were found off the island.\n\n38:35.960 --> 38:38.960\nAnd I think that there was these secret water channels that were\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:40.960\ncovered by dirt, but if you knew where they were,\n\n38:40.960 --> 38:43.960\nyou were supposed to put the boulders on top of it and that would\n\n38:43.960 --> 38:46.960\nstop the water from pouring in and then you could just dig through\n\n38:46.960 --> 38:48.960\nit without it being flooded all the time.\n\n38:48.960 --> 38:51.960\nBut one of the first things they did was just excavate the shit out of\n\n38:51.960 --> 38:54.960\none of these water channels so it just absolutely couldn't be, uh,\n\n38:54.960 --> 38:58.960\nplugged, and then from then on it was just done, son.\n\n38:58.960 --> 39:00.960\nThe money pit.\n\n39:00.960 --> 39:02.960\nWhat do you think was down there?\n\n39:02.960 --> 39:03.960\nIt was just like silver.\n\n39:03.960 --> 39:06.960\nI don't even think it was that much, but it was cool to the people\n\n39:06.960 --> 39:08.960\nwho like had a whole lifetime to do shit.\n\n39:08.960 --> 39:10.960\nYou know, back when there was like, yeah, let's build a pyramid.\n\n39:10.960 --> 39:12.960\nThat seems like a good use of time.\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:16.960\nThey found fragments of silver through the drill because they were\n\n39:16.960 --> 39:19.960\njust kind of like drilling down and seeing what they found.\n\n39:19.960 --> 39:21.960\nThere was like a pretty thin layer of silver.\n\n39:21.960 --> 39:23.960\nThen at the very bottom, there was these huge subterranean caverns\n\n39:23.960 --> 39:25.960\nthat didn't seem to have anything of value.\n\n39:25.960 --> 39:27.960\nAnd I think those are flooded too.\n\n39:27.960 --> 39:29.960\nSpencer knows so much stuff.\n\n39:29.960 --> 39:30.960\nAnd it's all useless.\n\n39:30.960 --> 39:31.960\nNo, no.\n\n39:31.960 --> 39:37.960\nThe other day I called them up and I go, why do pirates wear patches\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:39.960\nover their eyes?\n\n39:39.960 --> 39:42.960\nWhy do pirates wear patches over their eyes?\n\n39:42.960 --> 39:43.960\nThat's a good question.\n\n39:43.960 --> 39:44.960\nWhy do they wear them over their eyes?\n\n39:44.960 --> 39:47.960\nBecause I thought, oh, it's because they've lost their eye\n\n39:47.960 --> 39:48.960\nand it looks gross.\n\n39:48.960 --> 39:51.960\nBut then I was like, well, these...\n\n39:51.960 --> 39:52.960\nRight, exactly.\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:53.960\nIt's more intimidating.\n\n39:53.960 --> 39:55.960\nThey're supposed to be badasses.\n\n39:55.960 --> 39:58.960\nOh, I don't want you to see how it's really icky underneath here.\n\n39:58.960 --> 40:01.960\nSo I'm going to put this over there just so when we're talking\n\n40:01.960 --> 40:03.960\nface to face, I don't, you know, gross you out.\n\n40:03.960 --> 40:04.960\nI'm kind of embarrassed about it.\n\n40:04.960 --> 40:05.960\nSo I'm going to cover it up.\n\n40:05.960 --> 40:07.960\nI was like, ooh, you guys are supposed to be tough.\n\n40:07.960 --> 40:10.960\nBut then I called my friend Spencer.\n\n40:10.960 --> 40:12.960\nAnd just to be clear, I might be wrong about these.\n\n40:12.960 --> 40:13.960\nI was going off of memory.\n\n40:13.960 --> 40:16.960\nYeah, but this tracks for me.\n\n40:16.960 --> 40:18.960\nSo let's just make it history.\n\n40:18.960 --> 40:19.960\nSure.\n\n40:19.960 --> 40:21.960\nDon't at me.\n\n40:21.960 --> 40:28.960\nDo you want me to say it or you should say it?\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:29.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n40:29.960 --> 40:30.960\nNo, I'm done.\n\n40:30.960 --> 40:31.960\nI don't want to talk.\n\n40:31.960 --> 40:34.960\nI said, don't at me to the people on Twitter who are going to tell me\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:37.960\nthat's not why pirates had badges.\n\n40:37.960 --> 40:40.960\nYeah, well, you know.\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:42.960\nJust to keep airborne infections out of...\n\n40:42.960 --> 40:44.960\nNo, no, Spencer, go ahead.\n\n40:44.960 --> 40:45.960\nYou tell them.\n\n40:45.960 --> 40:46.960\nYou're so much better at it.\n\n40:46.960 --> 40:47.960\nNo, I...\n\n40:47.960 --> 40:50.960\nOkay, so what I told Trob was that I think for one,\n\n40:50.960 --> 40:51.960\npirates were superstitious.\n\n40:51.960 --> 40:53.960\nSo I think that they believed stuff.\n\n40:53.960 --> 40:56.960\nLike I think one of the reasons they wore earrings was because they just thought\n\n40:56.960 --> 40:57.960\nthat made them here better.\n\n40:57.960 --> 40:59.960\nThey had superstitions involving that.\n\n40:59.960 --> 41:03.960\nAnd I think that eyepatches were part of that to the extent that I think they\n\n41:03.960 --> 41:05.960\nsometimes just wore them as a superstition.\n\n41:05.960 --> 41:08.960\nThe other thing, what was the other thing I said?\n\n41:08.960 --> 41:11.960\nThe other thing was like they thought back then if you squinted,\n\n41:11.960 --> 41:16.960\nif you had one eye open, it would see stronger or whatever.\n\n41:16.960 --> 41:18.960\nThen squinting both eyes.\n\n41:18.960 --> 41:22.960\nInstead of doing this, you just like had one eye completely closed\n\n41:22.960 --> 41:23.960\nand you could do that.\n\n41:23.960 --> 41:25.960\nAnd that's why Popeye is like this too.\n\n41:25.960 --> 41:27.960\nRight, because he's a sailor man.\n\n41:27.960 --> 41:32.960\nAnd also like you were saying like because it's like bright lights outside during\n\n41:32.960 --> 41:36.960\nthe day and then you go below deck, your eye has to adjust or whatever,\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:37.960\nyou know, when you go below deck.\n\n41:37.960 --> 41:40.960\nBut if you have like this, you can...\n\n41:40.960 --> 41:41.960\nYou flip it up.\n\n41:41.960 --> 41:42.960\nYou flip it up and you compensate.\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:47.960\nAnd it's done today as a joke where there's nothing wrong with your eye.\n\n41:47.960 --> 41:49.960\nBut it's actually...\n\n41:49.960 --> 41:51.960\nOh, you're saying these guys didn't...\n\n41:51.960 --> 41:52.960\nI was sorry.\n\n41:52.960 --> 41:53.960\nThey didn't lose their eye.\n\n41:53.960 --> 41:54.960\nThey didn't lose their eye.\n\n41:54.960 --> 41:55.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n41:55.960 --> 41:56.960\nI'm just for no reason.\n\n41:56.960 --> 41:57.960\nWell, some of them did.\n\n41:57.960 --> 41:58.960\nI mean, they were wearing them for like weird cyborg reasons.\n\n41:58.960 --> 41:59.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n41:59.960 --> 42:00.960\nLike they thought they were super powering themselves.\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:01.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n42:01.960 --> 42:02.960\nWow.\n\n42:02.960 --> 42:03.960\nLike it's like a fingerless glove.\n\n42:03.960 --> 42:05.960\nIt's like a piece of equipment.\n\n42:05.960 --> 42:06.960\nYeah.\n\n42:06.960 --> 42:07.960\nA nautical like road warrior.\n\n42:07.960 --> 42:08.960\nNow you're getting it.\n\n42:08.960 --> 42:09.960\nYeah.\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:10.960\nYeah, you're catching on.\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:11.960\nHuh.\n\n42:11.960 --> 42:12.960\nYeah.\n\n42:12.960 --> 42:15.960\nBut also I think I said that, you know, they didn't have good antiseptic technology\n\n42:15.960 --> 42:16.960\nback then.\n\n42:16.960 --> 42:18.960\nBut probably did, you know, help.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:20.960\nThe technology of antiseptic wasn't as...\n\n42:20.960 --> 42:21.960\nIt was urine.\n\n42:21.960 --> 42:22.960\nThey used urine.\n\n42:22.960 --> 42:23.960\nYeah.\n\n42:23.960 --> 42:25.960\nYeah, they used urine, damn.\n\n42:25.960 --> 42:28.960\nDamn, don't use my urine for antiseptic.\n\n42:28.960 --> 42:32.960\nThere's some shit in there that'll fuck you up.\n\n42:32.960 --> 42:34.960\nI don't know what the hell's going on with me.\n\n42:34.960 --> 42:35.960\nMy dick feels like a lightsaber.\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:36.960\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n42:36.960 --> 42:37.960\nThat sounds good.\n\n42:37.960 --> 42:39.960\nI haven't seen you in a while.\n\n42:39.960 --> 42:41.960\nAnd I think you look very healthy.\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:42.960\nYou've lost some weight.\n\n42:42.960 --> 42:43.960\nYour skin is good.\n\n42:43.960 --> 42:45.960\nI got lab results from my regular doctor.\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:46.960\nYou cleaned up your acne.\n\n42:46.960 --> 42:48.960\nKidney, liver, prostate, everything's great.\n\n42:48.960 --> 42:50.960\nYou're wearing a belt.\n\n42:50.960 --> 42:51.960\nI don't even know.\n\n42:51.960 --> 42:52.960\nI already talked about this.\n\n42:52.960 --> 42:55.960\nI think I was pretty drunk last time, but I assume I talked about this.\n\n42:55.960 --> 42:58.960\nMy vitamin D levels are stabilized.\n\n42:58.960 --> 42:59.960\nI was, you know...\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:00.960\nHow'd you do that?\n\n43:00.960 --> 43:01.960\nAre you taking vitamins?\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:02.960\nI just took a couple.\n\n43:02.960 --> 43:03.960\nOkay.\n\n43:03.960 --> 43:04.960\nI didn't even take that many.\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:05.960\nI usually forget to take them.\n\n43:05.960 --> 43:06.960\nMy vitamin D sucks.\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:08.960\nI hear mushrooms are good.\n\n43:08.960 --> 43:10.960\nBut a little vitamin D goes a long way.\n\n43:10.960 --> 43:12.960\nIsn't that right, SPD?\n\n43:12.960 --> 43:13.960\nYeah.\n\n43:13.960 --> 43:15.960\nDo you have any vitamin Ds?\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:16.960\nI'm in perfect health.\n\n43:16.960 --> 43:19.960\nI get these results from my regular Beverly Hills doctor.\n\n43:19.960 --> 43:23.960\nAnd then I get this burning cock and weird vitamin D.\n\n43:23.960 --> 43:24.960\nDoes it hurt right now?\n\n43:24.960 --> 43:25.960\nRight now?\n\n43:25.960 --> 43:26.960\nIt's not.\n\n43:26.960 --> 43:29.960\nIt feels like I have a...\n\n43:29.960 --> 43:32.960\nIt feels like I just jerked off an hour ago.\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:33.960\nUh-huh.\n\n43:33.960 --> 43:35.960\nI kind of did.\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:36.960\nThat makes sense.\n\n43:36.960 --> 43:38.960\nAnd then I didn't pee afterwards.\n\n43:38.960 --> 43:43.960\nIt feels like there's maybe something...\n\n43:43.960 --> 43:44.960\nSorry.\n\n43:44.960 --> 43:45.960\nLadies.\n\n43:45.960 --> 43:46.960\nI was going to say sorry ladies.\n\n43:46.960 --> 43:47.960\nSorry everyone.\n\n43:47.960 --> 43:53.960\nThe men are like, don't tell us more about your dick.\n\n43:53.960 --> 43:55.960\nAnd the women are like, only me.\n\n43:55.960 --> 43:58.960\nOnly I don't want to hear this.\n\n43:58.960 --> 44:00.960\nIt's probably the opposite, right?\n\n44:00.960 --> 44:02.960\nThe women are like, what's going on?\n\n44:02.960 --> 44:06.960\nWhat is with you people?\n\n44:06.960 --> 44:10.960\nBut it just feels like, no, there's no pain.\n\n44:10.960 --> 44:14.960\nCertain positions, like if I put pressure on a certain foot or something.\n\n44:14.960 --> 44:16.960\nBut sitting isn't a problem.\n\n44:16.960 --> 44:17.960\nLike you're not in pain right now.\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:18.960\nRight now, fine.\n\n44:18.960 --> 44:19.960\nNo.\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:20.960\nIt's just like random positions.\n\n44:20.960 --> 44:27.960\nI think there's something in my bladder that is floating around and maybe is like...\n\n44:27.960 --> 44:30.960\nAnd you don't know where you got this from.\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:31.960\nA toilet seat?\n\n44:31.960 --> 44:32.960\nMaybe.\n\n44:32.960 --> 44:33.960\nWait.\n\n44:33.960 --> 44:35.960\nYou honestly don't know where you got this.\n\n44:35.960 --> 44:36.960\nWhat do you mean?\n\n44:36.960 --> 44:38.960\nI don't even know where you got a UTI.\n\n44:38.960 --> 44:39.960\nWhat do you mean?\n\n44:39.960 --> 44:41.960\nWell, I'm saying we got a detective here.\n\n44:41.960 --> 44:42.960\nWe could probably...\n\n44:42.960 --> 44:44.960\nOh, should we do a 911 call?\n\n44:44.960 --> 44:45.960\nYeah.\n\n44:45.960 --> 44:52.720\nIf we give him some facts, maybe we could back into where you got this thing so you could\n\n44:52.720 --> 44:58.960\nprevent it and maybe some listeners out there prevent it from happening to them or you again.\n\n44:58.960 --> 44:59.960\nI don't know what I did.\n\n44:59.960 --> 45:00.960\nCody's convinced.\n\n45:00.960 --> 45:06.960\nShe's like, okay, now will you shower not just after workouts?\n\n45:06.960 --> 45:07.960\nShe doesn't...\n\n45:07.960 --> 45:09.960\nHave you ever gotten a UTI before?\n\n45:09.960 --> 45:10.960\nNo.\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:11.960\nOkay.\n\n45:11.960 --> 45:13.960\nSo, well, you don't shower a lot.\n\n45:13.960 --> 45:14.960\nSo it doesn't...\n\n45:14.960 --> 45:17.960\nI know, but as you get older, I'm sure your immune system goes down or whatever.\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:19.960\nI mean, I got to shower every day now.\n\n45:19.960 --> 45:21.960\nWhen did you first start getting the...\n\n45:21.960 --> 45:25.960\nAnd jump in anytime with any detective questions?\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:26.960\nAgain.\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:29.960\nSo, okay, I'm going to figure this out.\n\n45:29.960 --> 45:30.960\nOkay.\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:31.960\nAll right.\n\n45:31.960 --> 45:37.960\nSo when did you first start feeling UTI in your dick?\n\n45:37.960 --> 45:39.960\nYeah, like several weeks ago.\n\n45:39.960 --> 45:40.960\nSeveral.\n\n45:40.960 --> 45:41.960\nYeah.\n\n45:41.960 --> 45:43.960\nSo just before going to Disneyland.\n\n45:43.960 --> 45:49.260\nIt was because I went to the doctor because I didn't want to have to worry about my crotch\n\n45:49.260 --> 45:50.260\nduring the vacation.\n\n45:50.260 --> 45:51.960\nBecause you were going to do some...\n\n45:51.960 --> 45:53.960\nBut the confusing thing is that I also...\n\n45:53.960 --> 45:56.960\nWell, I didn't diagnose it as anything.\n\n45:56.960 --> 46:00.960\nI didn't tell that doctor there's something wrong with my pee-pee tract because I didn't\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:02.960\nknow that's what was going on.\n\n46:02.960 --> 46:04.960\nI simultaneously...\n\n46:04.960 --> 46:09.960\nI think I put a little strain on one of my groin muscles or something.\n\n46:09.960 --> 46:14.960\nSo you got like a tinge in your taint from doing leg lifts a little too hard.\n\n46:14.960 --> 46:15.960\nYeah.\n\n46:15.960 --> 46:17.960\nI work out like a fucking...\n\n46:17.960 --> 46:18.960\nI've seen it.\n\n46:18.960 --> 46:19.960\nYeah.\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:20.960\nI've seen it.\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:22.960\nI blast my glutes.\n\n46:22.960 --> 46:25.960\nThat's what you want to do to them.\n\n46:25.960 --> 46:31.960\nI blast anybody's glutes after the show.\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:32.960\nGlutes blasted.\n\n46:32.960 --> 46:34.960\nThis is unisex things.\n\n46:34.960 --> 46:35.960\nNon-binary.\n\n46:35.960 --> 46:37.960\nI'll blast your glutes.\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:38.960\nEveryone's got glutes.\n\n46:38.960 --> 46:39.960\nI'm a blaster.\n\n46:39.960 --> 46:41.960\nSo you're blasting glutes.\n\n46:41.960 --> 46:42.960\nYou're blasting glutes.\n\n46:42.960 --> 46:43.960\nYou're blasting glutes.\n\n46:43.960 --> 46:44.960\nYou're blasting glutes.\n\n46:44.960 --> 46:45.960\nAnd I had this...\n\n46:45.960 --> 46:47.960\nI think I pulled my taint or something.\n\n46:47.960 --> 46:48.960\nRight.\n\n46:48.960 --> 46:49.960\nThe doctor was kind of like...\n\n46:49.960 --> 46:51.960\nThere's names for those muscles anyways.\n\n46:51.960 --> 46:56.960\nIn the meantime, at the exact same time around the time, I'm like, I feel this little itty-bitty\n\n46:56.960 --> 46:59.960\ntinge in like the tippy-tip of my weenus.\n\n46:59.960 --> 47:01.960\nAnd I'm assuming...\n\n47:01.960 --> 47:07.960\nI'm going like, you did something with your taint while you're doing leg lifts and benching.\n\n47:07.960 --> 47:15.960\nI bench like 135.\n\n47:15.960 --> 47:17.960\nThat's 245 plates, right?\n\n47:17.960 --> 47:18.960\nOne on each side?\n\n47:18.960 --> 47:19.960\nYeah.\n\n47:19.960 --> 47:20.960\nDamn.\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:27.960\nWhoever plays Minnie Mouse at the Disney park easily without the costume.\n\n47:27.960 --> 47:28.960\nI don't know.\n\n47:28.960 --> 47:30.960\nWhoever's in there seems like they're probably about...\n\n47:30.960 --> 47:31.960\nOkay.\n\n47:31.960 --> 47:32.960\nSo you're blasting taint.\n\n47:32.960 --> 47:33.960\nYou're blasting taint.\n\n47:33.960 --> 47:34.960\nYou're blasting taint.\n\n47:34.960 --> 47:38.960\nAll of a sudden, you get up and you're like, oh, there's a little twinge?\n\n47:38.960 --> 47:39.960\nYeah.\n\n47:39.960 --> 47:43.960\nAnd so I'm associating that with the tip of the penis thing, right?\n\n47:43.960 --> 47:44.960\nBecause I'm like...\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:46.960\nYou ever poke your belly button too hard and you're like...\n\n47:46.960 --> 47:49.960\nIt's like a nerve ending that shoots to the tip of your dick.\n\n47:49.960 --> 47:50.960\nBecause that's your insights.\n\n47:50.960 --> 47:51.960\nYeah.\n\n47:51.960 --> 47:53.960\nI don't know if everyone has that or not.\n\n47:53.960 --> 47:54.960\nA belly button?\n\n47:54.960 --> 47:57.960\nDoes anybody here have a belly button?\n\n47:57.960 --> 47:58.960\nOkay.\n\n47:58.960 --> 47:59.960\nYeah.\n\n47:59.960 --> 48:00.960\nNo, that happens.\n\n48:00.960 --> 48:01.960\nYeah.\n\n48:01.960 --> 48:02.960\nThat sounds like just basically everybody.\n\n48:02.960 --> 48:03.960\nOkay, yeah.\n\n48:03.960 --> 48:04.960\nYou don't go digging around in there real hard.\n\n48:04.960 --> 48:07.960\nAnd then there's a nerve that goes to the tip of your wiener, right?\n\n48:07.960 --> 48:08.960\nYeah.\n\n48:08.960 --> 48:09.960\nOkay.\n\n48:09.960 --> 48:10.960\nSo that's kind of...\n\n48:10.960 --> 48:11.960\nI was kind of feeling that.\n\n48:11.960 --> 48:14.960\nI was like, whatever's going on down there, first of all, I got to figure...\n\n48:14.960 --> 48:15.960\nI got to make sure it's not cancer.\n\n48:15.960 --> 48:16.960\nGot to make sure.\n\n48:16.960 --> 48:17.960\nGot to make sure.\n\n48:17.960 --> 48:18.960\nBecause I'm not going to sit here.\n\n48:18.960 --> 48:19.960\nYou didn't think you just pulled your...\n\n48:19.960 --> 48:20.960\nYou thought it was...\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:21.960\nThat's exactly what I thought.\n\n48:21.960 --> 48:22.960\nI went to the doctor.\n\n48:22.960 --> 48:25.960\nI said, I think I probably just pulled a muscle while I was working out.\n\n48:25.960 --> 48:30.960\nBut will you please stick your finger up my asshole and feel my balls in that order.\n\n48:30.960 --> 48:33.960\nJust smear it all over.\n\n48:33.960 --> 48:36.960\nAnd then all of a sudden I got a UTI and I don't know how.\n\n48:36.960 --> 48:40.960\nNow, he checked my balls.\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:44.960\nMy doctor keeps saying something like...\n\n48:44.960 --> 48:47.960\nMy doctors check my balls a couple of times.\n\n48:47.960 --> 48:50.960\nEvery time he does, he says...\n\n48:50.960 --> 48:53.960\nI told you the story about how one time I actually caught myself reaching up for my\n\n48:53.960 --> 48:54.960\nnipple.\n\n48:54.960 --> 48:55.960\nWhat?\n\n48:55.960 --> 49:00.960\nIt wasn't because I was turned out.\n\n49:00.960 --> 49:01.960\nIt was just like...\n\n49:01.960 --> 49:05.960\nI felt my balls being touched and I just...\n\n49:05.960 --> 49:06.960\nI was like, wow.\n\n49:06.960 --> 49:08.960\nCan you put a pin in that?\n\n49:08.960 --> 49:09.960\nCan you put a pin in that?\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:10.960\nPut a pin in that.\n\n49:10.960 --> 49:11.960\nPut a pin in that.\n\n49:11.960 --> 49:12.960\nPut a pin in that.\n\n49:12.960 --> 49:13.960\nPut a pin in that because I...\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:14.960\nOkay.\n\n49:14.960 --> 49:18.960\nMy doctor's like, just a guy my age is great.\n\n49:18.960 --> 49:22.960\nI have a great doctor.\n\n49:22.960 --> 49:24.960\nI know he's checked my balls at least.\n\n49:24.960 --> 49:25.960\nI think this is the third time.\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:27.960\nI'm a middle-aged man.\n\n49:27.960 --> 49:29.960\nCheck yourself.\n\n49:29.960 --> 49:32.960\nAnd he says...\n\n49:32.960 --> 49:36.960\nHe emphasizes how easy it is to check every time he does it.\n\n49:36.960 --> 49:40.960\nAnd I think subtextually what he's saying is stop making me touch your balls.\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:45.960\nThat's like when you go to the vet and they're like, you can express their anal glands at\n\n49:45.960 --> 49:46.960\nhome.\n\n49:46.960 --> 49:48.960\nIt's like, I know I can.\n\n49:48.960 --> 49:53.960\nIt's like he's going on.\n\n49:53.960 --> 49:58.960\nHe's kind of like, you know, like I said before, it's all you got to do.\n\n49:58.960 --> 50:02.960\nIt's just feel here and here and here and that's all there is to it.\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:06.960\nAnd I'm like, yeah, you're doing great.\n\n50:06.960 --> 50:08.960\nI'm not touching those fucking things.\n\n50:08.960 --> 50:11.960\nYou want me to start rubbing my nipples right here?\n\n50:11.960 --> 50:21.960\nI went to get my balls and the finger up the butt procedure.\n\n50:21.960 --> 50:23.960\nIt was like one early...\n\n50:23.960 --> 50:26.960\nIt was an early morning in March.\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:28.960\nIt was like cold.\n\n50:28.960 --> 50:35.960\nAnd I'm sitting there and my doctor comes in, Dr. Logan Rose.\n\n50:35.960 --> 50:38.960\nAnd he's Lord Rose.\n\n50:38.960 --> 50:39.960\nLogan Rose.\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:41.960\nDr. Logan Rose.\n\n50:41.960 --> 50:42.960\nBounty Hunter.\n\n50:42.960 --> 50:43.960\nExactly.\n\n50:43.960 --> 50:44.960\nYeah.\n\n50:44.960 --> 50:49.960\nAnd he's like this older African-American gentleman with long dreadlocks.\n\n50:49.960 --> 50:52.960\nAnd he's just like, he's a great doctor.\n\n50:52.960 --> 50:55.960\nHe comes in and it's like cold.\n\n50:55.960 --> 50:59.960\nSo, you know, and I'm, you know, in the gown and I'm sitting there like all by myself\n\n50:59.960 --> 51:05.960\nand he's like, okay, now it's time to do the procedure.\n\n51:05.960 --> 51:07.960\nAnd I turn around and his hands are...\n\n51:07.960 --> 51:09.960\nAnd he's like, I'm sorry, my hands are really cold.\n\n51:09.960 --> 51:10.960\nAnd they're freezing.\n\n51:10.960 --> 51:12.960\nAnd I start laughing and he's laughing.\n\n51:12.960 --> 51:13.960\nAnd we're just...\n\n51:13.960 --> 51:14.960\nHe's like...\n\n51:14.960 --> 51:17.960\nAnd I'm like...\n\n51:17.960 --> 51:18.960\nAnd he's laughing.\n\n51:18.960 --> 51:20.960\nIs this on your balls or your butthole?\n\n51:20.960 --> 51:21.960\nBoth.\n\n51:21.960 --> 51:23.960\nWait, that's not at the same time.\n\n51:23.960 --> 51:26.960\nAnd he's just like, I'm sorry, my hands are...\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:28.960\nHe says it.\n\n51:28.960 --> 51:33.960\nHe touches my balls and I go...\n\n51:33.960 --> 51:34.960\nAnd then he starts...\n\n51:34.960 --> 51:35.960\nHe backs up.\n\n51:35.960 --> 51:37.960\nHe's like, I'm sorry, my hands are really cold.\n\n51:37.960 --> 51:38.960\nI'm like, it's okay.\n\n51:38.960 --> 51:39.960\nJust keep going.\n\n51:39.960 --> 51:42.960\nAnd we start laughing at this situation.\n\n51:42.960 --> 51:43.960\nAnd I'm like...\n\n51:43.960 --> 51:47.960\nAnd I'm like, I'm sorry.\n\n51:47.960 --> 51:48.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n51:48.960 --> 51:49.960\nHe says, no, it's okay.\n\n51:49.960 --> 51:50.960\nIt's okay.\n\n51:50.960 --> 51:51.960\nYou're fine.\n\n51:51.960 --> 51:53.960\nWe're just sitting there laughing.\n\n51:53.960 --> 51:58.960\nAnd it's like, you're fine, okay, here's whatever's assigned this piece of paper.\n\n51:58.960 --> 52:00.960\nAnd he left and I got dressed.\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:04.960\nAnd I went out and Ryan Ridley was in the waiting room.\n\n52:04.960 --> 52:11.960\nAnd he was going in to see the same doctor to have the same procedure.\n\n52:11.960 --> 52:14.960\nAnd I said, hey, I warmed him up for you.\n\n52:14.960 --> 52:19.960\nGo enjoy yourself.\n\n52:19.960 --> 52:23.960\nThat would be funny even if his hands weren't cold.\n\n52:23.960 --> 52:24.960\nWarmed him up for him.\n\n52:24.960 --> 52:25.960\nBut you literally warmed him up.\n\n52:25.960 --> 52:27.960\nYou gave him your hot bottles and your ass.\n\n52:27.960 --> 52:29.960\nAnd his hands are now ready to go.\n\n52:29.960 --> 52:31.960\nWhat are you doing here?\n\n52:31.960 --> 52:35.960\nWell, you know, it's that time of the year and we're that age.\n\n52:35.960 --> 52:38.960\nSo have at it, son.\n\n52:38.960 --> 52:40.960\n16,000 miles.\n\n52:40.960 --> 52:43.960\nYou're very like when you go into a public restroom.\n\n52:43.960 --> 52:46.960\nI'm not a germaphobe about public restrooms.\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:51.960\nI think it's disgusting when the seats are visibly anything.\n\n52:51.960 --> 52:56.960\nBut provided there's no visible anything on the seat,\n\n52:56.960 --> 52:59.960\nif you ever like, you know, nobody wants to like,\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:03.960\nnobody wants to contact each other or, you know, like,\n\n53:03.960 --> 53:05.960\nwe'd all prefer if when we went to the bathroom,\n\n53:05.960 --> 53:09.960\nnobody else was involved or that there was just that the timing worked for everybody\n\n53:09.960 --> 53:11.960\nso that everyone had their privacy.\n\n53:11.960 --> 53:16.960\nAnd, you know, nature of the beast.\n\n53:16.960 --> 53:19.960\nSometimes the storyboard artist is just coming out.\n\n53:19.960 --> 53:20.960\nYou're going in.\n\n53:20.960 --> 53:23.960\nHave you ever like, you know, the seats like nice and clean?\n\n53:23.960 --> 53:28.960\nYou sit down and take a poop and it's like the seats all warm.\n\n53:28.960 --> 53:31.960\nAnd you're kind of like, I made eye contact with the man\n\n53:31.960 --> 53:34.960\nwho right now I'm so grateful for.\n\n53:34.960 --> 53:36.960\nOh, a lot of people really don't like that.\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:37.960\nBut you like it.\n\n53:37.960 --> 53:43.960\nI'm like, it's a weird duality thing where I'm like, I'm like, ah, gross.\n\n53:43.960 --> 53:46.960\nBut like with a big smile on my face because it's like,\n\n53:46.960 --> 53:48.960\nlike it's only intellectually gross.\n\n53:48.960 --> 53:50.960\nIt's physically comforting.\n\n53:50.960 --> 53:52.960\nIt's a heated toilet seat.\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:55.960\nI mean, it's only if you think about why that it's like gross.\n\n53:55.960 --> 53:58.960\nAnd then you kind of like, you're like, boy, this species, you know,\n\n53:58.960 --> 54:06.960\nthe Rick and Morty toilet system is needs to there needs to be something\n\n54:06.960 --> 54:09.960\nbecause there's like, how many employees do you have?\n\n54:09.960 --> 54:10.960\nYou don't even know.\n\n54:10.960 --> 54:12.960\nI think it's a human rights violation.\n\n54:12.960 --> 54:16.960\nAnd then there's like one urinal and two toilets.\n\n54:16.960 --> 54:20.960\nAnd then when squash games moves in, there's going to be double.\n\n54:20.960 --> 54:25.960\nIt's like so much waiting to go to the old building, which you were never at.\n\n54:25.960 --> 54:29.960\nThe old building, we just kept going, well, we're going to go to a new building.\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:31.960\nAt the old building, everybody had to be given.\n\n54:31.960 --> 54:34.960\nI have to shit on the third floor.\n\n54:34.960 --> 54:38.960\nI'm going to go down in the elevator solution to go shit in the first,\n\n54:38.960 --> 54:43.960\nbecause it's just, you know, in the afternoon, when you, when you get the,\n\n54:43.960 --> 54:48.960\nwhen you get the after lunch, ready to go after lunch bubble.\n\n54:48.960 --> 54:49.960\nYeah.\n\n54:49.960 --> 54:51.960\nYou know, reverse pez, baby.\n\n54:51.960 --> 54:52.960\nYeah, you got to go there.\n\n54:52.960 --> 54:54.960\nHave a little privacy.\n\n54:54.960 --> 54:55.960\nYeah.\n\n54:55.960 --> 55:01.960\nSo you can, because otherwise you just, there's no, I'm dancing around the issue.\n\n55:01.960 --> 55:03.960\nWell, yeah, we don't want to be a gross podcast.\n\n55:03.960 --> 55:05.960\nNo, we don't want to be a gross podcast.\n\n55:05.960 --> 55:06.960\nWe're classy.\n\n55:06.960 --> 55:11.960\nI don't, I'm just saying it's embarrassing because you're saying like,\n\n55:11.960 --> 55:14.960\ncause you could, you could like, okay.\n\n55:14.960 --> 55:15.960\nCan I tell you something?\n\n55:15.960 --> 55:18.960\nWe all know what we're doing in the stall, right?\n\n55:18.960 --> 55:19.960\nI mean, come on.\n\n55:19.960 --> 55:20.960\nLet's be adults here.\n\n55:20.960 --> 55:21.960\nYeah.\n\n55:21.960 --> 55:22.960\nSo if you hear something.\n\n55:22.960 --> 55:23.960\nWe're reading scripts.\n\n55:23.960 --> 55:24.960\nRight.\n\n55:24.960 --> 55:25.960\nOkay.\n\n55:25.960 --> 55:26.960\nBut then you make all the...\n\n55:26.960 --> 55:27.960\nInstagramming.\n\n55:27.960 --> 55:28.960\nAll right.\n\n55:28.960 --> 55:29.960\nGo ahead.\n\n55:29.960 --> 55:30.960\nWhat?\n\n55:30.960 --> 55:31.960\nNo, go ahead.\n\n55:31.960 --> 55:33.960\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n55:33.960 --> 55:34.960\nYeah.\n\n55:34.960 --> 55:35.960\nGo ahead.\n\n55:35.960 --> 55:37.960\nYou wanted him to have energy.\n\n55:37.960 --> 55:38.960\nJust go.\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:40.960\nI just, I was making like two, man.\n\n55:40.960 --> 55:41.960\nAll right.\n\n55:41.960 --> 55:42.960\nYeah.\n\n55:42.960 --> 55:43.960\nNo, it's the worst.\n\n55:43.960 --> 55:44.960\nYeah.\n\n55:44.960 --> 55:47.960\nAnd then you open the door and then there's the new show runner, you know, and it's like,\n\n55:47.960 --> 55:48.960\nhuh, that's what it sounds like.\n\n55:48.960 --> 55:51.960\nAll these guys, like everyone knows what my shoes look like.\n\n55:51.960 --> 55:54.960\nAnd like, you know what's worst about that bathroom?\n\n55:54.960 --> 56:00.960\nIt's arguable that the two stalls, cause there was one stall in the old building, one year\n\n56:00.960 --> 56:04.960\nand one stall, and then it was like everyone had to poop on different floors.\n\n56:04.960 --> 56:07.960\nNow there's two stalls one year and all.\n\n56:07.960 --> 56:08.960\nI think it's worse.\n\n56:08.960 --> 56:09.960\nHere's why.\n\n56:09.960 --> 56:14.960\nFirst stall, handicap stall, whatever we call it now.\n\n56:14.960 --> 56:15.960\nHandicap.\n\n56:15.960 --> 56:16.960\nProud stall.\n\n56:16.960 --> 56:18.960\nSuper power stall.\n\n56:18.960 --> 56:19.960\nI don't know.\n\n56:19.960 --> 56:21.960\nFree speech zone.\n\n56:21.960 --> 56:26.960\nIt's the one you're not supposed to use if you have, if both are available.\n\n56:26.960 --> 56:27.960\nI've never heard...\n\n56:27.960 --> 56:29.960\nI've recently heard about this.\n\n56:29.960 --> 56:31.960\nThey could just use it forever.\n\n56:31.960 --> 56:33.960\nAnd then now I'm hearing like it's like a rude thing to do.\n\n56:33.960 --> 56:34.960\nWell, it's like the fast lane.\n\n56:34.960 --> 56:36.960\nWell, just on the off chance.\n\n56:36.960 --> 56:37.960\nNo, I get the logic.\n\n56:37.960 --> 56:39.960\nIt makes perfect sense.\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:48.960\nBut, you know, so the door on that stall has resting locked face.\n\n56:48.960 --> 56:54.960\nYou can't tell if anyone's in there without pushing on it.\n\n56:54.960 --> 56:58.960\nWhich is everyone's nightmare if they're in there.\n\n56:58.960 --> 56:59.960\nYeah.\n\n56:59.960 --> 57:01.960\nAll the more I imagine if they're differently abled.\n\n57:01.960 --> 57:04.960\nBut everyone's differently abled when they're pooping.\n\n57:04.960 --> 57:06.960\nDon't, don't quote me on that.\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:07.960\nEpisode's title.\n\n57:07.960 --> 57:10.960\nDon't use that as the title.\n\n57:10.960 --> 57:13.960\nThat's because it's going to, people are going to still see the title and they go,\n\n57:13.960 --> 57:17.960\noh, this is Jordan Peterson-ing about it, like handicap stalls.\n\n57:17.960 --> 57:20.960\nEveryone's differently abled when they're pooping.\n\n57:20.960 --> 57:24.960\nIf you think about it, like and subscribe.\n\n57:24.960 --> 57:27.960\nI've never watched any of his videos, I'm sure.\n\n57:27.960 --> 57:30.960\nYou can't, you didn't get his voice.\n\n57:30.960 --> 57:32.960\nHe has a, he has like a kermit.\n\n57:32.960 --> 57:37.960\nSo you got to like go in there and like, like big bad wolf on somebody's, some little\n\n57:37.960 --> 57:40.960\npiggies poop session.\n\n57:40.960 --> 57:43.960\nAnd then once you've done that, so now they hate you.\n\n57:43.960 --> 57:50.960\nSo if they're in there, now you're like rattle, rattle, and they're, and they're like,\n\n57:50.960 --> 57:51.960\nread the room.\n\n57:51.960 --> 57:53.960\nLike they're just going to sit there and be quiet.\n\n57:53.960 --> 57:55.960\nThey're not going to go occupado.\n\n57:55.960 --> 58:04.960\nLike sorry, buddy, almost.\n\n58:04.960 --> 58:06.960\nMake them feel bad.\n\n58:06.960 --> 58:09.960\nYou mean, so you mean it's like, you're almost done.\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:11.960\nYou're like close, but no cigar.\n\n58:11.960 --> 58:15.960\nNo, I do mean I'm almost done, even if I'm not.\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:16.960\nHere's another thing.\n\n58:16.960 --> 58:19.960\nYou miss 100% of the shots, you don't take, you know.\n\n58:19.960 --> 58:24.960\nHere's another thing, the non-differently abled stall.\n\n58:24.960 --> 58:25.960\nThe small stall.\n\n58:25.960 --> 58:27.960\nThe small stall doesn't lock.\n\n58:27.960 --> 58:29.960\nNo, it doesn't lock.\n\n58:29.960 --> 58:30.960\nIt doesn't lock.\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:36.960\nThat one, you got to hook your foot under the door, lift with your strained groin until\n\n58:36.960 --> 58:38.960\nthe bolt mechanism will slide in.\n\n58:38.960 --> 58:40.960\nSo now you're rattling everything.\n\n58:40.960 --> 58:44.960\nThat took me a week to figure out that until Brandon told me.\n\n58:44.960 --> 58:45.960\nThese are the cinder block walls.\n\n58:45.960 --> 58:46.960\nYeah.\n\n58:46.960 --> 58:47.960\nAll the walls are just shaking.\n\n58:47.960 --> 58:51.960\nSo the person, if it's their first poop in this building, they're going like, who is\n\n58:51.960 --> 58:53.960\nthis maniac?\n\n58:53.960 --> 58:59.960\nHe better poop nice and quiet, or I'm going to judge him by his new balances.\n\n58:59.960 --> 59:04.960\nWhen we go back out there and I'm drawing his fucking dumb ideas that he's going to\n\n59:04.960 --> 59:13.960\nchange in a week, if those shoes walk by me, I'm going to spill the tea in the fucking\n\n59:13.960 --> 59:14.960\nbreak room.\n\n59:14.960 --> 59:15.960\nI'll tell you that.\n\n59:15.960 --> 59:17.960\nDan Harmon's a shaky pooper.\n\n59:17.960 --> 59:18.960\nHe's loud too.\n\n59:18.960 --> 59:19.960\nThere's no break room.\n\n59:19.960 --> 59:24.960\nWe're all working for a fucking loud poopin maniac.\n\n59:24.960 --> 59:29.960\nThat was so title.\n\n59:29.960 --> 59:31.960\nIt's just awful.\n\n59:31.960 --> 59:34.960\nI'll tell you what's worse than that.\n\n59:34.960 --> 59:40.960\nI went to Dino's house for fried chicken on Sunday.\n\n59:40.960 --> 59:44.960\nSidebar, because we like to give you a little bit of good news in these podcasts.\n\n59:44.960 --> 59:54.960\nIf you crush pork rinds and use those in lieu of breadcrumbs, zero carb fried chicken.\n\n59:54.960 --> 59:56.960\nAll right.\n\n59:56.960 --> 59:59.960\nGod be with you.\n\n59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.960\nIt's probably not healthy, but it's zero carbs.\n\n01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960\nThere's no bread.\n\n01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960\nIt's fucking pork rinds.\n\n01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960\nWhy don't we think of this?\n\n01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.960\nYou could crush up the pork rinds, put a roll of chicken in them and fry that.\n\n01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960\nFor God's sake.\n\n01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960\nIt tasted great.\n\n01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.960\nYeah, so then, time to do it.\n\n01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.960\nAnother guy goes in Dino's bathroom.\n\n01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.960\nI'm like, ugh, he had the right idea.\n\n01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.960\nDino goes, I got two bathrooms.\n\n01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.960\nYou live in a P.O. box.\n\n01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.960\nThe guest house.\n\n01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.960\nThere's kids in there.\n\n01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.960\nIt's a guest house to a P.O. box.\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.960\nIt's a tiny, tiny, tiny, it's a bird house.\n\n01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.960\nAnd there's a TV in it where usually if people got kids, the kids will go in there and they'll\n\n01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.960\nwatch like fucking Peppa Pig or whatever.\n\n01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.960\nThat show fucking sucks.\n\n01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.960\nI watched it for like two hours with my soon-to-be niece for the Disneyland trip.\n\n01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.960\nDid I talk about this when I was black out?\n\n01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960\nNot to me.\n\n01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.960\nDid you know, have you seen this fucking thing?\n\n01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.960\nDino's house?\n\n01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960\nNo, Peppa Pig.\n\n01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.960\nYou know, the pigs, all of their heads are drawn identically.\n\n01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.960\nIf you asked a six-year-old to draw a penis as fast as they could, that's what all the pigs,\n\n01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.960\ntheir heads are dicks and balls.\n\n01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.960\nYeah.\n\n01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.960\nBut I think there's satanic magic happening with that show because the three-year-old,\n\n01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960\nshe loves Peppa Pig.\n\n01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960\nSo I wanted to be a good uncle, get on her good side.\n\n01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960\nI'm like, maybe we'll watch Peppa Pig.\n\n01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.960\nShe's like, I want to sleep with Aunt Cody and Uncle Doodoo Bear.\n\n01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960\nThat's what they call me.\n\n01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960\nWhy?\n\n01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.960\nI kind of came up with it because I knew if I had a nickname that, when we had, we had\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.960\nWalkie Talkies in the desert and I'm like, I'm an interloper.\n\n01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960\nI'm an outsider.\n\n01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.960\nI gotta, I gotta be fun, you know, and I'm not a naturally fun person.\n\n01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.960\nAnd I don't want to put any energy into being fun.\n\n01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960\nWhat if I had a fun name?\n\n01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.960\nWell, you can't just name yourself.\n\n01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960\nWalkie Talkies.\n\n01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.960\nI was just like, Breaker Breaker.\n\n01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.960\nAnd it gave it like an improvisational sound.\n\n01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.960\nI was like, this is Doodoo Bear.\n\n01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.960\nOh boy, they think they've, you know, they're hacking the system, calling me that.\n\n01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960\nI'm like, you've been manipulated.\n\n01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.960\nI'm Ronald McDonald, a zero effort.\n\n01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.960\nI'm like a fucking star.\n\n01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960\nI might have kids.\n\n01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960\nI didn't know how easy it was.\n\n01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:36.960\nSo, so, so, so, so Dino goes, I go, I go, I'm not going to shit in the tiny guest house\n\n01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.960\nwhere the kids lay in the, in the, in the fold out bed and watch TV.\n\n01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960\nAnd Dino goes, it's just Finn.\n\n01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.960\nThat's IO's kid, ex-girlfriend of mine.\n\n01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.960\nHe's like, how old do you think Finn is?\n\n01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960\nHe's like eight or something.\n\n01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960\nI've never met him.\n\n01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.960\nHe's sentient, but it's just him.\n\n01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.960\nAnd I was, we're kind of like, yeah, he's like a, he's kind of like the feral kid in Road Warrior.\n\n01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.960\nHe's really smart, but he's just like, he's like an animal person.\n\n01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.960\nAnd I mean, like, like, like in a good way, like we just, we make fun of him.\n\n01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.960\nIt's like, you know, bad mother, bad mother.\n\n01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960\nAll right.\n\n01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.960\nBut he's laying there.\n\n01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960\nHe's watching some things.\n\n01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960\nHe's zoned out.\n\n01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.960\nBut this is like, I walked in and like 46 year old man, I walk in.\n\n01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960\nI got to walk past him.\n\n01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.960\nThere's this tiny little bathroom.\n\n01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.960\nThe whole place is like six cubic feet.\n\n01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960\nHe's watching Peppa Pig.\n\n01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960\nHe's watching God.\n\n01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.960\nI don't know what he's watching.\n\n01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.960\nI'm too, I got too much anxiety.\n\n01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960\nDragon Riders.\n\n01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.960\nLike he's watching some garbage that kids think is weird.\n\n01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960\nDino Riders.\n\n01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960\nYeah.\n\n01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.960\nLike some fucking time, time warriors or some shit.\n\n01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960\nTime Riders.\n\n01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.960\nAnd so I get, I get, I get to the bathroom door.\n\n01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.960\nIt's like this thin sliding door.\n\n01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960\nDo you say anything to him?\n\n01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960\nBecause I was like, what am I doing?\n\n01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.960\nI stopped and I paused and I'm like, why are you pausing?\n\n01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.960\nAnd then I like turned around and he's like sitting there.\n\n01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.960\nThere's like long haired eight year old California kid like glassy eyed watching his goddamn fucking\n\n01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960\nrobots or whatever.\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:19.960\nAnd then he looks at me and I go, I'm going to take a huge dump.\n\n01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.960\nAnd, and I go in and that's exactly what I did.\n\n01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960\nBut it was loud.\n\n01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.960\nSo I like ran the sink, but I'm like, not fooling anybody.\n\n01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.960\nYou think he thinks you're like washing your hands for an hour?\n\n01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.960\nI ran it anyway.\n\n01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.960\nLike, do you know what I think?\n\n01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960\nI wipe my ass.\n\n01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960\nI wash my hands.\n\n01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.960\nThey fucking finish up.\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.960\nCheck, check the Instagram.\n\n01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960\nGot a lot of likes.\n\n01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.960\nI come out of the thing ago and I give him a thumbs up.\n\n01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.960\nAnd, and he, look, I could lie at this point in the story and say that he said anything\n\n01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.960\nso that he deserved this, but it was really just my own shame.\n\n01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.960\nIt just, he's just kind of like, like an eye roll.\n\n01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.960\nAnd I, and I, and I, and then I, and I got all the way to the exit door and I was like,\n\n01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:22.960\nyeah, well, I have a car.\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.960\nWhat did he do

01:08:17.960\nYeah.\n\n01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.960\nAnd you kind of bear sites kind of leavey.\n\n01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.960\nCan you send somebody?\n\n01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960\nCome on.\n\n01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960\nOh yeah.\n\n01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960\nNo, no, no ice thingy.\n\n01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960\nLeavey, bring the ice thingy.\n\n01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.960\nI mean, if I, if I leave this stage, this show, I'll go right into the, right into the dumpster.\n\n01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.960\nI run a tight ship.\n\n01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960\nAll right.\n\n01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.960\nSo thanks, leavey.\n\n01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960\nSo isn't there any more?\n\n01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960\nThank you.\n\n01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960\nI think he's sick.\n\n01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:51.960\nIs there more to quantum suicide than, than just because what you're describing is just\n\n01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960\nreligion.\n\n01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.960\nHe thought he was going to die and by dying.\n\n01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960\nOkay, I get it now.\n\n01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.960\nSo he wasn't going, oh, I hate my life.\n\n01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960\nI'm going to kill myself.\n\n01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.960\nHe goes, um, I'm okay.\n\n01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.960\nBut what if I was taller and then jumped off a cliff?\n\n01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960\nWell, he thought he was getting out of the matrix.\n\n01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960\nLike he thought he was breaking through.\n\n01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960\nHe found a hack.\n\n01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960\nRight.\n\n01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.960\nHe thought like it was almost like a creepy pasta ritual or something because he brought\n\n01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960\nhis pets.\n\n01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.960\nYeah, he brought it.\n\n01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960\nHe brought some caged animals.\n\n01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960\nHe brought his pets dog.\n\n01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960\nYeah, no, you wouldn't like it.\n\n01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.960\nHe left them out there in the freezing cold like carriers.\n\n01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960\nYeah, it was bad.\n\n01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960\nHe was a dick.\n\n01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.960\nWell, he's dead.\n\n01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960\nUsually you'll be happy to know.\n\n01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960\nI am.\n\n01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:36.960\nUm, but it's, it is the crez, one of the craziest stories in a genre of that is just riddled\n\n01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.960\nwith WTFs and, and OMGs.\n\n01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:46.960\nYeah, I think he had a psychotic break and he, uh, he like, he like, he like invited this\n\n01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.960\ngirl that wasn't even his girlfriend.\n\n01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.960\nIt's like they, they had dated, then they weren't, they're not.\n\n01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960\nI call it a Moby.\n\n01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.960\nUm, he had talked to her a little bit.\n\n01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.960\nThere's a applause from the, from the movies.\n\n01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960\nMovies got it bad enough.\n\n01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.960\nWhat am I trying to, like what was it like when the white nighting Moby is like everyone's\n\n01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960\njust drowning in the same pool.\n\n01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.960\nI'm like shoving his head under like that's like that's like that's going to keep me safe.\n\n01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.960\nI already got me one and a half.\n\n01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960\nAll right.\n\n01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960\nOkay.\n\n01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960\nI only have to get me point five.\n\n01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.960\nMe one and a half.\n\n01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.960\nUh, fucking idiot.\n\n01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:38.960\nSo he dated a lady and then then then then he stopped dating a lady and he invited her\n\n01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.960\nout.\n\n01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960\nSo you want to do something cool?\n\n01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.960\nYou want to supervise my suicide.\n\n01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.960\nUm, he had made sure to leave her.\n\n01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.960\nLike it was clear to her that when he died, she was going to get some money.\n\n01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960\nYeah.\n\n01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960\nIt was $180,000.\n\n01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960\nI think.\n\n01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:04.960\nUm, but your theory based on the various clues, uh, is that he always fully intended for her\n\n01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.960\nto do it with him.\n\n01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.960\nAnd, uh, and then he was, he knew he, he could only lure anyone out.\n\n01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.960\nEven, I mean, he, yeah, he could, he could, you, you, you, you, you, you, the only way\n\n01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.960\nhe could get someone to attend his suicide was to bribe them, especially if your plan\n\n01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960\nis for them to join.\n\n01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.960\nYeah.\n\n01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.960\nI mean, it was, it was, that was the amount of money it was going to take to be able to\n\n01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.960\nmanipulate her through the process of that ritual all the way to the end.\n\n01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.960\nSo he basically like grabbed her hand on the way down, right?\n\n01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960\nYeah.\n\n01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.960\nI mean, so basically the whole way he's telling, he's taking her farther and farther through\n\n01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.960\nit, um, knowing that he has the leverage of the money because otherwise he's asking her\n\n01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.960\nto do some very crazy things and there's no benefit to her whatsoever.\n\n01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960\nShe wasn't suicidal.\n\n01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.960\nBut she had a knife which put a pit in why, but, um, uh,\n\n01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960\nWell, it came from his apartment.\n\n01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.960\nSo we assume he brought it.\n\n01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.960\nIt was like, it was like, ostensibly like, Oh, I'll bring that knife.\n\n01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.960\nCause then if I jump, it's weird though that he would be planning for the jump to be unsuccessful.\n\n01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.960\nIf I don't, if I don't, if the jump doesn't finish me, I'll start stabbing myself.\n\n01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.960\nI mean,\n\n01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960\nYeah.\n\n01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.960\nWell, I think, I think the part of that is the fact that he's trying to solve an emotional\n\n01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960\nproblem physically.\n\n01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.960\nAnd so what's happening is he's jumping off this cliff, but he's chosen a short cliff\n\n01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.960\nbecause he doesn't really want to die, but he thinks this quantum suicide thing is a great\n\n01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960\nthing because he's falling into this mental illness.\n\n01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.960\nBut, um, it's an interesting process, but, um, yeah, very disturbing.\n\n01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960\nBut basically he jumps, neither of them die.\n\n01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960\nHe pulls her down.\n\n01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.960\nShe's got a knife.\n\n01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960\nShe's so pissed.\n\n01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.960\nShe kills him.\n\n01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:38.960\nI'm laughing, but it's okay.\n\n01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960\nUh, she's in prison.\n\n01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.960\nYeah.\n\n01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960\nShe got life in prison.\n\n01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.960\nYeah.\n\n01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960\nThat's just self-defense.\n\n01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960\nWell, she, well, she didn't, she didn't.\n\n01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.960\nThere's more to the story.\n\n01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.960\nYeah.\n\n01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960\nI mean, she, she, she slit his throat.\n\n01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.960\nSo long story short, they go, they go off the cliff.\n\n01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.960\nUm, he has pulled her off the cliff by grabbing her hand and kill anyone.\n\n01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960\nThey have the knife.\n\n01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.960\nThey assume the knife was to finish the job on either one of them.\n\n01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.960\nIf they lived, um, he got up first, he helped her to her feet according to her.\n\n01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960\nAnd they walked about a mile and a half into the forest.\n\n01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960\nNow they're completely nude.\n\n01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960\nIt's the middle of the winter.\n\n01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960\nIt's raining.\n\n01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960\nIt's freezing cold and temperatures right about freezing.\n\n01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.960\nAnd, um, they basically get about a mile and a half and they get to a creek and they're\n\n01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.960\nabout to cross this creek and then suddenly her story gets a little fuzzy and he ends\n\n01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960\ndown in the creek with his throat cut and it's not just cut.\n\n01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960\nI mean, he's almost decapitated.\n\n01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.960\nSo, um, it looks like he was cut between three to seven times and she suggested that he was\n\n01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.960\nthe one who cut his own throat.\n\n01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960\nRight.\n\n01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.960\nIt's kind of, yeah.\n\n01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.960\nIt almost, well, I guess that she would probably only serve a couple of years if in fact it\n\n01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960\nwas just bottom of the cliff.\n\n01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.960\nShe stabbed him to death, like, because then she could tell all of the truth and be like,\n\n01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.960\nthis dick and the judge would be like, yeah, or the jury would go like, okay, I mean, no\n\n01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.960\none's in their right mind when someone who they think they're just helping commit suicide\n\n01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.960\ngrabs their hand, pulls them down and you had a knife and he sounds like a real jerk.\n\n01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.960\nHe left his pets in a fucking box up there.\n\n01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.960\nAnd when he pulled you down with him, that meant he was fine with his fucking animals\n\n01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.960\nfreezing to death.\n\n01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960\nYeah.\n\n01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.960\nBut anyways, but the weird thing is that she's a life in prison because of the, just because\n\n01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:32.960\nit took her a while and also her insistence that it was his, that not only that he demanded\n\n01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.960\nthat she kill him, but that he physically told her to put, to stand behind him and put\n\n01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.960\nthe knife up to his throat and in her version of the story, she's like, and I wasn't sure\n\n01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960\nwhat he was up to at that point.\n\n01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:51.460\nAnd then he took my hand and started sawing and it's like, like, geez, I mean, well, you're\n\n01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.960\nasking us to believe like, it would be easier to believe you were mad at, at a dick.\n\n01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.960\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.960\nWell, I think the toughest part of it for the, you know, for the jury and for the police as\n\n01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:07.960\nwell, is that when they found her, she started telling one story.\n\n01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.960\nAnd as they moved through the paramedics to the police, to multiple interviews with detectives,\n\n01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.960\nshe told a different story about his death each time.\n\n01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.560\nAnd so it just kept evolving to a point where she had more and more involvement.\n\n01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.640\nAnd so once she told the story about five times, her hand was on the knife with his.\n\n01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.960\nAnd so at that point, she can't go any farther and concede anything more.\n\n01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.960\nBut we know that there is more that she actually killed him because her story has.\n\n01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960\nOkay.\n\n01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.960\nSo she started with the simplest thing, which is like, she walked for a while and he slit\n\n01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960\nhis own throat.\n\n01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.960\nAnd she first, oh no, she first says that he died from injuries when he fell off the\n\n01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960\ncliff.\n\n01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960\nNo, obviously.\n\n01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960\nOkay.\n\n01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960\nYeah.\n\n01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.960\nThat's what she told the paramedics.\n\n01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960\nAnd they testified to that.\n\n01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.960\nAnd so she, she, that's what she first said.\n\n01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.640\nAnd obviously that's not true.\n\n01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.260\nAnd then she said that he fell on a knife in the woods.\n\n01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.240\nAnd obviously that's not going over too well.\n\n01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:05.400\nSo from there, it became that she was actually at the creek and he killed himself.\n\n01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.040\nBut then due to the number of slices across the throat, they assumed that he wouldn't\n\n01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.640\nbe able to do that.\n\n01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.080\nAnd she started to concede a little more with each detective interview.\n\n01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.920\nAnd finally, once they had her hand on the knife, then they didn't bother to go any farther.\n\n01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.720\nIt felt like they had enough.\n\n01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.720\nYeah.\n\n01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.920\nSo did he believe in multiple universes or realities or whatever?\n\n01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.920\nYeah.\n\n01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.960\nI mean, that was the, it was basically quantum mysticism.\n\n01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.600\nAnd so he was thinking that there was another version of him somewhere else.\n\n01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.920\nAnd in a parallel universe or alternate reality where he was going to die from this quantum\n\n01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:45.040\nsuicide and then assume that other life where he made different decisions and he was going\n\n01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.040\nto be happier.\n\n01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.040\nAnd obviously that adds him.\n\n01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.320\nDid you think he thought she was going to die or do you think she, like, he thought like,\n\n01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.240\noh, she'll be like, grist for the mill.\n\n01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240\nLike.\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240\nYeah.\n\n01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.640\nI think he fully intended for her to die and to transcend this world with him.\n\n01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.400\nI think he wanted to take someone with him.\n\n01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400\nRight.\n\n01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400\nOkay.\n\n01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400\nAnd then she was not aware of that.\n\n01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.520\nShe was like, promising her that money to get her up on the cliff.\n\n01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.480\nAnd then, and then they're like wandering around the metaphysical realm together or in some\n\n01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.920\nworld that's made of pizza.\n\n01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.920\nAnd she's like, why am I here?\n\n01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.640\nAnd he's like, I pulled you down.\n\n01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.000\nAnd she's like, you son of a bitch, I'll take pepperoni.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.120\nTell me about your day.\n\n01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.600\nIt's the Chris Pratt passengers movie relationship.\n\n01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.600\nYou did what?\n\n01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.920\nYou life ruin her.\n\n01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.920\nGive me that dick.\n\n01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.360\nI can't stay mad at you.\n\n01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.160\nI haven't seen past that movie is hysterical.\n\n01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.840\nI've told you, I've said this before and nobody laughed when I said this, but I'm telling\n\n01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.000\nyou, you got to watch the movie and you got to give me some fucking credit because it\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.280\nwas so like, and I'm sorry, it's a, it's a, it's a crass area.\n\n01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:55.920\nBut obviously, like what he's doing is, is essentially like, like it's like a, a, a,\n\n01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.520\nit's a, it's a, it's a non consensual, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,\n\n01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.760\nabduction, uh, uh, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, yeah, he's assaulting her life.\n\n01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760\nUm, right.\n\n01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.640\nHe kind of, you know, way sentences her to death.\n\n01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640\nRight.\n\n01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.440\nAnd then I made the joke and it, you know, we kept using the R word.\n\n01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.360\nI'm going to use the R word as infrequently as possible in my hilarious like appraisal\n\n01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.600\nof the movie, but, but, but, but, but like Cody and I are using it.\n\n01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.760\nIt's like, it's like, this is, it's like, geez, it's like, okay.\n\n01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.160\nAnd then I made the joke.\n\n01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:32.400\nI was like, well, there's only one way out of this feature film story, like third, the\n\n01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:38.560\nbottom of the second act, the, the spaceship's going to need to be raped and he'll somehow\n\n01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.560\ndo it.\n\n01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.160\nIt's absolutely what happened.\n\n01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.080\nThere's a hole on the ship that he had to go into that didn't want you in it, that it's\n\n01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.120\nall explained, like there's a hole and he has to like go in it, force his way up it.\n\n01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.520\nAnd it's just so, it's like the ship won't want you in that hole and it'll try to blast\n\n01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520\nyou out.\n\n01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.520\nBut if you can just stay in there and stay alive long enough to pull this lever, you'll\n\n01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.240\nsave everybody and, and that's the act that he does that, of course, when you come back\n\n01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:12.120\nfrom that, she's like, you know, it all comes out in the wash, like, you know, because I'm\n\n01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.880\nmad at you for doing the first thing, but then you, then you've, then you, you've saved\n\n01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.600\nthe ship and then they plant a tree and grow old together.\n\n01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600\nNobody's laughing again.\n\n01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:28.400\nSometimes it's, it's just a man, I mean, I, like, I did like to watch a movie and you're\n\n01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.000\nlike, I, like, there's, I, to make that joke and then they have the joke that you made\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.880\nthat you did not expect, but it was like fucking actually what they wrote.\n\n01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880\nIt's fantastic.\n\n01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.760\nIt'd be like if you were watching Monster House and I was like, well, there's only one\n\n01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.400\nway out of this, probably find out the house is like a sad fat person and they just, just\n\n01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.400\nhave tea and tell the story without houses waiting across the street.\n\n01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.400\nYeah.\n\n01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:03.520\nMaking of a murderer.\n\n01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.920\nYou watched that documentary.\n\n01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.920\nI have.\n\n01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.920\nYeah.\n\n01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920\nYeah.\n\n01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.920\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920\nDo you hate it?\n\n01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920\nI'm not big on doc.\n\n01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.920\nI mean, I love documentaries for the purpose of entertainment, but as far as investigating\n\n01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.800\na crime, they're definitely not the best thing to look at.\n\n01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:22.520\nI mean, just for the fact that it's edited and it's, you know, it's a created narrative,\n\n01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.640\nwhether it's, you know, entirely true or not, it's generally edited in a way that makes\n\n01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640\nit the most entertaining.\n\n01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.280\nBut if you studied that case, yeah, what do you think?\n\n01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280\nDo you have?\n\n01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.280\nI definitely think he's guilty.\n\n01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.280\nYou definitely think he's guilty.\n\n01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.280\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.760\nWhat about the kid?\n\n01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.280\nI believe he was involved, but I don't know to what extent.\n\n01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.280\nYeah.\n\n01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.040\nI mean, there, I mean, that, yeah, that aspect of is a little difficult because the biggest\n\n01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040\nbummer.\n\n01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:53.000\nBecause obviously he was mistreated very badly and so we don't really get a good sense\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nof the truth.\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nRight.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nRight.\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nSo why do you think that he did it?\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nWhat was it?\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.040\nBecause I mean, I watched it and I went, oh, this poor guy, but you're just, it's consistent\n\n01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.760\nwith his character and he also on the day that it happened, I mean, he actually set\n\n01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:12.320\nher up to come there under false pretenses and he had already harassed her and so that's\n\n01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.320\nreally the next step.\n\n01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.600\nAnd if you look at people who commit murders in that way, they generally start with things\n\n01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.200\nlike that and it escalates.\n\n01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.200\nYeah.\n\n01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.200\nSo that lie in particular.\n\n01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:28.480\nI mean, that's the, the, the idea that you have, the, that's the problem, like the police\n\n01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.560\nwant to do their job really well.\n\n01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.920\nThey want to save the world from evil people and they like, they can't stand the idea of\n\n01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.200\nsomebody getting away with it or they become certain somebody did something and then maybe\n\n01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.440\nsometimes they'll put their thumbs on some scales or they'll like overlook some clerical\n\n01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.440\nMiranda business or something and or they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll be like, well, maybe\n\n01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.320\nwe can get this confession or, you know, through this means or that because they got their\n\n01:21:53.320 --> 01:22:00.520\neyes on the final prize and it's exactly that mentality that we have to abandon when we\n\n01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:06.800\nwatch these like cereal kind of things because it's like people go, oh, I, I'm going to debunk\n\n01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.880\ncereal because I think Adnan did it.\n\n01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.920\nBut it's like, well, that's not really the point is rule of law.\n\n01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.920\nThe point is the terrible investigating, terrible law enforcement, terrible trials done terribly\n\n01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:28.960\nwhere whether the person did it or not, they shouldn't be in prison by any of our definition,\n\n01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.800\nour standards of jurisprudence, whatever that word means.\n\n01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:38.640\nLike you agree, I assume, like it's like, like you can still enjoy these documentaries\n\n01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.240\nwithout having, you know, I think people think they're ruining when they go, you know, that\n\n01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.240\nguy's a bag of dicks.\n\n01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.240\nHe did it.\n\n01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.600\nI'm like, well, still they shafted them.\n\n01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:50.320\nI think guilt and police misconduct are not mutually exclusive.\n\n01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.320\nI think most of the, most of the really interesting cases involve not only somebody who's guilty\n\n01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.800\nand pretending to be innocent, but also a case where that person is making strides in\n\n01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.440\nthat sense because there's a lot of police misconduct.\n\n01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.840\nWe do see a lot of cases like that, and they're very interesting.\n\n01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.160\nIt's unfortunate that it takes place, but yeah, that's why I, my mind is blown by like\n\n01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:18.160\ngood, good, by the book homicide detectives, like the guys that Yardley's always having\n\n01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.840\nas guests, like just like, geez, how can you suspend that dramatic part of your brain that's\n\n01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.360\nlike, you'd, you'd, you'd, you'd, you'd do it.\n\n01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.360\nYour Asperger detective.\n\n01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.400\nHe'd be like, let me look around this scene.\n\n01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.400\nYou guys see Caddyshack?\n\n01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.000\nI'm like, Caddyshack, what are you talking about?\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.760\nIt's a movie about resources and redirection of light.\n\n01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:41.760\nOh, what?\n\n01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.920\nWe got a fucking psycho on our hands.\n\n01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.080\nHey, he's a psycho that gets results.\n\n01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.520\nThe captain said, this guy came from Paris.\n\n01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520\nHe's Interpol.\n\n01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520\nWatch him.\n\n01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:57.720\nAnd then you just like follow like this and you're like, you're like laying down sunflower\n\n01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:04.600\nseeds and follow the trail of them to a, a cellar door and a body falls out.\n\n01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:09.200\nHoly shit.\n\n01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:17.400\nThis guy's got serious ass burgers and the, and the chief's chief's like, yeah, he's\n\n01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.160\ngot them all the way to the bank.\n\n01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.080\nI've never cleared so many cases in my life.\n\n01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.840\nHey, hello to your new partner, uh, Rhea Perlman.\n\n01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.600\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.840\nIt seems to simply be good casting.\n\n01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:42.320\nYeah, I, I, you and ready to, it's just in my iCloud as my ex-wife called it, as it\n\n01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320\nprobably goes.\n\n01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.960\nI had dinner with a, a DeVito, I thinking about Rhea Perlman somewhere in the back\n\n01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.920\nof my head for casting, I don't know.\n\n01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.240\nWhich DeVito?\n\n01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.680\nThere were several DeVito's at the dinner, dick.\n\n01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.120\nThere's a lot of DeVito's.\n\n01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120\nSo fuck you.\n\n01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.680\nShit.\n\n01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:08.440\nSo which DeVito?\n\n01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.440\nTwo, two of them, including the big one.\n\n01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.960\nFrank DeVito.\n\n01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.640\nNo, baby, double D.\n\n01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.920\nYeah, and you know fucking Batman walked in.\n\n01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.920\nYou listened to the show.\n\n01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.920\nYou like it.\n\n01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.440\nFucking Michael Keaton came in.\n\n01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.440\nYeah.\n\n01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.360\nRemember when we met, we met Michael Keaton like 20 years ago?\n\n01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.600\nIt was like the first famous person we ever like saw.\n\n01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.320\nAfter Stiller.\n\n01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.320\nYeah.\n\n01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.320\nAre you sure?\n\n01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320\nYeah.\n\n01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320\nYeah.\n\n01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.320\nYeah.\n\n01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.320\nYeah.\n\n01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.320\nCause we made Heat Fusion a jacket.\n\n01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320\nThat's why Michael Keaton wanted to meet us.\n\n01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:54.320\nYeah, and it was just like, we're like standing, standing outside his Santa Monica office.\n\n01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.520\nLike, and I just, I thought I was going to pass out.\n\n01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520\nI was that nervous.\n\n01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.240\nCause it was like, what are we doing?\n\n01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.480\nWhy are we meeting Michael Keaton?\n\n01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480\nWhat does he want?\n\n01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.000\nIt's like a Saturday.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.400\nYeah.\n\n01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.760\nAnd then we saw a car drive by and we're like, do you think that was Michael Keaton's car?\n\n01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.960\nLike what is he, does he come up on a scooter?\n\n01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.520\nWe're like on that ocean drive or whatever where it's just like, there's people are just\n\n01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520\nrollerblading.\n\n01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.520\nLike there's no way to.\n\n01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.520\nIt's almost like a dream.\n\n01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520\nI can't, I don't.\n\n01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.120\nWas he going to paraglide in?\n\n01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.040\nIs Michael Keaton already in there and he's just hiding?\n\n01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.760\nBut I think he, I think he drove in and like parked.\n\n01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.000\nThat's how fucking good that script was.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nBatman said, hey, come over to my house on a Sunday.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.500\nLet me be with these guys.\n\n01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.600\nI want to meet with these guys.\n\n01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.840\nYou know, I read this script.\n\n01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.840\nI want these guys to come in.\n\n01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.320\nLet me, let me talk to them.\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320\nLet me pick their brain.\n\n01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.560\nI think that's a pretty good Michael Keaton.\n\n01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.680\nNorm MacDonald does a pretty good Michael Keaton impression.\n\n01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.040\nBetter than that?\n\n01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040\nWho are you doing?\n\n01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.040\nLet me meet these guys.\n\n01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040\nLet me meet these guys.\n\n01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.040\nYeah.\n\n01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040\nNow I lost it.\n\n01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.440\nI always, I do, I do great first impressions.\n\n01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440\nMichael Keaton.\n\n01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440\nMichael Keaton.\n\n01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.440\nAnyways.\n\n01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.640\nSo what, wait, wait, wait, but remember, remember how he opened the door?\n\n01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.520\nHe was just like, he opened it so fast.\n\n01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520\nYou remember, right?\n\n01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.000\nYou remember the moment of meeting Michael Keaton?\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nI'm vaguely, vaguely remembering.\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nOh, you know what?\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.600\nI thought that you and I shared that it was like, that's implanted in our memory.\n\n01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600\nLike, who could...\n\n01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600\nIt isn't, it isn't.\n\n01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600\nI mean, but...\n\n01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.600\nOur standard was sidewalk.\n\n01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.600\nWe're like, how is Michael Keaton going to arrive?\n\n01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600\nI was seriously frying out.\n\n01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.600\nI was freaking out.\n\n01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.040\nAnd then he just like, the door just flew open, just flew open and he had just had this look\n\n01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.040\nand he was like, hey.\n\n01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040\nYeah.\n\n01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040\nYeah.\n\n01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.600\nLike he was, like he had been in there and he was worried, he was late and it was\n\n01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:47.000\nlike, the door couldn't open fast enough and it was just like, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.680\nAnd then we just, you think we blew that meeting?\n\n01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.760\nWell, we...\n\n01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.520\nIf the goal was to develop with Michael Keaton, we blew it.\n\n01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520\nWe blew it, yeah.\n\n01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.600\nYeah, we walked out without...\n\n01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.800\nI think, I think, you know, I mean, I was like, yeah, meeting Michael Keaton.\n\n01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:08.440\nI mean, like I was, you probably did all the talking and I just sat there going, but yeah,\n\n01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.760\nI hardly remember any of it because I was probably freaking out.\n\n01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.480\nWell, the conclusion of it was that we were both kind of like, because he was basically\n\n01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.240\nsaying to us, I mean, he said a lot about a lot of stuff, like the kinds of characters\n\n01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240\nhe likes to play.\n\n01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.880\nI mean, it's like, I look back on it and go like, geez, should be so lucky.\n\n01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.640\nIt's not that we thought we weren't, it's not like we were looking down at it, but we just,\n\n01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:35.200\nI mean, it was like, it's like, like, he was basically like kind of saying, write something\n\n01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:44.640\nfor me and I'll use my name and thing, you know, or he wasn't actually saying, write\n\n01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640\nsomething for me.\n\n01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.720\nHe was one of those things because he was a movie star, he was like, oh, you know, I'll\n\n01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:54.960\nEP it and I'll do a part in it.\n\n01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.680\nHe wanted to do what Stiller was doing with Heat Vision and Jack.\n\n01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:04.120\nSo then we were kind of just like, well, if you have any ideas, let us know.\n\n01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.520\nThat was like, all right, because we were like from Wisconsin, we're kind of like, well,\n\n01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.240\nwe don't just tell Michael Keaton what to say he created.\n\n01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.800\nLike that doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.680\nWe're like, well, fucking think about something and call us, Jesus Christ, let's get out of\n\n01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.680\nhere.\n\n01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:23.040\nFucking Batman, call us down here on Saturday.\n\n01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.440\nI think we were like, we did act a little like, oh boy, what's up with him, he's kind\n\n01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.440\nof weird.\n\n01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.920\nBut I think that was all about just being insecure.\n\n01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.200\nI mean, from my point of view, it was being insecure, like going, oh, geez, well, we were\n\n01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.200\ninsecure.\n\n01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200\nYeah.\n\n01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.200\nWait, wait, wait, me more than you.\n\n01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200\nI was like, fuck.\n\n01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.920\nYeah, we were like, how do you do a Michael Keaton meeting, right?\n\n01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.200\nAnd then, and then the easier path was to go like, well, he did it wrong.\n\n01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.200\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.360\nHey, you in the mood for pretzels, buddy, get out of my brain.\n\n01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.360\nBest friends.\n\n01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.360\nYeah.\n\n01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.440\nI think I was driving.\n\n01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.440\nYeah.\n\n01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:12.200\nOh, well, you don't know which guy was you in that exchange, but, but, but he was, he\n\n01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.520\nwas being very vulnerable, communicative, like, like, uh, loquacious.\n\n01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.520\nHe was like, enthusiastic.\n\n01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.480\nWe could have done that meeting better.\n\n01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.720\nI wish we could have easily turned it into a job.\n\n01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720\nYeah.\n\n01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.760\nI, we, we fucked up.\n\n01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:27.760\nWe fucked.\n\n01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.200\nWe fucked up the quantum world out there where we fucking went from Stiller to Keaton.\n\n01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.500\nIt was quantum suicide.\n\n01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500\nYeah.\n\n01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.040\nWell, well, well, no, that's the gateway is quantum suicide.\n\n01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.920\nI'm, we got to get there.\n\n01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.840\nSchrab, would you accompany me for how much to Griffith Park?\n\n01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840\nThere's a certain wall.\n\n01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:57.680\nWould you go in the bushes with me in Griffith Park and have a, what, what, this is your\n\n01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.680\nYeah, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all right.\n\n01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.680\nWow. Okay. Well?\n\n01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:09.680\nI hear that Godzilla movie didn't do as well as they thought it would.\n\n01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.680\nI don't know. Is that another Godzilla movie now?\n\n01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680\nNo.\n\n01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.680\nOh.\n\n01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.680\nYeah.\n\n01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.680\nI don't know the difference between jokes.\n\n01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.680\nIt was like three weeks ago or something like that.\n\n01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.680\nAll I heard from it was like,\n\n01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:27.680\nwell, that Godzilla movie didn't do as well as they thought it would. Have you seen the new Godzilla movie?\n\n01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.680\nDidn't even know it existed.\n\n01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:30.680\nOkay.\n\n01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.680\nAnd you're a detective.\n\n01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.680\nThe creature is 700 feet tall.\n\n01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.680\nYou haven't found him.\n\n01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:43.680\nWhat was he hiding in Madison Square Garden?\n\n01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.680\nYeah. Come on. Come on.\n\n01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.680\nHave they ever made a good one?\n\n01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.680\nShit yeah, man.\n\n01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.680\nI mean, recently?\n\n01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.680\nShit fuck yeah, man.\n\n01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.680\nYeah? Which one?\n\n01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.680\nYeah. The first one is awesome. The first one's great.\n\n01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:59.680\nAnd Godzilla vs. Violenta is great.\n\n01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.680\nIt's from the 90s. That one's fucking good.\n\n01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.680\nYou know what else is good?\n\n01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:05.680\nBlade.\n\n01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.680\nBlade's a fucking good movie, man.\n\n01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680\nFucking Wesley Snipes.\n\n01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.680\nYup.\n\n01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.680\nFucking Blade is great.\n\n01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680\nYup.\n\n01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.680\nProve me wrong.\n\n01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.680\nCan't.\n\n01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.680\nWon't.\n\n01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.680\nYou can't.\n\n01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.680\nHey, can we do a Kai B blade and you'll be a whistler?\n\n01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.680\nSure.\n\n01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.680\nAnd I'm going to come home from a rave where I killed all the vampires.\n\n01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.680\nJust going to check in with you.\n\n01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.680\nRiding my blade car into the warehouse.\n\n01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.680\nThose nun chucks you gave me.\n\n01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.680\nYou gave me out of garlic.\n\n01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.680\nI'm just mixing up some more garlic for you right now.\n\n01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.680\nIt's more blood suckers out there than ever before.\n\n01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.680\nIt's better be open season on suck heads because we're in the suck head killing business.\n\n01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.680\nI'm thinking of getting out.\n\n01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.680\nThis shit's too deep.\n\n01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.680\nBlade, you can't get out.\n\n01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.680\nYou're, you can't.\n\n01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.680\nHow's that cure coming?\n\n01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.680\nI'm working on it.\n\n01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.680\nI'm working on it.\n\n01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.680\nWait, I don't want a cure, do I?\n\n01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.680\nBecause I have all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses.\n\n01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.680\nThat's what I keep telling you.\n\n01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.680\nI don't want a cure.\n\n01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.680\nDo I like what I do?\n\n01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.680\nAre we both on the same page?\n\n01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.680\nI hope so.\n\n01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.680\nOkay, that's refreshing.\n\n01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.680\nI'm here because of you.\n\n01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.680\nYou know how Alfred's always fucking bitching at Batman.\n\n01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.680\nIt's like Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:54.680\nGo to a couples therapist.\n\n01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.680\nOkay, same page club.\n\n01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680\nAll right.\n\n01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.680\nLet's see what you got.\n\n01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.680\nSorry about my comment.\n\n01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.680\nI thought I was saying what you wanted to hear.\n\n01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.680\nSo check this out.\n\n01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.680\nSit down at the dinner table.\n\n01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.680\nI think you're going to like this.\n\n01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.680\nIt's a new recipe.\n\n01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:14.680\nOh.\n\n01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.680\nAnd I know it's not as spicy.\n\n01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.680\nOh.\n\n01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.680\nBecause you don't like it when it's spicy.\n\n01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.680\nNo, no, sir.\n\n01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680\nOkay.\n\n01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680\nI thought maybe weapons.\n\n01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680\nYeah, take it, take it.\n\n01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.680\nOkay.\n\n01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.680\nTake a taste of that.\n\n01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.680\nSee what you think?\n\n01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:29.680\nYou like that?\n\n01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680\nThat aftertaste.\n\n01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.680\nOh, god damn.\n\n01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.680\nCilantro.\n\n01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.680\nShit.\n\n01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680\nGod damn.\n\n01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680\nThe shit you get up to.\n\n01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.680\nMake Jack, Jack rabbit slap the bear, man.\n\n01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.680\nOh, so colloquial.\n\n01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.680\nHey, remember when you found me?\n\n01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.680\nYeah.\n\n01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.680\nYou, you were just a little blade.\n\n01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.680\nWho came up with blade?\n\n01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.680\nWas that you?\n\n01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.680\nI don't remember.\n\n01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.680\nKara, you told me everything needs a name.\n\n01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.680\nThat's how you put it.\n\n01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.680\nYeah, that's how you refer to things by their name.\n\n01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:14.680\nI didn't exactly get a lot of schooling.\n\n01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:22.680\nI relied on you for not only education, but also just a basic framework of thought.\n\n01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:28.680\nLike literally nobody told me how to speak or read or learn.\n\n01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:29.680\nNope.\n\n01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.680\nYou always told me everything needs a name.\n\n01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.680\nYep.\n\n01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.680\nYep.\n\n01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680\nThat's very true.\n\n01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:40.680\nI taught you well then, because name one thing that doesn't have one.\n\n01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.680\nYou can't do it.\n\n01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.680\nYou can't do it.\n\n01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:47.680\nYou can't name a single thing without one.\n\n01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.680\nAnd that's the first lesson.\n\n01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.680\nThat's why we named you blade.\n\n01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680\nAll right.\n\n01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.680\nAll right.\n\n01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680\nListen to me talking.\n\n01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680\nAll right.\n\n01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680\nInstead of eating this soup.\n\n01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680\nHere, try some of this bread I made.\n\n01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.680\nIt's full of wheat germ.\n\n01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.680\nGod damn.\n\n01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.680\nI'm too good for you.\n\n01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.680\nI'm afraid you agree.\n\n01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.680\nI wake up one day, see an open window with a curtain blowing in the breeze.\n\n01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.680\nAnd a little tear come down my cheek.\n\n01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.680\nYeah.\n\n01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680\nYeah.\n\n01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680\nWhy?\n\n01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680\nWhy?\n\n01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680\nWhy are you crying?\n\n01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680\nWhy would you cry?\n\n01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680\nDon't make me say it out loud.\n\n01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:21.680\nWell, the window, there's a drape on it.\n\n01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.680\nYou can close it.\n\n01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.680\nAre you crying because it's cold?\n\n01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.680\nAnd there's no window?\n\n01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.680\nBecause did the window break in the scenario?\n\n01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.680\nDid you break a window?\n\n01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.680\nAre you sad because you broke a window?\n\n01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.680\nOr because the drapes are open?\n\n01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.680\nWhat's good?\n\n01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:39.680\nWhoa.\n\n01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:40.680\nOkay.\n\n01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.680\nGive me that.\n\n01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.680\nGive me that.\n\n01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.680\nWhat?\n\n01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.680\nGive me that.\n\n01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.680\nTaking my soup.\n\n01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.680\nWhy are you crying?\n\n01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.680\nWhat?\n\n01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.680\nIn the thing.\n\n01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.680\nTake my soup.\n\n01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.680\nExplain yourself.\n\n01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.680\nI think this is a deflection.\n\n01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.680\nYou know what I mean.\n\n01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.680\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.680\nAfraid you'll leave me because I love you.\n\n01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.680\nLook at me like that.\n\n01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.680\nYou pulled it out of me.\n\n01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.680\nLike a fang.\n\n01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.680\nI was happy to leave it edgy and muscular.\n\n01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.680\nPlatonic.\n\n01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.680\nNo homo as the hip hop community says.\n\n01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680\nI don't approve of it.\n\n01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680\nFind that problematic.\n\n01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.680\nYou want to see the new Trident?\n\n01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.680\nYes.\n\n01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.680\nLook at that.\n\n01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:28.680\nThis Trident has four dents.\n\n01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.680\nThere's a hidden one.\n\n01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:39.680\nIt's a quadrant.\n\n01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.680\nNow, press the other button.\n\n01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:49.680\nYou can press your teeth.\n\n01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.680\nYou taught me how to do that.\n\n01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:59.680\nOnce a month you get a new battery.\n\n01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.680\nIt doesn't seem to be vibrating very hard.\n\n01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.680\nI thought that a vibrating toothbrush,\n\n01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.680\nI thought the whole point was for it to vibrate so hard\n\n01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.680\nit shakes all the dirt off your teeth.\n\n01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.680\nYour teeth are so clean it doesn't need to shake that hard.\n\n01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.680\nHow come it vibrates for two minutes and then stops\n\n01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.680\nand then starts again?\n\n01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.680\nYou're supposed to do the other side.\n\n01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:24.680\nOh, it's like a reminder.\n\n01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.680\nWhat a product.\n\n01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:34.680\nHere, why don't you put this lotion on my feet?\n\n01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.680\nWell, if you had to just give me a Trident,\n\n01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.680\nI wouldn't be doing this.\n\n01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.680\nYeah.\n\n01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.680\nThat kind of makes a fart noise.\n\n01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.680\nYou know what that sounds like.\n\n01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.680\nOkay, put those gross ass fucking gremlins up here.\n\n01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.680\nCome on, you old man.\n\n01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.680\nOkay.\n\n01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.680\nLook like goddamn Billy Bob from showbiz pizza place.\n\n01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.680\nHe fucking bare feet.\n\n01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.680\nStill so ticklish.\n\n01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.680\nAshy ass feet.\n\n01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:05.680\nLook like a goddamn...\n\n01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.680\nWell, they wouldn't be so ashy if you would put more cream on it.\n\n01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.680\nPut some more cream on it.\n\n01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.680\nWhat do you think I'm trying to do, you old man?\n\n01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.680\nPut some more cream on it.\n\n01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.680\nGod damn it, I love you.\n\n01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.680\nStop tickling so much.\n\n01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.680\nI'm not trying to tickle you.\n\n01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.680\nI'm trying to hydrate.\n\n01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.680\nGod damn ashy ass, dry ass, wooden stumps you call feet.\n\n01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.680\nYou old poop.\n\n01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:31.680\nYou want to watch it again?\n\n01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.680\nWatch?\n\n01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.680\nYes.\n\n01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.680\nI'll get the DVD player.\n\n01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.680\nOkay, great.\n\n01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.680\nI'm going to walk across the linoleum.\n\n01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680\nWhat?\n\n01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.680\nOh, no.\n\n01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:52.680\nWhistler!\n\n01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.680\nWhistler!\n\n01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.680\nHold on.\n\n01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.680\nWhat happened?\n\n01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.680\nMy feet are so hydrated, I slipped on the linoleum.\n\n01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.680\nGod damn it.\n\n01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.680\nWhy are we even walking over here?\n\n01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.680\nGet me the med kit.\n\n01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680\nShit.\n\n01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.680\nThere's one in the trident.\n\n01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.680\nI'll fly there.\n\n01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.680\nDid some flips.\n\n01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.680\nWhere are the band-aids in the stem?\n\n01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.680\nYeah, you unscrew it and then you put the band-aids on.\n\n01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.680\nOh, shit.\n\n01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.680\nShit everywhere.\n\n01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.680\nOh, shit, I'm going.\n\n01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680\nI'm going, Blade.\n\n01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.680\nWhat?\n\n01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:28.680\nI'm going.\n\n01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.680\nNo, this ain't how you go.\n\n01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.680\nI'm going.\n\n01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.680\nNo, I can't do this without you.\n\n01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.680\nNo, I'm slipping down the hallway because of the thing.\n\n01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.680\nLook, help me.\n\n01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:37.680\nI'm going.\n\n01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.680\nI'm going.\n\n01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.680\nOh, shit.\n\n01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.680\nThere's nothing I can do.\n\n01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:46.680\nIt's gone.\n\n01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:50.680\nThat's how I lost him.\n\n01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:55.680\nAnyways, that's how I lost him.\n\n01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.680\nThat's very, very interesting, Mr. Blade.\n\n01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.680\nAnd you're saying, I don't even have to fight vampires.\n\n01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.680\nOnly if you want to.\n\n01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.680\nJust feels wrong not to.\n\n01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.680\nThey killed my mom.\n\n01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.680\nWas it?\n\n01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.680\nI mean, if that's, if making, if fighting vampires makes you feel good, then that's what you should do.\n\n01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.680\nAs long as you're not hurting any non-vampire people.\n\n01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.680\nThat's hard.\n\n01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.680\nI'm a daywalker.\n\n01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.680\nI can be out during the day, but they can't.\n\n01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:36.680\nSo if I sleep during the day like they do,\n\n01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.680\nI'm just voluntarily being like one of them.\n\n01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.680\nBut if I sleep at night, that's when they do their thing.\n\n01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.680\nIt's like burning the candle at both ends.\n\n01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680\nYeah.\n\n01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680\nI'm skating uphill.\n\n01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.680\nYep.\n\n01:41:51.680 -->

Nobody wants to be...\n\n01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.680\nNobody wants to be referred to in the third person emotionally.\n\n01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:28.680\nI do.\n\n01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.680\nI

I thought he was steering.\n\n01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.680\nBut he might, he's five.\n\n01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.680\nHe might have been like, fuck, he thinks I'm steering.\n\n01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:44.680\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.680\nI was like, this isn't even bobsledding.\n\n01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.680\nWhat do you, do you even know what you're doing?\n\n01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:51.680\nDid you ever, did you go on Splash Mountain?\n\n01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:53.680\nNo.\n\n01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.680\nDo you know Splash Mountain?\n\n01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.680\nYeah, I've gone on it.\n\n01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.680\nDo you know why it's called Splash Mountain?\n\n01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.680\nBecause a lady died on it?\n\n01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.680\nNo.\n\n01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.680\nIt used to be a song of the south inspired ride.\n\n01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.680\nAnd then somebody went, oh my god, we can't do that anymore.\n\n01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:13.680\nYeah.\n\n01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.680\nAnd then Splash, Darrell Hanna, Tom Hanks Splash,\n\n01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.680\ncame out.\n\n01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.680\nShut up.\n\n01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:19.680\nThey called it Splash Mountain.\n\n01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:20.680\nShut up.\n\n01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.680\nSo if you go to Splash Mountain, I think there's like,\n\n01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.680\nthey've just played song of the south music.\n\n01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.680\nNo, there's, you know, the bears in there,\n\n01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.680\nthere's the rabbits and the briar patch and all that stuff.\n\n01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.680\nAnd Splash, but they call it Splash Mountain.\n\n01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680\nCome on.\n\n01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.680\nIt used to be called Racist Mountain.\n\n01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.680\nWhat was it called?\n\n01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.680\nLook it up.\n\n01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.680\nLook it up.\n\n01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:37.680\nWhat was it called before?\n\n01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.680\nYou should know what it's called if the story's true.\n\n01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:41.680\nNo, I don't because it's called Splash Mountain.\n\n01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.680\nIt was called Uncle Tom's, like with the teacup.\n\n01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.680\nIt was called something else.\n\n01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.680\nThe point of my story is that it's called Splash Mountain.\n\n01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:51.680\nThen why isn't there a mermaid anywhere in there?\n\n01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.680\nYou've got bad information.\n\n01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:54.680\nIt's not true.\n\n01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.680\nOkay.\n\n01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:57.680\nWell,

01:51:02.680\nRight.\n\n01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.680\nThat sounds authentic.\n\n01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:04.680\nRight.\n\n01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.680\nOkay.\n\n01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.680\nThat person's not improvising.\n\n01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:07.680\nNow it's called Splash Mountain.\n\n01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:08.680\nOkay.\n\n01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.680\nBut really is it, do you know this or are you Googling it?\n\n01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:12.680\nDo you know if it was named after the,\n\n01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:15.680\nif the Splash connection is true?\n\n01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.680\nOkay.\n\n01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:19.680\nI recognize the sound of Disney experts.\n\n01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.680\nYou don't, and you do not want to fuck with them.\n\n01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.680\nSo, okay.\n\n01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.680\nI retreat.\n\n01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.680\nAll right.\n\n01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.680\nFascinating.\n\n01:51:26.680 -->

Mysteries.\n\n01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680\nOh shit.\n\n01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:46.680\nWe forgot, Ryan Reynolds was our guest tonight.\n\n01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680\nShould we bring him out?\n\n01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.680\nI guess it's like two hours.\n\n01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680\nYeah.\n\n01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:50.680\nOkay.\n\n01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.680\nAll

time.\n\n01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:59.680\nSo we'll go to a dead pool for somewhere else.\n\n01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:04.680\nHe's the Merc with a mouth.\n\n01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:07.680\nDan likes him because they both break the fourth wall.\n\n01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.680\nYeah.\n\n01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.680\nWho else does?\n\n01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.680\nI do.\n\n01:52:12.680 -->

the mouth.\n\n01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.680\nYou know, like everyone shortens mercenary too.\n\n01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:26.680\nYeah.\n\n01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:27.680\nMerck.\n\n01:52:27.680 -->

stop.\n\n01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.680\nBut he doesn't have a mouth.\n\n01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.680\nHe has a mouth.\n\n01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.680\nBut his face is a mask.\n\n01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.680\nHis face is not a mask.\n\n01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:46.680\nHe wears a mask over his face.\n\n01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.680\nOver his mouth.\n\n01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.680\nRight.\n\n01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.680\nYeah, over the mouth that he absolutely has.\n\n01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.680\nYeah.\n\n01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:58.680\nI haven't seen this movie.\n\n01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.680\nHe hates Francis.\n\n01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.680\nYou haven't seen Deadpool?\n\n01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.680\nYou definitely haven't seen the

01:53:19.680\nHave fun being...\n\n01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:22.680\nEating fiber and watching The Mentalist.\n\n01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:25.680\nRob, what's his old ColecoVision

01:53:36.680\nCliff Hanger.\n\n01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.680\nI guess he doesn't really know how to do it.\n\n01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680\nYeah.\n\n01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:42.680\nOkay, good night,
