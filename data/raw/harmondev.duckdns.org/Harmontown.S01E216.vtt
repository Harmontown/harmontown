{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nWelcome one and all to Hollywood, California, Meltdown, Comic, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:28.000\nJust bring out the mayor of Harmontown. You know him. You love it, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:38.000\nThank you so much.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:42.000\nHe won the debates. He won. Come on.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:46.000\nHe's just so good. So facile.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:48.000\nHe's a people pleaser.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:50.000\nHe's a verbal wizard.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:56.000\nHe grabbed my attention like it was a pussy.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:06.000\nI was asking our guest tonight who works around sexuality a lot to confirm something that I felt.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:12.000\nIt's not on topic about that recording, but it also feels like...\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:18.000\nLook, guys do talk like that, but only when they're impotent.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:24.000\nThat's what I want. You don't talk like that when your dick works.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:30.000\nAnd for me to say that, it's like, oh, yeah, but that makes it worse because it's adding to this thing.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:34.000\nBut it's also important. I don't like the idea that that guy...\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:38.000\nYou don't say that to another guy.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nYou could do whatever you want.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nWhen you're a star, you could grab a pussy. That's the top of my list.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nYou wouldn't say that if your wiener worked.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nSean Connery never had to grab anybody by the pussy.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nOr tell another guy about it in a trailer.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nHow do we know you're a star? There's all this evidence here.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.000\nWhat a great meeting.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nBilly Bush and Donald Trump is.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:08.000\nThere's not a wet vagina and 100 miles from that.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nI thought it steeped things in dishonesty further for Billy Bush to be like,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:20.000\nboy, I was 11 years ago and all that stuff to just say what it really was, which is that he's laughing nervously\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nbecause he can't believe this is like, why is this guy saying this?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nI'm in a bus with Donald Trump and he's being a lunatic and it's hilarious.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:34.000\nIs he truly, like, ideologically, philosophically the answer is yes.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nIs he really supposed to in that moment?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nI have to stop you there, sir, and demand that you apologize to the women of America\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nthat may be listening to this one day.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nOr is he supposed to just go like...\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nNo!\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nI mean, the question is, was he going like...\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:56.000\nThe space work was off there.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nBilly Bush.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:06.000\nWhat I wonder is, because you've worn lots of mics, you've had a mic on.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nI do lots of live shows where there's a microphone on you\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nand I try to remember to mute myself if I ever have to go use the restroom\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.000\nor say something flagrantly sexist.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nBut they clearly didn't know that they were being recorded\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nbecause if they did, then they wouldn't have done it.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nBut I love the fact that there was an engineer who was like,\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:34.000\nI'm just going to fucking sit on this thing for 11 years.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nWayne Brady one time, I was shooting a terrible TV show before I was on Who's Line.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nBefore, he was on Who's Line called Quick Wits,\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nwhich is a very ill-fated show on NBC a long time ago.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nWayne Brady went to the bathroom.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nHis mic was hot and he went to go pee,\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nbut he was still live in the studio.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nAnd it was rehearsals. There was no audience there,\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nbut it was everybody else. It was all like Steve Carell was there.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nIt was like all these people before they became anybody.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:08.000\nAnd Wayne Brady was peeing and we could just hear Zip, Pee,\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:14.000\nand then Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dee,\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nhe's saying the whole fucking Zippity-Doo-Dah.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nAnd we were shitting ourselves.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nAnd he came back in and he didn't understand why everybody was so happy.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:30.000\nSo like the hot mic, give us and the hot mic, take us away.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:36.000\nTo this day, I swear if you run into an actor from community\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nand they start talking about Chevy J's,\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nthey instinctively start going like this.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nBecause it was like the third stage.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nIf you're talking about anything that could be potentially scandalous\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nat this internet age, it's like you're in your mic,\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nyou're hitting the mic.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nEvery time I'd set, people would go like,\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:00.000\noh yeah, and then this morning when he...\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nBut I swear, I've seen them like in parking lots,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nlike off the clock, like it's like, oh event,\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\noh hey Joel, how have you been?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nOh it's been years, yeah.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nI was like, oh did you hear about the thing?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nI was like, what are they doing?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nDo they have the papers?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nIs that an instant?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nAre they doing a bit or is that instinctive?\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nNo, I've watched it happen and then both of them realized\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nthey were doing it and then start laughing\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nand then I explained it to me because I'm not an actor\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nso I didn't know what was going on either.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nI was like, what the hell is it?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd then they explained it and I was like,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\noh my god, that's hilarious.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nBut it's also scandalous and...\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nThere, I think it works like that, you can just knock it out.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nI just want to...\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nHalloween's coming up and we'll have another show\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nor two before the actual event,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nbut right now is time to...\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nYou still have time to stop working on your\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nreally hacky basket of deplorables Halloween costume\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nor any other topical wordplay driven costume.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nJust get a vinyl cape and some teeth if you're that empty.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:09.000\nIt's not a holiday for word puzzles.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nWait, why do you...\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt's for fun.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nHave you heard of somebody who's making a basket\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:14.000\nof deplorables costume?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nNo, Cody predicted that.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nWe were talking about who are the...\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nWhat are the fucking costumes that are going to\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\njust make you want to hit people with a bottle?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nAnd it's just always the people that are like,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nlook who I am, I've talked about this before.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nI'm Picasso's blue period.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nYou have to put it all together.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nOh, so you are.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nYou never laugh out loud.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nAnd then it's like they want to live in a world\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nwhere Halloween is this parlor game\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nwhere everyone's running around\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:47.000\nand like, read my lips, no new taxes.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nAnd they're like a big lip and there's like a tax coming out\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nand they're like, yep.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:54.000\nI don't...\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nI just be a werewolf or something, man.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nCome on.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nThe only funny one I ever saw,\n\n06:58.000 --> 06:59.000\nI think I probably mentioned this one,\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nwe talked about this a long time ago,\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nwas my friend Melissa dressed up as Barbie\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nand she had a big shrimp on her head.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nShe was shrimp on the Barbie.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nIt was pretty good.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nI don't approve.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nThat's exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nI don't...\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nBut that one, you saw it\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nand you instantly knew what it was.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nYou didn't have to puzzle over it.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nOkay, maybe, okay.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nMaybe, I guess.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nI just don't want your costume to be a riddle.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nI don't want it to have a question and an answer.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nIt's like, you know, if you're going to do that,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\ngo as what you are, a vampire.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nBut Dan, you're just going as a different kind of vampire.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nEverybody, this is coming from a gentleman\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nwho once found an old computer monitor\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\non the side of the road, put it on his head,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\ndressed up in fur and put horns on the side\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nof the computer monitor and called himself monitor.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nYeah.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nBecause it was joyful and it was like...\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nWhat's the difference?\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nNo, because that's like a he-man figure.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nThat's like, look, I'm monitor.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nDo that, yeah.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nBe like, yeah.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:07.000\nHow is that different than shrimp on the Barbie?\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nBecause it couldn't beat he-man?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nLike, I'm saying like...\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nYou're being sexist now.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nNo, make a thing that has a name.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nBut you were doing the Minotaur, but you're a monitor.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nI'm saying it's a fine line.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou're walking there.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:31.000\nIt's a fine but solid line.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nIt's not blurry.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nIt's like, yeah, I guess it's razor thin,\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:38.000\nbut it's a line that still separates like joy from joylessness.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nDidn't you win...\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nDidn't you win a contest?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nYes, because they felt my relaxation and joy.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nLike, I was a big fat dude in a fur diaper\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nwith a computer monitor on his head.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nI'm monitor and I won because I was living the dream.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nI was cheating the system and they loved it.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nAnd, yeah.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nLike, I do Halloween right.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nI start with comfort.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nI back into an explanation.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nI go to the 99 cent store.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nI see some stuff.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nI tape it to my body.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nDo you remember the time that I didn't win the pumpkin carving contest\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nbecause there was a conspiracy against how good my pumpkin was?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:21.000\nYeah, I guess.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nCarved a dragon into a pumpkin.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nPeople got all bummed out about it.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nLike, yeah, you're not supposed to be good at it.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nYou're supposed to be scary faces.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nYeah.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nLike, we know who won.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nAll right.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:40.000\nSo, I was in Santa Monica for a wedding this weekend\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nand this is the craziest thing.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nWell, this is a first for me.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nI ran into my wedding planner on the beach.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nLike, I was just walking and I'm there for another wedding\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nand then I ran into...\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nI didn't know who she was at first.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nShe was like, Dan Harmon as I live and breathe.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nAnd I'm like, like, I don't know who that is.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt's like, but she's standing on Santa Monica beach\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nwith a clipboard and a pen.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:09.000\nSo, however I know her, something's happened since then\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nthat I don't want to ask questions about.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:17.000\nLike, getting signatures for a new shampoo or something.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nI don't think I ever knew anybody.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nSo, I was like, I don't know.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nI stepped a couple of steps and then I was like,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nwait, shit, she said she's out here working.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nWho works on a clipboard or the pen on the beach?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd then I was like, wait, wait, wait.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nOh, my God.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nIt's Christine.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nIt's my wedding planner.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nAnd then I was like, filled with this shame\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nbecause I was like, oh, I'm sorry.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nIt didn't work out.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nAnd she's like, I don't care.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nGet married again.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nShe gets paid by the hour.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nBy the wedding, at least, yeah.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nShe's got no back end on that.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nWhen I was like filled with this grief,\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nlike your wedding planner is really invested\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nin the institution of marriage.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nI planned the fuck out of that thing.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt was a good wedding.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nEverybody agrees it was a great wedding.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nThe marriage is up to me.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nIt's not her problem.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nAnd then she had been recently divorced, too.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nShe had been recently married.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nThat made it nice and relieving.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nShe's like, divorce is better.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nYeah, it is.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nIt's better than marriage.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nI mean, that's a good business model for a wedding planner.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nYou want everyone, you want that turnover.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nYeah, she may do that on purpose.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nMaybe when she's talking to clients,\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nshe's like, I just got married and it's great.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd then when she runs into her former clients,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nshe's like, I just got divorced.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nYou should get married again.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nI'm going to.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nThere's some vice thing,\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nthe special that I haven't watched yet,\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.000\nbut the director of Great Minds was telling me about it.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nThey used HIV to kill cancer.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:58.000\nThey like, you can modify HIV's protein structures\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nso that it's a little noodle that it uses\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nto plug into white blood cells,\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nonly plugs into cancer cells.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nAnd so they tried it on 20 kids with leukemia,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nand 18 of them are alive and cancer-free.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nI think I'm going to get some of this wrong.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nYou're going to watch it or look it up and like,\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\ngo ahead and correct me.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nSo you can give cancer aids?\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:19.000\nCan you imagine living in our lifetime\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nwhere we not only cure cancer,\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nbut we use aids?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd after you laugh at that,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nbecause it's like, oh yeah,\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nit's like when the Raptors fought the Super Saurus\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nor whatever, it's like,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nI could have just said Raptors\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\ntackle the T-Rex of the Jurassic Park,\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nbut I don't know if these kids have seen Jurassic Park 1.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nA lot of kids online\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\ndecrying Westworld further.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nThey're like, this Creighton guy,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nso you know you're talking to a millennial TV viewer\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nwhen they're like exposing Michael Creighton's\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nformulaic use of the,\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.000\noh, that old dinosaur park idea\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nrecycled for your new cowboy show, eh?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nFool me once, Mr. Creighton.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nOh, you fucking star, baby.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nYou fucking 25-year-old,\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:14.000\nimmortal little AI puke.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nIs it good?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nI've been out of town.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:17.000\nI haven't seen it.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nI loved it.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nI can't wait.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nIt's going to be on again tonight.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nWe'll see how the series plays out,\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nbut the pilot delivered everything that I said I wanted\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nbecause I was like,\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nthis should be a show about creepy scientists\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nliving underneath a fake deadwood\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nand because they deal with people\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nthat are just so much more than sex dolls,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:42.000\nso much more than target practice.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nThey're creating life down there,\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nbut they're also creating it for the exact purpose\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nof using it hedonistically.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nSo I want to see weird, polysexual,\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:56.000\nconfused psychological people in lab coats\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nhaving weird relationships with these nano-slabs\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nthat they then push up into this town\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:05.000\nand force to live on narrative loops,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:10.000\ninspired by what we've learned about that science\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nfrom video games and stuff,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nand the new depiction of Westworld\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\ninstead of just being like James Brolin being like,\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\ncome on, you can shoot him.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nJust go shoot him.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nIt's so much more realistic,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nthe depiction of what it's like to show up to Westworld\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nbecause we've played all these video games now\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nwhere we've had to create those environments\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nso that you walk down the street\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nand there's this guy going like,\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nwho will step up and fight this vomit?\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:36.000\nThey're talking and they have narrative loops.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nIs there a Yul Brynner bad guy in this one?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:44.000\nYes, but he's human.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd that just represents, everything's kind of inverted.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nSo it's a revisitation.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nWho's playing Richard Benjamin's eyebrows\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nin this particular show?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nAll right, you should just watch it.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nThe pilot is definitely worth watching.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's a mindblower.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:08.000\nAnd I hope the series can fill our Game of Thrones hole.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nWhatever.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nOkay, so I read.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nWhatever.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:16.000\nDan, tonight I'm going to fill your Game of Thrones hole.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nThat's my promise.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nLet's bring out our guest.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nI won't make the verbal segue from that to that,\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:28.000\nbut she is certainly,\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nI've called her the Michael Jordan of porn,\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nwhich is no...\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:37.000\nShe's been in 437 films so far.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:42.000\nRemember the modern porn world?\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nIt's beyond music in terms of how hard it would be\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nto be distinct and rack up.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nFor people to know your name,\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nbut I think a lot of people have heard the name Riley Reid,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nhaven't you?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nAll right.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nThree dudes audibly came just now.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nIn 2013, L.A. Weekly ranked her eighth on their list\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nof 10 porn stars who could be their next Jenna Jamison,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nwhich means nothing now,\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nbecause Jenna Jamison wasn't living in this crazy world\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:15.000\nwhere Ed porn is growing on trees and free to everybody.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nThat was back when Jurassic Park was in...\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nYes.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:24.000\nShe's her awards, her accolades of things.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nI mean, if there's anybody that represents like the...\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nShe's the most legit porn star I think we could have\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nto talk to about this stuff.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nShe's a wonderful gal\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nand made friends with her recently\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nbecause Justin noticed from her Instagram\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nthat she was a big Rick and Morty fan\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nbecause she was singing a song from Rick and Morty\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nI think pushing her butt up in the air.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nI can't remember.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nI was like...\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nI had been overraised in the posterior.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nIt's the song that the president does with Rick and Morty\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nand she was singing.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnyways, so he reached out to her and said,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nhey, I want to be friends.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nShe's been to the...\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nWe talked to her more on the...\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nDan, relax.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nTake a...\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nI'm excited.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nTake a deep breath.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nYou weren't this nervous\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nand Robin Williams is on the show.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:33.000\nPlease welcome Riley Reed.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nCan I get you a drink?\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nWould you like another vodka on the rocks?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nI'm still drinking my current one.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nBut thank you.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nMy gracious host.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:45.000\nSo Riley, is that true?\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nWere you singing a Rick and Morty song\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nduring one of your films?\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nIt wasn't during one of my films.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nIt was just a recording on my Instagram video\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nwhere I was like,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.000\nhead, bend over, raise the posterior.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nI'm definitely probably the number one Rick and Morty fan.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nNice.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nAlright, so...\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nI've got my limited edition jacket right here.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nOh, shit.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nYou got one of those.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nNumber 15.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nYeah, I got number two.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nWell, you should have...\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nNah, he does the voices.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nAnd I wouldn't have texted you\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nor whatever he did to reach out to you.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nI actually reached out to him.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nOh, really?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nYeah, I was like asking questions about Rick and Morty.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nOh, awesome.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nSo when I'm looking at my phone,\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nby the way, I'm not being aloof.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nI'm like, I have notes written down here.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nI think we should get one of the first things\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nout of the way, actually.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nWell, let's save it.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nLet's put a pin in the Prop 60 thing,\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nbecause if you were telling me backstage,\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nit's really important.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nYou're seeing these ads already tonight\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nduring the debates about this Prop 60 thing.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nYou...\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nIt's a fucking house of mirrors.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nI didn't even...\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nYou want to hear what she has to say\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nwhen you're voting that this thing has dropped on you\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nas a California voter, that you're informed.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:59.000\nBut, okay, here's a question you're probably sick of answering.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nBut it's like...\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nYou have a relationship.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nYou have a boyfriend.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nHow long have you been with your boyfriend?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nWe've been together over a year.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nBut even aside from that, that's not even related.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:16.000\nBut how is porn sex different from the sex you have off camera?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nIs there...\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nWell, it's a totally different one,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nbecause there's more people in the room\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nthan one-on-one sex.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nBut it's also the intimate connection,\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nbecause we're so in love and whatnot.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nSo that's a totally different realm\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nthan when I'm having sex with somebody on camera.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nIt's more of a grotesque,\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nlike, I'm just going to fuck you and then work with you again\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nmaybe a couple weeks later or something.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nWell, in terms of, yeah, if you're an objective viewer,\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nwhich...\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nIf you were a person floating in the corner of the room\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nthat was invisible and was watching you\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:00.000\nhave intimate, love-based sex...\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nWhat mechanical things are different?\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nYou're doing things for the cameras, I assume, right?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nYeah, I mean, you're definitely doing things for the camera.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nI have to be...\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:10.000\nI mean, for some pornos, they

28:28.000\nthere's no way to set the boundaries.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nYeah, they don't know.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nThey have an intimate knowledge of you\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nthat you don't have of them,\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nand people feel a weird\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nemotional connection\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nwith actors that don't show\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\neverything and do everything,\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nso you're getting a whole different order.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nThat's the thing, like podcasting itself.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nYou listen to somebody for two hours a week\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nevery week for a couple years.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nI'm not shocked at all when I run into people.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI'm very lucky with the people\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nthat listen to them,\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nbut it's definite.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nI have that relationship with people\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nthat I listen to on podcasts.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nI run into somebody that I listen to a lot,\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nand I'm like, I know this person.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nI own this person a little bit.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nI know who they are.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nLike you said, there's an advantage there.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nI guess that's the end of the conversation\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nbecause it's very uplifting news that you're like,\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nno, you've never filed a single restraining order.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nIt kind of says it all.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nUsually my fans are really neighborly.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nThey're like, Yo Riley rude.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nThey're super chill.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nThere also might be another...\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nI'm guessing that's probably wrong,\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nbut people have seen and know so much\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nabout you physically and intimately\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nthat there's really...\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nThey've already got the answer\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nto all those questions.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nYeah, that's something to be said for...\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nDo you have an opinion about that in general?\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nYou were a psychology major in college,\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nweren't you?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nI dropped out before the

freshman.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nYeah, I did it.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nBut you have an interest in this shit,\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nostensibly.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nDo you have an opinion about our relationship\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\non a national level\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nwith pornography?\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nWhat is going on there?\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nI think that just goes on\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\na personal intelligence level\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nwith somebody who's able\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:21.000\nto distinguish the difference that this is fantasy\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nand this is this person's job.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nWhen people choose to believe\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nthat the bang bus is real,\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nthey're allowing themselves\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nto be manipulated by society.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nWait, I'm going to stop you right there.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nI have to believe in something.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nThe fucking bang bus.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nBut collectively,\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\ndo you perceive our\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\ncountry, again, you can stop me and go,\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nthis isn't my jurisdiction,\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nbut we've got,\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nthere's debates going on right now\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nwhere there's a guy who's rampant,\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nverbal misogynist of nothing else\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nwho hears states,\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nhe's running against who will be\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nthe first female president,\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nissues coming

in general?\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nYou meet all these different people,\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nbut are we,\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nwhen you take us all collectively,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nare we sick, are we healthy,\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nare we, is there anything\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nthat could be said that needs to change in general,\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nor is it just fucking\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\ncomplicated? Well, I mean,\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nI know one thing is that we currently,\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nthe most popular taboo is\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nno longer incest, which was\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\ndefinitely a thing for a while where\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nthe most popular porn. I took a break\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nfrom it.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nMy search engine probably\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\ncontributed to that a lot.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nWhat is now\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nthe number one taboo? I don't know\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nwhat it is.

stuff,\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nbut you're coming up in 11 months\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000\non your, you'll go home\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nand you got training, you got the GI Bill,\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nAlex, you were\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nin the shit, albeit\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000\na nerd in the shit.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nYou were shooting the shit.\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nWhich is almost worse, probably.\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nYou're more isolated.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nDefinitely.\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nYou can't bro out with all the\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nmeat heads out there.\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nThose hurt locker guys have all the fun\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nwrestling\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\neach other because they have to have an intimate\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nrelationship with them.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nAlex, where were you stationed?\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nI was stationed at Fort Campbell\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nin Kentucky, the 101st\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nAirborne Division,\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nbut went to Iraq for a year\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nin East Baghdad,\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nand then Iraq,\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nAfghanistan for a year\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nin East Afghanistan.\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nSo when you're doing what you did out there,\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nwhere physically are you?\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nWhat's your home base?\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nIt's called the Forward Operating Base\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nor FAB, that's where we lived.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nIn Iraq it was the old\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nMinistry of Intelligence, I think.\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nSaddam Hussein's Ministry of Intelligence\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nthat we kind of just moved into.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nSo it was like big old cement buildings.\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nAnd then in Afghanistan\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nit was just kind of a camp that we set up\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nwith tents on gravel.\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nI'd go out on patrols and missions\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nand stuff like that with the guys to shoot videos.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nLee, what would it mean right now?\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nIf you got sent out\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nwhere we are\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nas the U.S. right now?\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nIf Trump invaded Mexico.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nIf a Marine got sent out to the desert\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nright now, are they still\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\ndeploying Marines out there?\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nYeah,\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nright now it's kind of a peace\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\ntime Marine Corps.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nThey're basically making moves like\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nwe do Meuse Marine\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nsomething fucking, it's an acronym.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nYou go on a boat\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nand you visit Asian countries\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nand you show your force around the world\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nand have some buddies\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nthat are in Lithuania\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nand shit just showing that we exist.\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000\nBut for the most part\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nwe're just doing peace time\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nbuilding hearts and minds\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nmissions and stuff like that.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nIf you're not anywhere right now\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nit would probably be a pretty\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nuneventful deployment.\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nSometimes you have to do photo ops\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nwhere you hand a blanket to a hurricane\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nserver.\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nI was the photographer that did those photo ops.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nAt your age, Lee,\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nlet's say you were deployed overseas\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nand you were an active Marine\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nanything could happen right now.\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nSome serious shit could go down.\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nYou could be\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nthrust right in there.\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nSo super recently\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000\ndeployment opportunity has come up\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nfor next year sometime.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nIt's a six month deployment\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nbut by the time it ends\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nI'll have supposed to have been out of the Marine Corps\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nfor one month. So I can do a six month extension\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nto go on the deployment\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nor not go and get out\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nearly. And it's like with my luck\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nI'll lose my legs\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nor something. Or I could\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000\ngo and do that and take the gamble.\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nSo like...\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nWhat's the upside\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nfor you? Like a bigger pension?\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nWell, it's\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\ntotal brainwashing too because\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nlike\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nI haven't been deployed or anything like that.\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nWe live in a, like me, everyday life\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nis around all these people who are like\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000\noh yeah, I was there for the initial push\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nin Fallujah or whatever.\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nSo I'm at a\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nlower status than them\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nbased off my experience in the military.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nSo like you have that just ingrained\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000\ninto you since day one that you want to\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\ngo out and do things and stuff like that\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nbut then you also get like, you don't pay\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000\ntaxes for the time that you're deployed.\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nYou get like combat pay. Yeah, but you can\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nyou can do that by losing a billion dollars.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nYou get that too. You don't even have to\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nbe in a tent.\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nSorry, I cut you off.\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:14:24.000 -->

that\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nbefore that and\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nyeah I'm ready to get out\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nand I think it adds to the story a little bit\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nthat our dad is a\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\ncareer military army officer\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nand so we spent our lives as kids\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nmoving around every two years around the world\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nand our parents are very\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nconservative\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nso we definitely grew up in that world\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nand\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nyou know had to figure out around\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nwhat do you think was he a hardcore dude\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nI used to\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nI don't know if you know what parade rest is\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nbut when my dad was angry at me\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nthat's how I stood in front of him\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nwhich is a military position of attention\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nwhat is that exactly\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nfeet\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nand for how long\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nhands behind your back\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nreally\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nand then I'd get beaten and then I'd go to bed\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nand then lesson learned\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nfucking oh\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nhahahaha\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nwell\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nhere's like\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nwhen I went to these shows and I met these officers\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nand I met these enlisted men and women\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nthey were like hey Jeff you should really\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nyou ever think about being an officer\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nI'm like no like I hate you\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nyou're too smart Jeff I hate being told what to do\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nyeah but all officers hate being told\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nwhat to do I was like yeah but I would be\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nin jail the whole time\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nbecause I don't like all these\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nfucking rules they're like yeah\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nall great generals say I'm like you're freaking me out\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nlike you're gonna have to fucking stop it\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nsomething I've never understood\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nmaybe you guys can clarify this\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nif you're nerds and you're in the military\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nand you've experienced this like\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nam I mistaken in assuming that\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nno matter who's been president\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nthrough the span of our country's history\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nthere's never been like a dramatic\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nlike\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nI know that Republicans are better at\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nstarting\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nentire wars\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nbetter for the military\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nbut I don't think you guys think like that\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nwhen you're in that line of work I don't think you're like\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nlike firemen don't go oh this guy's pro fire\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nlike I want him to be my\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\ncandidate like like you're firemen\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nyour job is to put out wars\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nand in other words\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nlike it's not like it's like a jackpot\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nlike\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nis your average marine\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nor your average army soldier\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nare they gung-ho and they want to kill mother fuckers\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nthey want war\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nthey are going to vote for whoever is most\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nlikely to start the next war\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nbut it's because of their ideology right it's not because of anything practical\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nwhere it's like Hillary Clinton\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nas far as I know\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\njust like Obama before her, Bill Clinton\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nthese aren't people\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nwho reduce the amount of fucking up people\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nwe do are they\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nthe defense budget stays\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nthe same and increases at the rate\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nthat it increases correct\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nI think the only president that hasn't declared war was like Carter\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nevery Democrat\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nexcept for him maybe has\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nit's almost like the president doesn't\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nmatter at all except\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nwhen he's a fucking lunatic\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nthat like can actually\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nI don't think we would have invaded\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nIraq if Al Gore had been president\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nthat's like the classic example\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nyou can't just picture that happening\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nwe'd always try to increase this if Al Gore was president\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nthat'd be great\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nbut you\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nspent your military career and got your GI Bill\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nyou've been at Camp Pendleton\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nyou haven't been stationed in a country that we're occupying\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nor fighting\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nour defense budget continues to just\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nit's more important than education\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nthat shit better fucking pay for my college\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nor I'm gonna be finished\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nbut we have bad news for you\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nwhile you've been gone we've made your college education worthless\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nenjoy it\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nenjoy your degree\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nand fucking whatever\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nbecause we haven't\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nvalued education as much as we have defense\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nand for that reason it just\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nit kind of confuses me when I see\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nvideo footage of like\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nrooms full of hard working men\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nand women that are salt of the earth that grew up in lower middle class\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nneighborhoods\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nand who volunteered for military\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nservice who are like so invested\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nin who becomes commander in chief of our military\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nand it's like you don't think\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nObama is gonna be a boon\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nto your industry\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nI was in Afghanistan when Obama was\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000\ninaugurated and it was like a funeral out there\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000\neveryone was because they think he's gonna\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nwhat you know like pull back\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nfrom all muslim countries I'm a secret muslim\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nand I hate blowing brown people\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000\neven if he did\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000\npull everybody back he'd assign you to the attorney general's office\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nso you could go raid dispensaries\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nthere's always work for a\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nhypocritical politician to assign\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000\npeople who know how to kill people\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nwhat was the mood on base\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000\neveryone was just\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000\ndisappointed distraught like just thought it was\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nthe worst thing that could happen to our country\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nthat he didn't really love America\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nsaying Obama that's one letter away from\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nOsama like and really meaning it\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nhis middle name is Saddam\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nwho's saying not today\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nsame shit\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nwe don't want to think that about our military\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nI want to think of them and police as like\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\npeople who are so close to the action\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nthat they know the nuts and bolts that there would be\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\na culture shock and a conversation with them\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nand the politics would be different but it would be because\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nof real things\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nit wouldn't be because of\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nhypnotism\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nfor somebody who actually has to be the one\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nwhose hand is on the lever\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nfinger on the trigger\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nI would expect them\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nI would grant them the right to be\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nso hardcore right wing\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nbecause of their real basic\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nlike fundamental philosophy\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nand the risks that they take and stuff\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nbut it's disappointing to hear that it's more like\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nas in the trailer park so in the military\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nthey watch Fox News\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nin the\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nwhere you eat\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nit's almost like that makes the job separate\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nfrom the ideology that it's like\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nwell the job is to have to deal with the\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nrepercussions of how we think\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nbut we don't\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nthey're just thinking the same shit\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nyou have to think that way to\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nbe happy doing that right\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nI'm trying to bounce that because\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nI don't get it like I feel like\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nwhen I'm a soldier and Obama gets elected I'm like\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nthat dude's gonna blow up shit like nobody's business\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nhe's a democrat\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nI think you just barely touched on it\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nmaybe but like the whole calling\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nKaepernick kneeling for the flag\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nnational anthem and shit like that\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\npeople are like he hates the troops\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nbut it's\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nmore like why does\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\ndisagreeing with\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000\ncertain things in America\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nhas a trend for standing for\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nmean that you don't appreciate the people\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nthat go\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nand fight for the things that you do happen to stand for\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nexactly\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nit doesn't\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nyou know what I'm
