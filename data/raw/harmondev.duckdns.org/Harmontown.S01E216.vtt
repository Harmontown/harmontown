00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Welcome one and all to Hollywood, California, Meltdown, Comic, Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:28.000
Just bring out the mayor of Harmontown. You know him. You love it, Dan Harmon.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
Thank you so much.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
He won the debates. He won. Come on.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
He's just so good. So facile.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
He's a people pleaser.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
He's a verbal wizard.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
He grabbed my attention like it was a pussy.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
I was asking our guest tonight who works around sexuality a lot to confirm something that I felt.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
It's not on topic about that recording, but it also feels like...

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Look, guys do talk like that, but only when they're impotent.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
That's what I want. You don't talk like that when your dick works.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
And for me to say that, it's like, oh, yeah, but that makes it worse because it's adding to this thing.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
But it's also important. I don't like the idea that that guy...

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
You don't say that to another guy.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
You could do whatever you want.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
When you're a star, you could grab a pussy. That's the top of my list.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
You wouldn't say that if your wiener worked.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Sean Connery never had to grab anybody by the pussy.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Or tell another guy about it in a trailer.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
How do we know you're a star? There's all this evidence here.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
What a great meeting.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Billy Bush and Donald Trump is.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
There's not a wet vagina and 100 miles from that.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I thought it steeped things in dishonesty further for Billy Bush to be like,

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
boy, I was 11 years ago and all that stuff to just say what it really was, which is that he's laughing nervously

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
because he can't believe this is like, why is this guy saying this?

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm in a bus with Donald Trump and he's being a lunatic and it's hilarious.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Is he truly, like, ideologically, philosophically the answer is yes.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Is he really supposed to in that moment?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I have to stop you there, sir, and demand that you apologize to the women of America

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
that may be listening to this one day.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Or is he supposed to just go like...

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
No!

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
I mean, the question is, was he going like...

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
The space work was off there.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Billy Bush.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
What I wonder is, because you've worn lots of mics, you've had a mic on.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I do lots of live shows where there's a microphone on you

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
and I try to remember to mute myself if I ever have to go use the restroom

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
or say something flagrantly sexist.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
But they clearly didn't know that they were being recorded

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
because if they did, then they wouldn't have done it.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But I love the fact that there was an engineer who was like,

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm just going to fucking sit on this thing for 11 years.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Wayne Brady one time, I was shooting a terrible TV show before I was on Who's Line.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Before, he was on Who's Line called Quick Wits,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
which is a very ill-fated show on NBC a long time ago.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Wayne Brady went to the bathroom.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
His mic was hot and he went to go pee,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
but he was still live in the studio.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And it was rehearsals. There was no audience there,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
but it was everybody else. It was all like Steve Carell was there.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
It was like all these people before they became anybody.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
And Wayne Brady was peeing and we could just hear Zip, Pee,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
and then Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dee,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
he's saying the whole fucking Zippity-Doo-Dah.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And we were shitting ourselves.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
And he came back in and he didn't understand why everybody was so happy.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
So like the hot mic, give us and the hot mic, take us away.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
To this day, I swear if you run into an actor from community

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
and they start talking about Chevy J's,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
they instinctively start going like this.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Because it was like the third stage.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
If you're talking about anything that could be potentially scandalous

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
at this internet age, it's like you're in your mic,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
you're hitting the mic.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Every time I'd set, people would go like,

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
oh yeah, and then this morning when he...

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
But I swear, I've seen them like in parking lots,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
like off the clock, like it's like, oh event,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
oh hey Joel, how have you been?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh it's been years, yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I was like, oh did you hear about the thing?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I was like, what are they doing?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Do they have the papers?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Is that an instant?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Are they doing a bit or is that instinctive?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
No, I've watched it happen and then both of them realized

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
they were doing it and then start laughing

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
and then I explained it to me because I'm not an actor

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
so I didn't know what was going on either.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I was like, what the hell is it?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
And then they explained it and I was like,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
oh my god, that's hilarious.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
But it's also scandalous and...

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
There, I think it works like that, you can just knock it out.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I just want to...

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Halloween's coming up and we'll have another show

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
or two before the actual event,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
but right now is time to...

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
You still have time to stop working on your

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
really hacky basket of deplorables Halloween costume

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
or any other topical wordplay driven costume.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Just get a vinyl cape and some teeth if you're that empty.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
It's not a holiday for word puzzles.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Wait, why do you...

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It's for fun.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Have you heard of somebody who's making a basket

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
of deplorables costume?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
No, Cody predicted that.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
We were talking about who are the...

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
What are the fucking costumes that are going to

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
just make you want to hit people with a bottle?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And it's just always the people that are like,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
look who I am, I've talked about this before.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I'm Picasso's blue period.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
You have to put it all together.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh, so you are.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You never laugh out loud.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And then it's like they want to live in a world

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
where Halloween is this parlor game

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
where everyone's running around

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
and like, read my lips, no new taxes.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
And they're like a big lip and there's like a tax coming out

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
and they're like, yep.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I don't...

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I just be a werewolf or something, man.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Come on.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
The only funny one I ever saw,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I think I probably mentioned this one,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
we talked about this a long time ago,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
was my friend Melissa dressed up as Barbie

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
and she had a big shrimp on her head.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
She was shrimp on the Barbie.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It was pretty good.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't approve.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
But that one, you saw it

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
and you instantly knew what it was.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
You didn't have to puzzle over it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay, maybe, okay.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Maybe, I guess.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I just don't want your costume to be a riddle.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I don't want it to have a question and an answer.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
It's like, you know, if you're going to do that,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
go as what you are, a vampire.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
But Dan, you're just going as a different kind of vampire.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Everybody, this is coming from a gentleman

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
who once found an old computer monitor

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
on the side of the road, put it on his head,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
dressed up in fur and put horns on the side

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
of the computer monitor and called himself monitor.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Because it was joyful and it was like...

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
What's the difference?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
No, because that's like a he-man figure.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
That's like, look, I'm monitor.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Do that, yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Be like, yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
How is that different than shrimp on the Barbie?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Because it couldn't beat he-man?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Like, I'm saying like...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You're being sexist now.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
No, make a thing that has a name.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
But you were doing the Minotaur, but you're a monitor.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm saying it's a fine line.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You're walking there.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
It's a fine but solid line.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
It's not blurry.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
It's like, yeah, I guess it's razor thin,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
but it's a line that still separates like joy from joylessness.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Didn't you win...

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Didn't you win a contest?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes, because they felt my relaxation and joy.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Like, I was a big fat dude in a fur diaper

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
with a computer monitor on his head.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I'm monitor and I won because I was living the dream.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I was cheating the system and they loved it.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And, yeah.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Like, I do Halloween right.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
I start with comfort.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I back into an explanation.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I go to the 99 cent store.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I see some stuff.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I tape it to my body.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Do you remember the time that I didn't win the pumpkin carving contest

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
because there was a conspiracy against how good my pumpkin was?

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah, I guess.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Carved a dragon into a pumpkin.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
People got all bummed out about it.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Like, yeah, you're not supposed to be good at it.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
You're supposed to be scary faces.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Like, we know who won.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
All right.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
So, I was in Santa Monica for a wedding this weekend

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
and this is the craziest thing.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Well, this is a first for me.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I ran into my wedding planner on the beach.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Like, I was just walking and I'm there for another wedding

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
and then I ran into...

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I didn't know who she was at first.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
She was like, Dan Harmon as I live and breathe.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
And I'm like, like, I don't know who that is.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
It's like, but she's standing on Santa Monica beach

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
with a clipboard and a pen.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
So, however I know her, something's happened since then

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
that I don't want to ask questions about.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Like, getting signatures for a new shampoo or something.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I don't think I ever knew anybody.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So, I was like, I don't know.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I stepped a couple of steps and then I was like,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
wait, shit, she said she's out here working.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Who works on a clipboard or the pen on the beach?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
And then I was like, wait, wait, wait.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh, my God.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It's Christine.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
It's my wedding planner.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
And then I was like, filled with this shame

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
because I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
It didn't work out.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And she's like, I don't care.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Get married again.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
She gets paid by the hour.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
By the wedding, at least, yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
She's got no back end on that.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
When I was like filled with this grief,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
like your wedding planner is really invested

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
in the institution of marriage.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
I planned the fuck out of that thing.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
It was a good wedding.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Everybody agrees it was a great wedding.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
The marriage is up to me.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's not her problem.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then she had been recently divorced, too.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
She had been recently married.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
That made it nice and relieving.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
She's like, divorce is better.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, it is.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
It's better than marriage.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I mean, that's a good business model for a wedding planner.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
You want everyone, you want that turnover.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah, she may do that on purpose.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Maybe when she's talking to clients,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
she's like, I just got married and it's great.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And then when she runs into her former clients,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
she's like, I just got divorced.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You should get married again.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm going to.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
There's some vice thing,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
the special that I haven't watched yet,

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
but the director of Great Minds was telling me about it.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
They used HIV to kill cancer.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
They like, you can modify HIV's protein structures

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
so that it's a little noodle that it uses

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
to plug into white blood cells,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
only plugs into cancer cells.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
And so they tried it on 20 kids with leukemia,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and 18 of them are alive and cancer-free.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I think I'm going to get some of this wrong.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You're going to watch it or look it up and like,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
go ahead and correct me.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
So you can give cancer aids?

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Can you imagine living in our lifetime

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
where we not only cure cancer,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
but we use aids?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
And after you laugh at that,

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
because it's like, oh yeah,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
it's like when the Raptors fought the Super Saurus

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
or whatever, it's like,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I could have just said Raptors

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
tackle the T-Rex of the Jurassic Park,

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
but I don't know if these kids have seen Jurassic Park 1.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
A lot of kids online

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
decrying Westworld further.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
They're like, this Creighton guy,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
so you know you're talking to a millennial TV viewer

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
when they're like exposing Michael Creighton's

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
formulaic use of the,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
oh, that old dinosaur park idea

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
recycled for your new cowboy show, eh?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Fool me once, Mr. Creighton.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh, you fucking star, baby.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
You fucking 25-year-old,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
immortal little AI puke.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Is it good?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I've been out of town.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I haven't seen it.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I loved it.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I can't wait.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
It's going to be on again tonight.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
We'll see how the series plays out,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
but the pilot delivered everything that I said I wanted

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
because I was like,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
this should be a show about creepy scientists

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
living underneath a fake deadwood

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
and because they deal with people

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
that are just so much more than sex dolls,

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
so much more than target practice.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
They're creating life down there,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
but they're also creating it for the exact purpose

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
of using it hedonistically.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
So I want to see weird, polysexual,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
confused psychological people in lab coats

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
having weird relationships with these nano-slabs

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
that they then push up into this town

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
and force to live on narrative loops,

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
inspired by what we've learned about that science

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
from video games and stuff,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and the new depiction of Westworld

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
instead of just being like James Brolin being like,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
come on, you can shoot him.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Just go shoot him.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
It's so much more realistic,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
the depiction of what it's like to show up to Westworld

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
because we've played all these video games now

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
where we've had to create those environments

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
so that you walk down the street

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
and there's this guy going like,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
who will step up and fight this vomit?

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
They're talking and they have narrative loops.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Is there a Yul Brynner bad guy in this one?

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
Yes, but he's human.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
And that just represents, everything's kind of inverted.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
So it's a revisitation.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Who's playing Richard Benjamin's eyebrows

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
in this particular show?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
All right, you should just watch it.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
The pilot is definitely worth watching.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It's a mindblower.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
And I hope the series can fill our Game of Thrones hole.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Whatever.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Okay, so I read.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Whatever.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Dan, tonight I'm going to fill your Game of Thrones hole.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
That's my promise.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Let's bring out our guest.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I won't make the verbal segue from that to that,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
but she is certainly,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I've called her the Michael Jordan of porn,

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
which is no...

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
She's been in 437 films so far.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Remember the modern porn world?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
It's beyond music in terms of how hard it would be

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
to be distinct and rack up.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
For people to know your name,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
but I think a lot of people have heard the name Riley Reid,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
haven't you?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
All right.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Three dudes audibly came just now.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
In 2013, L.A. Weekly ranked her eighth on their list

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
of 10 porn stars who could be their next Jenna Jamison,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
which means nothing now,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
because Jenna Jamison wasn't living in this crazy world

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
where Ed porn is growing on trees and free to everybody.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
That was back when Jurassic Park was in...

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Yes.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I mean, yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
She's her awards, her accolades of things.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
I mean, if there's anybody that represents like the...

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
She's the most legit porn star I think we could have

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
to talk to about this stuff.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
She's a wonderful gal

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and made friends with her recently

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
because Justin noticed from her Instagram

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
that she was a big Rick and Morty fan

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
because she was singing a song from Rick and Morty

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
I think pushing her butt up in the air.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I can't remember.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I was like...

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I had been overraised in the posterior.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
It's the song that the president does with Rick and Morty

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
and she was singing.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Anyways, so he reached out to her and said,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
hey, I want to be friends.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
She's been to the...

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
We talked to her more on the...

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Dan, relax.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Take a...

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm excited.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Take a deep breath.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
You weren't this nervous

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
and Robin Williams is on the show.

17:15.000 --> 17:33.000
Please welcome Riley Reed.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Can I get you a drink?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Would you like another vodka on the rocks?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm still drinking my current one.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
But thank you.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
My gracious host.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
So Riley, is that true?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Were you singing a Rick and Morty song

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
during one of your films?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It wasn't during one of my films.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
It was just a recording on my Instagram video

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
where I was like,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
head, bend over, raise the posterior.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm definitely probably the number one Rick and Morty fan.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Nice.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Alright, so...

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I've got my limited edition jacket right here.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Oh, shit.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
You got one of those.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Number 15.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Yeah, I got number two.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, you should have...

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Nah, he does the voices.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And I wouldn't have texted you

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
or whatever he did to reach out to you.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I actually reached out to him.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh, really?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, I was like asking questions about Rick and Morty.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Oh, awesome.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
So when I'm looking at my phone,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
by the way, I'm not being aloof.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm like, I have notes written down here.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I think we should get one of the first things

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
out of the way, actually.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, let's save it.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Let's put a pin in the Prop 60 thing,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
because if you were telling me backstage,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
it's really important.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
You're seeing these ads already tonight

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
during the debates about this Prop 60 thing.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You...

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It's a fucking house of mirrors.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I didn't even...

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You want to hear what she has to say

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
when you're voting that this thing has dropped on you

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
as a California voter, that you're informed.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
But, okay, here's a question you're probably sick of answering.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
But it's like...

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
You have a relationship.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
You have a boyfriend.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
How long have you been with your boyfriend?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
We've been together over a year.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
But even aside from that, that's not even related.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
But how is porn sex different from the sex you have off camera?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Is there...

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Well, it's a totally different one,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
because there's more people in the room

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
than one-on-one sex.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
But it's also the intimate connection,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
because we're so in love and whatnot.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
So that's a totally different realm

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
than when I'm having sex with somebody on camera.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
It's more of a grotesque,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
like, I'm just going to fuck you and then work with you again

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
maybe a couple weeks later or something.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Well, in terms of, yeah, if you're an objective viewer,

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
which...

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
If you were a person floating in the corner of the room

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
that was invisible and was watching you

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
have intimate, love-based sex...

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
What mechanical things are different?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
You're doing things for the cameras, I assume, right?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, I mean, you're definitely doing things for the camera.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I have to be...

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
I mean, for some pornos, they are, like, you know,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
romance scene where they don't even want us

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
to acknowledge the existence of a camera

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and they don't care about opening up.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
But usually I have to, like, hold my ass cheek

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
to make sure you can see the penetration.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
You know, it's not as...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Usually when I'm, like, fucking,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I like to ride my boyfriend's dick

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
and, like, have my clit rubbing against him,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
as well as the penetration.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
In regular pranks, sex...

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Riley, I expected more candor out of you.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Don't let this face deceive you.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Stop deflecting from the quest.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
We're trying to get to the truth here.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I was just saying, it's...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You have a favorite position.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
It's just being... having to open up for the camera,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
like, no matter what position, from doggy or this or that,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
even, like, you just have to, like,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I have to hold my ass cheek open, you know?

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Would you ever imagine in porn, like, in a scene,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
you're required to hit, like, in an average porn scene,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
you have to hit, like, all these, like,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Kamasutra, like...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh, yeah, I mean, we have four positions minimum,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
kind of a thing.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
You always have to have four positions.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
There's always blowjob in between.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So, like, that's, like, you know,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
the usual mandatory kind of a thing.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And then there's the, you know, the scenario

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
that goes along with the porn,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
or that usually they want you to keep alive

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
because otherwise it becomes very illegal

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
if you don't keep alive the...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Well, no, no, no, I mean, like, you know,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
if I'm the pizza delivery girl,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
they want me to talk about...

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
My boss might call me, I should go back to work, you know?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Like, they want us to keep that essence alive.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It's not... I'm not really, you know...

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I mean, sometimes we'll foreplay at home,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
but it's not the whole stereotype.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I mean, we definitely lost the narrative

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
when we lost film.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Like, you've seen Boogie Nights, I assume,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
and they get with you.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
That's that transition from film to video

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
where that foreshadows the transition

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
from to the internet world

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
where porn is just now...

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's like, is Gonzo the right word?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
But it's just, like, it's just, like,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
it's not narrative at all.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Or does Gonzo mean, like,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
brutally disgusting?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
No, no, no. Gonzo means, like, it's just, like,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
hey, we're fucking.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Hey, what's your name? Samantha. How old are you?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay, here's a dick.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah, you're 18, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Right.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
So, the...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Just to go back to that one loop,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
because I'm just curious...

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You're hitting those four bases,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
for instance, when you're doing a scene for work,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
when you're being intimate

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
with someone that you love,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
you said you mentioned you have this favorite position.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Might that mean that it's like,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
you guys don't hit all...

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
There's not, like, a bunch of...

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
No, no, I mean, occasionally sometimes...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
You might just do a very boring, like,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
let's just do this, because this is what I like.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Well, yeah, I mean, sometimes we wake up in the morning

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and we just have, like, regular morning sex.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Other times, you know, we're, like, in the kitchen

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
and we're fucking everywhere in the kitchen, you know?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So it's, like, it's definitely in the heat of the...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
But a plumber never comes in and goes,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
what's going on here?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Not anymore.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
We change neighborhoods and sinks.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
What is the difference, Riley,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
between the porn director and a bad one?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I hate when the porn directors

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
try to micromanage the sex.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So there are...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Sometimes I'm on a sex scene and they're, like,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
okay, now, like, run your hand down his chest

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and then put your fingers in his pants.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
That's, like, a line reading for a regular actor.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
There's times... Don't tell me how to talk.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Yeah, no, there's literally times where I've been on set

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and it's really sad that there's literally

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
a woman sitting there telling me what to do.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm, like, how do they even edit your voice out?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Like, I don't understand.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Like, literally the whole time, she is, like,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
okay, now brush her hair behind her ear.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Aw.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Like, it's... I mean, yes, it's sweet,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
but at the same time,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
it's just, like, I don't understand

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
why her presence is here.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Wait, who was she? Was she a director?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
She was a director. Like, this was actually

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
for Penthouse and I was, like,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
so disappointed. I was, like,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
micromanaged sex. Like, you're going to tell me

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
how to squeeze in, like, his balls.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Like, you can't just go and do it.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Like, girl, that's good to know.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Like, no, that's interesting.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Like, the...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
In terms of just the...

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
We were talking, and I think we can segue

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
then into the Prop 60 thing, because, um,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
like, well, first of all,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
like, is there...

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Do you perceive a wall

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
between yourself because you work in porn

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and, like, civilians,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
like, anybody outside that industry?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Like, do you think that you're,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
like, do you feel

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
alienated, isolated?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Do you...

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
If you go to

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
a party and someone

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
says, what do you do? Is there, like,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I mean, do you... No, I'm, like, I'm personally

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
very comfortable with what I do.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Like, I'll sit next to a plane.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I'll sit on a plane next to somebody if they ask me what I do.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I'm just blunt and I tell them,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
like, I'm a porn star, adult actress,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and usually they're, like,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
oh, like...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And then sometimes when I say adult actress,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
like, were you a child star kind of thing?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Like, people are very

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
confused sometimes.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And I've also happened...

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That happened where a lady was, like,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
writing a book on sex workers.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
So she was like, oh, my God, like,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
can I ask you a million questions?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
But I'm very comfortable personally,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
so I don't usually have any, like,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
weird issues with that, but

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I do get recognized a lot.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I do have a lot of people, like, know...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
You're extremely recognizable.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
And that's the other part of the question.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It's like, how safe do you feel?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Because I...

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Podcasting, like...

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
It's not really safe.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Sometimes I feel like it's not fair,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
because they have an advantage

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
where I can't give the first impression

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
of myself.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
They already have the impression of who I am.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
So it's, like, an unfair advantage,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
because, like, I have no idea who you are,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
but you guys have seen my asshole.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You know, like...

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Not fair, but it's also

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
very interesting and interesting.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
We have a special gift for you.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
We're going to make everybody here show you their asshole.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Yes! Please!

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I hope you too, man.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
We have to have a custodian of records

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
go through first and collect

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
pretty certificates.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I should tell you something about the chocolates

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I handed out before the show.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
They're filled with Tapehead Cleaner.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Do you know about that thing, or are you too young?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Tapehead Cleaner?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Amyl Nitrate?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Amyl Nitrate.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Oh, I've heard of Popper.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
VHS Tapehead Cleaner.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
If you huff it, it makes your butthole

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
get nice and ready for...

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
It relaxes you, or something.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It also gets you high,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
but also it relaxes your butthole.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Yes, yes.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I've definitely heard of those.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I would think those stocking

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
is what I'm talking about.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
We have a twisted relationship

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
with sex in the sex industry

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
in this country.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
We have a twisted relationship with fame.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
We have a twisted relationship with media, fantasy.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
We don't have our...

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I don't know...

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I'm not saying there's some other country

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
where they've achieved it,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
but I'm just saying...

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
If you told me that you

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
get frightened for your life

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
seven times a day, I wouldn't be shocked.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
But I don't...

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah, no, I don't.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Fans think they know you, fans like...

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I mean, definitely.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Some fans really think they know me.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I've never had a stalker.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I've never had to put a restraining order on somebody.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, luckily.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Have you ever met Donald Trump?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Thank God, no.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
You might get the actual amount

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
of negative or unwanted attention

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
that anybody would get

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
like being a good looking woman.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
You just get that anyway, right?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Well, then you compound that with...

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I get a lot of emails.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I'll get some crazy emails from some fans

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
who will start off the email talking

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
about how much they love me,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and then it's like, and I hate you so much,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and then I also love you,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and I hope I never talk to you again,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and then they'll email me two days later.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Again, Riley, I told you

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I was sorry about this.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
There's probably a lot of confusion there

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
because there's no culture,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
there's no way to set the boundaries.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Yeah, they don't know.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
They have an intimate knowledge of you

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
that you don't have of them,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
and people feel a weird

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
emotional connection

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
with actors that don't show

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
everything and do everything,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
so you're getting a whole different order.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
That's the thing, like podcasting itself.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
You listen to somebody for two hours a week

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
every week for a couple years.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I'm not shocked at all when I run into people.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm very lucky with the people

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
that listen to them,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
but it's definite.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I have that relationship with people

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
that I listen to on podcasts.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I run into somebody that I listen to a lot,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and I'm like, I know this person.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I own this person a little bit.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I know who they are.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Like you said, there's an advantage there.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I guess that's the end of the conversation

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
because it's very uplifting news that you're like,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
no, you've never filed a single restraining order.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It kind of says it all.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Usually my fans are really neighborly.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
They're like, Yo Riley rude.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They're super chill.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
There also might be another...

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm guessing that's probably wrong,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
but people have seen and know so much

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
about you physically and intimately

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
that there's really...

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
They've already got the answer

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
to all those questions.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah, that's something to be said for...

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Do you have an opinion about that in general?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
You were a psychology major in college,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
weren't you?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I dropped out before the end

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
of my freshman year.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I was going to be a psych minor,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
but that means nothing when you're a freshman.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Yeah, I did it.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
But you have an interest in this shit,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
ostensibly.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Do you have an opinion about our relationship

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
on a national level

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
with pornography?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
What is going on there?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I think that just goes on

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
a personal intelligence level

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
with somebody who's able

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
to distinguish the difference that this is fantasy

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and this is this person's job.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
When people choose to believe

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
that the bang bus is real,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
they're allowing themselves

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
to be manipulated by society.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Wait, I'm going to stop you right there.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I have to believe in something.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
The fucking bang bus.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
But collectively,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
do you perceive our

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
country, again, you can stop me and go,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
this isn't my jurisdiction,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
but we've got,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
there's debates going on right now

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
where there's a guy who's rampant,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
verbal misogynist of nothing else

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
who hears states,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
he's running against who will be

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
the first female president,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
issues coming up.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
As a woman and as a pornographic

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
actor,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
how do you see this country's

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
relationship in general?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
You meet all these different people,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
but are we,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
when you take us all collectively,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
are we sick, are we healthy,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
are we, is there anything

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
that could be said that needs to change in general,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
or is it just fucking

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
complicated? Well, I mean,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I know one thing is that we currently,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
the most popular taboo is

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
no longer incest, which was

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
definitely a thing for a while where

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
the most popular porn. I took a break

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
from it.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
My search engine probably

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
contributed to that a lot.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
What is now

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
the number one taboo? I don't know

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
what it is. I think it might be

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
tranny porn, but

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
it was for a very long

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
time incest porn. Huh.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
So that says a lot.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Like Pornhub,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Pornhub has been mainstream-of-fying

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
porn a little bit.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Somewhat consciously,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
but just indirect result of

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
it being a porn hub.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But they issue

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
these press releases and go like,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
they'll do little funny things on April Fool's Day.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
They'll issue, they'll go like,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
St. Patrick's Day, here's how many people

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
searched for Leprechaun porn.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Which I always thought, I thought it was a very positive

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
thing because it's like, they're

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
acknowledging just as

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
what's-his-face Kinsey did,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
part of that story was like,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
it was about revealing to everybody

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that sex was

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
simultaneously

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
private and therefore a beautiful

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
snowflake, but also

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
shared by everybody. Everybody's a freak.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Everybody's

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
coming and

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
going and

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and it's

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
okay.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I don't think there's anything wrong with porn.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I don't think it's wrong.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Well, I wouldn't expect you to say that.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
But I mean like our attitude towards it.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
feel like we're

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
really fucked up about it and that

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
one of the things that we do

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
and get away with because we're fucked up about it

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
is we treat your

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
industry as if it's like,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I don't know, it's like- Oh, it's definitely shunned

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
upon. And therefore

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
the danger of that is like, well, if we value

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
people and if our

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
taboos about porn have to do with

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
caring about people,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
then we

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
build this wall around this thing that we go like, oh, that's

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
a toilet, you know, because that's where

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I go every night.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, I'm totally to a lot of people

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
like I have like no

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
meaning of life to them. Like they're like, oh, you're

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
a porn star? Like exactly, like I'm a

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
toilet to them, you know, like they say

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
that I lose all, I can't think of the right word

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I want to say, but like, you know, I'm just

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
like no longer equal, you know, they're like, you

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
have no rights, you know, like-

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I hope this doesn't offend you, but I

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
heard a star, I was talking

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
about you with Justin during Comic Con,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
we were just seeing you on the yacht, the

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Game of Thrones people invaded and they

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
didn't invade, we wanted them there.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
They just seem like they're always invading them,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
they're so

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
medieval. But I

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
was just mentioning, oh, she seems so nice, and I asked

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
her if she'd be on the podcast, and he

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I heard a story like third hand through

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
him about you being at a party and like

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
somebody just kind of like just

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
as a casual matter of fact, like just somebody

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
not from the industry,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
somebody that didn't know you, but somebody

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
that was at a party with you, just kind of like

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
saying things and treating you in ways

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
that sort of implied that you

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
were down for whatever because of what

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
you did for a living. Oh yeah, I definitely

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
have a lot of people who automatically assume

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
that like I'm the world's biggest slut

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and I'm just gonna suck their dick right there, you know?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Because if you do it when you're working, then

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I mean, like I do it for a hobby, let's

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
let's- It's a great world.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Dan, that was very brave of you to admit that.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
That I do it for a hobby.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
That I do it for a hobby.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
That's what I, I mean, I wanted to, yeah

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
just like, I mean, I just like, I think our

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
attitude just in general, and I'm sure this is

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
gonna change over time. Yeah, I mean, people I think just

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
automatically assume that I'm like this crazy

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
sex freak, you know, it's just like, even though

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
they might be way hornier and freakier

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
than I am, they just automatically assume

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
because I do it on camera and

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
you know, maybe just I have more confidence

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
with it, they automatically assume

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
that I am like a freaky person.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Like, I have people who like, randomly

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
tell me and I like tell them I'm a pornster

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
and they're like, oh, I was like raped once.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Right. And I'm like, I don't know how this

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
is associating, I don't know how to respond

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
to you, like I'm just a sex worker, but

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I have a question, Raleigh.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
You hear stories like, I mean, I'm a

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
crap actor and I do failed TV shows for

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
living, but there, but there's times

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
like, it can be something big on camera,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
like a big network thing or a small

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
thing that we do for Channel 101, like our

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
little friends make videos, our little

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
friends, our actual awesome friends,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
and you'll come home after like

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
shooting something that was either well

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
paid or not paid, and you feel

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
this great sense of like, oh, wow, that was

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
really good, like I did good work today.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah, definitely there are days where

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
you know, also it's because it goes all

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
hand-in-hand, if I feel like my fellow

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
peers were like killing it, then there's

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
definitely days where I'm like, fuck, like

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
that scene is probably going to win an award

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
because we like killed it. You can go

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
home after having

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
sex and go like, yeah, like we did it.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, definitely, I mean, there's

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
definitely times where you can like feel like

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
there was like a genuine sexual

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
passion that was going

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
on, that you're like, that was hot.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Is that something you're striving for while

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
you're doing a thing like, I want people to

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
really watch this and I want this to endure,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I want this to be a clip that people will

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
like. Well, most times I just try to

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
like, enjoy it for what it is, like, I

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
mean, if I'm not really feeling the person

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
it's going to probably show on camera

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and I'm not going to try to like false

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
advertise it, like, you know, like

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
there's times where I'm not totally into

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
my partner or, you know, like maybe they

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I can't imagine, I'm so easily distracted

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
that there was eight people around with microphones

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
and camera equipment and some

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
That's also a really erotic part

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
of it too, that there's, you know, a guy

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
holding a boomstick the whole time

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and I'm like, you're just watching me slap

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
on this knob, you know, like

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
so, like, there's other

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
parts to it, if maybe I'm not totally into

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
like the person I'm fucking, I'm like,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
oh yeah, well, they're enjoying the show

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Other people, there must be, because you've

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
been, like, you've done enough films now

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
where you see an actor, like

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
another guy, like, oh jeez, not this fucking guy

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I have a no-list, so

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, you could kill rights now? You can say

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
fuck that guy, no way. Yeah, there's like one guy

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I won't work with just because he makes this

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
sound, he goes

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
So, I'm like, I just can't... This is the kind of shit I

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
want to know about. Like, that's

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
one guy, I'm just like, I'm like

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
looking at the director, like, really?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Like, I can't even take this guy seriously.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
There's a...

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I end up with a lot of Russian

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
stuff, because I think it's like a

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
it's a foot-fetish nylon thing

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
that's one of the categories

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
that I'm into, like, legs

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
and hosiery and stuff, and so I end up

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
like, I've seen this, there's this Russian guy

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
his version of going, ugh

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
is, ew

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and I can't

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
like, I'm just like, pants

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
around my ankles, just ready to go

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Saturday night

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I got my Emmy in one hand, I got

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
and I'm like

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I got everything I need to

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
see you're

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
a left-hander

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
and then this is like, ew

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
ew, ew

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
and it's like, well, it's also like

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
you might have like a foot in his face when

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
you're saying that, I'm like, well, you're

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
supposed to say when someone puts

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
a foot in your face, that's not what

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
you're supposed to say, anyway

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
but

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
you

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
you glossed over

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
something that I think is kind of like

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
this is just a, like, this is

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
the big bug zapper in the room, like

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
when you, when people

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
find out you're in this field

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
like, the association of that

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
real or imagined with

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
trauma

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
like, okay, so like, that is something

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
that people leap to, something bad

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
happened to you

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
oh yeah, people ask my dad when my dad's

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
like, yeah, my daughter's a porn star when it

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
comes up, they are automatically like

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
did you do something to her

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
like, and it's sad, it's really sad

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
that my own dad kind of deals with it as well

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
as I do, because nothing ever, I've always

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
just been this crazy sexual fiend

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
my whole entire life, so

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
like, when I was like, asked to be

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
an extra on a porno, I was like, yeah, that's awesome

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
and then like, I saw them doing it, and I was like, I want to do that

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
too, okay?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I was already like, having guys run trains

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
on me, I was having sex with girls, three

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
some orgies, like, all in high school, like

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
it was just totally fun and what I was

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
doing, so like- So the industry is a place

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
where, where, that is

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
lucrative, where that is like, your

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
status is rising when that happens, instead

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
of- Yeah, we're all tested

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
at high school, you're like, you're being

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
like, maligned by the people that are

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
well, I mean, I was, I was definitely

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
manipulating situations.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
You were, you were

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
the scar face of, of, of your high

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
school, because you had the, you had the goods

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
but

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
speaking of which, like, you're, you're like

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
a, but would you say, I mean, so

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
would you, when you look at your childhood, because

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
it's a, your Wikipedia says, you're moved around

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
a lot, you're, you're from Florida, those are

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
two warning signs.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Sorry,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
sorry, Florida.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
But, but, but, I mean,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
it's like, like, like, like, relative

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
to everybody in this room, would you say

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
squeaky clean, kind of like, trauma-free

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
childhood? Is that what you're saying? Or is it

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
like, like- I mean, it was like, I,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I didn't really have trauma, necessarily.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I mean, like, I lived a normal,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
you know, like, middle class,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
if not, like, slightly lower kind of

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
life. Like, I mean, my parents were divorced

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
and both remarried, but like, no, like,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
real trauma, like, you know, everything was

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
totally chill in my family, like,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I don't, I think I was pretty normal.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Yeah. My mom was super open,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I would tell her when I was going to do, like, acid

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
and shrooms, like, all right, mom, just so you know,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
like, what is the, like,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I've met a couple people, just like,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
you know, over time, like, just living

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
in town here, like, people that have worked, like,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
as producers, and

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
the two people that I know

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
that were in it, like, that were

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
really sleazy, like, what's the

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
industry like, like, in terms of the people that

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
create it, direct it, run the websites,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
is it, is it a fun

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
industry to be in, or is it, is it

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
a lot of creeps, or what is it?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I personally would consider

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
it more fun, but

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I mean, there's definitely, like, the sleazy

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
kind of creepy people, but

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I've, like, kind of worked my way

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
past and through all of that.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And now you get to pick and choose, you're a

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
status now. Yeah, and also, like, with the

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
agency that I work with and everything,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
like, they, he only goes through, like,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I started off with a different agency who, like,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
sent me once to Seattle,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
which I was, like, this guy just has a

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
camcorder, like, this is definitely

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
not a porno shoe. Yeah, so there's a, let's

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
talk about that for a second, like, how it's

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
structured, because most of us are just, like,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
it's anybody's guess. You have an agent.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
He has, he works for an agency.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah, he runs his agency, he's, like,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Mark Speegler. And so

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
he gets, all the gigs

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
come through him, he calls you, and says,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
like, okay, double anal on the

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
13th, whatever.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Double anal, is there such a thing as double

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
anal on the 13th? There is definitely double

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
triple and more. Is that your bad luck to do it

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
on the 13th?

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I don't do double anal.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah, and you have stuff that you do

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
do, don't do, then there's the grrrr guy, and

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
it's, like, whatever, and you, and then there's

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
a price, and is it still the case as it was

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
in the 90s? I mean, it was always, like,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
the women run the industry, like, or that

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
was maybe our overcompensatory,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
like, sort of, like, statement, because

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the women get paid more, and the women do

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
have, like, kill rights on scenes,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
like, the guy, if a woman says,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I don't work with that guy, that guy's, like,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
a significant part of his career is kind of

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
fucked, like, especially if the woman is you,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
and so, like, even though,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
like, but I think back then,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
even though that was being said about the

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
women that were in these scenes,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
the hierarchy

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
was still probably male dominated,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
but now is that different, because

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
you're your own boss, basically, like,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
you have your own website, you produce,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
you told me you edit your own stuff, and

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
when I marveled at that, you're like, well, it's porn

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
editing.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Like, I could be a pretty bad editor,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
and still be a great porn editor,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
but, but, but it's still, like,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
pretty cool to imagine you with

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
headphones, and, uh, because I'm assuming

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
you have neighbors, and then you're, like,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
like, and you're, like, you're, like,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
you're, like, you got the, do you use Final Cut,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
or Avid, or what? I use Adobe.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Adobe, like, Premiere.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Premiere. Um,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
you ever take it over into After Effects,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
just throw some lasers in there?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Not yet. Not yet. I did just do this

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
pretty fun, like, Halloween thing,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
but no, nothing to that extent.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
But you're producing your own stuff, so you're,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
and your website, readmylips.com?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Yeah. Very clever. Uh,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
um, that's, like, you're, like,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I bet, I bet most people who have

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
seen your, your face and heard your name,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
it's probably, like, porn hub is becoming, like,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
this thing that's, that's gotta be, like,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
an ally and an enemy to you, right?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
For sure. I mean, I definitely,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I definitely am very fond of them,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
because I do think that they help my career a lot,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
like, especially, I've, I've not,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
for the last couple years, I haven't been less than

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
rated number four, and the last couple months

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I've always been the rated number one porn star

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
on porn hub, so that automatically just comes

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
up a lot, and

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
currently, I have, like, this program

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
with them, where if I upload my videos

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and I get some money based on, like,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
ad views or whatever, so

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I have, like, but I don't put any of, like,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
my super sex stuff that's, like, on my website,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
it'll be, like, me washing the dishes naked

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
or something, and that has, like, almost a million views,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
so... Well, because I,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
and I've always said this about, like, the,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
the, no one knows how to monetize the internet,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
except the, the, the porn industry has always

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
been able to, because the porn industry kind of

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
runs on... I mean, we're

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
advancements of everything. Right. That's true.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Technology too, right? VR and everything. Like, the, um...

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Sex dolls? I just did, uh,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I just did, did, did VR

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
and had, had boobs, like,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
like, like, porn

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
will one day free us from everything.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Like, um,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
it will advance us in, in ways

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
we didn't know. I was like, oh, that's a,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
that's a nice boobs, like, and

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
they're mine. Yeah, I mean, I just had this one

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
sex toy that was molded after me that will

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
now be able to,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
like, it'll have memory of, like,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
what makes you ejaculate. Oh, God.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And, yeah, it's supposed

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
to be called the perfect fuck,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and it'll know, it'll also

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
be self-lubricating. It'll, like, it's...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
This sounds like a rather cold

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
open of a, of a dystopian.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah. This is, like,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
at 209, we go, it's a...

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Ladies and gentlemen... You will no longer have to get married.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Yeah, they, they, they try

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
to make one sex toy based on me,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
but the shipping costs were too big.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Right. Um...

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
It just...

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Thank you.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Eat those chocolates every minute.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
So,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
yeah, so, so Pornhub

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
is mainstream-ifying in the,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
you know, it's making, it's making, making us

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
maybe hopefully relax about porn a little bit.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Um, and it's also helping

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
self-starters. It's, like, but it,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
it might also be, it, you have to, like...

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Yeah, I mean, I have to contact

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
them constantly to remove scenes that are

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
up on my website. Right.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
One thing I do super exclusively is anal.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Like, I only shoot that for myself and one other company.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
So, they'll take

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
my own anal scenes from my own website.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So, I have to, like, email them and be, like,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
hey, take down my pizza delivery girl

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
anal scene, like... Like, that's

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
special. That's my only gang

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
bang that exists online.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And it's, like, exclusively at my website.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Do you check... I saw the thumbnail

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
for that one. Uh, and, uh...

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
So, which means I was, like, I was, like,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
it was, like, it shouldn't have been there.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
The... Do you... This, I, I feel, like,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I... I wanted to say this, but, like,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I don't know if you hear this all the time

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
and if this makes you happy or sad or what

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
your reaction to this is, but fuck it.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I'll just... Like, my girlfriend and I

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
watch porn together. We've seen you a thousand

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
times in different things.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
And then we met you and now

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
we... It's, like, both of us individually

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
and as a couple, like, we don't,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
like, we don't click at you anymore.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Oh, sad. Sad face.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
That's because we're bad people, right?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Because...

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I think it's also, I think it's also

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
just American society, the way

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
it kind of, like, has

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
portrayed us to be and, like, the way that

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
the standards are of, like, you don't fuck your friends.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Right. You know, that's, like, cheating.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
And it's also just, like, like, oh, there's a threshold

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
you have to go through. Everything has to be about taboo.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Yeah, and, like, I'm not a fantasy. Now I'm, like,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
this tangible thing. In order for my girlfriend and I

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
to enjoy watching porn together, we have to

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
we have to have this unspoken agreement that we're

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
doing something base,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
crass, animalistic

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
together. And so then we meet you

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
and you're, like, hi.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
But, you know, like, like,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
like, can I borrow a cup of sugar

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
or whatever? And

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
and I'm afraid Trump's

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
going to get elected too. And look, there's Game of Thrones people

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and it's like, and, and then,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and then, yeah, and it's like, I guess it's just

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
it is, that's, that's, that sort of

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
typifies that, that, that border, which I don't

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
think will, like, but it doesn't,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
it doesn't bum you out, like, like, it doesn't make

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
you, it's not like... I'm really sad

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
that you and your girlfriend aren't banging, watching my

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
porn anymore. We usually just watch

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and then we end up, like,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
touching ourselves on each other. We don't, like,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
we don't, like, put the laptop open and then I'm, like,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
we're both watching. Do you want to try

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
that? No.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Um,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
but, uh, what, out of

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
all these categories, then we'll go to the

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Prop 60 thing, but out of all that, there's all the

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
categories. It's sort of funny how porn is

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
so, like, like, it's the

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
internet, how it's, like, regimented

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
sexuality, but

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
that also, I think, is a step towards,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
it's like, you can, you can mark

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
your, your transition

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
if you were to become curious about

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
bisexuality, you could, like, drift

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
in categories and tag clouds and things

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
and you can kind of, like, it's more

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
supervisable and curatable by the

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
person's own discretion, but, um,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
what, these categories that

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
all exist, like, are there ones that are your

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
favorites, not because they cause, or maybe

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
it's because they cause the most pleasure,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
or maybe it's because they're the easiest for the most

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
money or whatever, like, what are, if your agent

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
calls and says, I got a boom, boom, boing, and a boom,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
do, do, do, like, like, like, which

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
one makes you go fucking sweet?

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Like, like, I want more of those.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Uh, well, I definitely love, like,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
blow job scenes, because usually

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
those are, like, in and out in two hours

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and so that's, like,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
really nice, um,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
quickly. I mean, it's not all too, there's

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
a lot of prep time. Yeah, I mean, there's, like, you know,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
an hour's worth of makeup,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
you know, in the makeup chair, kind of a thing.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I knew those dicks were fake.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It's, they're

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
impossible. Um, so it's, like,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
and there's a lot of porn that's just straight up blow jobs.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I mean, then there's definitely, yeah, there's, like, certain scenes

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
that I hate working for, which, like, I mean,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Reality Kings is, like, I love them, but

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I also hate because a lot of their stuff

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
is, like, they're not even shooting sex the

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
whole time, they're shooting ad shots, which are, like,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
you know, those little gifts on the side of

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
the porn hub, basically, that is, like, you know,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
the obvious fucking, even though, like,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
you can see over the counter, but you're, you know,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
it's supposed to be, like, relative, so, like, that guy

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
technically doesn't see, even though he's, like, under the nose

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
eating or pussy or whatever the fuck.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Yeah. So, like, there's, like, a lot of that

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
where we'll spend so much time just shooting,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
like, these ad-based shots

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
where it's just, like, over and over,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
like, these 30-second clips, and they're, like,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
want so many of them, and it's, like, we're not even

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
doing sex things, or, you know,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
or, like, I hate VR porn because, like, that's, like,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I'm supposed to be, like, making out

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
with the camera, so, like, now I'm, like,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
having sex with, like, a camera,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
like, literally, if this is the camera,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
they want me to go...

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I saw a VR one.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I just got my Vive system, so I

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
saw a VR one with you, and it's, you're

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
a bridesmaid with another...

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Oh, yeah, Mia Malkova.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
And then, all VR porn right now is just,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
it's just a point-of-view video of...

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Yeah, it's like POV.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Well, no, all the time, the guys, like, legs

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
are just, like, below frame,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
and then there's just, like, women coming

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
in and going, what are you doing?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
What are you, you think

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
that dick is important?

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
All right, let's see what's going on.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
This, because the guy can't do

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
anything, or you'll get seasick,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
like, he can't, like, get up

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
and start going, ah!

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Uh...

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
The, um...

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It's dangerous, like,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
these cameras aren't expensive

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
and a lot of amateur pornographers are

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
grabbing them and going, let's make a VR

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
porn, you put on the helmet, and you're

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
like, what the fuck!

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Oops.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Woo!

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Woo!

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
That was the, that was the new glass

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
that Jane Kick started for me, and...

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
No, tell me now.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
No, no, no.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Riley, do you, do you

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
think porn is a porn that you can

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
consume? Oh, that's a good question.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
He's a good interviewer.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I never would have thought to answer that.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It was like, you're a therapist, as a therapist.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Yeah, uh, I, I only watch

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
anime porn.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Anime porn. Yeah, so, like,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
that's what I like to, which is what I used to,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
like, before porn, I didn't like

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
watching boy on girl sex, to me, like,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
the penis on camera kind of looked weird,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
so I would watch lesbian sex

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
or anime porn.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Was the allure of anime porn

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
for you? Uh, I think that

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
it's just, like, ultimately super

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
fantasy, and also now that I know

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
most of the performers, it kind of makes it

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
different, so I'll watch... Is it because you're too critical?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Because I can only watch British comedy. Yeah, I mean,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
so... I think so.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
And, like, sometimes even that doesn't do it

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
for me, sometimes I just have to look at pictures.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Right. And it's like, just the picture alone

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
is enough because I can create my whole

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
own imaginary entity

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
so... Exactly, I can't watch New Girl because I'm like,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I don't know, Heather.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I don't know her, obviously.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I don't know her fucking name.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Liz Maryweather, and I'm like,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I met her, and I respect her, and

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
she... So, I can't watch

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
New Girl because, like, if they do

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
a joke and then it goes to commercial, I'm like,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
that's an act break, and then I'm like, you're a dick.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
And, like, it's too much...

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I spend too much time all day

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
obsessing over these things. I can't

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
just watch, like, Parks and Rec,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
like, usually, and, like, without, like, being drawn

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
into conflicting voices

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
in my head, well... Yeah, definitely.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And if I'm with a girlfriend or something,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
they inevitably just get the impression that I'm, like,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
this fucking asshole, so...

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah, like, I'm super picky about my blowjobs,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
so if I can see that the girl... So if you're watching a bad

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
blowjob, if Faye Reagan is, like,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
hacking it up on the... Yeah.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
No, I know. If you're, like, just...

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
If you're just making the sounds, and I'm just, like,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
you're not even doing anything, like,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I'm just... So, yeah, I...

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Riley, or anybody here, has anybody

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
pornstar karaoke at Sardos

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
up in the valley?

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
No?

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
There is a karaoke place.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
There's a hand being raised over there.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Yeah, you've done it?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Right, is it monthly or weekly, or what is it?

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Weekly. Weekly.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Yeah, I went there once. Sardos

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
is, like, on pass, right?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Yeah, in Burbank.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Your first date.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Wow, you know how to treat a lady, I love that.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Uh...

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Uh...

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
That's my wife.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Uh, sorry.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I just moved to the Catskills.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Uh...

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Near Warner Brothers, there's a place called Sardos.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
They do karaoke, but weekly there is pornstar

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
karaoke, and I went there once, did not

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
know that. My friends invited me,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
and it was... I was like,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
what the fuck? That's Stephanie Swift.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Like, that's somebody I knew, like,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
and I guess people that, like, you kind

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
of vaguely recognize, because, you know,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I've seen porn.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
And they get up there, here's the thing about

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
pornstar karaoke, competitive as shit.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
They're not having fun,

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
they're actually trying to win karaoke.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And on the tables

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
at Sardos, this is true,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
there's little slips of paper,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I haven't been there, this has got to be

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
eight years ago, or so.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Little slips of paper on each table

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
that said, hey, respect

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
our neighbors, don't fuck on their lawns

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
or on their backyards.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Because apparently the porn stars were getting

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
out, like, doing karaoke, and then

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
banging on their nearby

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
private property. And they actually

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
had to tell them... I can't believe he did devil and blue jeans!

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
He knows

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
that's mine! I do black vilfits!

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
They have to be uptight about something, so they funnel

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
it into, like, something that's right.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
So, alright, so prop 60, let's talk

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
about that, because, like, the debates are tonight, some

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
of them are DVR, California voters

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
are gonna go in, you're gonna be standing in your neighbor's garage

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
or at some elementary school, and then this fucking

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
thing has dropped on you without warning, there's, like,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
you have to have an opinion about condoms and porn

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
and all this stuff. So we already had the

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
whatever the prop was, and that

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
went through, right? So there was, like, a condom law.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Yeah, there's a measure B which already

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
went through, which by technically

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
we're supposed to use condoms when we're shooting porn.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
But there's, like, no penalty

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
if we don't, so nobody

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
even does. So I'm gonna describe an ad

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
to you that I saw tonight, because, and then

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
you, like, let's get your perspective

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
on this, because it's very, from

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
talking to you, a very deceptive ad.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
There's a woman on camera, and she looks

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
very sad, and

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
if I assume her story's

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
true, so she should be sad, but she's, like, I

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
there's loopholes in the

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
condom law, and people take

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
them, and we need a law

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
that prevents the loopholes too, and

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I'm an adult film actress,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and I got aids from doing

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
adult film and all this stuff, and it's

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
very sad, and it seems very serious, and

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
it leaves you with the choice between not caring

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
about someone's life, and, like,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
voting for this law.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Now, you tell me

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
how many, how many people have gotten

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
aids from doing porn in the last

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
decade? Well, there hasn't

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
been anybody who has contracted actual

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
HIV from porn for the last

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
eleven years, so

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
this whole condom law is very

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
misleading, or in the way that they try

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
to sell it as trying to prevent

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
HIV or other

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
STDs, and I

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
myself, I've been shooting for five years, and

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I've never contracted gonorrhea or

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
chlamydia or any... And those are actually

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
like... These are very common... If you had

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
it would be like, eh, workplace

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
hazards... Yeah, I mean, it's exactly, it's very

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
common, it happens a lot in the industry...

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
But you haven't even... Even I, myself...

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
437 movies... For

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
five years, I have never contracted

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
an STD, so

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
and I personally, the

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
regulation now, to date, is

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
every 12 days we get tested. It was

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
prior, I think...

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It's either been a year or two that it's

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
been 14 days, but prior it was

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
every 30 days, and we all

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
collectively agreed, we're like, oh, we

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
feel like we should be, you know, to...

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
If we, because we were having a couple, like,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
scares, like, we have false

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
positives that come up, and then, you know, there's

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
a whole, like, I can't think of the word,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
but, you know, when they collectively get everybody together

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and they're like, okay, you guys are possibly,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
you know, you possibly have something...

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I'm not sure what's it, or a

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
quarantine? Yeah, there we go, like a quarantine

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
kind of a thing, so they'll, like, get these people,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
but even in all the scares,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
like, it's been 11 years since anybody

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
has actually contracted anything from...

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I mean, that's a lot of penises going into a lot of

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
bulls. And the people who did back...

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
When there was, it was people who

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
do, like, anal cream pies,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
where the girls who got

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
AIDS, HIV,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
so, like, even within my

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
industry or my agency, none of us

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
do anal cream pies,

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
because that was the... like,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
other girls who worked with the same performers who did

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
anal sex or regular cream pies,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
they didn't contract the disease, as opposed

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
to the girls who shot, like, anal cream pies.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
They were able to contract the disease,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
so...

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
So, we have pre-condemn...

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Despite what you might think about the condom law

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
that's already been voted in, and which isn't up

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
for being repealed, we're not voting for that.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
This is, like, a big piece of, like, duct tape,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
and then some that someone wants to put over

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
the existing condom laws.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The existing condom laws are already there,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and from what you're saying,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
before that condom law existed,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
this shit was being

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
self-policed by your industry.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Yes, it's not legally... it's not by

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
legal rights that we have to be tested.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
It's not, like, you know, like, when we shoot

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
and they film us, they're like, hey, are you

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
under the influence of any drugs or alcohol?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Are you 18? Are you here under your own free will?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
There's never a question saying, are you tested

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
and are you clean? Like, so there is no, like,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
legal standard on this, but this is

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
an industry standard that we've developed

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
to be tested every 12 to 14

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
days, and now

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
they want to, like, legally come in

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
and demand that we wear

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
pornos, and if it's not shown in

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
every single frame of the porno

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
that is, you know, being

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
out there, that now any

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
civilian can now sue us

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
for 25% of

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the makings of this

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
film or something along the lines. I can't...

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I'm not totally sure with

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
the whole thing.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It's, yeah, so just to repeat

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
that, and maybe that, like, yeah, if the condom

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
isn't in every frame, which just imagine

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
there's a porn editor. I don't know how they can even do it

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
in every frame. What a terrible porn movie.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Like, my favorite shots are the master shots.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
First of all, like, I'm not a huge

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
fan of the point of

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
entry, like, close-ups. Like, I like

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
the far away stuff if there's a condom

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
that's visible. Forget about that.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Like, the...

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
What is the agenda behind this?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Personally, what I take the agenda

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
is that they want to move porn out of California.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Do they want to move it somewhere

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
else, or do they just want California cleaner?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I think they want California out, like,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
the porn industry out, because even in

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
the way that they... if you guys, like, check

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
out your, you know,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Voters ballot, you know,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
check out your shit here and you actually read

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
on Prop 60, it's really

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
misleading because all it basically is telling

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
you that it's, like, let's stop

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
spreading, you know, STDs

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
in the adult industry and

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
bringing it into the broader community.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Like, it's making it sound like we come in

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and we're, like, gizzing all over you guys

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and giving you aides and shit, which is

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
not nearly, like I said, it has

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
been 11 years. It's been 11 years since we've

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
had any contracted diseases.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
In spite of people shunting you off into a

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
relatively unregulated industry, it's...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Yes, and then it's also bringing this guy, Michael Weinstein,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
who is, like, the founder of

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
AIDS Health Color Foundation or something

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
like that, it makes him now

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
he's going to be, like, inducted

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
into, like, legislation where he will

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
now oversee all

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
of porn and kind of, like, control

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
all of porn in California

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and, I mean, this guy has also

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
spent over $1.8

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
million of AIDS Health Care Foundation

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
just on trying to

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
get this, you know,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
bill in

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
act. And what's his angle?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Like, how does he profit or, like...

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Well, he'll be getting paid by

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
taxpayers' dollars once he is...

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You said that, like, the money

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
that went into this, like,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
the reason there's a commercial tonight during the debates,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
there can't, there won't be another commercial

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
because the porn industry would

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
have to use its blowjob money to, like,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
make a national airtime spot.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
There's no way that we can compete with that, you know?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
These people use AIDS research

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
money. Yes, which should be going

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
to better, you know...

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
To make AIDS fight cancer.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
People, yeah. Like, it should

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
go to that stuff you were talking about earlier

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
with the leukemia and

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
shit. Yeah, that shit.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Get the fucking cancer. Like, goddamn

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
piece of shit, kids.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But, yeah, I mean,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I want to see an AIDS versus cancer

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
movie, like, like, Predator

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
versus...

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
If nothing else, just do the

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
research because you're a California voter

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and you're gonna be, like, it's just, it's dropped in your lap

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and it's like, like, the key points here being

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
you're not, if you vote no on

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Prop 60, the only

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
thing that you're

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
affecting is just, you're stopping...

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Well, no, you want to vote no on Prop 60.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
No, that's what I'm saying. If you vote no on Prop 60

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
you're not making any dramatic decisions

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
about the course of people's lives

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
except that you're just, like, saying

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
like, there's someone that's

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
trying to do that. There's someone that's trying

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to change things and they're not

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
changing things to make there be less AIDS

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
among porn stars or the community

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
because that's not an issue. They're lying

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
about that. They're misleading you about that.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So a vote no on Prop 60 means

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
what exactly?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Can I say a quick thing?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Real quick, I don't need to go off on stage.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Prop 60 would allow me

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
to sue Riley if I don't see

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
a condom in her porn.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Yes, because it also sues, it's not suing

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
performers, it's suing producers and

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
because I produce my own content

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
if he's viewing something on my website

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
he will be able to sue me directly.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Right.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And it's just crazy

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
at what it does

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and what it affects and how

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
misleading it is because basically it's just...

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It's like a financial stoning law.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It's like saying that if you see

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
a porn star you can throw

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
financial rocks at them until they die.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The reason you're also able to do this is because now

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I have to display my legal

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
name and my address

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
publicly and, you know, I have

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
a huge fan base but as well as

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
other transgender performers

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and gay performers who are more

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
of a target towards violence

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
than I am.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So it's like, now those kinds of people

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
are set up for harassment.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
People who want to harass a transgender

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
like maybe they're a super big fan

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
but they hate that they're a fan

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
or some fucking weird psycho shit.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Wow.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So, no on Prop 60

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
safe enough to say.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
If there was anybody that had anything to gain from it

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
it would be...

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Please. I mean, I don't know if it passes

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I don't know what I'll be doing.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I'll have to move.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
You'll be getting a law degree

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
to defend yourself in small claims court

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
against people that...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Against big condom.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
All right, well, do you mind sticking around

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
with some other friends?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I just haven't finished my drink.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Is it Jeff Cook? Jeff Cook, are you here?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's Jeff Davis, Dan. I've known you for years.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Jeff, is Jeff the...

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Who are the Cook brothers?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Right here.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
All right, so I assume it's not Jeff

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
or you would have said yes.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Who's the Cook brother

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
that sent me the video

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
or that sent some of the video of the...

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That's me, Alex Cook.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Alex Cook. I was close.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Music

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And you...

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And this is your...

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
You're the brother. What's your name? Lee.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Lee Cook. Okay, you guys...

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
There's microphones for you, right? You can have a seat.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Take some mics. So, Alex, you sent this video.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Like, I don't know how much of this

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
is supposed to be a surprise.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Like, it's like a wedding proposal or...

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
There's like, you sent a video that said

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
you're a veteran

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and you...

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Tongue in cheek owned...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
You're playing the veteran card.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It's good. It's a fine card to play.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Like, you've served your country.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
You're out of the service.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You've got some...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You've suffered some PTSD stuff

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
or injuries or...

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
No, no injuries, just kind of

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
getting to being a civilian again after the army,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
getting over everything.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And you got your little brother here and you guys are from where?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I live in Florida now,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
but he's stationed at Camp Pendleton now.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
He's a Marine currently.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So, Alex,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
you are...

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You're a retired Army? Or are you selective?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
No, I'm out. I was in for about five years.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I went to Iraq for a year and Afghanistan for a year.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
And now, Lee, you're

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
active Marine.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yeah, I'm in Marine Corps based Camp Pendleton

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
in San Diego.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh yeah? Have you been

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
shipped out?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
No, I basically just hang out in California

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
and get drunk a lot.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I had a little easier...

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
My only problem with Camp Pendleton

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
is that I got the worst food poisoning

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
in my fucking life.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Yeah, right next to the...

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Totally.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So, Alex, it's hard to find fault

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
with anybody that does play the veteran card

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
which is a fully valid card,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
but also you seem to love your brother very much

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and speak very highly of him.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And in your video

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
what you're saying to me is

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
you know, he's in the service.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You were in the service and you just

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
thought maybe because you guys are both big fans of the show

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
that

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
if you came up here

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
and made it more important that maybe

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
your agenda was to

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
maybe...

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Well, we wanted to talk to you either

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
didn't need to be on stage, this is awesome,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
but

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
yeah, we just wanted to be able to

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
talk with you and the fact that we've had

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
all these different experiences that

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I don't know if a lot of your fans

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
kind of, you know, the nerdy

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
or tight people don't tend to be in the military, so...

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Right.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
What was your MOS in the army?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Pretty nerdy one.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I was a 46 Romeo, which is a broadcaster,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
so I

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
shot video and stuff, but I was in an

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
infantry unit and went with them

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
to Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
You were an army nerd, I love that.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
46 Romeo, I love that.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
What about you, Lee? I eat tanks.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm an engineer,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
so basically, demolition, construction,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
seaford, shit like that.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So what...

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I mean, if your video...

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
maybe I'm gilding the lily, I don't know.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I thought your video was like...

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
putting words in your mouth and saying,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I'd like to talk to my little brother,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I'd like to kind of talk him out of serving.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I'm almost done, and then I'm

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
home free.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Well, here's what I thought when I saw the video.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Hang on, Dan.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah, I got like

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
11 months left,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and then I'm getting out and moving back

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
to Florida and hanging out.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And then retiring?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
No, I'll...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I haven't been in long enough to officially retire

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and get pension and stuff like that,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
but I'll use the GI bill.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I want to go to school for music,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and so I'll go do that in Florida and hang out.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Well done.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yeah, the two things

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
that hit my mind were like,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
well, number one, this is a pretty contractual issue,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I think. You're in it until you're out of it.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And number two,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
correct me if I'm wrong, but

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
if your brother's enough of a sociopath

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
that a podcast would convince him

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
to not risk his life or risk his life,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
then maybe he's the kind of

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
heartless killing machine we need in the armed services.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I mean,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
that's where we want people

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
that are, like,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
programmable and deadly.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Who has a better

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
ua or ura?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Ura. Ua.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Ua doesn't make any sense.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
It's not a real sound.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I never really could do a good hua.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Hey, bruh.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Alright, that was my answer.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Neither.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So your experience, Lee,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
has been a lot easier than your older brothers.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Same training

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
and all this stuff,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
but you're coming up in 11 months

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
on your, you'll go home

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and you got training, you got the GI Bill,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Alex, you were

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
in the shit, albeit

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
a nerd in the shit.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
You were shooting the shit.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Which is almost worse, probably.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
You're more isolated.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Definitely.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
You can't bro out with all the

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
meat heads out there.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Those hurt locker guys have all the fun

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
wrestling

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
each other because they have to have an intimate

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
relationship with them.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Alex, where were you stationed?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I was stationed at Fort Campbell

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
in Kentucky, the 101st

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Airborne Division,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
but went to Iraq for a year

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
in East Baghdad,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
and then Iraq,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Afghanistan for a year

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
in East Afghanistan.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
So when you're doing what you did out there,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
where physically are you?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
What's your home base?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
It's called the Forward Operating Base

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
or FAB, that's where we lived.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
In Iraq it was the old

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Ministry of Intelligence, I think.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Saddam Hussein's Ministry of Intelligence

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
that we kind of just moved into.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So it was like big old cement buildings.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And then in Afghanistan

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
it was just kind of a camp that we set up

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
with tents on gravel.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I'd go out on patrols and missions

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and stuff like that with the guys to shoot videos.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Lee, what would it mean right now?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
If you got sent out

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
where we are

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
as the U.S. right now?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
If Trump invaded Mexico.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
If a Marine got sent out to the desert

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
right now, are they still

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
deploying Marines out there?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
right now it's kind of a peace

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
time Marine Corps.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
They're basically making moves like

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
we do Meuse Marine

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
something fucking, it's an acronym.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
You go on a boat

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and you visit Asian countries

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and you show your force around the world

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
and have some buddies

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
that are in Lithuania

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
and shit just showing that we exist.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
But for the most part

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
we're just doing peace time

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
building hearts and minds

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
missions and stuff like that.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
If you're not anywhere right now

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
it would probably be a pretty

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
uneventful deployment.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Sometimes you have to do photo ops

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
where you hand a blanket to a hurricane

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
server.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I was the photographer that did those photo ops.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
At your age, Lee,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
let's say you were deployed overseas

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and you were an active Marine

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
anything could happen right now.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Some serious shit could go down.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You could be

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
thrust right in there.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So super recently

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
deployment opportunity has come up

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
for next year sometime.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
It's a six month deployment

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
but by the time it ends

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I'll have supposed to have been out of the Marine Corps

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
for one month. So I can do a six month extension

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
to go on the deployment

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
or not go and get out

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
early. And it's like with my luck

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I'll lose my legs

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
or something. Or I could

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
go and do that and take the gamble.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
So like...

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
What's the upside

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
for you? Like a bigger pension?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Well, it's

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
total brainwashing too because

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
like

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I haven't been deployed or anything like that.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
We live in a, like me, everyday life

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
is around all these people who are like

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
oh yeah, I was there for the initial push

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
in Fallujah or whatever.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So I'm at a

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
lower status than them

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
based off my experience in the military.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So like you have that just ingrained

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
into you since day one that you want to

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
go out and do things and stuff like that

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
but then you also get like, you don't pay

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
taxes for the time that you're deployed.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
You get like combat pay. Yeah, but you can

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
you can do that by losing a billion dollars.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Yeah.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
You get that too. You don't even have to

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
be in a tent.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Sorry, I cut you off.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
No, no, no.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I got to, I was very lucky that I got to go

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
perform like for some USO

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
shows like for Marines

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
and Army

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and some air bases

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and we also got to go

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
to Bethesda and Walter Reed

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
like the hospitals for the world, most of the

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Marines, the wounded Marines are at

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and it was fucking crazy, man.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Like everybody's

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
blown to bits and

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
some of the nicest

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
like coolest people you ever met.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Like it's nuts.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Yeah, and what

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
just like people getting blown to bits like

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I obviously

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
have never seen it firsthand but I work with

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
people and I'm around people so often that

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
have had that like

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
right now I actually got tasked out

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
so I just check IDs at the gate and I'm like

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
welcome to Camp Pendleton, have a nice day

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
but there's this

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
old dude who calls himself Agent Whitehead

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
and he has like

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
he has a retired military ID so we have

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
to let him on base but he's always

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
like saying that he can like mind control

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
people and stuff like that and he has

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
like two prosthetic legs

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
but like

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
he's a Vietnam vet so like

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
that dude got messed up

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
like that dude

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Where are you guys at?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I want to know a lot more about

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Agent Whitehead.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
That's classified.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Can we get him on the show?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
He's in the back right now

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and he goes through night vision goggles

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Where are you guys at politically?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I mean like

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
there's been this tradition like

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
oh I'm a Republican so I'm into

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
war and strong armed forces and defense

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and all that stuff but it's like Truman was a Democrat

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and he was a civil rights

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
advocate and

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
dropped the bomb on

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Hiroshima and

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Nagasaki.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Get the other one right Dan.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Zuki maybe?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
These words have changed so much like politically though

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
like from

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
you guys span a couple years now in the

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
armed services like the guys

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
gals around you are they

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
right wing?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
They're mostly right wing to the max.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And are they pretty like

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
do they say like

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
shit that makes you like crazy?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
One thing I find a lot

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I'm as left as you can get

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
just about

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
slightly less than him maybe but

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
like one thing I find is like

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
yeah Trump sucks

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
but

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
right and that

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and that shrug is like

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
there's the world in that shrug

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I mean I grab

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
women by the pussy too

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
because our forefathers

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
did

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
the

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
the yeah I mean

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
how do you reconcile

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
being politically liberal?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Do you disguise yourself

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
when you're if you're surrounded you're in a

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
cause I imagine there's right wing people in Hollywood

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
that kind of like they probably feel a little

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
clammed up like like they don't want to

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
alienate themselves it could cost them money

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
it could cost them livelihood.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I don't know how many it just doesn't go with

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the territory but then again they must exist

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
so what do you guys

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
do when you're

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
in a tent or a barracks

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
or at some army term

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
military term

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
and people say something like

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
do you engage and go like no I'm gonna

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
change your hearts and minds?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I can't speak for him but

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I personally am like let me tell you why you're wrong

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
and then I go into a spiel

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and I'm like I'm the only liberal marine

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
ever I'm great

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
so yeah I was

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I definitely stayed more quiet when I was

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
in the army and this was

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
like I deployed to Iraq in 2003

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
so it was pretty recent

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
after 9-11 and everyone was kind of like

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
ramped up to go over there

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and kill people. What was your unit?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I was in the

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
506th Infantry Regiment

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
in the 101st Airborne Division which is actually

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
technically the Band of Brothers guys

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
from the HBO thing.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
We did our USO shows

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
we did shows for like

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
NATO doctors

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
we do comedy for them

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
you can reference Voltaire

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
we also did a show

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
for the Big Red One

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
which is straight up infantry grunts

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
and they were just like

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
proud murderers

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and they were

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
great fun but their job

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
is to go in there and like

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
they're a tip of the spear

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
if you didn't do a joke about blowing shit up

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
or fucking and sucking they weren't digging it

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I imagine you have to get to that space

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
in order to

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
your job if you're going to do it well

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
or even if you're not invested in doing it well

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
but you're only invested in maintaining

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
your sanity you obviously

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
that's the definition of a soldier

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
you have to leave your humanity

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
at the door you have to become a machine

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
because

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
the hierarchy and everything it's like

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
reliant even that's the weird thing about this country

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
is that we act like there's this left

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
and right hand but it's like the lefties

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
in our country argue that

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
we need thicker body armor

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
like there's a

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
goddamn ambidextrous

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
we're a right of center

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
empire why wouldn't you be right of center

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
if you were an empire

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
you would be conservative because you'd like

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
things to be the way they were yesterday

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
more so than to have them change

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and it's our behavior that would indicate that

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
we are a

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
we have

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
people in our country that vote and pay

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
taxes and speak very loudly

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
about

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
how incredibly left we are

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
but when we

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
measure our country as a collective and observe

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
our behavior we are

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
we are full on into

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
blowing shit up we're full on into occupying

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
spaces influencing

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
democracy across the globe

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
depending on our interests

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
like we are we're down

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
to fuck

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
and so

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
what is my point

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
well let me just say

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I don't think I mentioned this in the little

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
video but

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I guess my point was just that

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
if I got drafted

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
if I was not

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
43 and I wouldn't immediately have a million reasons

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
why I couldn't but

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I would absolutely

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I mean

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
there's only one path

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
you would have to go like okay yes

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I surrender all of my

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
critical thinking because otherwise

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I'm gonna keep fucking up and I could

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
hurt somebody I could

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
something up for everybody

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
if I'm not

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
if I don't just put blinders on and just

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I gotta just

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I wouldn't be capable of doing it successfully

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
but that would be my choice

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
for me that's a shitty thing

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
it's like the more you think the stupider you are

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
like

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
if someone is like

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
hey you fucked up so you gotta go do

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
lunges up and down a hallway for five hours

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
or whatever you're like okay I'm gonna go do lunges

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
for no reason and I'll

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
think about something else like there's no

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
there's no opportunity

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
as a lower ranking person to be like

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I'm smarter than my leader

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I have a better frame of

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
mind than him a better like

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
geopolitical understanding of the situation

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
than him or her

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
so I'm gonna make this decision

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
yeah I don't even want that in my

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
editor

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
you know like on a sitcom

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
that will cost money

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and make us worse television

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
you need blind loyalty

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I'm sorry Riley

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
do people in the porn industry ever get asked to go to

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
USO shows?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I mean I get asked to the military ball

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
once a week

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
but

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
like

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
people go out and perform

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
the troops would flip if you came out there

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
yeah I mean I don't know

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I don't personally go and perform like sex shows

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
no no no

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I'm not saying you would get on stage

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
and do like porn

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
but if you went out there and just like

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
shook hands and said hello and met people

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
they'd freak out

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
probably a lot of the locals would be pretty upset about it

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
to be honest

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
the locals

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
like in Iraq and Afghanistan their Muslim country

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
so porn was not allowed at all in the military

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
but obviously

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I'm sure I first saw

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I've sent many porn

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
yeah I've sent many

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I've sent care packages to guys in the army

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
very often

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
well alright so

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
what is in that care package Riley?

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
my panties

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
so your service to our country

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and your love of your brother has gotten you up here

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
we're very

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
fascinated to hear from you

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
you're a good egg like what do you want to do

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
with this opportunity

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
is there any albums to plug

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
or any props

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
like 60 you know let's hear your counterpoint

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
or yeah

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
anything you want to say?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
no I don't think we have any plugs we just wanted to

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
be able to chat with you and

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
is there anything when you're listening to the podcast

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
that you're like well geez none of these people

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
on stage or listening are in military service

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
if they knew what we knew maybe

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
is there anything that you've heard us

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
express that you're like well come on

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
oh

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I've got a few

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I'll read it on Jeff's twitter later

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
but are you saying Lee

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
that Alex has talked to you

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
out of going into active service

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
oh no no no no like

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
so I have a daughter and she was born when I was

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
18 and I was

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
like well I'm not going to finish college

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
so I'm going to join

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
the military and have a life that way

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
and so that's why I joined and then I was

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
like

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I was already super liberal and shit like that

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
before that and

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
yeah I'm ready to get out

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and I think it adds to the story a little bit

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
that our dad is a

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
career military army officer

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
and so we spent our lives as kids

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
moving around every two years around the world

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and our parents are very

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
conservative

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
so we definitely grew up in that world

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
and

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
you know had to figure out around

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
what do you think was he a hardcore dude

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I used to

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I don't know if you know what parade rest is

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
but when my dad was angry at me

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
that's how I stood in front of him

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
which is a military position of attention

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
what is that exactly

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
feet

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and for how long

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
hands behind your back

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
really

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
and then I'd get beaten and then I'd go to bed

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
and then lesson learned

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
fucking oh

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
hahahaha

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
well

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
here's like

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
when I went to these shows and I met these officers

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
and I met these enlisted men and women

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
they were like hey Jeff you should really

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
you ever think about being an officer

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I'm like no like I hate you

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
you're too smart Jeff I hate being told what to do

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
yeah but all officers hate being told

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
what to do I was like yeah but I would be

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
in jail the whole time

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
because I don't like all these

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
fucking rules they're like yeah

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
all great generals say I'm like you're freaking me out

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
like you're gonna have to fucking stop it

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
something I've never understood

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
maybe you guys can clarify this

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
if you're nerds and you're in the military

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and you've experienced this like

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
am I mistaken in assuming that

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
no matter who's been president

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
through the span of our country's history

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
there's never been like a dramatic

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
like

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I know that Republicans are better at

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
starting

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
entire wars

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
better for the military

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
but I don't think you guys think like that

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
when you're in that line of work I don't think you're like

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
like firemen don't go oh this guy's pro fire

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
like I want him to be my

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
candidate like like you're firemen

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
your job is to put out wars

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and in other words

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
like it's not like it's like a jackpot

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
like

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
is your average marine

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
or your average army soldier

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
are they gung-ho and they want to kill mother fuckers

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
they want war

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
they are going to vote for whoever is most

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
likely to start the next war

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
but it's because of their ideology right it's not because of anything practical

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
where it's like Hillary Clinton

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
as far as I know

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
just like Obama before her, Bill Clinton

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
these aren't people

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
who reduce the amount of fucking up people

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
we do are they

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
the defense budget stays

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
the same and increases at the rate

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
that it increases correct

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I think the only president that hasn't declared war was like Carter

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
every Democrat

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
except for him maybe has

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
it's almost like the president doesn't

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
matter at all except

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
when he's a fucking lunatic

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
that like can actually

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I don't think we would have invaded

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Iraq if Al Gore had been president

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
that's like the classic example

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
you can't just picture that happening

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
we'd always try to increase this if Al Gore was president

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
that'd be great

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
but you

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
spent your military career and got your GI Bill

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
you've been at Camp Pendleton

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
you haven't been stationed in a country that we're occupying

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
or fighting

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
our defense budget continues to just

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
it's more important than education

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
that shit better fucking pay for my college

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
or I'm gonna be finished

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
but we have bad news for you

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
while you've been gone we've made your college education worthless

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
enjoy it

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
enjoy your degree

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
and fucking whatever

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
because we haven't

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
valued education as much as we have defense

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and for that reason it just

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
it kind of confuses me when I see

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
video footage of like

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
rooms full of hard working men

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
and women that are salt of the earth that grew up in lower middle class

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
neighborhoods

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
and who volunteered for military

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
service who are like so invested

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
in who becomes commander in chief of our military

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and it's like you don't think

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Obama is gonna be a boon

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
to your industry

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I was in Afghanistan when Obama was

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
inaugurated and it was like a funeral out there

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
everyone was because they think he's gonna

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
what you know like pull back

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
from all muslim countries I'm a secret muslim

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
and I hate blowing brown people

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
even if he did

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
pull everybody back he'd assign you to the attorney general's office

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
so you could go raid dispensaries

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
there's always work for a

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
hypocritical politician to assign

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
people who know how to kill people

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
what was the mood on base

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
everyone was just

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
disappointed distraught like just thought it was

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
the worst thing that could happen to our country

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
that he didn't really love America

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
saying Obama that's one letter away from

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Osama like and really meaning it

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
his middle name is Saddam

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
who's saying not today

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
same shit

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
we don't want to think that about our military

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I want to think of them and police as like

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
people who are so close to the action

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
that they know the nuts and bolts that there would be

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
a culture shock and a conversation with them

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
and the politics would be different but it would be because

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
of real things

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
it wouldn't be because of

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
hypnotism

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
for somebody who actually has to be the one

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
whose hand is on the lever

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
finger on the trigger

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I would expect them

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I would grant them the right to be

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
so hardcore right wing

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
because of their real basic

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
like fundamental philosophy

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and the risks that they take and stuff

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
but it's disappointing to hear that it's more like

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
as in the trailer park so in the military

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
they watch Fox News

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
in the

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
where you eat

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
it's almost like that makes the job separate

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
from the ideology that it's like

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
well the job is to have to deal with the

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
repercussions of how we think

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
but we don't

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
they're just thinking the same shit

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
you have to think that way to

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
be happy doing that right

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I'm trying to bounce that because

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I don't get it like I feel like

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
when I'm a soldier and Obama gets elected I'm like

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
that dude's gonna blow up shit like nobody's business

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
he's a democrat

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I think you just barely touched on it

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
maybe but like the whole calling

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Kaepernick kneeling for the flag

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
national anthem and shit like that

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
people are like he hates the troops

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
but it's

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
more like why does

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
disagreeing with

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
certain things in America

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
has a trend for standing for

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
mean that you don't appreciate the people

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
that go

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
and fight for the things that you do happen to stand for

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
exactly

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
it doesn't

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
you know what I'm saying

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and you know there's liberal

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
nerds in the military and there's

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
all different stripes in the military

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
there's definitely that mainstream right wing

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
go kill muslims culture but

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I don't want to shit all over everyone

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I met other nerds there and other

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
bright people that thought it wouldn't work

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
that's the conflict that we're in, that's the last thing we want to do

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
but that is the thing

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
that also gets taken advantage of

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
we developed this phrase support our troops

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
like we

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
we're like because we figured out

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
that like oh who the hell

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
can't support our troops, what are you a monster

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
you're talking about young men and women

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
risking their lives for our country but it was like

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
if it wasn't support our troops

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
it would be support the war

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
and it's easy to not support a war

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
it's impossible to not support the troops

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and so that's an abusable ideology

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
it's like

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
at stateside when we get reminded

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
of the fact that

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
like oh in Vietnam and then these poor kids

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
came home and we spit on them because we confused

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
them with the people that sent them there

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
we're never going to make that mistake again

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
but that growth on our part

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
was absolutely abused by a war machine

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
that told us yeah don't do that

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
anymore ever again and no news coverage

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
and blah blah blah support our troops and it was like

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
it was used for fucked up

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
purposes and like so we sit over

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
here and we go like I don't even know what to fucking

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
like how to treat veterans

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
you know it's like except to say and then you get this

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
like empire where we just go like well I'm

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
liberal so I want these guys who lost their

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
arms and legs to be taken care of

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I want them to have a better

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
armor on their Humvees when they're patrolling

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
the areas we like you kind of like I'm a liberal

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
what?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
like yeah alright okay

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
how do you guys feel about porn when you're not

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
in Afghanistan you like

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Riley

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
here's maybe a little too intimate a question

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
to ask you but

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
are you a waxer

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
a shaver how do you do

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
I know where this is going

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I personally shave

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
but I do plan on getting like laser hair

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
removal at some point now Riley do you know

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
that you don't need to choose between price and quality

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
to get an amazing affordable shave

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
if you go to Dollar Shave Club.com

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
slash Harmontown you'll get

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000

they'll actually come over and shave you

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000

seriously I have no reason to deal with the

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
drugstore hassle and the battle

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and battle the locked up razor

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000

and I've never seen fucking

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Jeff I agree it's insane that we've

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
created a dichotomy between

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
quality and price

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
especially with shaving

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
equipment like why

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
why can't the top notch

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
shaving accoutrement

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
also be the cheapest

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
are you saying that I should simply

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I should simply go to Dollar Shave Club

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
dot com slash Harmontown

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
and pick a razor that works for me

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
from their lineup of amazing

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
blades Jeff I can't control you

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
it sounds like

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
it sounds like you're trying to

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
tell me what to do I can only

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't want to be told what to do

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
like our great guests and I can only share my

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
experience with you Riley

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Reed's done 437 movies and doesn't

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
have AIDS that says

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
no one prop 60 to me

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
the cook brothers

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
say 11 months

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
and out and I'd like to use my GI bill

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
that says vote Democrat to me

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
but don't be fooled

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
and think that they're not also a hawks

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
and all I can

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
tell you from my experience is that I

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
get a first class shave when I use

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
the executive blade

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
you have a beard you have a full beard

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
this is all built on

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
lies my brother actually

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
just ran out of his Dollar Shave Club

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
razors this morning hence

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
and he's a veteran

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
so go to Dollar Shave Club

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
dot com slash Harmontown

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
and support our troops

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
even the lapsed ones

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I mean as far as I

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
as far as I'm led to believe Dan

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
if it falls this liberal claptrap

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
is to be believed

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
that I can look and smell

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
like a million bucks

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
without paying for it

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
that seems to, that's Obama's America

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
and in the interest of equal times

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
maybe you're a Republican so think of it this way

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
like when you do grab

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
your lover by the pussy

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
don't you want it to be

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
a smooth

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
frictionless

don't just flock the Dollar Shave Club

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
don't associate them with my liberal

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
agenda is what I'm saying

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
this country may need

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
walls around it we may need

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
an orange rotting pumpkin

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
for a president

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000

I just feel so dirty right now

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000

look and smell like a million dollars

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000

that brings up anal bleaching

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
like

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
laser scrapers

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
he's a guy

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
he's a skincare guy

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
she's got very wonderful soft skin

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
like

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
a fake doctor

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
but

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
and at one point

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
he told her

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
we do anal

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I think and then he looked at her butthole

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
he's like you don't need it

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
good for her

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
good for you

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
do you

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
yeah

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
more important to me than a bright white butthole

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I once had one guy

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
trying to tell my ethnicity by the color

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
of my asshole

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
he's like quarter Cherokee

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and you're like wriggling

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
like oh

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
tell more

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
oh my god don't go out tomorrow night

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
and then he falls over and there's a poison dart in his back

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
you can say those records are still

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I don't do

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
any alteration to my body at all

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
so I don't put fake nails on

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I don't dye my hair

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I don't do anal bleaching

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
it's certainly your

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
you need to shave once in a while

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
yeah I mean like I shave my legs

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
but how much are you paying for your razor

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
what about lifestyle, diet, exercise

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
drinking, drugs

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
do you have do's and don'ts

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
and are there sacrifices you make to maintain your

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
yeah I mean I definitely

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I used to like to skateboard

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and stuff like that and I don't do that anymore

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
because you can just scrape a knee

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
yeah exactly if I have a scrape on my knee

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
but what about

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
are you like

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
do you have to push

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
the limits of your endurance daily

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
to like maintain a

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
no I don't work out

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
or anything

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I'm not being glib but part of your work

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
is exercise

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I feel like I hit that daily heart rate

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
thing that I'm supposed to do

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
with my job

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and I like to do a lot of the work

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I don't like to just leave it up to the guy

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
so you know I like to perform up to my

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
standard and my quality of what I think

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
as most women do

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
yeah I mean and also I don't like to play dead

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
starfish so I definitely

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
dead starfish

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
do you have like parts of your body

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
insured because I feel like

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
if I made my living off of

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
being attractive and being appealing

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
for other people to watch me

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
have sex I would get my best parts

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
insured I don't

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I've heard of like some people do like

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Kieran Lee who is like you know

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
big time browsers performer

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
has like a million dollar insurance policy

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
on his penis

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
his penis is insured with Lloyds of London

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
they used to say that

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
about like what's your name for that

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
there was an entertainment tonight hostess

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
or something like her legs are insured

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Lloyds of London

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
didn't she have an insurance thing

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I mean is that me yeah I guess like

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
okay

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
but you could do that with anything

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
that's like kind of like just a bad version

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
of playing the stock market like I could just say

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm gonna insure this snail with Lloyds of London

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and then if it dies

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
and then stop on it and collect

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
the god damn money

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
and they're like yeah we'll cover that for 60 dollars

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
a minute until you stop on it

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
and we'll pay you 120

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and there's a two minute

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
moratorium on snail stomping

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
and

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I mean

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I don't like insurance I think

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
insurance is like

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Dino says that dessert is where

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
western society like where we peaked

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
you knew once we started inventing food

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
that we were just like no I'm not hungry

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
but just a little more food

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
just for the taste

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and I'm saying

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
as for capitalism insurance is the

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
the invention of the idea that

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
like oh hey man

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
nice pants

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
be ashamed if something happened to them

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
are you

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
mean extortion

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
well no I'm not gonna do it

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I'm just betting it'll happen

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I'm almost certain I heard this exact sentence on

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
BangBus

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I'll never forget getting an envelope

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
when Christopher Reeve

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
was still alive and it was a

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
the envelope was from an insurance company

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
and it was identical

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
to a fucking like

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
extortion racket because it was a picture

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
of post accident Christopher Reeve

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
fell off a horse like injured his neck

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
it's like you're 25 I don't know

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Superman I know you

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
there's been a lot of super super men

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
so he didn't have horse insurance

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
that's the problem

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
so it's a picture of a visibly

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
affected

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Christopher Reeve like he's like

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
going like this and there's a quote

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
next to the photo that I'm getting in the mail

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and it says don't let what happened to me happen to you

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
like what

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
how is this not a note from a fucking criminal

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
how is this

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
not identical how is this not against the law

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
don't you're threatening me

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
don't let what

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
what that's what

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
insurance is it goes it's a beautiful house

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
beautiful family be ashamed of something happened

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
can I have $60

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
but

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
they don't even the mafia is more honest

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
because what they're saying is we'll do it

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
we'll destroy your house

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
and your family give us $60

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
you just

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
guaranteed it won't happen that's more

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
honest exchange of goods and services

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
than insurance which is saying

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
like oh I don't know something might happen in your house

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
and you're like yeah something might for real

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
like a mafia guy might extort me or

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
a tornado might happen and they're like yeah all kinds of things

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
$60 please and then the tornado happens

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
and then they send a guy that's like tornado

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I don't know

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
looks to me like you're an alcoholic maybe had

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
a rough night

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
the Tasmanian devil came through here

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
and we only

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
insured you against tornadoes

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
they're spelled the same

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
but they're pronounced different

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
yeah read the fine

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
umlauts

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
insurance isn't a government

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
agency which is why you know that

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
their business isn't making sure

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
that your cancer your tornado your flood

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
won't pay out

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
they're a business

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
that's what you know about them from the get go

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
the weird thing is that then they're all

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
tied into the government because a guy with a gun

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
can pull you over and demand to see their

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
paperwork

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and if you're reaching for the glove box in the wrong way

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
and you're in the wrong color

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
welcome to the angry grandpa portion of the show

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I just like

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I like to round up a group of soldiers and porn stars

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I just shake my cane

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
guardians of

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
vitality and

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
violence

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
lend me your power

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I guess everybody go home and watch Westworld

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
and

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
to do the highlights of the debates I saw him

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
it's just more of him fucking

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
loudmouth in it and like interrupting her

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
and he's like he spends the whole

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
time going can I tell you you let her go a minute

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
you let her go a whole minute it's like an eight

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
year old and I don't even care

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I hate all politicians and I hate government

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
but I mean

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I was traveling today

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I flew home and so I was in a car

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
and I recorded the

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
debate I'll watch it later maybe

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
and the only time I've ever truly loved

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Twitter was today because all my funny friends were being

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
hilarious but Megan Gans

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
is a writer and that works on community

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
she wrote something it wasn't even a joke she just

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
she just wrote crying

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
you act professional

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
and play by the rules and you get interrupted

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
by men and that to me says

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
the fucking hole

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
he kept talking about how she gets to interrupt him

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
and all this stuff it was like you can't

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
like that was my biggest fear is that

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
what she's working against is you can't

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
you can't compete with him without looking

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
dumber than you are

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
because who would

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
she didn't get to choose

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
her opponent

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
it's like

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I almost went to

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
six hours after she wins two things are

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
going to happen the Republican Party is going to

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
start

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
maligning her

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
by maligning him

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
the Republican Party is already

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
disavowed him but they're going to

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
six hours after her inauguration or election

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
they're going to start saying

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
there's a woman in the White House

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and the only reason is because she

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
it was a one woman race

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
she went up against the impotent man

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
she went up against a weird orange guy

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
from a Doritos commercial

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
like they're going to be like who wasn't even a fair election

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
hey Lee

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I can't paddle ten is it very Trump

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I know they hate Hillary probably right

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
what's super cool though is that at the same time

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
it's in Southern California so like

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I can't paddle

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
the debate

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
that went on a couple weeks ago

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
right now I just like scan ID's

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
at the gate and I'm like you can come on

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
you're brown you can't

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
you're brown you can't because that's my job

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
but uh Jesus Christ

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
fucking so all these people came

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
through with like their Trump stickers

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
and their Trump hats and they were like yeah

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Trump is stomping Hillary in the bait tonight

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
and they were like yeah that he is

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
but uh like once you

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
once you leave Camp Pendleton and you like

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
you go 30 minutes north

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
or even down to like the gas lamp in San Diego

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
and stuff suddenly you start seeing all these like

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Priuses with Bernie stickers

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
which is that that was our dude

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
the sex industry

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
needs regulation

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
but it can be self-regulated

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
they're doing fine

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000

he had to run into the yard

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
folding his butt

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
saying what about my

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
scale production surgery

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
that I had look it up

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
there's a story about

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Donald Trump getting scale production surgery

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
based on the advice

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
of his wife Marla Mables

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
and then getting so mad at how much

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
it was that he

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
he per assaulted her

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
okay

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
when you talk about grabbing by the pussy

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I got a feeling you haven't touched a lot of pussy

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I don't think that your dick works

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
and I don't want

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
to disparage people whose dicks don't work

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
because

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I don't want to live in a society based on sexual acumen

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I'd like to leave it to the professionals

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
and watch them and find a girl

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
to be cool enough to just

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
be content with a giant fat walrus

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
running on top of her

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
