Zac McKeever up there in the booth, how's it going, man? Give it up for Zach, the man with the...\n\n00:47.400 --> 00:55.400\nThe guy who makes it sound good, and if it sounds not good, it's not Zach's fault. Because Zach rules.\n\n00:55.400 --> 01:10.400\nWhat's today's date? The 19th.\n\n01:10.400 --> 01:24.400\nFrom nearby downtown, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session. Please give it up for the hardest working game master in town, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:24.400 --> 01:44.400\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:44.400 --> 01:54.400\nTwo to the three to the four.\n\n01:54.400 --> 02:02.400\nI was still on four.

Everybody's mama needs me to fuck them.\n\n02:50.400 --> 02:55.400\nOne to the ten. Fuck your mama.\n\n02:55.400 --> 03:03.400\nAll right. I was gonna say flamin. I was like, it's gonna get gross and kind of phone that one in there. And I got to be honest with you.\n\n03:03.400 --> 03:11.400\nYeah. Well, I, you know, but you couldn't see I was trying not to. Don't you? And let's make the theme of the show gratitude because it's Thanksgiving.\n\n03:11.400 --> 03:21.400\nAren't you thankful to me? You could see on my face. He's not enjoying this. And then you think like it's probably why he's do is it's not very entertaining.\n\n03:21.400 --> 03:28.400\nBut then the last thought should be, yeah, but look at him go. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him.\n\n03:28.400 --> 03:35.400\nThat sense of obligation on his face. I'm so fortunate to have a guy in his life that thinks he owes me something.\n\n03:35.400 --> 03:40.400\nYou kind of phoned in the baby kicky dance too. It was like it was kind of a half baby kicky.\n\n03:40.400 --> 03:52.400\nYeah. I honestly, I gotta be honest. I'm not in a bad mood or anything. I'm a little I'm a little exhausted because we just finished season three of Harmon Quest.\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:58.400\nOh, yeah. Spencer. Spencer.\n\n03:58.400 --> 04:11.400\nTag treasure season. Yeah. We got no treasure. No, you got so we got a little treasure. I think I got some treasure. This is going to be a fucking awesome season because Spencer fucking did all the hard work and all we did was just goof off.\n\n04:11.400 --> 04:16.400\nThe guests were amazing. It's going to be good. Have you been moved backward?\n\n04:16.400 --> 04:21.400\nI've been every week. I've been withdrawing one inch.\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:23.400\nAre you trying to get out of the show?\n\n04:23.400 --> 04:32.400\nAre you trying to escape one of these days? So just like I'll I'll be announced and I'll just walk in and then walk out and take my place.\n\n04:32.400 --> 04:35.400\nYeah, you're further afield than you normally are.\n\n04:35.400 --> 04:41.400\nYeah. Yeah. You want me to upstage myself?\n\n04:41.400 --> 04:48.400\nNo, we don't we don't we don't need nothing from nobody. But we're just yeah, I'm sure there's a sure there's a rhyme to the reason.\n\n04:48.400 --> 05:05.400\nI'm sure. And a reason for the season. I'm sure the president's committed treason. I'm sure I'm sure diseases cause lesions.\n\n05:05.400 --> 05:14.400\nThanksgiving can't be beat. Fuck your mama and her feet. Put the turkey on a plate. Indians pilgrims hate.\n\n05:14.400 --> 05:23.400\nPut it aside. Sit down at a table. Make it wide. Eat the gravy. Wave wavy.\n\n05:23.400 --> 05:32.400\nYeah. I mean, I'm like you were loose before the beat came on. You were you were you were spitting fire before that beat came on.\n\n05:32.400 --> 05:38.400\nYeah. Well, the beat listen to that beat. It's like a little like a Zach. Just don't do it right now. But Zach, you got the beat.\n\n05:38.400 --> 05:47.400\nAll right. Well, don't call my bluff with the beat. But I'm saying Zach, keep one in the chamber. So if I point at you with them, I'm ready to go.\n\n05:47.400 --> 05:56.400\nI was a little exhausted. I saw you at the drawing room today. I went in there to get my work done for Rick and Morty for the for before we.\n\n05:56.400 --> 06:03.400\nYeah. And for people that think that Dan doesn't work hard, he sat at the drawing room with James, whatever his name is, one of the writers from the show.\n\n06:03.400 --> 06:13.400\nAnd you guys sat down there and Dan put like his pantomime, like thinking glasses on and sat down there and completely like worked on a script.\n\n06:13.400 --> 06:19.400\nLike you actually were doing hard Rick and Morty work there. Yeah, at a bar.\n\n06:19.400 --> 06:25.400\nI just had a little I just had a little loose end to tie up. So you know, one of the scripts started like to fix it a little bit.\n\n06:25.400 --> 06:39.400\nYeah, you know, it wasn't that it wasn't so I mean, I don't I actually experienced a great deal of I was like, oh, shit, I only had one drink and then and then the and then I opened the laptop and I was like, I'm so like, I shouldn't do this.\n\n06:39.400 --> 06:44.400\nThis is unprofessional. I was kind of like tired.\n\n06:44.400 --> 06:57.400\nAnd then and then I and then I finished up and I had a couple more drinks. Cody came by and then I went home and I went to bed and I woke up like an hour ago and and I'm just a little tired.\n\n06:57.400 --> 07:03.400\nAnd you've only got 65 more episodes to go. Yeah.\n\n07:03.400 --> 07:05.400\nWhat are we grateful for?\n\n07:05.400 --> 07:17.400\nI got my health. I got my career. I got Cody. I got you got your new video game that you spend more time with than anybody else.\n\n07:17.400 --> 07:21.400\nI got I got No Man's Sky is what you're referring to.\n\n07:21.400 --> 07:35.400\nI mean, I've got mixed feelings. You know, I'm enjoying playing No Man's Sky right now. I'm concerned that I'm going to stop enjoying it. But that doesn't seem like a fair thing to not enjoy about a game.\n\n07:35.400 --> 07:48.400\nThat's not fair to the game. You can't call that a negative thing. I'm enjoying it right now. I keep playing it. But I looked ahead as it were. I kind of like, I typed in No Man's Sky Automation.\n\n07:48.400 --> 07:55.400\nBecause I was like, are they very, what am I doing all this crap for? I'm never going to get get to watch it do itself.\n\n07:55.400 --> 08:08.400\nAnd the answer is no, no, you're going to run around collecting minerals forever. You're never going to get to just like make a machine that feeds into another machine and then puts it all into a chest.\n\n08:08.400 --> 08:11.400\nI want to play Minecraft again.\n\n08:11.400 --> 08:21.400\nIt sounds like fancy Minecraft. It's Minecraft in space. It's like it's ticking a lot of boxes that should excite me a lot. It does excite me a lot. It's Minecraft in space.\n\n08:21.400 --> 08:39.400\nI want when is somebody going to understand I just want a game where you can you just go into an infinite universe and you you go around and you you you mine resources and then you you you you you craft stuff and then you you store it in in\n\n08:39.400 --> 08:49.400\nin chests. Like what? Why is that game 15 years old now? How come nobody can replicate it? I play all these kind of like Minecraft ask games.\n\n08:49.400 --> 08:55.400\nAnd they just they don't compare. I don't get it.\n\n08:55.400 --> 08:57.400\nDo you miss your Minecraft?\n\n08:57.400 --> 09:06.400\nI got I still know where it is. I can find it. I get a little tired of it after a while. I'll take like six months off of it. But then I'll end up going back to it.\n\n09:06.400 --> 09:13.400\nInitially. It's weird to me. I don't know. Like a relationship. Yeah.\n\n09:13.400 --> 09:15.400\nAll right. Well, so are you okay?\n\n09:15.400 --> 09:22.400\nThey are just tired. You just you're a little sleepy right now. You didn't answer that before you asked. I'm trying to dig a little deeper right now.\n\n09:22.400 --> 09:23.400\nOh, okay.\n\n09:23.400 --> 09:28.400\nWell, we don't have to do the show if you don't want. I don't know.\n\n09:28.400 --> 09:37.400\nA lot of times when people ask, are you okay like that? They mean you're not okay or something like like so. I'm asking, is there something on your mind?\n\n09:37.400 --> 09:39.400\nOr is it simply just fatigue?\n\n09:39.400 --> 09:47.400\nYeah, I couldn't have been more transparent forthcoming with that information. I led with it at the risk of bringing the entire audience down.\n\n09:47.400 --> 09:58.400\nThese people that came out here paid good money, risked robbery on the sidewalk. And so I tried to be honest. That's all I have is my truth.\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:04.400\nSo I'm like, yeah, I'm a little tired, a little exhausted. You know, I don't want to say that I don't feel like being here.\n\n10:04.400 --> 10:06.400\nThat would be a rude thing to say to people that felt like being here.\n\n10:06.400 --> 10:13.400\nWell, we have a surprise for the audience tonight because tonight is it too early to announce what we're going to do for the finale of the show?\n\n10:13.400 --> 10:18.400\nNo, I think, you know, we got to win them back. We're going to get these people.\n\n10:18.400 --> 10:23.400\nBecause I was in the mood to play some D&D for all y'all.\n\n10:23.400 --> 10:31.400\nBut for the first time because Spencer's also exhausted and rightfully so from doing Harmon Quest, he didn't bring any of his materials.\n\n10:31.400 --> 10:37.400\nSo tonight Dan is going to be Dungeon Master and Spencer and I are going to play D&D together.\n\n10:37.400 --> 10:43.400\nOkay.\n\n10:43.400 --> 10:46.400\nDo you think you got what it takes right now to be a Dungeon Master?\n\n10:46.400 --> 10:51.400\nYeah. Let's do it now.\n\n10:51.400 --> 10:53.400\nThis is not enough.\n\n10:53.400 --> 11:03.400\nOh shit.\n\n11:03.400 --> 11:06.400\nWhere's Spencer theme?\n\n11:06.400 --> 11:09.400\nI just wanted to sit down.\n\n11:09.400 --> 11:12.400\nIs this how you usually keep the microphone?\n\n11:12.400 --> 11:15.400\nOh yeah.\n\n11:15.400 --> 11:17.400\nWhat do you mean?\n\n11:17.400 --> 11:20.400\nAre you taller than me?\n\n11:20.400 --> 11:23.400\nI'm a hunter.\n\n11:23.400 --> 11:28.400\nI'm kind of doing that, yeah.\n\n11:28.400 --> 11:30.400\nDon't you ever want it to be a little lower?\n\n11:30.400 --> 11:34.400\nI do. That's why I bend it down lower.\n\n11:34.400 --> 11:36.400\nRight.\n\n11:36.400 --> 11:37.400\nRight?\n\n11:37.400 --> 11:39.400\nPoor little thing.\n\n11:39.400 --> 11:41.400\nNo, no.\n\n11:41.400 --> 11:44.400\nThis is a silly way to have a mic. It's blocking half your face.\n\n11:44.400 --> 11:47.400\nThat's what I like about it.\n\n11:47.400 --> 11:50.400\nYou know what I got going on back there most of the time?\n\n11:50.400 --> 11:51.400\nHard on?\n\n11:51.400 --> 11:52.400\nAnts.\n\n11:52.400 --> 11:53.400\nAIDS.\n\n11:53.400 --> 11:54.400\nAnts.\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:56.400\nAnts.\n\n11:56.400 --> 12:02.400\nYou see how a little bit of AIDS back there.\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:04.400\nSpencer, what are you grateful for?\n\n12:04.400 --> 12:11.400\nOh, I'm grateful for friends and fun and food.\n\n12:11.400 --> 12:12.400\nOh, food.\n\n12:12.400 --> 12:14.400\nOh man, you guys, holy shit.\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:16.400\nWe were in New York.\n\n12:16.400 --> 12:19.400\nI got this banana pudding at this place called Magnolia Bakery.\n\n12:19.400 --> 12:20.400\nIt was so good.\n\n12:20.400 --> 12:21.400\nI went back.\n\n12:21.400 --> 12:23.400\nI bought two more banana puddings.\n\n12:23.400 --> 12:24.400\nIt was so good.\n\n12:24.400 --> 12:26.400\nI went back home.\n\n12:26.400 --> 12:29.400\nThere was a Magnolia Bakery in L.A.\n\n12:29.400 --> 12:32.400\nI went back and bought some more.\n\n12:32.400 --> 12:35.400\nIt was so good.\n\n12:35.400 --> 12:39.400\nAll of the dressing rooms at the Harmon Quest shoot,\n\n12:39.400 --> 12:41.400\nthere was a note on our table that said,\n\n12:41.400 --> 12:43.400\nlook in the fridge.\n\n12:43.400 --> 12:44.400\nYeah.\n\n12:44.400 --> 12:46.400\nAnd there was two banana puddings,\n\n12:46.400 --> 12:48.400\none for me, one for church.\n\n12:48.400 --> 12:50.400\nMaybe there was two in every fridge.\n\n12:50.400 --> 12:52.400\nAnd they were all for Jeff and Church.\n\n12:52.400 --> 12:55.400\nAnd it said, this banana pudding is from Spencer.\n\n12:55.400 --> 12:57.400\nIt was very sweet of you.\n\n12:57.400 --> 12:59.400\nAnd that shit was good.\n\n12:59.400 --> 13:01.400\nIt's so good.\n\n13:01.400 --> 13:05.400\nAnd you can make it yourself because I have the recipe.\n\n13:05.400 --> 13:07.400\nNext time in town,\n\n13:07.400 --> 13:10.400\nI want you to bring enough banana pudding for everybody.\n\n13:10.400 --> 13:11.400\nAll right.\n\n13:11.400 --> 13:13.400\nThat's easy enough.\n\n13:13.400 --> 13:14.400\nAll right.\n\n13:14.400 --> 13:18.400\nWhat kind of characters are you interested in portraying today, gentlemen?\n\n13:18.400 --> 13:20.400\nWhat does Jeff want?\n\n13:20.400 --> 13:22.400\nYou're the game master, Dan.\n\n13:22.400 --> 13:24.400\nWhat kind of realm do you want to put us in?\n\n13:24.400 --> 13:27.400\nThe fantasy realm, like all Pathfinder D&D?\n\n13:27.400 --> 13:28.400\nYes.\n\n13:28.400 --> 13:29.400\nOkay.\n\n13:29.400 --> 13:32.400\nAnd yeah, Spencer, what kind of class?\n\n13:32.400 --> 13:34.400\nDo you want dice?\n\n13:34.400 --> 13:35.400\nIt's going to freestyle.\n\n13:35.400 --> 13:37.400\nI could use a couple of dice.\n\n13:37.400 --> 13:39.400\nDid anybody bring any dice, by the way?\n\n13:39.400 --> 13:40.400\nNo.\n\n13:40.400 --> 13:42.400\nSee, in the old days, our fans all had dice.\n\n13:42.400 --> 13:43.400\nIn the old days.\n\n13:43.400 --> 13:44.400\nYeah.\n\n13:44.400 --> 13:47.400\nI mean, I'll just roll them in my mind.\n\n13:47.400 --> 13:49.400\nThat's fair.\n\n13:49.400 --> 13:53.400\nIt's my favorite James Taylor song.\n\n13:53.400 --> 13:56.400\nI'll be rolling in my mind.\n\n13:56.400 --> 13:58.400\nThat's Billy Ocean.\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:02.400\nYou've got dice that I'm rolling,\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:05.400\nrolling in my mind.\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:08.400\n20 sides of booty.\n\n14:08.400 --> 14:11.400\n20 sides of booty.\n\n14:11.400 --> 14:13.400\n20 sides of booty?\n\n14:13.400 --> 14:14.400\nYep.\n\n14:14.400 --> 14:16.400\nOh, you got dice?\n\n14:16.400 --> 14:17.400\nFor real?\n\n14:17.400 --> 14:19.400\nBring them up, bring them up, sir.\n\n14:19.400 --> 14:21.400\nNow we're talking.\n\n14:21.400 --> 14:23.400\nOh, shit.\n\n14:23.400 --> 14:25.400\nOh, thank you, sir.\n\n14:25.400 --> 14:26.400\nWhat's your name?\n\n14:26.400 --> 14:27.400\nGreg.\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:28.400\nGreg, everybody.\n\n14:28.400 --> 14:30.400\nOh, shit.\n\n14:30.400 --> 14:32.400\nGreg, have a seat for a moment, Greg.\n\n14:32.400 --> 14:34.400\nLet's meet you for a moment.\n\n14:34.400 --> 14:37.400\nAre you a longtime Harmontown goat?\n\n14:37.400 --> 14:39.400\nDo you come here a lot?\n\n14:39.400 --> 14:41.400\nNo, this is my first time here.\n\n14:41.400 --> 14:42.400\nYour first time here?\n\n14:42.400 --> 14:43.400\nOh, shit.\n\n14:43.400 --> 14:45.400\nNot my first Harmontown, though.\n\n14:45.400 --> 14:48.400\nAnd you had the prescience to bring a sack full of dice?\n\n14:48.400 --> 14:50.400\nIt's in my backpack.\n\n14:50.400 --> 14:51.400\nReally?\n\n14:51.400 --> 14:52.400\nFantastic.\n\n14:52.400 --> 14:54.400\nAre you a game master or just a game player?\n\n14:54.400 --> 14:55.400\nJust a game player.\n\n14:55.400 --> 14:57.400\nWhat do you play?\n\n14:57.400 --> 14:58.400\nMostly Pathfinder.\n\n14:58.400 --> 15:01.400\nWe just started a fifth edition game with some of my friends,\n\n15:01.400 --> 15:05.400\nand I'm going to join a Wednesday game coming up next week.\n\n15:05.400 --> 15:06.400\nDamn.\n\n15:06.400 --> 15:07.400\nIt's

you're kind of casing the jail cell with your thief casing instincts,\n\n20:46.400 --> 20:54.400\nyou see at the bottom of every other one of the bars is a tiny rune.\n\n20:54.400 --> 20:57.400\nAt the bottom of these bars are runes.\n\n20:57.400 --> 21:00.400\nThis thief guy says that.\n\n21:00.400 --> 21:06.400\nCan I use my knowledge of magics to determine if they're magical runes?\n\n21:06.400 --> 21:09.400\nWaving your arms in a magical manner.\n\n21:09.400 --> 21:12.400\nYou, uh, you, you, you bring...\n\n21:12.400 --> 21:17.400\nOh man, you, you, you, you, you detect so much.\n\n21:17.400 --> 21:25.400\nThese are standard runes from the magic guild of the, of the, the, the, the lords over this realm's magic activities.\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:29.400\nThey're basically like, uh, just sort of containment runes.\n\n21:29.400 --> 21:35.400\nSo basically like this is a jail cell for, you know, people, whether they're magic or not.\n\n21:35.400 --> 21:36.400\nIt's pretty standard runes.\n\n21:36.400 --> 21:42.400\nLike you, if you were to try to turn invisible in here, it would, it would, it would either not let you\n\n21:42.400 --> 21:47.400\nor it would alert somebody or like maybe like, um, in a pool when you try to pee.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:50.400\nAnd it, it would, it would like stain you.\n\n21:50.400 --> 21:51.400\nYeah.\n\n21:51.400 --> 21:55.400\nYou just, all you know is that it's secure, there's security runes.\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:56.400\nThat's no good.\n\n21:56.400 --> 21:59.400\nYou guys, you guys saw this cleric, he's like...\n\n21:59.400 --> 22:02.400\nHe's like, like, scrutinizing these runes.\n\n22:02.400 --> 22:04.400\nOh man, what are you doing?\n\n22:04.400 --> 22:07.400\nI'm, uh, we can't use magic to get out of here, I think.\n\n22:07.400 --> 22:10.400\nOr if we do, it'll alert the guards.\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:11.400\nOkay.\n\n22:11.400 --> 22:12.400\nI can try, though.\n\n22:12.400 --> 22:16.400\nWell, what if, uh, what do these locks look like?\n\n22:16.400 --> 22:17.400\nSorry, what?\n\n22:17.400 --> 22:20.400\nWhat do the locks look like on the, on the bar, on the door?\n\n22:20.400 --> 22:21.400\nOh man.\n\n22:21.400 --> 22:22.400\nYou look like a thief.\n\n22:22.400 --> 22:23.400\nYou can pick a lock, right?\n\n22:23.400 --> 22:24.400\nI've seen some locks.\n\n22:24.400 --> 22:29.400\nThe locks look like nothing to you because they lock from the other side.\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:30.400\nDamn.\n\n22:30.400 --> 22:31.400\nClever.\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:32.400\nYeah.\n\n22:32.400 --> 22:41.400\nUh,

23:11.400\nHe's like, he's got fox pelts all over his shoulders.\n\n23:11.400 --> 23:16.400\nUm, he's got a wooden crown, uh, that's blood stained.\n\n23:16.400 --> 23:18.400\nUh, he's wearing

--> 24:56.400\nUh, we don't have to tell you that.\n\n24:56.400 --> 24:59.400\nIf you don't know where the squid ink is, then you're an outsider.\n\n24:59.400 --> 25:03.400\nIf you're asking about squid ink and you're an outsider, that means you're an investigator.\n\n25:03.400 --> 25:06.400\nSitopolis doesn't like being investigated for its squid ink.\n\n25:06.400 --> 25:09.400\nI can't believe I'm talking about this so much.\n\n25:09.400 --> 25:14.400\nAnd he, he starts as he's saying that he reaches for, in a, in a pouch and he pulls out.\n\n25:14.400 --> 25:18.400\nAnd he, you, you guys see that there's this little tiny creature, he pulls out of a pouch.\n\n25:18.400 --> 25:22.400\nIt looks very squid like and he squeezes it.\n\n25:22.400 --> 25:27.400\nUm, and you all need to save for, uh, uh, mental magic.\n\n25:27.400 --> 25:28.400\nOh no.\n\n25:28.400 --> 25:29.400\nOkay.\n\n25:29.400 --> 25:30.400\nAll right.\n\n25:30.400 --> 25:31.400\nOkay.\n\n25:31.400 -->

25:42.560\nmake you dodge to the side and hold your breath.\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:48.240\nThis isn't your first time at the gas attack rodeo.\n\n25:48.240 --> 25:52.960\nBut Tom, Tom, Tom, and shit.\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:53.600\nWhat was it?\n\n25:53.600 --> 25:54.880\nLars.\n\n25:54.880 --> 26:00.360\nBoth of you guys inhale this weird, greasy, inky cloud of gas.\n\n26:00.360 --> 26:05.200\nYour minds are like, you can't control your thoughts anymore.\n\n26:05.200 --> 26:08.560\nYou start thinking weird shit about it.\n\n26:08.560 --> 26:10.800\nYou see an image of a ship.\n\n26:10.800 --> 26:16.560\nYou see a mountain with a church on top of it.\n\n26:16.560 --> 26:20.720\nThen you see inside the church ostensibly,\n\n26:20.720 --> 26:22.520\nalthough you don't know.\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:25.120\nYou're just using the kind of Eisenstein principles\n\n26:25.120 --> 26:27.280\nof establishing shots from your memories.\n\n26:27.280 --> 26:29.480\nBut it could be the inside of a completely different church.\n\n26:29.480 --> 26:32.520\nBut you saw a church, and now you're\n\n26:32.520 --> 26:35.560\nseeing the inside of a church, and there's a flash image.\n\n26:35.560 --> 26:38.400\nAnd you see blood filling the church.\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:41.760\nAnd you see this judge doom at the front of it, laughing.\n\n26:41.760 --> 26:47.680\nAnd then you black out relative to you, Tracebot.\n\n26:47.680 --> 26:50.880\nThese guys just fall down, and they're unconscious.\n\n26:50.880 --> 26:54.400\nAnd then they don't wake up for at least an hour.\n\n26:54.400 --> 26:58.560\nSo if there's things you want to do while they're asleep.\n\n26:58.560 --> 27:00.200\nSo what's the judge doing then?\n\n27:00.200 --> 27:01.160\nIs he still hanging out?\n\n27:01.160 --> 27:02.320\nHe walks away.\n\n27:02.320 --> 27:03.920\nI mean, you know what?\n\n27:03.920 --> 27:08.560\nI should, I mean, he, OK.\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:09.240\nHe can.\n\n27:09.240 --> 27:13.880\nWell, now, he notices that it doesn't affect you,\n\n27:13.880 --> 27:15.200\nthat it didn't take with you.\n\n27:15.200 --> 27:16.120\nI'm holding my breath.\n\n27:16.120 --> 27:16.720\nYeah.\n\n27:16.720 --> 27:19.480\nAnd then he's like, he's like, ah, you're not worth it.\n\n27:19.480 --> 27:20.680\nAnd he walks away.\n\n27:20.680 --> 27:22.440\nSorry.\n\n27:22.440 --> 27:25.320\nIt's all right, it's fine.\n\n27:25.320 --> 27:29.320\nGotta go refill this squid now.\n\n27:29.320 --> 27:30.040\nShit, man.\n\n27:30.040 --> 27:34.760\nAnd he walks about 10 feet down a hallway,\n\n27:34.760 --> 27:37.840\nlined with stone, wet stone.\n\n27:37.840 --> 27:40.920\nAnd he goes through what you can hear.\n\n27:40.920 --> 27:42.480\nYou can't see it from here, but you're\n\n27:42.480 --> 27:44.240\nusing your thief casing instincts\n\n27:44.240 --> 27:47.320\nto notice it's probably a very large wooden door\n\n27:47.320 --> 27:49.440\nwith many locks on it.\n\n27:49.440 --> 27:52.000\nAll of them remaining unlocked.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.760\nBut you can just hear the clanging.\n\n27:53.760 --> 27:56.160\nAnd your thief ears are going like,\n\n27:56.160 --> 27:58.000\nthere's a lot of fucking locks on that door.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.240\nAnd I'm trying to count as steps, too, to the distances.\n\n28:01.240 --> 28:09.040\nYou put that door at about 30 feet away from the cell door,\n\n28:09.040 --> 28:15.560\njust around a kind of jagged corner, as if there's like.\n\n28:15.560 --> 28:18.640\nSo all you know is that there's a hallway,\n\n28:18.640 --> 28:21.240\nand then it comes around, and then there's this cell.\n\n28:21.240 --> 28:23.680\nThere's no cells next to it.\n\n28:23.680 --> 28:28.360\nAnd then that hallway, it ends at a dead end,\n\n28:28.360 --> 28:30.520\nright out in front of your cell.\n\n28:30.520 --> 28:32.960\nThere's a table there with candles on it.\n\n28:32.960 --> 28:38.160\nThere's a torch above that, weird redundancy.\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:42.560\nAnd there's some stuff on the table.\n\n28:42.560 --> 28:45.600\nBut is there anything in the cell or anything?\n\n28:45.600 --> 28:47.960\nThe cell has two benches.\n\n28:47.960 --> 28:55.440\nAnd no windows.\n\n28:55.440 --> 28:58.960\nSo I don't have any tools or anything because I'm prison.\n\n28:58.960 --> 28:59.760\nYeah, no.\n\n28:59.760 --> 29:06.120\nYou guys are wearing burlap robes there.\n\n29:06.120 --> 29:07.680\nIt seemed like standard issue.\n\n29:07.680 --> 29:10.200\nBut Lars and I are still asleep for an hour, right?\n\n29:10.200 --> 29:10.800\nYeah.\n\n29:10.800 --> 29:12.640\nSo you did all that to do this.\n\n29:12.640 --> 29:14.600\nI mean, I figure an hour is a long time for a thief.\n\n29:14.600 --> 29:16.680\nSo if there's anything else you want to know, I'm going to pick.\n\n29:16.680 --> 29:20.160\nI can't really try and pick the lock with my hands, I'd assume.\n\n29:20.160 --> 29:21.400\nThat'd be crazy.\n\n29:21.400 --> 29:25.800\nI mean, you can, you know, you try to.\n\n29:25.800 --> 29:29.880\nWell, what if I have we revealed what races we are?\n\n29:29.880 --> 29:33.480\nI'm an orc warrior.\n\n29:33.480 --> 29:34.560\nI'm an elf.\n\n29:34.560 --> 29:39.320\nCan I be a warforged, a robot man?\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:41.720\nOK.\n\n29:41.720 --> 29:42.960\nYou do that.\n\n29:42.960 --> 29:45.320\nHow does this, do I sound like a robot?\n\n29:45.320 --> 29:46.120\nYeah.\n\n29:46.120 --> 29:46.720\nOK.\n\n29:51.720 --> 29:56.600\nYou are a warforge, a crazy, intricate clockwork man\n\n29:56.600 --> 29:59.320\nfrom a strange realm.\n\n29:59.320 --> 30:00.880\nYou're made of metal and things.\n\n30:00.880 --> 30:04.600\nSo you do have powers that other humans don't have,\n\n30:04.600 --> 30:06.000\neven when you're naked.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.520\nCan I try and take my finger off to make it a lot bigger?\n\n30:09.520 --> 30:17.800\nYou do that, and you successfully are functioning,\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:21.160\nbut you're unable to pick this lock with your finger lock.\n\n30:21.160 --> 30:23.240\nBam.\n\n30:23.240 --> 30:26.360\nOnly for the time being, though, it's just a failure\n\n30:26.360 --> 30:27.080\nin that sense.\n\n30:27.080 --> 30:32.360\nThe door immediately, as soon as you start even looking\n\n30:32.360 --> 30:37.200\nat that lock, let alone picking out that door opens again,\n\n30:37.200 --> 30:40.880\nand Judge Doom comes back, and he goes like,\n\n30:40.880 --> 30:41.960\nwhat the hell are you doing?\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:44.520\nI told you the first time, not to fuck with that lock.\n\n30:44.520 --> 30:45.520\nOh, yeah.\n\n30:45.520 --> 30:48.680\nNo, I'm not, yeah.\n\n30:48.680 --> 30:52.040\nI, you got me.\n\n30:52.040 --> 30:54.160\nWhat are you doing with your finger?\n\n30:54.160 --> 30:55.120\nOh, with it?\n\n30:55.120 --> 30:56.120\nNo, no.\n\n30:56.120 --> 30:58.440\nThis is just normal.\n\n30:58.440 --> 31:01.080\nOh, man, you must have really broke my finger.\n\n31:01.080 --> 31:03.640\nYou know how these models can be.\n\n31:03.640 --> 31:05.440\nYeah.\n\n31:05.440 --> 31:08.360\nWell, that's totally convincing.\n\n31:11.800 --> 31:13.080\nIt doesn't matter anyway.\n\n31:13.080 --> 31:15.640\nYou're all food for the mother hen.\n\n31:15.640 --> 31:17.600\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:19.240\nAnd he walks away.\n\n31:19.240 --> 31:22.040\nAll right, well, can I wait for him to walk away, I guess?\n\n31:22.040 --> 31:24.360\nAnd then can I try and wake people up, these guys up?\n\n31:28.560 --> 31:33.120\nYou successfully wake Tom Tom Tom up earlier\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:34.800\nthan he would have woken up.\n\n31:34.800 --> 31:37.360\nWhereas Lars continues to sleep.\n\n31:37.360 --> 31:42.480\nThe exact duration of the effect of the squid ink.\n\n31:42.480 --> 31:44.040\nI don't know what to do, you guys.\n\n31:44.040 --> 31:47.360\nI feel like we could just wait it out.\n\n31:47.360 --> 31:50.920\nNo, we'll get fed to the hen.\n\n31:50.920 --> 31:52.440\nAnd you're asleep.\n\n31:52.440 --> 31:58.080\nI have a, I have sensed a weakness in one of the walls\n\n31:58.080 --> 32:00.320\nin this cell.\n\n32:00.320 --> 32:03.360\nThat would be crazy.\n\n32:03.360 --> 32:06.080\nHe successfully convinces you that that's true.\n\n32:06.080 --> 32:07.840\nThat's awesome.\n\n32:07.840 --> 32:10.080\nWhat else do you see?\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:17.120\nI use metal punch.\n\n32:17.120 --> 32:19.520\nAnd I punch the west wall of it.\n\n32:19.520 --> 32:21.600\nBecause I feel, I've been scratching it,\n\n32:21.600 --> 32:25.080\nlike ticking off the days that we've been there.\n\n32:25.080 --> 32:27.760\nAnd I feel like the plaster or whatever\n\n32:27.760 --> 32:29.520\nthey've used to make that wall is a little weaker\n\n32:29.520 --> 32:30.440\nthan the other walls.\n\n32:30.440 --> 32:32.000\nAnd I use metal punch.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.320\nOh, I believe in him.\n\n32:33.320 --> 32:33.880\nYes.\n\n32:33.880 --> 32:37.560\nAnd I give it everything I have.\n\n32:37.560 --> 32:38.880\nYou hurt your hand.\n\n32:41.440 --> 32:42.120\nYou got this.\n\n32:42.120 --> 32:43.640\nKeep it up.\n\n32:43.640 --> 32:45.440\nLars, you are now awake.\n\n32:45.440 --> 32:46.560\nWhoa.\n\n32:46.560 --> 32:48.840\nI had a dream about a bloody church.\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:49.560\nHoly shit.\n\n32:49.560 --> 32:50.600\nTell me about that.\n\n32:50.600 --> 32:52.600\nHave you always been a robot?\n\n32:52.600 --> 32:54.520\nYeah, but no one paid attention.\n\n32:54.520 --> 32:56.280\nOh, OK.\n\n32:56.280 --> 32:59.160\nWhen he mentions that bloody church, Trace,\n\n32:59.160 --> 33:03.880\nbut you, because you didn't sleep and because he had the image\n\n33:03.880 --> 33:06.240\nyou started, you're putting something together,\n\n33:06.240 --> 33:08.920\nyou feel like maybe you actually know these guys,\n\n33:08.920 --> 33:13.160\nthat you remember that you came to this town together,\n\n33:13.160 --> 33:16.920\nand that you were coming here for some reason that had to do.\n\n33:16.920 --> 33:18.400\nBecause when he says bloody church,\n\n33:18.400 --> 33:23.080\nyou're like, whoa, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.\n\n33:23.080 --> 33:25.320\nWhy are we coming here?\n\n33:25.320 --> 33:29.600\nYou guys hear a distant crowd cheering.\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:31.480\nIt's so distant that they might have\n\n33:31.480 --> 33:33.920\nbeen there the whole time doing things other than cheering,\n\n33:33.920 --> 33:35.520\nbut now they're cheering so loud that you\n\n33:35.520 --> 33:37.760\nhear them for the first time.\n\n33:37.760 --> 33:40.760\nOh, shit.\n\n33:40.760 --> 33:44.200\nThe door opens, same door as before,\n\n33:44.200 --> 33:48.240\nand Judge Doome comes walking down and says, all right, you\n\n33:48.240 --> 33:53.560\nfucks, you ready to feed the hen?\n\n33:53.560 --> 33:56.480\nNo.\n\n33:56.480 --> 34:01.960\nWell, you wouldn't make good hen food if you were ready.\n\n34:01.960 --> 34:06.680\nSmuggles, diggles, get in here.\n\n34:06.680 --> 34:16.480\nThese squid-headed priests come in, and they're wearing robes.\n\n34:16.480 --> 34:23.160\nThey kind of look like, Tom, Tom, Tom, you recognize them.\n\n34:23.160 --> 34:26.160\nYou recognize them as mind flayers.\n\n34:26.160 --> 34:32.000\nThey're psychic monsters, sentient, though.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.360\nThey're not monsters in the sense that they can't vote\n\n34:34.360 --> 34:38.240\nand stuff, like they're people.\n\n34:38.240 --> 34:45.080\nThey just look horrible, and they like to kill people.\n\n34:45.080 --> 34:45.880\nWe shouldn't judge them.\n\n34:45.880 --> 34:51.720\nI mean, they're probably the heroes of their own stories,\n\n34:51.720 --> 34:56.840\nbut the orcs are terrified of them,\n\n34:56.840 --> 35:00.720\nbecause they're particularly susceptible to their psychic\n\n35:00.720 --> 35:04.560\nattacks, but you're not operating in a penalty\n\n35:04.560 --> 35:08.200\nor anything like that, but you know they can fuck you up.\n\n35:08.200 --> 35:12.600\nSo Judge Doome is like, all right, fucks, it's time.\n\n35:12.600 --> 35:16.600\nAnd he nods at one of the mind flayer guys,\n\n35:16.600 --> 35:19.360\nand they gesture at the lock, and it clicks,\n\n35:19.360 --> 35:21.520\nand the cell door opens.\n\n35:21.520 --> 35:22.960\nIt opens wide.\n\n35:22.960 --> 35:24.680\nIt opens wide as a cell door.\n\n35:24.680 --> 35:26.560\nIt can open.\n\n35:26.560 --> 35:28.280\nYou're now in an open cell.\n\n35:28.280 --> 35:29.520\nWhat do you guys want to do?\n\n35:29.520 --> 35:30.680\nShould we run for it?\n\n35:30.680 --> 35:33.760\nI'll defer.\n\n35:33.760 --> 35:35.880\nCan we run for it?\n\n35:35.880 --> 35:37.920\nI think we run for it, but we run together.\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:40.920\nHow many mind flayers are there?\n\n35:40.920 --> 35:41.280\nHow many?\n\n35:41.280 --> 35:42.320\nOh, there's two.\n\n35:42.320 --> 35:42.920\nOh, man.\n\n35:42.920 --> 35:44.840\nThere's just two, and Judge Doome.\n\n35:44.840 --> 35:46.800\nHe can see you guys thinking about running.\n\n35:46.800 --> 35:49.240\nI'm going to hide in the corner.\n\n35:49.240 --> 35:50.400\nYou're going to end the cell?\n\n35:50.400 --> 35:52.760\nYeah.\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:57.760\nYou do a passable job of hiding in the corner of the cell.\n\n35:57.760 --> 35:58.800\nI know you're over there.\n\n35:58.800 --> 36:00.880\nI'm not involved in this.\n\n36:00.880 --> 36:04.760\nIt's pretty impressive how concealed you are over there.\n\n36:04.760 --> 36:08.840\nThank you for showing me your skills.\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:10.080\nI'm glad you're in there.\n\n36:10.080 --> 36:11.560\nYeah.\n\n36:11.560 --> 36:14.160\nDo we have any inventory, or just our prison garb?\n\n36:14.160 --> 36:16.280\nYou're just wearing burlap sacks.\n\n36:16.280 --> 36:22.600\nYou have what's called a holdout dagger in your rectum.\n\n36:22.600 --> 36:25.320\nIt's very dull, but it's like you come\n\n36:25.320 --> 36:31.360\nfrom a tribe of warriors at puberty that was inserted.\n\n36:31.360 --> 36:34.480\nIt stays up there for most of your life.\n\n36:34.480 --> 36:37.160\nIt's honestly more of a ceremony.\n\n36:37.160 --> 36:37.800\nAll right.\n\n36:37.800 --> 36:43.160\nWell, I take my holdout dagger out of my rectum\n\n36:43.160 --> 36:46.720\nand also use my sharpened toothbrush\n\n36:46.720 --> 36:48.960\nover time while I was there.\n\n36:48.960 --> 36:53.640\nAnd I'm a two-hand fight attack on one of the guards.\n\n36:53.640 --> 36:54.120\nOK.\n\n36:54.120 --> 36:55.080\nI'm a two-hand fighter.\n\n36:55.080 --> 36:59.640\nI can't let you pretend that you created a toothbrush.\n\n36:59.640 --> 37:00.840\nI'm not going to let you do that.\n\n37:00.840 --> 37:02.960\nYeah, it's been one night.\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:06.280\nBut is that metagaming to have created a toothbrush?\n\n37:06.280 --> 37:08.760\nWell, yeah, you can't just say, by the way, I did this.\n\n37:08.760 --> 37:09.160\nOK.\n\n37:09.160 --> 37:10.560\nAlthough, I'm giving you a little latitude\n\n37:10.560 --> 37:12.280\nbecause you don't have character sheets and stuff\n\n37:12.280 --> 37:15.600\nlike that, but I'm calling the toothbrush out of bounds.\n\n37:15.600 --> 37:16.080\nOK, OK.\n\n37:16.080 --> 37:16.600\nBullshit.\n\n37:16.600 --> 37:22.120\nI take my out-of-bounds dagger out of my butt\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:25.800\nand put it like, I kind of like.\n\n37:25.800 --> 37:29.280\nWell, hold on because it's one action to do that,\n\n37:29.280 --> 37:30.720\nand I rolled for it.\n\n37:30.720 --> 37:32.840\nAnd you do such a bad job of.\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:33.640\nOh, no.\n\n37:33.640 --> 37:35.280\nBut it's actually kind of good news\n\n37:35.280 --> 37:38.200\nbecause you're doing such a bad job of getting\n\n37:38.200 --> 37:41.640\nthe dagger out of your ass that you just,\n\n37:41.640 --> 37:43.080\nhe doesn't know you have one yet.\n\n37:43.080 --> 37:48.040\nSo you're just like digging all the way up your ass,\n\n37:48.040 --> 37:51.640\nand it looks like you're, he's like, oh, orcs.\n\n37:54.640 --> 37:55.240\nYeah, perfect.\n\n37:55.240 --> 37:55.720\nThat place is racist.\n\n37:55.720 --> 37:56.360\nHe is racist.\n\n37:56.360 --> 37:59.480\nI am racist.\n\n37:59.480 --> 38:00.960\nI hate all races.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:03.800\nAnd then you see him look over at one of his mind\n\n38:03.800 --> 38:06.000\nflayers who didn't seem to react.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.840\nBut he's like, he's like, whatever.\n\n38:09.840 --> 38:13.240\nIdentity politics.\n\n38:13.240 --> 38:16.800\nI hate identity politics.\n\n38:16.800 --> 38:17.360\nAll right.\n\n38:17.360 --> 38:19.240\nI hate identity politics.\n\n38:19.240 --> 38:20.960\nHe keeps saying it because he's not,\n\n38:20.960 --> 38:22.880\nhe wants to get a rise out of people, I guess.\n\n38:22.880 --> 38:24.360\nDo I see, oh.\n\n38:24.360 --> 38:27.240\nHe really thinks it means something.\n\n38:27.240 --> 38:29.880\nI hate identity politics.\n\n38:29.880 --> 38:31.760\nDo I see Tom Tom pull out his dagger?\n\n38:31.760 --> 38:32.880\nOr try to pull out his dagger?\n\n38:32.880 --> 38:34.080\nHe hasn't done it yet.\n\n38:34.080 --> 38:35.640\nNo, yeah, you just see the same thing\n\n38:35.640 --> 38:38.440\nthat everybody else saw, which is like this orc\n\n38:38.440 --> 38:43.080\nis just digging in his butt, like he's like his own puppet.\n\n38:43.080 --> 38:46.320\nBut so your hand is still up your ass,\n\n38:46.320 --> 38:48.520\nso I would actually let you take another try.\n\n38:48.520 --> 38:51.800\nI believe in you.\n\n38:51.800 --> 38:56.840\nI pretend that I'm asleep.\n\n38:56.840 --> 38:58.480\nDo you remove your hand from your hand?\n\n38:58.480 --> 39:02.280\nNo, no, I pretend that I'm an orc who\n\n39:02.280 --> 39:05.720\nput my hand up his own butt, and then he goes, oh.\n\n39:05.720 --> 39:07.840\nLike the chimpanzee in the video.\n\n39:07.840 --> 39:08.800\nI passed out.\n\n39:08.800 --> 39:12.920\nIt's like I'm playing possum right now.\n\n39:12.920 --> 39:15.640\nNo sleeping, get up.\n\n39:15.640 --> 39:19.320\nYou feel a stab of otherworldly pain in your frontal lobe.\n\n39:19.320 --> 39:22.240\nOh, shit.\n\n39:22.240 --> 39:24.560\nYou got psychic attacked.\n\n39:24.560 --> 39:26.640\nI got psychic attacks.\n\n39:26.640 --> 39:28.760\nIt's searing pain in your brain.\n\n39:28.760 --> 39:32.680\nBut I have a constitution of 21.\n\n39:32.680 --> 39:35.680\nWell, that doesn't matter.\n\n39:35.680 --> 39:37.960\nIt still hurts.\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:40.360\nBut I care less about it.\n\n39:40.360 --> 39:45.200\nWell, I'm just a sleepy orc with a hand up his own butt.\n\n39:45.200 --> 39:47.440\nA creepy voice whispers in your brain,\n\n39:47.440 --> 39:50.280\nthere will be more pain.\n\n39:50.280 --> 39:53.120\nLet's just go with these guys.\n\n39:53.120 --> 39:58.120\nYou hear a voice from a mostly concealed shadow\n\n39:58.120 --> 40:00.880\nin the corner of the cell saying that.\n\n40:00.880 --> 40:01.720\nI trust them.\n\n40:01.720 --> 40:08.320\nI cast Inflict Light Wounds on one of the mind flayers.\n\n40:08.320 --> 40:09.400\nOh, shit.\n\n40:09.400 --> 40:11.760\nOh, man.\n\n40:11.760 --> 40:14.760\nYou have positioned yourself as a harmless man\n\n40:14.760 --> 40:16.320\nin a burlap sack when secretly you\n\n40:16.320 --> 40:18.640\nhave the power of the ancient holies.\n\n40:18.640 --> 40:22.240\nYou now lay your hands upon the nearest mind flayer,\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:25.000\nand it reacts with searing pain as you cook it,\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:37.400\nlike so much calamari doing the mind flayer falls back\n\n40:37.400 --> 40:40.000\nto the wall, spewing blood from its nose,\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nwhich is underneath its tentacle mouth.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nBut you assume there's a nose under there.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:45.400\nThere's blood coming out.\n\n40:45.400 --> 40:46.400\nHoly shit.\n\n40:46.400 --> 40:49.080\nIt's going ee, ee, ee.\n\n40:49.080 --> 40:50.120\nI think we can win.\n\n40:50.120 --> 40:55.120\nAnd you're next, if you don't back off.\n\n40:55.120 --> 40:58.920\nJudge Dooms like fucking psychic squid people.\n\n40:58.920 --> 41:01.560\nDo you want something done right?\n\n41:01.560 --> 41:09.600\nHe comes at Lars with drawing his swords.\n\n41:09.600 --> 41:13.360\nHe's doing a two-sword attack.\n\n41:13.360 --> 41:14.400\nOh, shit.\n\n41:14.400 --> 41:18.320\nHe misses with one and kind of grazes your arm\n\n41:18.320 --> 41:24.160\nwith the other, doing a moderate amount of damage,\n\n41:24.160 --> 41:25.440\nbut just to your arm.\n\n41:25.440 --> 41:27.480\nSo it's not that big a deal in the grand scheme,\n\n41:27.480 --> 41:30.240\nbecause it's like, if your arm was a body,\n\n41:30.240 --> 41:33.960\nit would have been hit in its arm.\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:38.600\nYour arm's arm is hurt, but you're OK.\n\n41:38.600 --> 41:40.440\nJeff, what do you got?\n\n41:40.440 --> 41:44.680\nI go at him with a, because I have no weapons right now,\n\n41:44.680 --> 41:45.240\nexcept to think of it.\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:46.640\nYou're laying on the floor.\n\n41:46.640 --> 41:48.440\nOh, your hand's so pure.\n\n41:48.440 --> 41:50.720\nI hand up your ass.\n\n41:50.720 --> 41:52.840\nDo you want to roll dice to see if I successfully pull my\n\n41:52.840 --> 41:52.840\narm?\n\n41:52.840 --> 41:53.840\nSure, that's what you want.\n\n41:53.840 --> 41:56.760\nOh, yeah, you whip it out like a fucking,\n\n41:56.760 --> 41:59.440\nlike a Kleenex out of a box.\n\n41:59.440 --> 42:02.120\nSo I take out my secret poop weapon,\n\n42:02.120 --> 42:05.360\nand describe it for me.\n\n42:05.360 --> 42:12.840\nIt's a short, rather blunt, four and a half inch\n\n42:12.840 --> 42:17.360\nceremonial dagger that was inserted into your asshole\n\n42:17.360 --> 42:22.320\nwhen you turned 12 in your orc village.\n\n42:22.320 --> 42:28.320\nIt was sharper back then, but it was never so sharp\n\n42:28.320 --> 42:29.760\nthat it tore flesh.\n\n42:29.760 --> 42:32.760\nSo it's really like, it's a weapon that\n\n42:32.760 --> 42:35.480\nis mostly used by the elders of your tribe\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:39.440\nto terrorize the children, because adolescent orcs\n\n42:39.440 --> 42:43.200\nare very difficult to manage.\n\n42:43.200 --> 42:45.440\nSo they have these rituals that they\n\n42:45.440 --> 42:49.440\nuse to focus your aggression on the outside world.\n\n42:49.440 --> 42:54.840\nWell, I use weapon focus and throw it at the, what's his name?\n\n42:54.840 --> 42:55.560\nJudge Doom.\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:56.240\nJudge Doom.\n\n42:56.240 --> 42:57.600\nOK.\n\n42:57.600 --> 43:00.720\nI will tell you that he will make a worse target,\n\n43:00.720 --> 43:03.640\nbecause again, this is a very blunt knife.\n\n43:03.640 --> 43:07.000\nI'll just tell you that your lore in your tribe\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:10.240\nunderstands that in the few stories where an orc actually\n\n43:10.240 --> 43:13.240\nhas to use these things, the most effective use of them\n\n43:13.240 --> 43:19.720\nis as an assist in mealy like a punching, because it's so dull,\n\n43:19.720 --> 43:21.680\nbut it's sharper than a fist.\n\n43:21.680 --> 43:25.200\nOK, so I do, because I'm generally\n\n43:25.200 --> 43:27.080\nlike a two-handed fighter.\n\n43:27.080 --> 43:28.600\nI would let you throw it, but I'm just\n\n43:28.600 --> 43:31.120\nrecommending you don't throw it at a guy with any armor,\n\n43:31.120 --> 43:33.960\nbut the mind flayers are just squid people in robes.\n\n43:33.960 --> 43:34.880\nI appreciate your advice.\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:36.200\nOK, thanks.\n\n43:36.200 --> 43:39.120\nI come at with a chop to the throat\n\n43:39.120 --> 43:43.480\nand a stab with my blunt poop weapon into his midsection.\n\n43:43.480 --> 43:45.360\nOh, you karate chop with one hand and then.\n\n43:45.360 --> 43:47.800\nLike, throat midsection with the poops.\n\n43:47.800 --> 43:49.320\nAnd this is on Judge Doom, huh?\n\n43:49.320 --> 43:51.640\nOn Judge Doom himself, his very self.\n\n43:51.640 --> 43:58.440\nAll right, well, your chop goes wide,\n\n43:58.440 --> 44:02.320\nand then your blunt stab misses.\n\n44:02.320 --> 44:03.240\nI'm sorry.\n\n44:03.240 --> 44:06.400\nI want you to be rolling better.\n\n44:06.400 --> 44:08.360\nIt's hard.\n\n44:08.360 --> 44:10.560\nSo you miss.\n\n44:10.560 --> 44:11.120\nIt's OK.\n\n44:11.120 --> 44:11.960\nI was groggy.\n\n44:11.960 --> 44:14.080\nI just woke up from a little nap.\n\n44:14.080 --> 44:15.160\nTrace, but you.\n\n44:15.160 --> 44:17.560\nCan I launch myself at the mind flayer\n\n44:17.560 --> 44:19.160\nhoping to tackle his head?\n\n44:19.160 --> 44:21.960\nYes.\n\n44:21.960 --> 44:23.480\nIt's not a critical fail, but you\n\n44:23.480 --> 44:28.520\ndo a poor job of leaping from the shadowy corner.\n\n44:28.520 --> 44:29.680\nMy plan.\n\n44:29.680 --> 44:32.160\nYeah.\n\n44:32.160 --> 44:36.640\nYeah, the robot thief kind of clumsily\n\n44:36.640 --> 44:38.560\njangles out of the corner and lands\n\n44:38.560 --> 44:40.440\nat the feet of the mind flayer.\n\n44:40.440 --> 44:41.600\nSee, it was a trick.\n\n44:41.600 --> 44:42.600\nI was on your side.\n\n44:45.840 --> 44:47.400\nNow you guys are going to die.\n\n44:47.400 --> 44:49.320\nShut up back there.\n\n44:49.320 --> 44:51.280\nOh, no.\n\n44:51.280 --> 44:52.760\nNobody grabs that torch.\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:54.000\nKeep the torch safe.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:54.920\nGrab the torch.\n\n44:54.920 --> 44:56.040\nGuard the torch with your lives.\n\n44:56.040 --> 44:56.760\nGrab the torch.\n\n44:56.760 --> 44:57.840\nOh, god.\n\n44:57.840 --> 45:01.360\nOne of the mind flayers, you see him squint and look\n\n45:01.360 --> 45:04.760\nat Tom Tom Tom, but nothing happens.\n\n45:04.760 --> 45:05.880\nOh, shit.\n\n45:05.880 --> 45:12.120\nHe must have remembered his ex-girlfriend or something.\n\n45:12.120 --> 45:14.000\nQuick thinking.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:15.760\nAnd let's see.\n\n45:15.760 --> 45:16.640\nOh, shit.\n\n45:16.640 --> 45:22.200\nWell, the other mind flayer is he's massively wounded\n\n45:22.200 --> 45:25.520\nand against the wall, but you see him doing something.\n\n45:25.520 --> 45:27.760\nIt looks like he's healing himself\n\n45:27.760 --> 45:30.480\nwith some kind of psychic thing.\n\n45:30.480 --> 45:37.760\nJudge Doom, he does a really good job of attacking Tom\n\n45:37.760 --> 45:38.440\nTom Tom.\n\n45:38.440 --> 45:39.760\nWhat?\n\n45:39.760 --> 45:43.520\nHe was my HP currently right now.\n\n45:43.520 --> 45:44.040\nFull.\n\n45:44.040 --> 45:45.280\n40.\n\n45:45.280 --> 45:46.080\n40?\n\n45:46.080 --> 45:48.600\nYeah, but you better subtract 7 from that.\n\n45:48.600 --> 45:49.480\nOh, damn.\n\n45:49.480 --> 45:52.520\nOK, like, all right, you guys can go.\n\n45:52.520 --> 45:54.200\nI'd start with Tom Tom Tom.\n\n45:54.200 --> 46:00.440\nOK, I do a power attack at, who am I closest to right now?\n\n46:00.440 --> 46:03.440\nYou are closest to Judge Doom, right?\n\n46:03.440 --> 46:05.440\nJudge Doom, power attack.\n\n46:05.440 --> 46:07.440\nAnd I just go for like a strangle.\n\n46:07.440 --> 46:11.120\nLike, I use all of my arm strength and just go straight\n\n46:11.120 --> 46:12.680\nto try to choke him out.\n\n46:12.680 --> 46:13.400\nOK.\n\n46:13.400 --> 46:18.080\nYou grabbed his throat with the efficiency\n\n46:18.080 --> 46:24.680\nof an animal at bay from the stories of animals with hands\n\n46:24.680 --> 46:27.320\nfrom your childhood.\n\n46:27.320 --> 46:31.480\nYour hands go to his throat as if guided by special magnets\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:36.000\nin a novelty sculpture of someone choking someone.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:42.880\nAnd your thumbs find his windpipe with magic-like efficiency.\n\n46:42.880 --> 46:43.400\nNice.\n\n46:43.400 --> 46:46.600\nYou realize you have his life at your mercy.\n\n46:46.600 --> 46:50.280\nYou need only squeeze to snuff him out.\n\n46:50.280 --> 46:51.480\nPower attack.\n\n46:51.480 --> 46:53.040\nSqueeze that shit.\n\n46:53.040 --> 46:54.240\nYeah, I mean, it's all right.\n\n46:54.240 --> 46:57.600\nYou crush his windpipe, he can't breathe.\n\n46:57.600 --> 46:59.640\nEven if you let go, he can't breathe.\n\n46:59.640 --> 47:02.120\nHe's so sad and in such pain.\n\n47:09.560 --> 47:12.080\nThis is what your actions half rock.\n\n47:16.080 --> 47:22.000\nHe's crawling to you, Lars, like, this is a line\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:26.840\nwith demons and live in torturous agony.\n\n47:26.840 --> 47:27.840\nWhat did you say, Spencer?\n\n47:27.840 --> 47:29.840\nI'm just punishing him verbally.\n\n47:33.920 --> 47:36.800\nOh, does he have any items that look stealable?\n\n47:36.800 --> 47:41.360\nOh, man, he's got so many items.\n\n47:41.360 --> 47:43.840\nThere is one mind flayer left, but that was Tom Tom's\n\n47:43.840 --> 47:45.720\nattack, Lars, you can go.\n\n47:45.720 --> 47:46.560\nI kick him.\n\n47:46.560 --> 47:49.480\nYou kick the, you kick Judge Jume, OK.\n\n47:49.480 --> 47:51.080\nWell, I mean, it's an easy target.\n\n47:51.080 --> 47:51.840\nYeah, yeah, you kick him.\n\n47:51.840 --> 47:55.880\nI mean, he's like, man, I'm dying and now I'm getting kicked.\n\n47:55.880 --> 47:58.720\nHa, you see?\n\n47:58.720 --> 48:00.160\nTracebutt, you want to do something?\n\n48:00.160 --> 48:02.920\nYeah, well, does he, do I see any items on his person\n\n48:02.920 --> 48:04.680\nthat I could immediately grab, like,\n\n48:04.680 --> 48:06.240\nwithin a short period of time?\n\n48:06.240 --> 48:08.760\nYeah, like, his most visible objects are,\n\n48:08.760 --> 48:13.000\nhe has a pair of shimmering, slightly glowing gloves made\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:17.720\nof a very fine chainmail that are draped over his belt.\n\n48:17.720 --> 48:23.040\nHe has an extra sword on the back, He-Man style.\n\n48:23.040 --> 48:27.000\nHe's got those fox pelts that you notice\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.160\nupon closer inspection.\n\n48:29.160 --> 48:32.480\nThe eyes have a kind of life to them.\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:34.280\nYeah, that's cool as shit.\n\n48:34.280 --> 48:38.040\nYeah, I mean, they don't just look like regular dead foxes.\n\n48:38.040 --> 48:40.560\nThey look like maybe they're, yeah, like living pelts.\n\n48:40.560 --> 48:47.560\nOK, can I take the sword and throw it to Tom Tom Tom?\n\n48:47.560 --> 48:52.080\nYou grab the sword off the back of the dying man\n\n48:52.080 --> 48:56.280\nand the robot thief flings you this sword.\n\n48:56.280 --> 48:57.400\nDo you want to try to catch it?\n\n48:57.400 --> 48:59.360\nYeah, I try to catch the sword.\n\n48:59.360 --> 49:03.400\nYou do so with, like, a globetrotter.\n\n49:03.400 --> 49:04.640\nHell yeah.\n\n49:04.640 --> 49:05.720\nI'm going to go grab a Coke.\n\n49:05.720 --> 49:06.720\nI'll be right back.\n\n49:10.480 --> 49:11.960\nHe's achieved his dream.\n\n49:11.960 --> 49:12.680\nHe's leaving.\n\n49:12.680 --> 49:13.720\nOK.\n\n49:13.720 --> 49:18.280\nI catch the sword and I try to use the momentum of catching\n\n49:18.280 --> 49:21.800\nthe sword and swing around and kill the final mind flayer.\n\n49:21.800 --> 49:23.000\nOK.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:23.960\nAnd a cleave.\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:25.160\nI use cleave.\n\n49:25.160 --> 49:26.640\nIt's a critical hit.\n\n49:26.640 --> 49:27.640\nYeah.\n\n49:27.640 --> 49:28.120\nYeah.\n\n49:35.960 --> 49:39.160\nAlso, this sword has, like, some strange magic properties.\n\n49:39.160 --> 49:41.280\nYou hear a voice in your head as you\n\n49:41.280 --> 49:45.000\nstrike saying, ah, flesh.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.240\nAnd there's, like, the wound that you cause\n\n49:48.240 --> 49:55.440\nas you cleave the mother mind flayer in half at his hips.\n\n49:55.440 --> 50:00.000\nThe wound is cauterized with a strange orange glow.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.320\nBut it's not a healthy thing because it\n\n50:02.320 --> 50:04.360\nstarts to eat the flesh away.\n\n50:04.360 --> 50:08.240\nThe body continues to start disintegrating in both halves\n\n50:08.240 --> 50:10.440\nas you watch it.\n\n50:10.440 --> 50:14.120\nYou'd still have time to grab any, like, his robes.\n\n50:14.120 --> 50:17.640\nBut he's slowly just disappearing.\n\n50:17.640 --> 50:20.160\nSo we vanquished everybody inside this room right now?\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:21.160\nYeah.\n\n50:21.160 --> 50:23.480\nThere's a, oh, the other mind flayer\n\n50:23.480 --> 50:25.640\nis, like, he was healing himself.\n\n50:25.640 --> 50:26.640\nOh, yeah, no.\n\n50:26.640 --> 50:28.840\nHe's at a disadvantage.\n\n50:28.840 --> 50:30.640\nHe's only just alive.\n\n50:30.640 --> 50:32.600\nTracebutt, Tracebutt, finish the job.\n\n50:32.600 --> 50:33.680\nWhat about you?\n\n50:33.680 --> 50:34.560\nOh, Mars.\n\n50:34.560 --> 50:38.440\nI cast Scorching Ray at the last mind flayer.\n\n50:38.440 --> 50:42.520\nWhoa, what are you, what's your god?\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:44.280\nIn a good way.\n\n50:44.280 --> 50:47.400\nCan we not talk religion?\n\n50:47.400 --> 50:49.040\nIt's like politics.\n\n50:49.040 --> 50:52.240\nLinking your thumbs together and fanning your fingers out\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:56.800\nin a manual display of symbol-ness.\n\n50:56.800 --> 51:00.320\nFlames shoot from your fingertips in a fan-like pattern,\n\n51:00.320 --> 51:03.480\ndancing through the air and connecting with the face\n\n51:03.480 --> 51:05.680\nand genitals of the mind flayer.\n\n51:05.680 --> 51:08.800\nHe shrieks in agony through all of your brains,\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:11.880\ntrying as hard as he can to hurt you with his thoughts.\n\n51:11.880 --> 51:15.200\nBut all he successfully does is share with you\n\n51:15.200 --> 51:19.720\nwhat he's thinking as he dies, which is, oh, God, Daphne,\n\n51:19.720 --> 51:23.000\noh, why was I such a dick?\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:23.960\nI was gaslighting.\n\n51:23.960 --> 51:25.240\nThat's what they call gaslighting,\n\n51:25.240 --> 51:27.120\nis what I was doing to her.\n\n51:27.120 --> 51:28.640\nAnd he dies.\n\n51:28.640 --> 51:29.120\nDamn.\n\n51:32.040 --> 51:33.520\nNice job, guys.\n\n51:33.520 --> 51:35.160\nI loot the body.\n\n51:35.160 --> 51:38.320\nYou find yourselves wondering, what was that relationship\n\n51:38.320 --> 51:40.200\nabout?\n\n51:40.200 --> 51:41.160\nLies.\n\n51:41.160 --> 51:42.360\nI feel kind of bad.\n\n51:42.360 --> 51:43.280\nYeah.\n\n51:43.280 --> 51:46.640\nOK, so yeah, I mean, he's technically alive, the Judge\n\n51:46.640 --> 51:51.400\nDoom, but he's not going to continue living,\n\n51:51.400 --> 51:52.960\nand he can barely speak.\n\n51:52.960 --> 51:53.840\nHe's turning purple.\n\n51:53.840 --> 51:54.480\nHe's dying.\n\n51:54.480 --> 51:56.960\nI walk up to him and say, what did you\n\n51:56.960 --> 51:58.880\nhave against us in the first place?\n\n51:58.880 --> 52:03.200\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n52:03.200 --> 52:04.480\nI give him a pen and paper.\n\n52:04.480 --> 52:13.840\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n52:13.840 --> 52:16.400\nCan I heal him like a little bit just so we can talk to him\n\n52:16.400 --> 52:18.240\nas normal, eh, or?\n\n52:18.240 --> 52:20.280\nOK, you use, like, cure late wounds?\n\n52:20.280 --> 52:21.800\nOK, you do that.\n\n52:21.800 --> 52:24.680\nYou cure it, just a tip of his late wounds.\n\n52:24.680 --> 52:31.160\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n52:31.160 --> 52:32.120\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n52:32.120 --> 52:35.840\nI was saying, ah, ah, because I couldn't breathe.\n\n52:35.840 --> 52:39.240\nRight, what did you have against us in the first place?\n\n52:39.240 --> 52:41.280\nI ain't trying to grapple him, I guess.\n\n52:41.280 --> 52:42.120\nYou try what?\n\n52:42.120 --> 52:43.520\nTo grapple him.\n\n52:43.520 --> 52:44.400\nOh, you grapple him.\n\n52:44.400 --> 52:46.660\nOK, I mean, you've got him secured.\n\n52:46.660 --> 52:47.360\nHe's not going to.\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:50.000\nYou did a good job of, he just, he just,\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.320\nhe focused his healing on his trachea,\n\n52:52.320 --> 52:53.400\nso that he can speak.\n\n52:53.400 --> 52:56.820\nbut he's like, you've even done a kind of cruel thing\n\n52:56.820 --> 53:01.820\nwhere he's able to draw in like 5% less oxygen\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:04.040\nwith each breath that it will take\n\n53:04.040 --> 53:05.680\nin totality to keep him alive.\n\n53:05.680 --> 53:08.880\nSo he's like still in a perpetual state of suffocation.\n\n53:09.720 --> 53:11.040\nIt's easy like waterboarding.\n\n53:11.040 --> 53:15.360\nLike he's like, it would be called simulated death,\n\n53:15.360 --> 53:17.320\nbut he's actually dying.\n\n53:17.320 --> 53:20.160\nHe just, you're torturing him, he's tortured.\n\n53:20.160 --> 53:21.320\nAre we the bad guys?\n\n53:21.320 --> 53:22.400\nNo, no, we're good.\n\n53:22.400 --> 53:24.680\nI think he's, well, I mean, I'm not, I can't judge.\n\n53:24.680 --> 53:26.440\nI'm a dungeon master, you know?\n\n53:26.440 --> 53:29.640\nBut I don't think anyone that imprisoned somebody\n\n53:29.640 --> 53:31.800\nwithout due process is a very good person.\n\n53:31.800 --> 53:35.560\nTruly anyone who allies with mind flayers needs to be killed.\n\n53:35.560 --> 53:37.600\nAnd he did call you fuck faces and stuff.\n\n53:37.600 --> 53:39.200\nLike he was mean, you know?\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:41.400\nHe didn't tell you why you were here.\n\n53:41.400 --> 53:46.240\nOh God, oh God, I want to die, but I don't want to live.\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:49.160\nI poke out his eye, what?\n\n53:49.160 --> 53:50.520\nI poke out his eye.\n\n53:50.520 --> 53:55.520\nAh, the robot pokes out his eye with his metal finger.\n\n53:55.520 --> 54:00.520\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:06.720\nDude, please stop, please don't torture me anymore.\n\n54:06.720 --> 54:09.120\nI hate dying in pain.\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:11.920\nI don't, if you're gonna kill me, please kill me.\n\n54:11.920 --> 54:15.360\nIf you're not gonna kill me, please heal me more\n\n54:15.360 --> 54:16.400\nso I can live.\n\n54:16.400 --> 54:19.400\nI pick him up by the ankle and hold him upside down\n\n54:19.400 --> 54:24.400\nand look, I'm trying to get him like eye to eye,\n\n54:25.840 --> 54:27.160\nbut my arm isn't long enough.\n\n54:27.160 --> 54:30.400\nSo like I keep scooting my hand up,\n\n54:30.400 --> 54:32.920\nlike I have him by the belt now.\n\n54:32.920 --> 54:34.840\nHe's upside down, but he's, I have him by the belt.\n\n54:34.840 --> 54:37.800\nSo now he's upside down and we're eye to eye.\n\n54:38.800 --> 54:40.880\nAnd I say, where is the squid ink?\n\n54:40.880 --> 54:45.880\nAh, it's in my pouch on my belt, you know that?\n\n54:46.720 --> 54:48.080\nHow would I know that?\n\n54:48.080 --> 54:51.040\nI used it on you, is that what you want?\n\n54:51.040 --> 54:52.920\nI take the squid ink out of his pouch.\n\n54:52.920 --> 54:55.960\nAh, you, there's a pouch on his belt\n\n54:55.960 --> 54:57.920\nthat's like writhing around, you remember that,\n\n54:57.920 --> 54:59.320\nor maybe you don't remember,\n\n54:59.320 --> 55:01.920\nmaybe you're a better role player than I am a DM.\n\n55:01.920 --> 55:06.160\nCause you, you have a faint memory of,\n\n55:06.160 --> 55:08.520\nhe's got a little wriggling squid in that bag.\n\n55:08.520 --> 55:09.840\nYeah, it shot you in the brain juice.\n\n55:09.840 --> 55:12.120\nAnd he squeeze it, it's like a knockout drug\n\n55:12.120 --> 55:12.960\nor something like that.\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:15.120\nI put it in his mouth.\n\n55:15.120 --> 55:17.760\nWait, hold on to that, that could be useful.\n\n55:17.760 --> 55:19.520\nMy rogue mind tells me.\n\n55:19.520 --> 55:20.840\nOkay.\n\n55:20.840 --> 55:22.160\nGood thinking, Trace Butt.\n\n55:22.160 --> 55:24.440\nI give Trace Butt the pouch of squid ink.\n\n55:24.440 --> 55:25.280\nOh, thanks.\n\n55:25.280 --> 55:28.480\nYou now have a squid ink of knockout.\n\n55:28.480 --> 55:31.160\nA squid, a baby squid of knockout.\n\n55:31.160 --> 55:32.840\nI guess I grab his keys.\n\n55:33.840 --> 55:35.600\nYou grab his keys.\n\n55:35.600 --> 55:37.880\nIs there anything on that desk that's relevant?\n\n55:37.880 --> 55:40.720\nThe desk contains six candles,\n\n55:40.720 --> 55:45.000\ntwo hats, and a drawer.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:46.120\nTake these hats.\n\n55:46.120 --> 55:51.120\nOne hat is like a tall hat, like a two foot tall hat.\n\n55:52.960 --> 55:55.560\nI take off a, what's his name?\n\n55:57.560 --> 55:58.400\nJudge Dooms?\n\n55:58.400 --> 55:59.960\nNow I take off Judge Dooms outfit,\n\n55:59.960 --> 56:02.480\nlike I'm going to like dress up like him to sneak out.\n\n56:02.480 --> 56:03.640\nBut then I just go, you know what,\n\n56:03.640 --> 56:05.080\nit's just funny if I leave him naked\n\n56:05.080 --> 56:08.120\nand I just, and I light his clothes on fire.\n\n56:08.120 --> 56:09.680\nSo he's now just naked.\n\n56:09.680 --> 56:11.200\nYou could have had him be naked\n\n56:11.200 --> 56:12.720\nand also take his clothes.\n\n56:12.720 --> 56:14.560\nYeah, but I don't want to, they don't fit.\n\n56:14.560 --> 56:15.400\nOkay.\n\n56:15.400 --> 56:17.280\nHe's really sad because he's naked now\n\n56:17.280 --> 56:19.400\nand he's still, again, he's dying the whole time.\n\n56:19.400 --> 56:20.480\nIt's like a horrible death.\n\n56:20.480 --> 56:22.680\nI give him two Good Berries.\n\n56:23.680 --> 56:28.160\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, thank you.\n\n56:28.160 --> 56:29.880\nAnd then I smash him in the head and kill him.\n\n56:29.880 --> 56:30.720\nAh!\n\n56:33.440 --> 56:34.920\nWhere'd you get Good Berries?\n\n56:36.320 --> 56:38.200\nHe had, they were in the,\n\n56:38.200 --> 56:39.040\nOh God.\n\n56:39.040 --> 56:40.720\nThey were in the secret compartment\n\n56:40.720 --> 56:42.440\nin the hilt of the anal dagger, yeah.\n\n56:42.440 --> 56:44.760\nYeah, that's some good thinking.\n\n56:44.760 --> 56:45.600\nNo, it is.\n\n56:45.600 --> 56:46.680\nIt's like a beautiful,\n\n56:46.680 --> 56:50.440\nI'll tell you the ritual that is Orchvillage practices\n\n56:50.440 --> 56:54.400\nin its roots, it's actually a really wonderful thing,\n\n56:54.400 --> 56:56.400\nbut it's just become so corrupted\n\n56:56.400 --> 56:57.760\nand it's just about oppression.\n\n56:57.760 --> 56:58.600\nRight.\n\n56:58.600 --> 57:01.600\nLike, it's really just about scaring kids.\n\n57:01.600 --> 57:03.920\nAre there other prisoners in this jail cell?\n\n57:05.720 --> 57:07.080\nNo.\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:08.600\nWhat's big tracks?\n\n57:08.600 --> 57:09.440\nWhat's that?\n\n57:09.440 --> 57:10.280\nLet's get out of here.\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:12.840\nOh, the robot says, let's get out of here.\n\n57:12.840 --> 57:15.280\nYeah, so we look for the exit.\n\n57:15.280 --> 57:17.120\nYou guys took those hats.\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:18.960\nYeah, we got two hats.\n\n57:18.960 --> 57:22.400\nOkay, I take the seven candles too,\n\n57:22.400 --> 57:23.240\njust to keep the seven.\n\n57:23.240 --> 57:24.080\nThe quid.\n\n57:24.080 --> 57:27.200\nThe candles are in your orc sack,\n\n57:27.200 --> 57:28.400\nor no, you don't have an orc sack.\n\n57:28.400 --> 57:30.280\nYou just scoop them up in your arms\n\n57:30.280 --> 57:32.480\nand they kind of go out and burn you with wax,\n\n57:32.480 --> 57:34.600\nbut you're holding six candles.\n\n57:34.600 --> 57:36.200\nHell yeah.\n\n57:36.200 --> 57:38.640\nAll right, you guys head around that hallway\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:42.720\nand there's a eight foot tall, four foot wide giant door\n\n57:42.720 --> 57:46.360\nwith six locks on it, but all of them are unfastened.\n\n57:46.360 --> 57:47.360\nOh, hell yeah.\n\n57:47.360 --> 57:49.640\nThis is our lucky day.\n\n57:49.640 --> 57:50.480\nYeah.\n\n57:50.480 --> 57:52.160\nLet's continue onward.\n\n57:53.240 --> 57:54.600\nTracebutt goes to the door.\n\n57:54.600 --> 57:56.040\nYou open it?\n\n57:56.040 --> 57:56.880\nYeah.\n\n57:56.880 --> 57:58.240\nHe opens the door.\n\n57:58.240 --> 57:59.560\nOh, I should have listened.\n\n57:59.560 --> 58:01.880\nBehind the door is a room.\n\n58:01.880 --> 58:05.280\nIt's white with white walls and a white ceiling.\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:09.600\nThere's a hole in the ceiling that's a square below the square.\n\n58:09.600 --> 58:12.840\nIt's a beech wood table, finely polished, containing\n\n58:12.840 --> 58:16.040\nall of your items in three separate piles,\n\n58:16.040 --> 58:19.280\none for each of you, each labeled with your name.\n\n58:20.400 --> 58:21.800\nIt's all your stuff.\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:26.800\nAnd beyond that, there's a door in the north wall\n\n58:28.080 --> 58:31.080\nthat it's oozing with green slime.\n\n58:31.080 --> 58:31.920\nOh, shit.\n\n58:31.920 --> 58:36.760\nIt's got a little doorway, a little peeky patch in it.\n\n58:36.760 --> 58:41.640\nAnd yeah, the room is lit by daylight.\n\n58:41.640 --> 58:43.440\nThat's a skylight above the door.\n\n58:43.440 --> 58:44.480\nNice.\n\n58:44.480 --> 58:45.320\nLet's get our stuff.\n\n58:45.320 --> 58:46.920\nYeah, we all pick up our items.\n\n58:46.920 --> 58:49.880\nOkay, you pick up all your items.\n\n58:49.880 --> 58:51.360\nYou have them all.\n\n58:51.360 --> 58:53.160\nI stand on top of the beech wood table.\n\n58:53.160 --> 58:57.480\nIt's like, Lars, Tracebutt, stand on my shoulders.\n\n58:57.480 --> 58:58.720\nYou get on top and climb out.\n\n58:58.720 --> 59:03.240\nAnd I will use my own strength to get myself here.\n\n59:03.240 --> 59:05.920\nI'll be on the bottom because I'm the most sturdy.\n\n59:05.920 --> 59:07.360\nI'll lock my joints.\n\n59:08.200 --> 59:10.800\nAll right, so I get on top of Tracebutt.\n\n59:10.800 --> 59:12.520\nLars, you want to climb on top of me?\n\n59:12.520 --> 59:14.560\nYeah, I climb up to the top and I do it.\n\n59:14.560 --> 59:16.160\nCan I reach the hole?\n\n59:16.160 --> 59:19.440\nYou can, yeah, if you're on top of Tom Tom's,\n\n59:19.440 --> 59:20.440\nyou're climbing on top of something.\n\n59:20.440 --> 59:23.600\nYeah, yeah, yeah, you can reach the hole.\n\n59:23.600 --> 59:24.920\nThere's sand above it.\n\n59:24.920 --> 59:29.160\nYou could, it's like a hole to a beach.\n\n59:29.160 --> 59:30.280\nIs it big enough for me to fit through?\n\n59:30.280 --> 59:33.120\nOh yeah, it's like a three foot square hole.\n\n59:33.120 --> 59:36.480\nSo I climb up and look for a rope to hand down to my friends.\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:39.640\nOkay, you pull yourself up with cleric like agility.\n\n59:41.640 --> 59:43.200\nIt's a sunlit beach.\n\n59:43.200 --> 59:44.560\nIt's actually quite beautiful.\n\n59:44.560 --> 59:46.400\nThere's an ocean.\n\n59:46.400 --> 59:49.840\nIt's a crystal clear blue ocean.\n\n59:49.840 --> 59:51.720\nAnd yeah, you pull yourself up.\n\n59:51.720 --> 59:55.920\nThere's, you hear seagulls and a strange distant sound\n\n59:55.920 --> 59:58.880\nthat you've never heard before in the distance.\n\n59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880\nLike it's just a strange kind of like humming\n\n01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.440\nor something, there's a big forest\n\n01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.120\nand a road made of pebbles.\n\n01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.320\nBy the way, that's how they make all roads that you remember.\n\n01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.200\nLike it's usually some form of pebble refinement.\n\n01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160\nYou're looking for like a rope or something?\n\n01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.000\nIs that what you're looking for?\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.320\nDo we have ropes in our stuff?\n\n01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.120\nSay what?\n\n01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.960\nDo we have ropes in our stuff?\n\n01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.680\nYeah, you each have 50 feet of rope\n\n01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.080\nbecause everyone does, yeah.\n\n01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080\nClassic, yeah.\n\n01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.120\nI throw you the rope.\n\n01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.280\nOkay, robot throws a rope up.\n\n01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.800\nI find a tree to tie it around.\n\n01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.640\nWe'll just hold it.\n\n01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.480\nHow heavy are you?\n\n01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.280\nI'm just, okay, do a tree.\n\n01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.160\nOkay, I tie it around a tree.\n\n01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.000\nWait, what are you doing?\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.440\nIt's not polite to ask.\n\n01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.760\nWhat are you, are you having the cleric pull you up?\n\n01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.160\nHe's looking for a tree to tie the rope around.\n\n01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.320\nYeah, you should probably find a tree.\n\n01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.200\nYou're made of metal.\n\n01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.040\nOr like a big rock.\n\n01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.720\nAll right, so I'm on top of a trace button.\n\n01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.000\nSo I climb up the rope.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.480\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.680\nYou're up.\n\n01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.880\nNice.\n\n01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.520\nYou also hear this strange sound.\n\n01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.760\nIt's getting louder now than when you first came out.\n\n01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.600\nIt's like, oh no.\n\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.440\nIt's like,\n\n01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.440\nCha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.\n\n01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.520\nSo you pull, you both managed to find a rock.\n\n01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.760\nYou secure the rope to it and you pull a trace button up.\n\n01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.600\nHell yeah.\n\n01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.440\nThe sound keeps coming.\n\n01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.240\nOh, you got it.\n\n01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.080\nOh, you got it.\n\n01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.920\nCha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.\n\n01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.760\nLook at your height.\n\n01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760\nWhen you're finally able to pinpoint\n\n01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.120\nthe source of the sound, you look\n\n01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.960\nand you see the strangest sight.\n\n01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.960\nIt's like a giant dragonfly made of armor and glass,\n\n01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.000\nbut its wings are not wings at all.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.920\nThey're like javelins that are rotating around.\n\n01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.480\nIt's a helicopter.\n\n01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.320\nOh no.\n\n01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.480\nYour memories come flooding back to you\n\n01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480\nwhen you see it.\n\n01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.240\nThe three of you met in Vietnam.\n\n01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.080\nOh no.\n\n01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.040\nYou're having flashbacks.\n\n01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.880\nYou're remembering what happened to you.\n\n01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.880\nYou were part of an experimental drug torture operation\n\n01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.200\nadopted by the Viet Cong, financed by the Soviet Union.\n\n01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.200\nYou were prisoners of war and these things\n\n01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.120\nwere dripped into your eyeballs.\n\n01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:23.960\nOh no.\n\n01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.560\nThat's the last thing you remember,\n\n01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.800\nbut you now realize that your captain,\n\n01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.280\nCaptain Dander Pants, is in the helicopter\n\n01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.200\nand your pilot Murdoch is at the stick.\n\n01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.440\nThey're lowering the ladder down.\n\n01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.240\nGet up here, get up here, you candy asses.\n\n01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.320\nCome on, come on, get up.\n\n01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.960\nLet's do it.\n\n01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.560\nYou guys run to the ladder.\n\n01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.480\nYou start climbing up, but you hear Captain Dandy Pants\n\n01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.720\ngoing, what the fuck happened to you?\n\n01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.520\nWhat the fuck, you're a robot?\n\n01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.640\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.240\nOh, I don't know, I guess.\n\n01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.480\nLars, since motive, you have magic,\n\n01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.240\nlike the Detect Magic motive.\n\n01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.520\nDetect Magic on the helicopter?\n\n01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.000\nYeah, it's weird because you feel like you've had\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.440\nthis whole life as a cleric\n\n01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.880\nand that you don't know what a helicopter is,\n\n01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.040\nbut you have more memories from a life\n\n01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.960\nwhere you know what a helicopter is.\n\n01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.760\nYou have more of a relationship with that identity,\n\n01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.440\nthis soldier from Vietnam.\n\n01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.200\nBut I can detect magic still.\n\n01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.480\nYeah, you can totally, and there's no magic\n\n01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.120\non this helicopter, it's technological.\n\n01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120\nOh, shit.\n\n01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.520\nYou feel the Lars part of you kind of receding\n\n01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.800\nalmost as if it requires you to believe it's real\n\n01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.040\nin order to be real, but it's currently still pretty real\n\n01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.280\nbecause you just spent all this time in this jail cell.\n\n01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.440\nBut you also see this look on Captain Dandy Pants' face.\n\n01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.720\nHe's looking at you guys like he's actually deeply unsettled.\n\n01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.520\nHe recognizes your faces, but he did not expect\n\n01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.800\nto see what he's seeing.\n\n01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.920\nWhat happened to us down there?\n\n01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.720\nThat's what I was gonna ask you.\n\n01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.320\nGet in this goddamn helicopter.\n\n01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.320\nCome on, we can talk about it when we get to the DMT, C.\n\n01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.600\nD the D, the drop zone.\n\n01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.720\nCome on, you sons of bitches.\n\n01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.800\nDon't fucking judge my lack of Vietnam jargon.\n\n01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.160\nI was, let me finish.\n\n01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.800\nI

01:04:33.400\nIt's hard to be a supervisor of soldiers like you.\n\n01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.080\nIt makes your mind slip.\n\n01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.000\nIt's been a strenuous war.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nThis country's fighting itself.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.560\nMore than it's fighting the enemy.\n\n01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.000\nWe don't even know, I'm all fucked up.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.280\nI got one job I focus on so I can get through the day\n\n01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.920\nwithout putting a gun in my mouth.\n\n01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.920\nTake care of my boys.\n\n01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.720\nAnd you're the hardest boys I ever had to take care of\n\n01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.280\nand I love the fuck out of you.\n\n01:04:54.280 -->

soaring.\n\n01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.040\nThere's a strange roaring sound you hear to your right.\n\n01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.040\nYou see a huge swarm of baby dragons\n\n01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.160\nis coming out of a palm tree.\n\n01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nThe palm tree has, there was a hinge on the giant palm tree\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nand a bunch of baby dragons came out of it.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nI turn over to Lars and Tracebutt and go,\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nI think Captain Danny passes on DMT right now.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.840\nWhat?\n\n01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.840\nFuck you, I heard that.\n\n01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.840\nYou're not disrespectful.\n\n01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.120\nYou're not disrespectful.\n\n01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.560\nIt is to dismiss what we're doing over here\n\n01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.200\nis some kind of drug trip.\n\n01:05:47.200 -->

so.\n\n01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.680\nI mean, you're just remembering\n\n01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.840\nthat you were in Vietnam, right?\n\n01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.880\nI mean, you share that with them, I assume.\n\n01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.760\nYou're like, yeah, all I remember is being in Vietnam,\n\n01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.680\nbut then we woke up in the cell,\n\n01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.240\nbut we kind of have these identities.\n\n01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.880\nSo you kind of do your best to relate to him,\n\n01:06:21.880 -->

01:06:48.960\nis like lactating mothers.\n\n01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:57.000\nLike, as you continue to breastfeed the casting of spells,\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.080\nlike, you can tell that it's important to keep,\n\n01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.720\nit keeps you remembering Lars' life.\n\n01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.760\nAnd you're kind of like in this weird halfway spot\n\n01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.000\nwhere you're like half this Vietnam soldier named\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.160\nDiggins and half Lars.\n\n01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:14.880\nI remember.\n\n01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.720\nBut you're able to cast this spell, it very clearly works.\n\n01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.160\nYou guys see like magic energy come out of his hands,\n\n01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.680\nCaptain Dandy Pence is like, what the fuck?\n\n01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.920\nWhat is that, commie energy?\n\n01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.360\nHoly shit, your fucking hands got pink shit coming out of it!\n\n01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.880\nBut it clearly makes Murdoch a magnificent pilot,\n\n01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.880\nand he flies through these like, canyons\n\n01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.280\nand is evading these baby dragons.\n\n01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.200\nBaby dragons, what the fuck?\n\n01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.240\nCaptain Dandy Pence gets on a heavy machine

life.\n\n01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.920\nHoly shit, I should have loved my children.\n\n01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.160\nWhat's Project Omega?\n\n01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.120\nWe'll talk about it in the debrief.\n\n01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.200\nStand down, take that morphine or don't take it.\n\n01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.120\nIt's addictive.\n\n01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.000\nI'll take it.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.560\nOK, he shoots the baby dragons and the baby dragons\n\n01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.200\nkind of recede.\n\n01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.440\nThat was kind of a strange thing, like the baby dragon\n\n01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.040\nattack didn't seem very confident.\n\n01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.680\nSo the helicopter is taking you over the,\n\n01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.240\nit doesn't look like Vietnam, it looks like Palm Beach\n\n01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.200\nand it just takes you along this shoreline\n\n01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.280\nand then it takes you to this, it looks like an American\n\n01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.080\nmilitary base circa 1970, and you land.\n\n01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.600\nMan, this is nuts, right?\n\n01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.400\nDo I ever see this before?\n\n01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.040\nDo we?\n\n01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.640\nLars, you remember you're still like floating halfway\n\n01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.800\nbetween like being Diggins and being Lars.\n\n01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.600\nYou're like, you can equally remember\n\n01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.360\nbeing born in this like little hamlet of,\n\n01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.400\nin this like Middle Earth type realm where your parents\n\n01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.360\nwere persecuted for being witches and so you swore revenge\n\n01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.920\nand you ran away and you were raised by this weird coven\n\n01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.600\nof all women that were like super progressive\n\n01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.520\nand resented your maleness but also knew that in a misogynistic\n\n01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.160\nworld their greatest weapon would be like a male kind\n\n01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.480\nof priest that they could send out on secret missions.\n\n01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.120\nSo they did love you but they also, they were like,\n\n01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.360\nin a weird ironic kind of Judy Dench James Bond relationship\n\n01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.040\nthey were like not intimate mothers to you so it's crazy\n\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.080\nbecause you were raised by all like super powerful\n\n01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.880\nconfident women but they were very distant,\n\n01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.360\nlike they didn't want to like attach to you as a person.\n\n01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.040\nSo you're really kind of fucked up but you're also\n\n01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.880\nlike super powerful, like you're really good at focusing\n\n01:10:12.880

hate yourself for having a penis.\n\n01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.880\nBut it's like really effective and you're able\n\n01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.760\nto climb walls and if you meditate for an hour\n\n01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.480\nyou can turn into a bat and it's also clear to you,\n\n01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.520\nit's like that's your whole life\n\n01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.520\nbut then

received\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.360\nand so you ran away from home, you went to New York,\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.200\nyou started working in a diner, you lied about your age,\n\n01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.760\nyou didn't have to get a work permit and you worked at a bakery\n\n01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.640\nand then the draft came along and you actually

they've developed some ability\n\n01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.200\nto replicate your fucking personalities\n\n01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.600\nand that look in your fucking eyes, Diggins,\n\n01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.760\nthen they deserve to win.\n\n01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.680\nLet's go see the commander.\n\n01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.360\nCode 310, open up the belly.\n\n01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.920\nWhat you thought were trees now reveal themselves\n\n01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.040\nto be half tree, half human marines.\n\n01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.880\nOr are they just men in ghillie suits?\n\n01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.520\nYou don't know.\n\n01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.160\nBut if they are, they're like state of the fucking art.\n\n01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.880\nThey look like costumes from Wizard of Oz or something.\n\n01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.080\nThey look like trees, straight up trees,\n\n01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.120\nbut they've got faces and they've got ammunition\n\n01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.640\nand they're bandolier straps.\n\n01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.600\nYou think to yourself, why would you\n\n01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.680\ngo to the trouble of disguising a man as a tree\n\n01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.520\nand then put fucking belts and shit on him?\n\n01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.600\nBut then you think, hey, anything can be on a tree.\n\n01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.240\nWhat does a birdhouse make people go, hey,\n\n01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.720\nwhy is there a house in that tree?\n\n01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.360\nIt doesn't.\n\n01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.840\nIt's like, what about a little kid?\n\n01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.440\nOne of them has a kid up in his branches\n\n01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.640\nwho doesn't seem to even understand\n\n01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.040\nthat he's climbing a marine.\n\n01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.560\nAnd they start moving.\n\n01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.160\nWhereas before they moved, you didn't even notice them.\n\n01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.920\nThey were just like, oh, of course there's two trees\n\n01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.360\non this beach adjacent 1970s marine base\n\n01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:16.040\nand a tropical Vietnam coast base.\n\n01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.280\nThey go over to these rocks and they touch the rocks\n\n01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.480\nand these panels open on them and they're doing something.\n\n01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.720\nThey nod at each other and they press something\n\n01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.880\nat the same time.\n\n01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.400\nAnd this big, giant door starts opening\n\n01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.760\nand there's like a klaxon sounding.\n\n01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.760\nAnd it's like, there's this big door opens up\n\n01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.800\nand there's a staircase going down\n\n01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.960\nand Dandy Pants starts heading down.\n\n01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.560\nAnd the helicopter starts taking off.\n\n01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.760\nMurdoch goes like, hey, keep your cocks in your socks.\n\n01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.040\nAnd he takes off.\n\n01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.480\nYou too.\n\n01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.960\nDandy Pants looks back at you and goes, gentlemen,\n\n01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.880\nwe don't keep Lady Liberty's mouth open\n\n01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.600\nin this fucking cocks storm.\n\n01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.760\nShe's open wide for you.\n\n01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.240\nYou're going to go down her throat or what?\n\n01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.600\nCome on.\n\n01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.920\nLet's go.\n\n01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.680\nI think I find that offensive.\n\n01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.600\nWell, it definitely.\n\n01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.000\nIt's very offensive, actually, yeah.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.640\nYou go numb for that stuff, but it's definitely\n\n01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.040\nan unapologetically homophobic culture.\n\n01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.120\nPeople are just constantly calling each other fag\n\n01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.240\nand gay and implying that they're weak and all this stuff.\n\n01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.080\nAnd it's like, it drives you fucking nuts,\n\n01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.800\nbut it is what it is.\n\n01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.320\nAnd I was raised by women.\n\n01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.120\nYeah, well, your other half was.\n\n01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.920\nIn your Diggins half, you were just\n\n01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.520\nraised by a mom, pa, kind of like,\n\n01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.640\nit was just a regular kind of, like Norman Rockwell\n\n01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.520\nkind of upbringing.\n\n01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.360\nIf it weren't for your gayness, it\n\n01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.760\nwould have been a privileged life.\n\n01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.880\nBut your honesty, your compulsion\n\n01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.280\nto be who you really are and not put up\n\n01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.040\nwith torture of like having to conform,\n\n01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.000\nlike whereas no one else does, it made you go,\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.640\nlike, I'm not going to do this.\n\n01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.600\nAnd my mom and dad say they love me no matter what.\n\n01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.920\nYour mom told you once.\n\n01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.360\nShe said, son, do you know what love is when you were like 11?\n\n01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.080\nAnd you were just having weird feelings.\n\n01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.840\nLike you didn't know what if they were normal.\n\n01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.440\nYou didn't know who to talk to about it.\n\n01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.160\nBut your mom said to you once, son,\n\n01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.920\nI want you to know what the definition of love is,\n\n01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.320\nlike unconditional love.\n\n01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.520\nIt means if you ever killed somebody,\n\n01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.600\nI would help you bury the body.\n\n01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.560\nIt wouldn't matter to me if I thought you were right or wrong.\n\n01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.600\nI don't care if you turn out to be a serial killer.\n\n01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.280\nI would still try to keep you alive as long as possible.\n\n01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.600\nI would take a bullet for you.\n\n01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.200\nYou're my son, and I love you.\n\n01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.440\nAnd then when you came out to her,\n\n01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.600\nshe acted like you were a fucking monster.\n\n01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.080\nAnd it broke your heart.\n\n01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.040\nIt was terrible.\n\n01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:49.560\nLike she obviously was either lying about the death thing\n\n01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:53.080\nor she really hates gay people.\n\n01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.720\nBut in any case, it was just like you just fucking,\n\n01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720\nof course, you ran away.\n\n01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.040\nYou had to.\n\n01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.440\nIt wasn't even out of spite for them.\n\n01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.760\nIt was out of pain.\n\n01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.480\nYou had to start a new life on your own.\n\n01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.360\nAs a child, you were just a kid.\n\n01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.440\nAnd so now, but so you.\n\n01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.160\nWhat if she just really wanted to be an accessory to murder?\n\n01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.880\nThat's one of the questions you ask yourself.\n\n01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.440\nIt's like, maybe my mom just wanted to really\n\n01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.720\nhoped I would be a serial killer.\n\n01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.520\nMaybe she was more just disappointed.\n\n01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.680\nIt really fucks with you.\n\n01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.120\nBut you're in the army, but you're not out.\n\n01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.000\nYou're not openly gay.\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.400\nIt's literally against the rules.\n\n01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.760\nThey would kick you out of the army\n\n01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.120\nif you said that you were gay or if you like, yeah.\n\n01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.320\nI think you've gotten way accustomed to keeping things\n\n01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.200\nway at a distance.\n\n01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.200\nYou don't even flirt around with your closest friends\n\n01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.480\nlike knowing there's something that you have that.\n\n01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.320\nBut you do think, after all the shit you've\n\n01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.960\nbeen through with these guys, one thing\n\n01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.480\nthat you refuse to do is when they talk about pussy and stuff,\n\n01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.640\nlike, oh, OK, get back to stateside\n\n01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.440\nso I can take a labia and put it on my mouth\n\n01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.800\nand go, dah, dah, dah, dah.\n\n01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.280\nLike, you draw the line.\n\n01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.320\nYou're not going to lie.\n\n01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.960\nYou're not going to live a dishonest life.\n\n01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.920\nSo you're just kind of like nod and stuff.\n\n01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.480\nBut these guys, they were never like, what are you a faggot?\n\n01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.320\nHow come you don't talk about pussy with us?\n\n01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.600\nThey're just like, I think, but you wonder sometimes\n\n01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.560\nif maybe they think like, oh, and it's like,\n\n01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.040\nthere's a part of you that thinks if that's the case,\n\n01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.240\nif they know, and the fact that they're not\n\n01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.120\nbothering to ask you about it, corner you about it,\n\n01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.240\nin this fucked up, sick world, that's\n\n01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.120\nlike the love that your mom

01:25:08.080\nIt's safer this way.\n\n01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.960\nYou had some crazy experiences growing up\n\n01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.480\nin your Midwestern hometown that's like in the fog that\n\n01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.920\ngets created by abuse and experimentation in a society\n\n01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.040\nthat doesn't have conversations about it.\n\n01:25:24.040 -->

game.\n\n01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.840\nIt was like so many triangles and pixels that you can render before you're just like God damn it.\n\n01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:45.840\nDon't make it round.\n\n01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.840\nMake it a box.\n\n01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:57.840\nBut yeah it's a big black room and there's it's like like there's like a couple chairs in the corners but at the far end of it.\n\n01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:05.840\nIn front of a big screen is this like big desk and it's there's no one behind that desk.\n\n01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:23.840\nThere's a name plate on the desk that says general hodge hodge and but there's a there's a standing slightly to the side of that desk is a man in a three piece suit with shock white hair pure ivory hair.\n\n01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.840\nDamn.\n\n01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.840\nIt's more hair than you've ever seen and big white eyebrows.\n\n01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.840\nI guess it's Matthew Maudine in Stranger Things.\n\n01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840\nBut he also has a little goatee.\n\n01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840\nIt's Oh it's Colonel Sanders.\n\n01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840\nOh yeah.\n\n01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:49.840\nBut in a black suit Colonel Sanders in a black suit with horn rim glasses and he's not smoking so it doesn't bump with the smoking man in X files.\n\n01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.840\nIt's kind of like Colonel Sanders in a black suit with glasses.\n\n01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:55.840\nColonel Sanders has glasses.\n\n01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:06.840\nHe takes his glasses off his his piercing green eyes and you can't you can't see them closely yet.\n\n01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:12.840\nBut boy if you ever look at his eyes closely there's like this crazy thing I'll describe.\n\n01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.840\nBut he he says step forward into the light gentlemen.\n\n01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.840\nI go we we ran into mine flares.\n\n01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.840\nYou know about mine flares.\n\n01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:27.840\nI know about things that you've only just begun to understand.\n\n01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.840\nWell then learn that mine flares.\n\n01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.840\nIt's crazy huh.\n\n01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.840\nThat's bad news.\n\n01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840\nWhat's happening.\n\n01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.840\nThank you for that information soldier.\n\n01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.840\nStep forward into the light.\n\n01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.840\nOh I do that then.\n\n01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840\nLet's get a look at this.\n\n01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:47.840\nProject Omega in all its glory.\n\n01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:57.840\nIt seems you whippersnappers just found yourselves on the front lines of America's next brand of war.\n\n01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.840\nWhat is that.\n\n01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:07.840\nI cast I cast finished thought.\n\n01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:16.840\nYou do an amazing job but you're an orc fighter so you're just kind of like you just grunt at him.\n\n01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.840\nI'm suspicious of Colonel Sanders so from the darkness I'm going to cast detect magic him in the general actually.\n\n01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.840\nOh you cast detect magic.\n\n01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840\nOkay interesting.\n\n01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:30.840\nSo Colonel Sanders not magic like you're sweeping around the room.\n\n01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:36.840\nAre you trying to disguise that or are you doing it sneakily.\n\n01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.840\nAre you is it your it's your objective to not be known so you're okay taking a penalty for that reason.\n\n01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840\nSure.\n\n01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.840\nOkay so anyways you're fine.\n\n01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:55.840\nBut yeah so you the Colonel Sanders is not he's not magic and the general general hodge hodge is not magic.\n\n01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.840\nNothing in this room is magic except for a flower pot by one of the chairs in the corner.\n\n01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.840\nThere's a strange plant growing out of it and that screen behind the desk.\n\n01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.840\nIt's like like it's it's it's that's that's magical and then there's a there's a plant that's magical.\n\n01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.840\nSo that's glad you did that.\n\n01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.840\nWell I was really hoping you did that when I designed this room.\n\n01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840\nOh damn.\n\n01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.840\nI elbow Tom Tom and I say hey there's something up with that plan

the strange room.\n\n01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:36.840\nIt it definitely does a great job of distracting Colonel Sanders.\n\n01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:43.840\nHe's like well I'll be a Alabama side sloper.\n\n01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.840\nSide sloper.\n\n01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.440\nHe he he waves at the the general like he's a snap stand on the general like it's like\n\n01:43:50.440 -->

going to get worse and worse\n\n01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:28.440\nand worse and better and better and better you're gonna do so much for us we should probably tell\n\n01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:38.680\nhim exactly what's been going on at this point using our magic screen hit it the screen lights\n\n01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:51.720\nup with imagery that elucidate the topic as they explain to you guys that um don't fail me now\n\n01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:02.920\nthat the uh the the the the the the the the soviet union when it uh when it dug into\n\n01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:09.720\nvietnam and korea it started realizing long before the americans knew it that uh that a cold war\n\n01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.800\nwas a losing one for the soviet union that capitalism was probably gonna work because\n\n01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:22.040\ni mean you know we all know that now look how happy we are um it uh but they knew that they were\n\n01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:28.120\nyou know it wasn't gonna work in a in a square on fight so they started digging down into the earth\n\n01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:37.320\nin the places like cuba and north korea and and the like and they unearthed a subterranean cavern\n\n01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:48.760\nwhen they dug down into north korea and found a dragon egg and they heated it up with an electric\n\n01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:57.000\nblanket and and they they put it in an incubator and they studied it and it started to crack and\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:05.080\nhatch and when it did something crazy started happening that uh seddie the search for extraterrestrial\n\n01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.960\nintelligence started reporting to them which was then a secret project no one knew that it was\n\n01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:16.680\nactually started all the way back then uh and um that they were started to report like weird like\n\n01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:21.720\ntheir equipment that they used to scan for intelligence in outer space was actually picking\n\n01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:28.200\nup this weird signal that they first mistook for like is there an alien presence like two feet\n\n01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:33.640\noutside of earth's uh atmosphere that we can't see but then over time they started realizing\n\n01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:39.560\nthat there was this throbbing presence this signal that was previously unknown to mankind\n\n01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:44.520\nthat was emanating from the earth itself that something was happening so over time what they\n\n01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:49.720\nrealized is there was some kind of like awakening of magic energy that was happening uh at the point\n\n01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:55.720\nwhere this uh this dragon egg started hatching so they they stopped incubating the egg uh and took\n\n01:51:55.720 --> 01:52:02.760\nit to a secure facility uh more on that in the third adventure uh that we'll do uh new years um\n\n01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:12.520\nbut uh then they they found out that uh that so there's that you know um uh that magic is real\n\n01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:19.800\nand uh and they found like uh and the and the and the and the and the russians were oh there it is\n\n01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:29.400\nokay yeah they found out magic is real and uh and um and then uh so they started you they had already\n\n01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.880\nbeen doing like these programs like uh in the american military that where they're doing like\n\n01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:39.400\nremote viewing and and mk ultra and stuff like that experimenting with lsd and brainwashing and\n\n01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.920\nall this stuff um so spies american spies with that that had access to the information of what\n\n01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:52.600\nthe soviets had uncovered uh um they uh they used it to liberate some of this uh uh uh information\n\n01:52:52.600 --> 01:53:01.960\nand used it to dig down in uh uh los alamos uh uh because and find a dragon egg of their own um\n\n01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:09.080\nand uh it it they did not incubate it um but they uh they started chiseling into it and when they did\n\n01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:15.080\nthat um the person that was chiseling it uh got struck with a bolt in his eyeballs and he flew\n\n01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:21.320\nback and his hair turned white and he became this colonel sanders guy um so so that that's this guy\n\n01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:26.440\nhe was like uh he's like a head scientist from mit that they entrusted with this project and\n\n01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:31.560\nhis name is colonel's what we gave him a name before i can't remember um let's call him colonel\n\n01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:37.960\nsanders and uh he so he like and he he gained all this knowledge when he tried to like chisel into\n\n01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:43.800\nthis dragon egg and from his knowledge he started like dictating to uh like uh uh think tanks and\n\n01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:49.560\nstuff and they started writing up all of these like uh tomes and things like uh and storing them\n\n01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:58.040\nin transistorized devices and analyzing them and america so since like the 1959\n\n01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:03.160\nhas had this secret operation going where they've been like uh trying to like uh it's a magical\n\n01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:10.440\narms race that's been going on between the soviets and and and america uh uh all this time um uh\n\n01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:16.680\nit's it's it was largely like not generating any results but they um had been like training people\n\n01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:22.280\nto try to use this stuff like like they're you know like oh like like what if you uh read this\n\n01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:27.320\nstuff can you try can you cast spells can you do stuff and it wasn't really working that well\n\n01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:32.200\nbut it was getting enough results that it's got massive funding and god forbid the russians actually\n\n01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:36.200\naccomplish something before we do so that's just been going on underground which is why the defense\n\n01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:40.680\nbudgets are so enormous it's like how could a nuclear missile cost that much it's crazy it just\n\n01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:46.680\ntakes some nuclear shit and put it in a fucking uh bullet and throw it like like it's it's it's a huge\n\n01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.840\ninvention the idea that it takes a lot of money to make a nuclear missile all that money goes into\n\n01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.800\nalso schools it doesn't cost that much to teach children so all of that money uh has been secretly\n\n01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:03.480\nfunneled into uh into these programs and uh uh so when you guys joined the military uh you you\n\n01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.960\nyou went through basic training but then like through certain tests and things they detected\n\n01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:14.120\nkind of aptitude uh on your parts and then they started like funneling you over into these programs\n\n01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:21.560\num uh where you were getting uh trained for this other stuff and the the reason that we actually\n\n01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:27.080\nwent to vietnam isn't because we were trying to protect the you know the world from communism\n\n01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:34.040\nin the sense of like vietnam being strategic it's because they there's a site in in in vietnam where\n\n01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:41.400\nthe soviets had found this like weird like stonehenge like structure but underground in this\n\n01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:52.040\nlike cavern and uh it was like this like it it it it it made more magic uh and so they sent you guys\n\n01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:58.840\non a reconnaissance mission uh and uh and then you got captured but then they put they tried some\n\n01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:04.040\nweird shit on you and you had this whole adventure that we don't remember uh but you were and you\n\n01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:09.320\nwere in this different world and uh and then you you woke up in that in that cell and then then\n\n01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:14.520\nnow you're now you're remembering that this was all part of some crazy mission that started in\n\n01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:21.000\nin in vietnam and you still don't understand did you go through a portal i bet you did uh\n\n01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.600\nlike why like like like why were you uh on the other you know in this other world so like that's\n\n01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:33.720\nthese guys are like they've always suspected that the reason why these dragon eggs are creating this\n\n01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:41.080\nlike uh magic energy is because they're the only things from a different universe that uh uh and\n\n01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:47.080\nand uh that that exist in ours and that there must be some way to get to that universe where magic\n\n01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:52.920\nis normal and technology isn't and if you could get there then you could take magic energy and use\n\n01:56:52.920 --> 01:57:00.120\nit for military purposes over here and so it seems like maybe the russians have found a way to get\n\n01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:05.240\nto the other side and you guys must have been there and escaped i have one question for the\n\n01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:11.560\nfor the game i have one question
