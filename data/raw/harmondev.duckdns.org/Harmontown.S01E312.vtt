00:00.000 --> 00:26.400
Check, check. Howdy gang, how's it going? Thank you, give me a moment while I plug in.

00:26.400 --> 00:36.400
It smells always like awesome popcorn in here, which I love. Would you say, we love it.

00:36.400 --> 00:47.400
All right. Zac McKeever up there in the booth, how's it going, man? Give it up for Zach, the man with the...

00:47.400 --> 00:55.400
The guy who makes it sound good, and if it sounds not good, it's not Zach's fault. Because Zach rules.

00:55.400 --> 01:10.400
What's today's date? The 19th.

01:10.400 --> 01:24.400
From nearby downtown, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session. Please give it up for the hardest working game master in town, Spencer Crittenden.

01:24.400 --> 01:44.400
And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:44.400 --> 01:54.400
Two to the three to the four.

01:54.400 --> 02:02.400
I was still on four. You went on to six. Four to the four to the two to the six.

02:02.400 --> 02:18.400
Fuck your mama with dicks. Seven, eight. Ain't no hate. I went to fucking your mom. My name's fucking Tom. I like to fuck her hard.

02:18.400 --> 02:32.400
Yard. Always rhyme hard. With yard. Fucking your mom hard. Fuck her in the front yard. I'm gonna fuck her in the street.

02:32.400 --> 02:50.400
Fucking mama's can't be beat. Fucking mama on the surface of the sun. Fucking mama's job number one. Everybody's mama needs me to fuck them.

02:50.400 --> 02:55.400
One to the ten. Fuck your mama.

02:55.400 --> 03:03.400
All right. I was gonna say flamin. I was like, it's gonna get gross and kind of phone that one in there. And I got to be honest with you.

03:03.400 --> 03:11.400
Yeah. Well, I, you know, but you couldn't see I was trying not to. Don't you? And let's make the theme of the show gratitude because it's Thanksgiving.

03:11.400 --> 03:21.400
Aren't you thankful to me? You could see on my face. He's not enjoying this. And then you think like it's probably why he's do is it's not very entertaining.

03:21.400 --> 03:28.400
But then the last thought should be, yeah, but look at him go. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him.

03:28.400 --> 03:35.400
That sense of obligation on his face. I'm so fortunate to have a guy in his life that thinks he owes me something.

03:35.400 --> 03:40.400
You kind of phoned in the baby kicky dance too. It was like it was kind of a half baby kicky.

03:40.400 --> 03:52.400
Yeah. I honestly, I gotta be honest. I'm not in a bad mood or anything. I'm a little I'm a little exhausted because we just finished season three of Harmon Quest.

03:52.400 --> 03:58.400
Oh, yeah. Spencer. Spencer.

03:58.400 --> 04:11.400
Tag treasure season. Yeah. We got no treasure. No, you got so we got a little treasure. I think I got some treasure. This is going to be a fucking awesome season because Spencer fucking did all the hard work and all we did was just goof off.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.400
The guests were amazing. It's going to be good. Have you been moved backward?

04:16.400 --> 04:21.400
I've been every week. I've been withdrawing one inch.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.400
Are you trying to get out of the show?

04:23.400 --> 04:32.400
Are you trying to escape one of these days? So just like I'll I'll be announced and I'll just walk in and then walk out and take my place.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.400
Yeah, you're further afield than you normally are.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.400
Yeah. Yeah. You want me to upstage myself?

04:41.400 --> 04:48.400
No, we don't we don't we don't need nothing from nobody. But we're just yeah, I'm sure there's a sure there's a rhyme to the reason.

04:48.400 --> 05:05.400
I'm sure. And a reason for the season. I'm sure the president's committed treason. I'm sure I'm sure diseases cause lesions.

05:05.400 --> 05:14.400
Thanksgiving can't be beat. Fuck your mama and her feet. Put the turkey on a plate. Indians pilgrims hate.

05:14.400 --> 05:23.400
Put it aside. Sit down at a table. Make it wide. Eat the gravy. Wave wavy.

05:23.400 --> 05:32.400
Yeah. I mean, I'm like you were loose before the beat came on. You were you were you were spitting fire before that beat came on.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.400
Yeah. Well, the beat listen to that beat. It's like a little like a Zach. Just don't do it right now. But Zach, you got the beat.

05:38.400 --> 05:47.400
All right. Well, don't call my bluff with the beat. But I'm saying Zach, keep one in the chamber. So if I point at you with them, I'm ready to go.

05:47.400 --> 05:56.400
I was a little exhausted. I saw you at the drawing room today. I went in there to get my work done for Rick and Morty for the for before we.

05:56.400 --> 06:03.400
Yeah. And for people that think that Dan doesn't work hard, he sat at the drawing room with James, whatever his name is, one of the writers from the show.

06:03.400 --> 06:13.400
And you guys sat down there and Dan put like his pantomime, like thinking glasses on and sat down there and completely like worked on a script.

06:13.400 --> 06:19.400
Like you actually were doing hard Rick and Morty work there. Yeah, at a bar.

06:19.400 --> 06:25.400
I just had a little I just had a little loose end to tie up. So you know, one of the scripts started like to fix it a little bit.

06:25.400 --> 06:39.400
Yeah, you know, it wasn't that it wasn't so I mean, I don't I actually experienced a great deal of I was like, oh, shit, I only had one drink and then and then the and then I opened the laptop and I was like, I'm so like, I shouldn't do this.

06:39.400 --> 06:44.400
This is unprofessional. I was kind of like tired.

06:44.400 --> 06:57.400
And then and then I and then I finished up and I had a couple more drinks. Cody came by and then I went home and I went to bed and I woke up like an hour ago and and I'm just a little tired.

06:57.400 --> 07:03.400
And you've only got 65 more episodes to go. Yeah.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
What are we grateful for?

07:05.400 --> 07:17.400
I got my health. I got my career. I got Cody. I got you got your new video game that you spend more time with than anybody else.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.400
I got I got No Man's Sky is what you're referring to.

07:21.400 --> 07:35.400
I mean, I've got mixed feelings. You know, I'm enjoying playing No Man's Sky right now. I'm concerned that I'm going to stop enjoying it. But that doesn't seem like a fair thing to not enjoy about a game.

07:35.400 --> 07:48.400
That's not fair to the game. You can't call that a negative thing. I'm enjoying it right now. I keep playing it. But I looked ahead as it were. I kind of like, I typed in No Man's Sky Automation.

07:48.400 --> 07:55.400
Because I was like, are they very, what am I doing all this crap for? I'm never going to get get to watch it do itself.

07:55.400 --> 08:08.400
And the answer is no, no, you're going to run around collecting minerals forever. You're never going to get to just like make a machine that feeds into another machine and then puts it all into a chest.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.400
I want to play Minecraft again.

08:11.400 --> 08:21.400
It sounds like fancy Minecraft. It's Minecraft in space. It's like it's ticking a lot of boxes that should excite me a lot. It does excite me a lot. It's Minecraft in space.

08:21.400 --> 08:39.400
I want when is somebody going to understand I just want a game where you can you just go into an infinite universe and you you go around and you you you mine resources and then you you you you you craft stuff and then you you store it in in

08:39.400 --> 08:49.400
in chests. Like what? Why is that game 15 years old now? How come nobody can replicate it? I play all these kind of like Minecraft ask games.

08:49.400 --> 08:55.400
And they just they don't compare. I don't get it.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.400
Do you miss your Minecraft?

08:57.400 --> 09:06.400
I got I still know where it is. I can find it. I get a little tired of it after a while. I'll take like six months off of it. But then I'll end up going back to it.

09:06.400 --> 09:13.400
Initially. It's weird to me. I don't know. Like a relationship. Yeah.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.400
All right. Well, so are you okay?

09:15.400 --> 09:22.400
They are just tired. You just you're a little sleepy right now. You didn't answer that before you asked. I'm trying to dig a little deeper right now.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.400
Oh, okay.

09:23.400 --> 09:28.400
Well, we don't have to do the show if you don't want. I don't know.

09:28.400 --> 09:37.400
A lot of times when people ask, are you okay like that? They mean you're not okay or something like like so. I'm asking, is there something on your mind?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.400
Or is it simply just fatigue?

09:39.400 --> 09:47.400
Yeah, I couldn't have been more transparent forthcoming with that information. I led with it at the risk of bringing the entire audience down.

09:47.400 --> 09:58.400
These people that came out here paid good money, risked robbery on the sidewalk. And so I tried to be honest. That's all I have is my truth.

09:58.400 --> 10:04.400
So I'm like, yeah, I'm a little tired, a little exhausted. You know, I don't want to say that I don't feel like being here.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
That would be a rude thing to say to people that felt like being here.

10:06.400 --> 10:13.400
Well, we have a surprise for the audience tonight because tonight is it too early to announce what we're going to do for the finale of the show?

10:13.400 --> 10:18.400
No, I think, you know, we got to win them back. We're going to get these people.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.400
Because I was in the mood to play some D&D for all y'all.

10:23.400 --> 10:31.400
But for the first time because Spencer's also exhausted and rightfully so from doing Harmon Quest, he didn't bring any of his materials.

10:31.400 --> 10:37.400
So tonight Dan is going to be Dungeon Master and Spencer and I are going to play D&D together.

10:37.400 --> 10:43.400
Okay.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.400
Do you think you got what it takes right now to be a Dungeon Master?

10:46.400 --> 10:51.400
Yeah. Let's do it now.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.400
This is not enough.

10:53.400 --> 11:03.400
Oh shit.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.400
Where's Spencer theme?

11:06.400 --> 11:09.400
I just wanted to sit down.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.400
Is this how you usually keep the microphone?

11:12.400 --> 11:15.400
Oh yeah.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.400
What do you mean?

11:17.400 --> 11:20.400
Are you taller than me?

11:20.400 --> 11:23.400
I'm a hunter.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.400
I'm kind of doing that, yeah.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
Don't you ever want it to be a little lower?

11:30.400 --> 11:34.400
I do. That's why I bend it down lower.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
Right.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
Right?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
Poor little thing.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.400
No, no.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
This is a silly way to have a mic. It's blocking half your face.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.400
That's what I like about it.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.400
You know what I got going on back there most of the time?

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
Hard on?

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
Ants.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
AIDS.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
Ants.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.400
Ants.

11:56.400 --> 12:02.400
You see how a little bit of AIDS back there.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
Spencer, what are you grateful for?

12:04.400 --> 12:11.400
Oh, I'm grateful for friends and fun and food.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
Oh, food.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
Oh man, you guys, holy shit.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
We were in New York.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.400
I got this banana pudding at this place called Magnolia Bakery.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.400
It was so good.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
I went back.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.400
I bought two more banana puddings.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
It was so good.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
I went back home.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.400
There was a Magnolia Bakery in L.A.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.400
I went back and bought some more.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.400
It was so good.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.400
All of the dressing rooms at the Harmon Quest shoot,

12:39.400 --> 12:41.400
there was a note on our table that said,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
look in the fridge.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Yeah.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.400
And there was two banana puddings,

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
one for me, one for church.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
Maybe there was two in every fridge.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
And they were all for Jeff and Church.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.400
And it said, this banana pudding is from Spencer.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.400
It was very sweet of you.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.400
And that shit was good.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.400
It's so good.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.400
And you can make it yourself because I have the recipe.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.400
Next time in town,

13:07.400 --> 13:10.400
I want you to bring enough banana pudding for everybody.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
All right.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.400
That's easy enough.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
All right.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.400
What kind of characters are you interested in portraying today, gentlemen?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
What does Jeff want?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
You're the game master, Dan.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.400
What kind of realm do you want to put us in?

13:24.400 --> 13:27.400
The fantasy realm, like all Pathfinder D&D?

13:27.400 --> 13:28.400
Yes.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.400
Okay.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.400
And yeah, Spencer, what kind of class?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
Do you want dice?

13:34.400 --> 13:35.400
It's going to freestyle.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
I could use a couple of dice.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.400
Did anybody bring any dice, by the way?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
No.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.400
See, in the old days, our fans all had dice.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
In the old days.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
Yeah.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
I mean, I'll just roll them in my mind.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.400
That's fair.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.400
It's my favorite James Taylor song.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.400
I'll be rolling in my mind.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.400
That's Billy Ocean.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.400
You've got dice that I'm rolling,

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
rolling in my mind.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.400
20 sides of booty.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.400
20 sides of booty.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.400
20 sides of booty?

14:13.400 --> 14:14.400
Yep.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
Oh, you got dice?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.400
For real?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.400
Bring them up, bring them up, sir.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
Now we're talking.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.400
Oh, shit.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.400
Oh, thank you, sir.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
What's your name?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
Greg.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
Greg, everybody.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
Oh, shit.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
Greg, have a seat for a moment, Greg.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.400
Let's meet you for a moment.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.400
Are you a longtime Harmontown goat?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
Do you come here a lot?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.400
No, this is my first time here.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.400
Your first time here?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
Oh, shit.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
Not my first Harmontown, though.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.400
And you had the prescience to bring a sack full of dice?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.400
It's in my backpack.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.400
Really?

14:51.400 --> 14:52.400
Fantastic.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
Are you a game master or just a game player?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.400
Just a game player.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.400
What do you play?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.400
Mostly Pathfinder.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.400
We just started a fifth edition game with some of my friends,

15:01.400 --> 15:05.400
and I'm going to join a Wednesday game coming up next week.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
Damn.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
It's fun.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.400
Fantastic.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.400
Greg, was it?

15:09.400 --> 15:10.400
Yeah.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.400
Where are you from?

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
Santa Monica, actually.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
Santa Monica.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.400
Should we keep Greg up here and play along with us?

15:15.400 --> 15:20.400
Yeah.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.400
I mean, we're using your lumber right now.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
We should keep you up here.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.400
Dan, how do you want to start this off?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.400
Do you need anything from us?

15:27.400 --> 15:29.400
Greg, what kind of character...

15:29.400 --> 15:30.400
It's Greg?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
Yeah, it's Greg.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.400
What kind of character do you like to play,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
or would you like to play?

15:36.400 --> 15:38.400
I could be a cleric.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Okay, done.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Damn.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
What do you want to be, Jeff?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
Jeff.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
I never do this.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
I've never done this like a straight-up fighter.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
I want to be like a warrior.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
All right.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Spencer.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.400
Can I be a thief?

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
Yes.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
Yeah.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.400
Be a what?

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
A rogue.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
Oh, yeah.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
Oh, yeah.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.400
Bone-relieval stat.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Right.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.400
All right, so we got Greg as a cleric,

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
me as a warrior,

16:05.400 --> 16:07.400
Spencer as a thief, rogue.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
Mm-hmm.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
All right.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
Oh, boy.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
Okay.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.400
You can feel the fucking awesome dramatic tension.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.400
No, I'm excited.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.400
Oh, shit.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
Lighting change.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.400
Lighting change.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.400
I'm rendering your campaign in my head.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
It's now loading.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.400
Compiling, yeah.

16:28.400 --> 16:36.400
Tip, if you attack an enemy, you gain experience.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.400
Oh, that's a load screen, too.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.400
Yeah.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.400
Okay, Dan, whenever you're ready,

16:44.400 --> 16:47.400
I'll give you the Spencer theme so you can do the thing,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
or do you want to talk this out for a bit?

16:49.400 --> 16:52.400
It's probably best to just jump in

16:52.400 --> 16:55.400
before I can really think about this, I think,

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
because what am I going to do?

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
Make it good.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.400
Throughout history, the realm of fall staff

17:02.400 --> 17:07.400
has been besieged by war and famine.

17:07.400 --> 17:15.400
This war-torn, famineous realm has a swan center

17:15.400 --> 17:20.400
of population in the dead middle of it,

17:20.400 --> 17:28.400
a bustling, thriving city called Cintopolis,

17:28.400 --> 17:34.400
where men and women and non-binary unicorns

17:34.400 --> 17:42.400
from clothes lines and pursue other acts of happiness.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.400
But an omen of doom is on the horizon

17:46.400 --> 17:50.400
for this normally peaceful realm.

17:50.400 --> 18:01.400
For the king of tribbles is planning something

18:01.400 --> 18:06.400
unbeknownst to our heroes who find themselves locked

18:06.400 --> 18:11.400
in a dungeon deep in the town hall of Cintopolis

18:11.400 --> 18:21.400
for crimes which they can't even talk about yet.

18:21.400 --> 18:33.400
The blue apron.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.400
Okay, yeah, so basically you guys are in,

18:36.400 --> 18:41.400
you're in, oh man, you're in this jail cell.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.400
There's like bars and stuff,

18:43.400 --> 18:47.400
it's like so many bars, it's like so jail-y.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
How many bars?

18:49.400 --> 18:56.400
Oh man.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.400
You deduce that there's about 12 bars.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.400
Yeah.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.400
It's easy, right?

19:06.400 --> 19:11.400
I am an orc warrior and I go up to the bars

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
and see if I can try to bend them with my strength.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.400
Okay, so do you guys see that those big orc warriors

19:17.400 --> 19:19.400
just going up to the bars

19:19.400 --> 19:21.400
and he's just like trying to,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.400
as if he's trying to bend the bars.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.400
But you guys don't know each other.

19:26.400 --> 19:31.400
You all three just woke up about 20 minutes ago

19:31.400 --> 19:36.400
and now this orc fighter is just bending at the bars.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.400
You find them immovable.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.400
Hey.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.400
Hi.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.400
My name's Tom.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.400
Uh...

19:49.400 --> 19:52.400
Tom.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
Tom.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
Tom, Tom, Tom.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
My name is Tom, Tom, Tom.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.400
Just call me Tom.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.400
These bars are immovable.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
Hi Tom.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.400
I'm Lars.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
Lars Stevens.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.400
And I'm a cleric.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.400
Use some of your magic to get me out of this jail.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
I have a baby to feed.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.400
Oh.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
Whoa, that's crazy.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
Who are you?

20:24.400 --> 20:27.400
My name is Trace Butt.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
Trace Butt?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.400
Yeah.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
Trace Butt.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
Uh, you...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.400
You, you notice...

20:35.400 --> 20:46.400
As you're kind of casing the jail cell with your thief casing instincts,

20:46.400 --> 20:54.400
you see at the bottom of every other one of the bars is a tiny rune.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.400
At the bottom of these bars are runes.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.400
This thief guy says that.

21:00.400 --> 21:06.400
Can I use my knowledge of magics to determine if they're magical runes?

21:06.400 --> 21:09.400
Waving your arms in a magical manner.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.400
You, uh, you, you, you bring...

21:12.400 --> 21:17.400
Oh man, you, you, you, you, you detect so much.

21:17.400 --> 21:25.400
These are standard runes from the magic guild of the, of the, the, the, the lords over this realm's magic activities.

21:25.400 --> 21:29.400
They're basically like, uh, just sort of containment runes.

21:29.400 --> 21:35.400
So basically like this is a jail cell for, you know, people, whether they're magic or not.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
It's pretty standard runes.

21:36.400 --> 21:42.400
Like you, if you were to try to turn invisible in here, it would, it would, it would either not let you

21:42.400 --> 21:47.400
or it would alert somebody or like maybe like, um, in a pool when you try to pee.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.400
And it, it would, it would like stain you.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.400
Yeah.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.400
You just, all you know is that it's secure, there's security runes.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
That's no good.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.400
You guys, you guys saw this cleric, he's like...

21:59.400 --> 22:02.400
He's like, like, scrutinizing these runes.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.400
Oh man, what are you doing?

22:04.400 --> 22:07.400
I'm, uh, we can't use magic to get out of here, I think.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.400
Or if we do, it'll alert the guards.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
Okay.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
I can try, though.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.400
Well, what if, uh, what do these locks look like?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
Sorry, what?

22:17.400 --> 22:20.400
What do the locks look like on the, on the bar, on the door?

22:20.400 --> 22:21.400
Oh man.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.400
You look like a thief.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.400
You can pick a lock, right?

22:23.400 --> 22:24.400
I've seen some locks.

22:24.400 --> 22:29.400
The locks look like nothing to you because they lock from the other side.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.400
Damn.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.400
Clever.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.400
Yeah.

22:32.400 --> 22:41.400
Uh, I'll, I mean, being a thief, you, you, you've been in jail cells before.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
I've been in jail cells before.

22:42.400 --> 22:47.400
And so, like, you're pretty, you, you, you, you think, you know, looking for, even just

22:47.400 --> 22:53.400
looking at the back of this lock, like the casing for it, you kind of know it's, uh,

22:53.400 --> 22:54.900
it's pretty heavy duty stuff.

22:54.900 --> 22:58.400
It's like anti-thief lock.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.400
This is my worst enemy.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.400
Hey, quit looking at that lock, thief.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
Um, okay.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
Okay.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.400
This guy comes over.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
This guy comes over.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.400
He's like, he's got fox pelts all over his shoulders.

23:11.400 --> 23:16.400
Um, he's got a wooden crown, uh, that's blood stained.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.400
Uh, he's wearing spectacles.

23:18.400 --> 23:23.400
Uh, one, one of the lenses in his spectacles is a dark green.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.400
Uh, the other is, is no glass at all.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.400
It's just, there's just a hole there.

23:28.400 --> 23:36.400
Um, he is wearing high healed shoes, uh, and, and, and carrying two swords.

23:36.400 --> 23:42.400
Um, and he's got a, he's got a key ring on his belt, uh, and gravy all over his chin.

23:42.400 --> 23:47.400
Uh, he gives you a very intimidating look and you, you, you remember, uh, once he looks

23:47.400 --> 23:53.400
at you as your memory comes back that, uh, this is the, this is the guy that, uh, uh,

23:53.400 --> 23:54.400
sentenced you.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
His name is Judge Doom.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
Oh no.

23:58.400 --> 24:04.400
Don't look at that lock, thief, or I'll put you in a cell that you'll never get out of.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.400
What?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.400
He, he, uh, why, why?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
What cell?

24:08.400 --> 24:09.400
What cell?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.400
It's a cell called death.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
Glad you asked.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
I thought that's where you were headed, but I wasn't sure.

24:14.400 --> 24:20.400
Yeah. Also, we do have, uh, strictly like harder to get out of cells here, but that's

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
for like a class criminals.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
Right.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
You don't deserve it.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.400
Oh shit.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.400
Your piece is a shit, all of you.

24:27.400 --> 24:31.400
You don't come into Sitopolis and act the way you acted last night.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.400
How was that?

24:32.400 --> 24:39.400
Just, I don't owe you any, oh, I do owe you answers.

24:39.400 --> 24:49.400
You know, you were acting all fucking badass and trying to talk, talking about where's

24:49.400 --> 24:52.400
the, where's the, where's the squid?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.400
Uh, where's the squid ink?

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
Uh, we don't have to tell you that.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.400
If you don't know where the squid ink is, then you're an outsider.

24:59.400 --> 25:03.400
If you're asking about squid ink and you're an outsider, that means you're an investigator.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.400
Sitopolis doesn't like being investigated for its squid ink.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.400
I can't believe I'm talking about this so much.

25:09.400 --> 25:14.400
And he, he starts as he's saying that he reaches for, in a, in a pouch and he pulls out.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.400
And he, you, you guys see that there's this little tiny creature, he pulls out of a pouch.

25:18.400 --> 25:22.400
It looks very squid like and he squeezes it.

25:22.400 --> 25:27.400
Um, and you all need to save for, uh, uh, mental magic.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
Oh no.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.400
Okay.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.400
All right.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.400
Okay.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.400
Uh, uh, uh Uh, Tracebutt.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.400
Yeah.

25:35.400 --> 25:35.920
Yeah.

25:35.920 --> 25:39.560
Tracebot, you see your thief instincts

25:39.560 --> 25:42.560
make you dodge to the side and hold your breath.

25:42.560 --> 25:48.240
This isn't your first time at the gas attack rodeo.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.960
But Tom, Tom, Tom, and shit.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.600
What was it?

25:53.600 --> 25:54.880
Lars.

25:54.880 --> 26:00.360
Both of you guys inhale this weird, greasy, inky cloud of gas.

26:00.360 --> 26:05.200
Your minds are like, you can't control your thoughts anymore.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.560
You start thinking weird shit about it.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.800
You see an image of a ship.

26:10.800 --> 26:16.560
You see a mountain with a church on top of it.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.720
Then you see inside the church ostensibly,

26:20.720 --> 26:22.520
although you don't know.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.120
You're just using the kind of Eisenstein principles

26:25.120 --> 26:27.280
of establishing shots from your memories.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.480
But it could be the inside of a completely different church.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.520
But you saw a church, and now you're

26:32.520 --> 26:35.560
seeing the inside of a church, and there's a flash image.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.400
And you see blood filling the church.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.760
And you see this judge doom at the front of it, laughing.

26:41.760 --> 26:47.680
And then you black out relative to you, Tracebot.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.880
These guys just fall down, and they're unconscious.

26:50.880 --> 26:54.400
And then they don't wake up for at least an hour.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.560
So if there's things you want to do while they're asleep.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.200
So what's the judge doing then?

27:00.200 --> 27:01.160
Is he still hanging out?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.320
He walks away.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.920
I mean, you know what?

27:03.920 --> 27:08.560
I should, I mean, he, OK.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.240
He can.

27:09.240 --> 27:13.880
Well, now, he notices that it doesn't affect you,

27:13.880 --> 27:15.200
that it didn't take with you.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.120
I'm holding my breath.

27:16.120 --> 27:16.720
Yeah.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.480
And then he's like, he's like, ah, you're not worth it.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.680
And he walks away.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.440
Sorry.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.320
It's all right, it's fine.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.320
Gotta go refill this squid now.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.040
Shit, man.

27:30.040 --> 27:34.760
And he walks about 10 feet down a hallway,

27:34.760 --> 27:37.840
lined with stone, wet stone.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.920
And he goes through what you can hear.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.480
You can't see it from here, but you're

27:42.480 --> 27:44.240
using your thief casing instincts

27:44.240 --> 27:47.320
to notice it's probably a very large wooden door

27:47.320 --> 27:49.440
with many locks on it.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.000
All of them remaining unlocked.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.760
But you can just hear the clanging.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.160
And your thief ears are going like,

27:56.160 --> 27:58.000
there's a lot of fucking locks on that door.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.240
And I'm trying to count as steps, too, to the distances.

28:01.240 --> 28:09.040
You put that door at about 30 feet away from the cell door,

28:09.040 --> 28:15.560
just around a kind of jagged corner, as if there's like.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.640
So all you know is that there's a hallway,

28:18.640 --> 28:21.240
and then it comes around, and then there's this cell.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.680
There's no cells next to it.

28:23.680 --> 28:28.360
And then that hallway, it ends at a dead end,

28:28.360 --> 28:30.520
right out in front of your cell.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.960
There's a table there with candles on it.

28:32.960 --> 28:38.160
There's a torch above that, weird redundancy.

28:38.160 --> 28:42.560
And there's some stuff on the table.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.600
But is there anything in the cell or anything?

28:45.600 --> 28:47.960
The cell has two benches.

28:47.960 --> 28:55.440
And no windows.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.960
So I don't have any tools or anything because I'm prison.

28:58.960 --> 28:59.760
Yeah, no.

28:59.760 --> 29:06.120
You guys are wearing burlap robes there.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.680
It seemed like standard issue.

29:07.680 --> 29:10.200
But Lars and I are still asleep for an hour, right?

29:10.200 --> 29:10.800
Yeah.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.640
So you did all that to do this.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.600
I mean, I figure an hour is a long time for a thief.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.680
So if there's anything else you want to know, I'm going to pick.

29:16.680 --> 29:20.160
I can't really try and pick the lock with my hands, I'd assume.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.400
That'd be crazy.

29:21.400 --> 29:25.800
I mean, you can, you know, you try to.

29:25.800 --> 29:29.880
Well, what if I have we revealed what races we are?

29:29.880 --> 29:33.480
I'm an orc warrior.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.560
I'm an elf.

29:34.560 --> 29:39.320
Can I be a warforged, a robot man?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.720
OK.

29:41.720 --> 29:42.960
You do that.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.320
How does this, do I sound like a robot?

29:45.320 --> 29:46.120
Yeah.

29:46.120 --> 29:46.720
OK.

29:51.720 --> 29:56.600
You are a warforge, a crazy, intricate clockwork man

29:56.600 --> 29:59.320
from a strange realm.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.880
You're made of metal and things.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.600
So you do have powers that other humans don't have,

30:04.600 --> 30:06.000
even when you're naked.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.520
Can I try and take my finger off to make it a lot bigger?

30:09.520 --> 30:17.800
You do that, and you successfully are functioning,

30:17.800 --> 30:21.160
but you're unable to pick this lock with your finger lock.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.240
Bam.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.360
Only for the time being, though, it's just a failure

30:26.360 --> 30:27.080
in that sense.

30:27.080 --> 30:32.360
The door immediately, as soon as you start even looking

30:32.360 --> 30:37.200
at that lock, let alone picking out that door opens again,

30:37.200 --> 30:40.880
and Judge Doom comes back, and he goes like,

30:40.880 --> 30:41.960
what the hell are you doing?

30:41.960 --> 30:44.520
I told you the first time, not to fuck with that lock.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.520
Oh, yeah.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.680
No, I'm not, yeah.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.040
I, you got me.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.160
What are you doing with your finger?

30:54.160 --> 30:55.120
Oh, with it?

30:55.120 --> 30:56.120
No, no.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.440
This is just normal.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.080
Oh, man, you must have really broke my finger.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.640
You know how these models can be.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.440
Yeah.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.360
Well, that's totally convincing.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.080
It doesn't matter anyway.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.640
You're all food for the mother hen.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.240
And he walks away.

31:19.240 --> 31:22.040
All right, well, can I wait for him to walk away, I guess?

31:22.040 --> 31:24.360
And then can I try and wake people up, these guys up?

31:28.560 --> 31:33.120
You successfully wake Tom Tom Tom up earlier

31:33.120 --> 31:34.800
than he would have woken up.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.360
Whereas Lars continues to sleep.

31:37.360 --> 31:42.480
The exact duration of the effect of the squid ink.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.040
I don't know what to do, you guys.

31:44.040 --> 31:47.360
I feel like we could just wait it out.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.920
No, we'll get fed to the hen.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.440
And you're asleep.

31:52.440 --> 31:58.080
I have a, I have sensed a weakness in one of the walls

31:58.080 --> 32:00.320
in this cell.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.360
That would be crazy.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.080
He successfully convinces you that that's true.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.840
That's awesome.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.080
What else do you see?

32:10.080 --> 32:17.120
I use metal punch.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.520
And I punch the west wall of it.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.600
Because I feel, I've been scratching it,

32:21.600 --> 32:25.080
like ticking off the days that we've been there.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.760
And I feel like the plaster or whatever

32:27.760 --> 32:29.520
they've used to make that wall is a little weaker

32:29.520 --> 32:30.440
than the other walls.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.000
And I use metal punch.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.320
Oh, I believe in him.

32:33.320 --> 32:33.880
Yes.

32:33.880 --> 32:37.560
And I give it everything I have.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.880
You hurt your hand.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.120
You got this.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.640
Keep it up.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.440
Lars, you are now awake.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.560
Whoa.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.840
I had a dream about a bloody church.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.560
Holy shit.

32:49.560 --> 32:50.600
Tell me about that.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
Have you always been a robot?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.520
Yeah, but no one paid attention.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.280
Oh, OK.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.160
When he mentions that bloody church, Trace,

32:59.160 --> 33:03.880
but you, because you didn't sleep and because he had the image

33:03.880 --> 33:06.240
you started, you're putting something together,

33:06.240 --> 33:08.920
you feel like maybe you actually know these guys,

33:08.920 --> 33:13.160
that you remember that you came to this town together,

33:13.160 --> 33:16.920
and that you were coming here for some reason that had to do.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.400
Because when he says bloody church,

33:18.400 --> 33:23.080
you're like, whoa, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.320
Why are we coming here?

33:25.320 --> 33:29.600
You guys hear a distant crowd cheering.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.480
It's so distant that they might have

33:31.480 --> 33:33.920
been there the whole time doing things other than cheering,

33:33.920 --> 33:35.520
but now they're cheering so loud that you

33:35.520 --> 33:37.760
hear them for the first time.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.760
Oh, shit.

33:40.760 --> 33:44.200
The door opens, same door as before,

33:44.200 --> 33:48.240
and Judge Doome comes walking down and says, all right, you

33:48.240 --> 33:53.560
fucks, you ready to feed the hen?

33:53.560 --> 33:56.480
No.

33:56.480 --> 34:01.960
Well, you wouldn't make good hen food if you were ready.

34:01.960 --> 34:06.680
Smuggles, diggles, get in here.

34:06.680 --> 34:16.480
These squid-headed priests come in, and they're wearing robes.

34:16.480 --> 34:23.160
They kind of look like, Tom, Tom, Tom, you recognize them.

34:23.160 --> 34:26.160
You recognize them as mind flayers.

34:26.160 --> 34:32.000
They're psychic monsters, sentient, though.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.360
They're not monsters in the sense that they can't vote

34:34.360 --> 34:38.240
and stuff, like they're people.

34:38.240 --> 34:45.080
They just look horrible, and they like to kill people.

34:45.080 --> 34:45.880
We shouldn't judge them.

34:45.880 --> 34:51.720
I mean, they're probably the heroes of their own stories,

34:51.720 --> 34:56.840
but the orcs are terrified of them,

34:56.840 --> 35:00.720
because they're particularly susceptible to their psychic

35:00.720 --> 35:04.560
attacks, but you're not operating in a penalty

35:04.560 --> 35:08.200
or anything like that, but you know they can fuck you up.

35:08.200 --> 35:12.600
So Judge Doome is like, all right, fucks, it's time.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.600
And he nods at one of the mind flayer guys,

35:16.600 --> 35:19.360
and they gesture at the lock, and it clicks,

35:19.360 --> 35:21.520
and the cell door opens.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.960
It opens wide.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.680
It opens wide as a cell door.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.560
It can open.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.280
You're now in an open cell.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.520
What do you guys want to do?

35:29.520 --> 35:30.680
Should we run for it?

35:30.680 --> 35:33.760
I'll defer.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.880
Can we run for it?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.920
I think we run for it, but we run together.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.920
How many mind flayers are there?

35:40.920 --> 35:41.280
How many?

35:41.280 --> 35:42.320
Oh, there's two.

35:42.320 --> 35:42.920
Oh, man.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.840
There's just two, and Judge Doome.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.800
He can see you guys thinking about running.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.240
I'm going to hide in the corner.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.400
You're going to end the cell?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.760
Yeah.

35:52.760 --> 35:57.760
You do a passable job of hiding in the corner of the cell.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.800
I know you're over there.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.880
I'm not involved in this.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.760
It's pretty impressive how concealed you are over there.

36:04.760 --> 36:08.840
Thank you for showing me your skills.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.080
I'm glad you're in there.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.560
Yeah.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.160
Do we have any inventory, or just our prison garb?

36:14.160 --> 36:16.280
You're just wearing burlap sacks.

36:16.280 --> 36:22.600
You have what's called a holdout dagger in your rectum.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.320
It's very dull, but it's like you come

36:25.320 --> 36:31.360
from a tribe of warriors at puberty that was inserted.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.480
It stays up there for most of your life.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.160
It's honestly more of a ceremony.

36:37.160 --> 36:37.800
All right.

36:37.800 --> 36:43.160
Well, I take my holdout dagger out of my rectum

36:43.160 --> 36:46.720
and also use my sharpened toothbrush

36:46.720 --> 36:48.960
over time while I was there.

36:48.960 --> 36:53.640
And I'm a two-hand fight attack on one of the guards.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.120
OK.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.080
I'm a two-hand fighter.

36:55.080 --> 36:59.640
I can't let you pretend that you created a toothbrush.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.840
I'm not going to let you do that.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.960
Yeah, it's been one night.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.280
But is that metagaming to have created a toothbrush?

37:06.280 --> 37:08.760
Well, yeah, you can't just say, by the way, I did this.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.160
OK.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.560
Although, I'm giving you a little latitude

37:10.560 --> 37:12.280
because you don't have character sheets and stuff

37:12.280 --> 37:15.600
like that, but I'm calling the toothbrush out of bounds.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.080
OK, OK.

37:16.080 --> 37:16.600
Bullshit.

37:16.600 --> 37:22.120
I take my out-of-bounds dagger out of my butt

37:22.120 --> 37:25.800
and put it like, I kind of like.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.280
Well, hold on because it's one action to do that,

37:29.280 --> 37:30.720
and I rolled for it.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.840
And you do such a bad job of.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.640
Oh, no.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.280
But it's actually kind of good news

37:35.280 --> 37:38.200
because you're doing such a bad job of getting

37:38.200 --> 37:41.640
the dagger out of your ass that you just,

37:41.640 --> 37:43.080
he doesn't know you have one yet.

37:43.080 --> 37:48.040
So you're just like digging all the way up your ass,

37:48.040 --> 37:51.640
and it looks like you're, he's like, oh, orcs.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.240
Yeah, perfect.

37:55.240 --> 37:55.720
That place is racist.

37:55.720 --> 37:56.360
He is racist.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.480
I am racist.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.960
I hate all races.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.800
And then you see him look over at one of his mind

38:03.800 --> 38:06.000
flayers who didn't seem to react.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.840
But he's like, he's like, whatever.

38:09.840 --> 38:13.240
Identity politics.

38:13.240 --> 38:16.800
I hate identity politics.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.360
All right.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.240
I hate identity politics.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.960
He keeps saying it because he's not,

38:20.960 --> 38:22.880
he wants to get a rise out of people, I guess.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.360
Do I see, oh.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.240
He really thinks it means something.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.880
I hate identity politics.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.760
Do I see Tom Tom pull out his dagger?

38:31.760 --> 38:32.880
Or try to pull out his dagger?

38:32.880 --> 38:34.080
He hasn't done it yet.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.640
No, yeah, you just see the same thing

38:35.640 --> 38:38.440
that everybody else saw, which is like this orc

38:38.440 --> 38:43.080
is just digging in his butt, like he's like his own puppet.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.320
But so your hand is still up your ass,

38:46.320 --> 38:48.520
so I would actually let you take another try.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.800
I believe in you.

38:51.800 --> 38:56.840
I pretend that I'm asleep.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.480
Do you remove your hand from your hand?

38:58.480 --> 39:02.280
No, no, I pretend that I'm an orc who

39:02.280 --> 39:05.720
put my hand up his own butt, and then he goes, oh.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.840
Like the chimpanzee in the video.

39:07.840 --> 39:08.800
I passed out.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.920
It's like I'm playing possum right now.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.640
No sleeping, get up.

39:15.640 --> 39:19.320
You feel a stab of otherworldly pain in your frontal lobe.

39:19.320 --> 39:22.240
Oh, shit.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.560
You got psychic attacked.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.640
I got psychic attacks.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.760
It's searing pain in your brain.

39:28.760 --> 39:32.680
But I have a constitution of 21.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.680
Well, that doesn't matter.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.960
It still hurts.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.360
But I care less about it.

39:40.360 --> 39:45.200
Well, I'm just a sleepy orc with a hand up his own butt.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.440
A creepy voice whispers in your brain,

39:47.440 --> 39:50.280
there will be more pain.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.120
Let's just go with these guys.

39:53.120 --> 39:58.120
You hear a voice from a mostly concealed shadow

39:58.120 --> 40:00.880
in the corner of the cell saying that.

40:00.880 --> 40:01.720
I trust them.

40:01.720 --> 40:08.320
I cast Inflict Light Wounds on one of the mind flayers.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.400
Oh, shit.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.760
Oh, man.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.760
You have positioned yourself as a harmless man

40:14.760 --> 40:16.320
in a burlap sack when secretly you

40:16.320 --> 40:18.640
have the power of the ancient holies.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.240
You now lay your hands upon the nearest mind flayer,

40:22.240 --> 40:25.000
and it reacts with searing pain as you cook it,

40:25.000 --> 40:37.400
like so much calamari doing the mind flayer falls back

40:37.400 --> 40:40.000
to the wall, spewing blood from its nose,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
which is underneath its tentacle mouth.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
But you assume there's a nose under there.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.400
There's blood coming out.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.400
Holy shit.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.080
It's going ee, ee, ee.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.120
I think we can win.

40:50.120 --> 40:55.120
And you're next, if you don't back off.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.920
Judge Dooms like fucking psychic squid people.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.560
Do you want something done right?

41:01.560 --> 41:09.600
He comes at Lars with drawing his swords.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.360
He's doing a two-sword attack.

41:13.360 --> 41:14.400
Oh, shit.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.320
He misses with one and kind of grazes your arm

41:18.320 --> 41:24.160
with the other, doing a moderate amount of damage,

41:24.160 --> 41:25.440
but just to your arm.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.480
So it's not that big a deal in the grand scheme,

41:27.480 --> 41:30.240
because it's like, if your arm was a body,

41:30.240 --> 41:33.960
it would have been hit in its arm.

41:33.960 --> 41:38.600
Your arm's arm is hurt, but you're OK.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.440
Jeff, what do you got?

41:40.440 --> 41:44.680
I go at him with a, because I have no weapons right now,

41:44.680 --> 41:45.240
except to think of it.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.640
You're laying on the floor.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.440
Oh, your hand's so pure.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.720
I hand up your ass.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.840
Do you want to roll dice to see if I successfully pull my

41:52.840 --> 41:52.840
arm?

41:52.840 --> 41:53.840
Sure, that's what you want.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.760
Oh, yeah, you whip it out like a fucking,

41:56.760 --> 41:59.440
like a Kleenex out of a box.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.120
So I take out my secret poop weapon,

42:02.120 --> 42:05.360
and describe it for me.

42:05.360 --> 42:12.840
It's a short, rather blunt, four and a half inch

42:12.840 --> 42:17.360
ceremonial dagger that was inserted into your asshole

42:17.360 --> 42:22.320
when you turned 12 in your orc village.

42:22.320 --> 42:28.320
It was sharper back then, but it was never so sharp

42:28.320 --> 42:29.760
that it tore flesh.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.760
So it's really like, it's a weapon that

42:32.760 --> 42:35.480
is mostly used by the elders of your tribe

42:35.480 --> 42:39.440
to terrorize the children, because adolescent orcs

42:39.440 --> 42:43.200
are very difficult to manage.

42:43.200 --> 42:45.440
So they have these rituals that they

42:45.440 --> 42:49.440
use to focus your aggression on the outside world.

42:49.440 --> 42:54.840
Well, I use weapon focus and throw it at the, what's his name?

42:54.840 --> 42:55.560
Judge Doom.

42:55.560 --> 42:56.240
Judge Doom.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.600
OK.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.720
I will tell you that he will make a worse target,

43:00.720 --> 43:03.640
because again, this is a very blunt knife.

43:03.640 --> 43:07.000
I'll just tell you that your lore in your tribe

43:07.000 --> 43:10.240
understands that in the few stories where an orc actually

43:10.240 --> 43:13.240
has to use these things, the most effective use of them

43:13.240 --> 43:19.720
is as an assist in mealy like a punching, because it's so dull,

43:19.720 --> 43:21.680
but it's sharper than a fist.

43:21.680 --> 43:25.200
OK, so I do, because I'm generally

43:25.200 --> 43:27.080
like a two-handed fighter.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.600
I would let you throw it, but I'm just

43:28.600 --> 43:31.120
recommending you don't throw it at a guy with any armor,

43:31.120 --> 43:33.960
but the mind flayers are just squid people in robes.

43:33.960 --> 43:34.880
I appreciate your advice.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.200
OK, thanks.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.120
I come at with a chop to the throat

43:39.120 --> 43:43.480
and a stab with my blunt poop weapon into his midsection.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.360
Oh, you karate chop with one hand and then.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.800
Like, throat midsection with the poops.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.320
And this is on Judge Doom, huh?

43:49.320 --> 43:51.640
On Judge Doom himself, his very self.

43:51.640 --> 43:58.440
All right, well, your chop goes wide,

43:58.440 --> 44:02.320
and then your blunt stab misses.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.240
I'm sorry.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.400
I want you to be rolling better.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.360
It's hard.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.560
So you miss.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.120
It's OK.

44:11.120 --> 44:11.960
I was groggy.

44:11.960 --> 44:14.080
I just woke up from a little nap.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.160
Trace, but you.

44:15.160 --> 44:17.560
Can I launch myself at the mind flayer

44:17.560 --> 44:19.160
hoping to tackle his head?

44:19.160 --> 44:21.960
Yes.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.480
It's not a critical fail, but you

44:23.480 --> 44:28.520
do a poor job of leaping from the shadowy corner.

44:28.520 --> 44:29.680
My plan.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.160
Yeah.

44:32.160 --> 44:36.640
Yeah, the robot thief kind of clumsily

44:36.640 --> 44:38.560
jangles out of the corner and lands

44:38.560 --> 44:40.440
at the feet of the mind flayer.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.600
See, it was a trick.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.600
I was on your side.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.400
Now you guys are going to die.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.320
Shut up back there.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.280
Oh, no.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.760
Nobody grabs that torch.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.000
Keep the torch safe.

44:54.000 --> 44:54.920
Grab the torch.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.040
Guard the torch with your lives.

44:56.040 --> 44:56.760
Grab the torch.

44:56.760 --> 44:57.840
Oh, god.

44:57.840 --> 45:01.360
One of the mind flayers, you see him squint and look

45:01.360 --> 45:04.760
at Tom Tom Tom, but nothing happens.

45:04.760 --> 45:05.880
Oh, shit.

45:05.880 --> 45:12.120
He must have remembered his ex-girlfriend or something.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.000
Quick thinking.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.760
And let's see.

45:15.760 --> 45:16.640
Oh, shit.

45:16.640 --> 45:22.200
Well, the other mind flayer is he's massively wounded

45:22.200 --> 45:25.520
and against the wall, but you see him doing something.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.760
It looks like he's healing himself

45:27.760 --> 45:30.480
with some kind of psychic thing.

45:30.480 --> 45:37.760
Judge Doom, he does a really good job of attacking Tom

45:37.760 --> 45:38.440
Tom Tom.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.760
What?

45:39.760 --> 45:43.520
He was my HP currently right now.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.040
Full.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.280
40.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.080
40?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.600
Yeah, but you better subtract 7 from that.

45:48.600 --> 45:49.480
Oh, damn.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.520
OK, like, all right, you guys can go.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.200
I'd start with Tom Tom Tom.

45:54.200 --> 46:00.440
OK, I do a power attack at, who am I closest to right now?

46:00.440 --> 46:03.440
You are closest to Judge Doom, right?

46:03.440 --> 46:05.440
Judge Doom, power attack.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.440
And I just go for like a strangle.

46:07.440 --> 46:11.120
Like, I use all of my arm strength and just go straight

46:11.120 --> 46:12.680
to try to choke him out.

46:12.680 --> 46:13.400
OK.

46:13.400 --> 46:18.080
You grabbed his throat with the efficiency

46:18.080 --> 46:24.680
of an animal at bay from the stories of animals with hands

46:24.680 --> 46:27.320
from your childhood.

46:27.320 --> 46:31.480
Your hands go to his throat as if guided by special magnets

46:31.480 --> 46:36.000
in a novelty sculpture of someone choking someone.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.880
And your thumbs find his windpipe with magic-like efficiency.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.400
Nice.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.600
You realize you have his life at your mercy.

46:46.600 --> 46:50.280
You need only squeeze to snuff him out.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.480
Power attack.

46:51.480 --> 46:53.040
Squeeze that shit.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.240
Yeah, I mean, it's all right.

46:54.240 --> 46:57.600
You crush his windpipe, he can't breathe.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.640
Even if you let go, he can't breathe.

46:59.640 --> 47:02.120
He's so sad and in such pain.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.080
This is what your actions half rock.

47:16.080 --> 47:22.000
He's crawling to you, Lars, like, this is a line

47:22.000 --> 47:26.840
with demons and live in torturous agony.

47:26.840 --> 47:27.840
What did you say, Spencer?

47:27.840 --> 47:29.840
I'm just punishing him verbally.

47:33.920 --> 47:36.800
Oh, does he have any items that look stealable?

47:36.800 --> 47:41.360
Oh, man, he's got so many items.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.840
There is one mind flayer left, but that was Tom Tom's

47:43.840 --> 47:45.720
attack, Lars, you can go.

47:45.720 --> 47:46.560
I kick him.

47:46.560 --> 47:49.480
You kick the, you kick Judge Jume, OK.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.080
Well, I mean, it's an easy target.

47:51.080 --> 47:51.840
Yeah, yeah, you kick him.

47:51.840 --> 47:55.880
I mean, he's like, man, I'm dying and now I'm getting kicked.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.720
Ha, you see?

47:58.720 --> 48:00.160
Tracebutt, you want to do something?

48:00.160 --> 48:02.920
Yeah, well, does he, do I see any items on his person

48:02.920 --> 48:04.680
that I could immediately grab, like,

48:04.680 --> 48:06.240
within a short period of time?

48:06.240 --> 48:08.760
Yeah, like, his most visible objects are,

48:08.760 --> 48:13.000
he has a pair of shimmering, slightly glowing gloves made

48:13.000 --> 48:17.720
of a very fine chainmail that are draped over his belt.

48:17.720 --> 48:23.040
He has an extra sword on the back, He-Man style.

48:23.040 --> 48:27.000
He's got those fox pelts that you notice

48:27.000 --> 48:29.160
upon closer inspection.

48:29.160 --> 48:32.480
The eyes have a kind of life to them.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.280
Yeah, that's cool as shit.

48:34.280 --> 48:38.040
Yeah, I mean, they don't just look like regular dead foxes.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.560
They look like maybe they're, yeah, like living pelts.

48:40.560 --> 48:47.560
OK, can I take the sword and throw it to Tom Tom Tom?

48:47.560 --> 48:52.080
You grab the sword off the back of the dying man

48:52.080 --> 48:56.280
and the robot thief flings you this sword.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.400
Do you want to try to catch it?

48:57.400 --> 48:59.360
Yeah, I try to catch the sword.

48:59.360 --> 49:03.400
You do so with, like, a globetrotter.

49:03.400 --> 49:04.640
Hell yeah.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.720
I'm going to go grab a Coke.

49:05.720 --> 49:06.720
I'll be right back.

49:10.480 --> 49:11.960
He's achieved his dream.

49:11.960 --> 49:12.680
He's leaving.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.720
OK.

49:13.720 --> 49:18.280
I catch the sword and I try to use the momentum of catching

49:18.280 --> 49:21.800
the sword and swing around and kill the final mind flayer.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.000
OK.

49:23.000 --> 49:23.960
And a cleave.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.160
I use cleave.

49:25.160 --> 49:26.640
It's a critical hit.

49:26.640 --> 49:27.640
Yeah.

49:27.640 --> 49:28.120
Yeah.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.160
Also, this sword has, like, some strange magic properties.

49:39.160 --> 49:41.280
You hear a voice in your head as you

49:41.280 --> 49:45.000
strike saying, ah, flesh.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.240
And there's, like, the wound that you cause

49:48.240 --> 49:55.440
as you cleave the mother mind flayer in half at his hips.

49:55.440 --> 50:00.000
The wound is cauterized with a strange orange glow.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.320
But it's not a healthy thing because it

50:02.320 --> 50:04.360
starts to eat the flesh away.

50:04.360 --> 50:08.240
The body continues to start disintegrating in both halves

50:08.240 --> 50:10.440
as you watch it.

50:10.440 --> 50:14.120
You'd still have time to grab any, like, his robes.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.640
But he's slowly just disappearing.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.160
So we vanquished everybody inside this room right now?

50:20.160 --> 50:21.160
Yeah.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.480
There's a, oh, the other mind flayer

50:23.480 --> 50:25.640
is, like, he was healing himself.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
Oh, yeah, no.

50:26.640 --> 50:28.840
He's at a disadvantage.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.640
He's only just alive.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.600
Tracebutt, Tracebutt, finish the job.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.680
What about you?

50:33.680 --> 50:34.560
Oh, Mars.

50:34.560 --> 50:38.440
I cast Scorching Ray at the last mind flayer.

50:38.440 --> 50:42.520
Whoa, what are you, what's your god?

50:42.520 --> 50:44.280
In a good way.

50:44.280 --> 50:47.400
Can we not talk religion?

50:47.400 --> 50:49.040
It's like politics.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.240
Linking your thumbs together and fanning your fingers out

50:52.240 --> 50:56.800
in a manual display of symbol-ness.

50:56.800 --> 51:00.320
Flames shoot from your fingertips in a fan-like pattern,

51:00.320 --> 51:03.480
dancing through the air and connecting with the face

51:03.480 --> 51:05.680
and genitals of the mind flayer.

51:05.680 --> 51:08.800
He shrieks in agony through all of your brains,

51:08.800 --> 51:11.880
trying as hard as he can to hurt you with his thoughts.

51:11.880 --> 51:15.200
But all he successfully does is share with you

51:15.200 --> 51:19.720
what he's thinking as he dies, which is, oh, God, Daphne,

51:19.720 --> 51:23.000
oh, why was I such a dick?

51:23.000 --> 51:23.960
I was gaslighting.

51:23.960 --> 51:25.240
That's what they call gaslighting,

51:25.240 --> 51:27.120
is what I was doing to her.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.640
And he dies.

51:28.640 --> 51:29.120
Damn.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.520
Nice job, guys.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.160
I loot the body.

51:35.160 --> 51:38.320
You find yourselves wondering, what was that relationship

51:38.320 --> 51:40.200
about?

51:40.200 --> 51:41.160
Lies.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.360
I feel kind of bad.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.280
Yeah.

51:43.280 --> 51:46.640
OK, so yeah, I mean, he's technically alive, the Judge

51:46.640 --> 51:51.400
Doom, but he's not going to continue living,

51:51.400 --> 51:52.960
and he can barely speak.

51:52.960 --> 51:53.840
He's turning purple.

51:53.840 --> 51:54.480
He's dying.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.960
I walk up to him and say, what did you

51:56.960 --> 51:58.880
have against us in the first place?

51:58.880 --> 52:03.200
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.480
I give him a pen and paper.

52:04.480 --> 52:13.840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

52:13.840 --> 52:16.400
Can I heal him like a little bit just so we can talk to him

52:16.400 --> 52:18.240
as normal, eh, or?

52:18.240 --> 52:20.280
OK, you use, like, cure late wounds?

52:20.280 --> 52:21.800
OK, you do that.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.680
You cure it, just a tip of his late wounds.

52:24.680 --> 52:31.160
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.120
That's what I was saying.

52:32.120 --> 52:35.840
I was saying, ah, ah, because I couldn't breathe.

52:35.840 --> 52:39.240
Right, what did you have against us in the first place?

52:39.240 --> 52:41.280
I ain't trying to grapple him, I guess.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.120
You try what?

52:42.120 --> 52:43.520
To grapple him.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.400
Oh, you grapple him.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.660
OK, I mean, you've got him secured.

52:46.660 --> 52:47.360
He's not going to.

52:47.360 --> 52:50.000
You did a good job of, he just, he just,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.320
he focused his healing on his trachea,

52:52.320 --> 52:53.400
so that he can speak.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.820
but he's like, you've even done a kind of cruel thing

52:56.820 --> 53:01.820
where he's able to draw in like 5% less oxygen

53:02.520 --> 53:04.040
with each breath that it will take

53:04.040 --> 53:05.680
in totality to keep him alive.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.880
So he's like still in a perpetual state of suffocation.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.040
It's easy like waterboarding.

53:11.040 --> 53:15.360
Like he's like, it would be called simulated death,

53:15.360 --> 53:17.320
but he's actually dying.

53:17.320 --> 53:20.160
He just, you're torturing him, he's tortured.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.320
Are we the bad guys?

53:21.320 --> 53:22.400
No, no, we're good.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.680
I think he's, well, I mean, I'm not, I can't judge.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.440
I'm a dungeon master, you know?

53:26.440 --> 53:29.640
But I don't think anyone that imprisoned somebody

53:29.640 --> 53:31.800
without due process is a very good person.

53:31.800 --> 53:35.560
Truly anyone who allies with mind flayers needs to be killed.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.600
And he did call you fuck faces and stuff.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.200
Like he was mean, you know?

53:39.200 --> 53:41.400
He didn't tell you why you were here.

53:41.400 --> 53:46.240
Oh God, oh God, I want to die, but I don't want to live.

53:46.240 --> 53:49.160
I poke out his eye, what?

53:49.160 --> 53:50.520
I poke out his eye.

53:50.520 --> 53:55.520
Ah, the robot pokes out his eye with his metal finger.

53:55.520 --> 54:00.520
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

54:02.960 --> 54:06.720
Dude, please stop, please don't torture me anymore.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.120
I hate dying in pain.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.920
I don't, if you're gonna kill me, please kill me.

54:11.920 --> 54:15.360
If you're not gonna kill me, please heal me more

54:15.360 --> 54:16.400
so I can live.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.400
I pick him up by the ankle and hold him upside down

54:19.400 --> 54:24.400
and look, I'm trying to get him like eye to eye,

54:25.840 --> 54:27.160
but my arm isn't long enough.

54:27.160 --> 54:30.400
So like I keep scooting my hand up,

54:30.400 --> 54:32.920
like I have him by the belt now.

54:32.920 --> 54:34.840
He's upside down, but he's, I have him by the belt.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.800
So now he's upside down and we're eye to eye.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.880
And I say, where is the squid ink?

54:40.880 --> 54:45.880
Ah, it's in my pouch on my belt, you know that?

54:46.720 --> 54:48.080
How would I know that?

54:48.080 --> 54:51.040
I used it on you, is that what you want?

54:51.040 --> 54:52.920
I take the squid ink out of his pouch.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.960
Ah, you, there's a pouch on his belt

54:55.960 --> 54:57.920
that's like writhing around, you remember that,

54:57.920 --> 54:59.320
or maybe you don't remember,

54:59.320 --> 55:01.920
maybe you're a better role player than I am a DM.

55:01.920 --> 55:06.160
Cause you, you have a faint memory of,

55:06.160 --> 55:08.520
he's got a little wriggling squid in that bag.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.840
Yeah, it shot you in the brain juice.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.120
And he squeeze it, it's like a knockout drug

55:12.120 --> 55:12.960
or something like that.

55:12.960 --> 55:15.120
I put it in his mouth.

55:15.120 --> 55:17.760
Wait, hold on to that, that could be useful.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.520
My rogue mind tells me.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.840
Okay.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.160
Good thinking, Trace Butt.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.440
I give Trace Butt the pouch of squid ink.

55:24.440 --> 55:25.280
Oh, thanks.

55:25.280 --> 55:28.480
You now have a squid ink of knockout.

55:28.480 --> 55:31.160
A squid, a baby squid of knockout.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.840
I guess I grab his keys.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.600
You grab his keys.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.880
Is there anything on that desk that's relevant?

55:37.880 --> 55:40.720
The desk contains six candles,

55:40.720 --> 55:45.000
two hats, and a drawer.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.120
Take these hats.

55:46.120 --> 55:51.120
One hat is like a tall hat, like a two foot tall hat.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.560
I take off a, what's his name?

55:57.560 --> 55:58.400
Judge Dooms?

55:58.400 --> 55:59.960
Now I take off Judge Dooms outfit,

55:59.960 --> 56:02.480
like I'm going to like dress up like him to sneak out.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.640
But then I just go, you know what,

56:03.640 --> 56:05.080
it's just funny if I leave him naked

56:05.080 --> 56:08.120
and I just, and I light his clothes on fire.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.680
So he's now just naked.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.200
You could have had him be naked

56:11.200 --> 56:12.720
and also take his clothes.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.560
Yeah, but I don't want to, they don't fit.

56:14.560 --> 56:15.400
Okay.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.280
He's really sad because he's naked now

56:17.280 --> 56:19.400
and he's still, again, he's dying the whole time.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.480
It's like a horrible death.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.680
I give him two Good Berries.

56:23.680 --> 56:28.160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, thank you.

56:28.160 --> 56:29.880
And then I smash him in the head and kill him.

56:29.880 --> 56:30.720
Ah!

56:33.440 --> 56:34.920
Where'd you get Good Berries?

56:36.320 --> 56:38.200
He had, they were in the,

56:38.200 --> 56:39.040
Oh God.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.720
They were in the secret compartment

56:40.720 --> 56:42.440
in the hilt of the anal dagger, yeah.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.760
Yeah, that's some good thinking.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.600
No, it is.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.680
It's like a beautiful,

56:46.680 --> 56:50.440
I'll tell you the ritual that is Orchvillage practices

56:50.440 --> 56:54.400
in its roots, it's actually a really wonderful thing,

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
but it's just become so corrupted

56:56.400 --> 56:57.760
and it's just about oppression.

56:57.760 --> 56:58.600
Right.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.600
Like, it's really just about scaring kids.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.920
Are there other prisoners in this jail cell?

57:05.720 --> 57:07.080
No.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.600
What's big tracks?

57:08.600 --> 57:09.440
What's that?

57:09.440 --> 57:10.280
Let's get out of here.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.840
Oh, the robot says, let's get out of here.

57:12.840 --> 57:15.280
Yeah, so we look for the exit.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.120
You guys took those hats.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.960
Yeah, we got two hats.

57:18.960 --> 57:22.400
Okay, I take the seven candles too,

57:22.400 --> 57:23.240
just to keep the seven.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.080
The quid.

57:24.080 --> 57:27.200
The candles are in your orc sack,

57:27.200 --> 57:28.400
or no, you don't have an orc sack.

57:28.400 --> 57:30.280
You just scoop them up in your arms

57:30.280 --> 57:32.480
and they kind of go out and burn you with wax,

57:32.480 --> 57:34.600
but you're holding six candles.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.200
Hell yeah.

57:36.200 --> 57:38.640
All right, you guys head around that hallway

57:38.640 --> 57:42.720
and there's a eight foot tall, four foot wide giant door

57:42.720 --> 57:46.360
with six locks on it, but all of them are unfastened.

57:46.360 --> 57:47.360
Oh, hell yeah.

57:47.360 --> 57:49.640
This is our lucky day.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.480
Yeah.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.160
Let's continue onward.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.600
Tracebutt goes to the door.

57:54.600 --> 57:56.040
You open it?

57:56.040 --> 57:56.880
Yeah.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.240
He opens the door.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.560
Oh, I should have listened.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.880
Behind the door is a room.

58:01.880 --> 58:05.280
It's white with white walls and a white ceiling.

58:05.280 --> 58:09.600
There's a hole in the ceiling that's a square below the square.

58:09.600 --> 58:12.840
It's a beech wood table, finely polished, containing

58:12.840 --> 58:16.040
all of your items in three separate piles,

58:16.040 --> 58:19.280
one for each of you, each labeled with your name.

58:20.400 --> 58:21.800
It's all your stuff.

58:21.800 --> 58:26.800
And beyond that, there's a door in the north wall

58:28.080 --> 58:31.080
that it's oozing with green slime.

58:31.080 --> 58:31.920
Oh, shit.

58:31.920 --> 58:36.760
It's got a little doorway, a little peeky patch in it.

58:36.760 --> 58:41.640
And yeah, the room is lit by daylight.

58:41.640 --> 58:43.440
That's a skylight above the door.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.480
Nice.

58:44.480 --> 58:45.320
Let's get our stuff.

58:45.320 --> 58:46.920
Yeah, we all pick up our items.

58:46.920 --> 58:49.880
Okay, you pick up all your items.

58:49.880 --> 58:51.360
You have them all.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.160
I stand on top of the beech wood table.

58:53.160 --> 58:57.480
It's like, Lars, Tracebutt, stand on my shoulders.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.720
You get on top and climb out.

58:58.720 --> 59:03.240
And I will use my own strength to get myself here.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.920
I'll be on the bottom because I'm the most sturdy.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.360
I'll lock my joints.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.800
All right, so I get on top of Tracebutt.

59:10.800 --> 59:12.520
Lars, you want to climb on top of me?

59:12.520 --> 59:14.560
Yeah, I climb up to the top and I do it.

59:14.560 --> 59:16.160
Can I reach the hole?

59:16.160 --> 59:19.440
You can, yeah, if you're on top of Tom Tom's,

59:19.440 --> 59:20.440
you're climbing on top of something.

59:20.440 --> 59:23.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can reach the hole.

59:23.600 --> 59:24.920
There's sand above it.

59:24.920 --> 59:29.160
You could, it's like a hole to a beach.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.280
Is it big enough for me to fit through?

59:30.280 --> 59:33.120
Oh yeah, it's like a three foot square hole.

59:33.120 --> 59:36.480
So I climb up and look for a rope to hand down to my friends.

59:36.480 --> 59:39.640
Okay, you pull yourself up with cleric like agility.

59:41.640 --> 59:43.200
It's a sunlit beach.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.560
It's actually quite beautiful.

59:44.560 --> 59:46.400
There's an ocean.

59:46.400 --> 59:49.840
It's a crystal clear blue ocean.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.720
And yeah, you pull yourself up.

59:51.720 --> 59:55.920
There's, you hear seagulls and a strange distant sound

59:55.920 --> 59:58.880
that you've never heard before in the distance.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880
Like it's just a strange kind of like humming

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.440
or something, there's a big forest

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.120
and a road made of pebbles.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.320
By the way, that's how they make all roads that you remember.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.200
Like it's usually some form of pebble refinement.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160
You're looking for like a rope or something?

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.000
Is that what you're looking for?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.320
Do we have ropes in our stuff?

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.120
Say what?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.960
Do we have ropes in our stuff?

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.680
Yeah, you each have 50 feet of rope

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.080
because everyone does, yeah.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080
Classic, yeah.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.120
I throw you the rope.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.280
Okay, robot throws a rope up.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.800
I find a tree to tie it around.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.640
We'll just hold it.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.480
How heavy are you?

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.280
I'm just, okay, do a tree.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.160
Okay, I tie it around a tree.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.000
Wait, what are you doing?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.440
It's not polite to ask.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.760
What are you, are you having the cleric pull you up?

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.160
He's looking for a tree to tie the rope around.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.320
Yeah, you should probably find a tree.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.200
You're made of metal.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.040
Or like a big rock.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.720
All right, so I'm on top of a trace button.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.000
So I climb up the rope.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.480
All right, you do that.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.680
You're up.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.880
Nice.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.520
You also hear this strange sound.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.760
It's getting louder now than when you first came out.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.600
It's like, oh no.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.440
It's like,

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.440
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.520
So you pull, you both managed to find a rock.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.760
You secure the rope to it and you pull a trace button up.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.600
Hell yeah.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.440
The sound keeps coming.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.240
Oh, you got it.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.080
Oh, you got it.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.920
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.760
Look at your height.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760
When you're finally able to pinpoint

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.120
the source of the sound, you look

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.960
and you see the strangest sight.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.960
It's like a giant dragonfly made of armor and glass,

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.000
but its wings are not wings at all.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.920
They're like javelins that are rotating around.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.480
It's a helicopter.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.320
Oh no.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.480
Your memories come flooding back to you

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480
when you see it.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.240
The three of you met in Vietnam.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.080
Oh no.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.040
You're having flashbacks.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.880
You're remembering what happened to you.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.880
You were part of an experimental drug torture operation

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.200
adopted by the Viet Cong, financed by the Soviet Union.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.200
You were prisoners of war and these things

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.120
were dripped into your eyeballs.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:23.960
Oh no.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.560
That's the last thing you remember,

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.800
but you now realize that your captain,

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.280
Captain Dander Pants, is in the helicopter

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.200
and your pilot Murdoch is at the stick.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.440
They're lowering the ladder down.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.240
Get up here, get up here, you candy asses.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.320
Come on, come on, get up.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.960
Let's do it.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.560
You guys run to the ladder.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.480
You start climbing up, but you hear Captain Dandy Pants

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.720
going, what the fuck happened to you?

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.520
What the fuck, you're a robot?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.640
What the fuck?

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.240
Oh, I don't know, I guess.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.480
Lars, since motive, you have magic,

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.240
like the Detect Magic motive.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.520
Detect Magic on the helicopter?

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah, it's weird because you feel like you've had

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.440
this whole life as a cleric

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.880
and that you don't know what a helicopter is,

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.040
but you have more memories from a life

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.960
where you know what a helicopter is.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.760
You have more of a relationship with that identity,

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.440
this soldier from Vietnam.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.200
But I can detect magic still.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.480
Yeah, you can totally, and there's no magic

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.120
on this helicopter, it's technological.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120
Oh, shit.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.520
You feel the Lars part of you kind of receding

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.800
almost as if it requires you to believe it's real

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.040
in order to be real, but it's currently still pretty real

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.280
because you just spent all this time in this jail cell.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.440
But you also see this look on Captain Dandy Pants' face.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.720
He's looking at you guys like he's actually deeply unsettled.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.520
He recognizes your faces, but he did not expect

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.800
to see what he's seeing.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.920
What happened to us down there?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.720
That's what I was gonna ask you.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.320
Get in this goddamn helicopter.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.320
Come on, we can talk about it when we get to the DMT, C.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.600
D the D, the drop zone.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.720
Come on, you sons of bitches.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.800
Don't fucking judge my lack of Vietnam jargon.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.160
I was, let me finish.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.800
I was in marine boots when your momma's diapers

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.040
were titty fucking your dad's cum.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.400
I don't wanna hear your shit.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.400
It's hard to be a supervisor of soldiers like you.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.080
It makes your mind slip.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.000
It's been a strenuous war.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
This country's fighting itself.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.560
More than it's fighting the enemy.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.000
We don't even know, I'm all fucked up.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.280
I got one job I focus on so I can get through the day

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.920
without putting a gun in my mouth.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.920
Take care of my boys.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.720
And you're the hardest boys I ever had to take care of

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.280
and I love the fuck out of you.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.600
But what the fuck happened to you?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.240
You got turned into a robot?

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.840
Get in the helicopter.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.040
Come on, Murdoch, go, go.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.680
Murdoch's going like, like, shit, fuck, yeah, let's go.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.040
He's like, the helicopter starts soaring.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.040
There's a strange roaring sound you hear to your right.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.040
You see a huge swarm of baby dragons

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.160
is coming out of a palm tree.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.000
Oh, no.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The palm tree has, there was a hinge on the giant palm tree

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and a bunch of baby dragons came out of it.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I turn over to Lars and Tracebutt and go,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I think Captain Danny passes on DMT right now.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.840
What?

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.840
Fuck you, I heard that.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.840
You're not disrespectful.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.120
You're not disrespectful.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.560
It is to dismiss what we're doing over here

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.200
is some kind of drug trip.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.200
Why don't you just relax?

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.280
You're having a bad trip, man.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.840
You're freaking out.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.120
I'm having a bad trip.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.000
You're the one that looks like a fucking pig monster

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.200
and weird armor.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.880
What the fuck happened to you, man?

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.560
We don't know, or do we know?

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.400
You guys don't know, no.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.240
I didn't think so.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.680
I mean, you're just remembering

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.840
that you were in Vietnam, right?

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.880
I mean, you share that with them, I assume.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.760
You're like, yeah, all I remember is being in Vietnam,

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.680
but then we woke up in the cell,

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.240
but we kind of have these identities.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.880
So you kind of do your best to relate to him,

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.800
everything that you do now.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.400
He's like, god damn it!

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.600
Project Omega is live!

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.400
We gotta warn the president!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.320
I cast Guidance on Murdoch

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.760
so he can escape from the dragons.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.160
Oh, that's nice of you, yeah.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.880
You do a really good job of like,

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.880
so Lars, you're like, the best I can describe it

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.960
is like lactating mothers.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:57.000
Like, as you continue to breastfeed the casting of spells,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.080
like, you can tell that it's important to keep,

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.720
it keeps you remembering Lars' life.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.760
And you're kind of like in this weird halfway spot

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.000
where you're like half this Vietnam soldier named

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.160
Diggins and half Lars.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:14.880
I remember.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.720
But you're able to cast this spell, it very clearly works.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.160
You guys see like magic energy come out of his hands,

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.680
Captain Dandy Pence is like, what the fuck?

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.920
What is that, commie energy?

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.360
Holy shit, your fucking hands got pink shit coming out of it!

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.880
But it clearly makes Murdoch a magnificent pilot,

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.880
and he flies through these like, canyons

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.280
and is evading these baby dragons.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.200
Baby dragons, what the fuck?

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.240
Captain Dandy Pence gets on a heavy machine gun,

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.360
it's mounted in the back of the helicopter.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.720
You ever see baby dragons before?

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.120
I've seen any shit like this since fucking North Korea.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.520
What the fuck's going on?

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.520
If it fucking moves, then it's a commie.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.400
Fuck this shit, god damn it.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.320
God, I love America, I fucking go insane.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.440
I can't believe there's baby dragons in real life.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.920
Holy shit, I should have loved my children.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.160
What's Project Omega?

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.120
We'll talk about it in the debrief.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.200
Stand down, take that morphine or don't take it.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.120
It's addictive.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.000
I'll take it.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.560
OK, he shoots the baby dragons and the baby dragons

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.200
kind of recede.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.440
That was kind of a strange thing, like the baby dragon

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.040
attack didn't seem very confident.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.680
So the helicopter is taking you over the,

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.240
it doesn't look like Vietnam, it looks like Palm Beach

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.200
and it just takes you along this shoreline

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.280
and then it takes you to this, it looks like an American

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.080
military base circa 1970, and you land.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.600
Man, this is nuts, right?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.400
Do I ever see this before?

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.040
Do we?

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.640
Lars, you remember you're still like floating halfway

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.800
between like being Diggins and being Lars.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.600
You're like, you can equally remember

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.360
being born in this like little hamlet of,

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.400
in this like Middle Earth type realm where your parents

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.360
were persecuted for being witches and so you swore revenge

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.920
and you ran away and you were raised by this weird coven

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.600
of all women that were like super progressive

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.520
and resented your maleness but also knew that in a misogynistic

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.160
world their greatest weapon would be like a male kind

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.480
of priest that they could send out on secret missions.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.120
So they did love you but they also, they were like,

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.360
in a weird ironic kind of Judy Dench James Bond relationship

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.040
they were like not intimate mothers to you so it's crazy

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.080
because you were raised by all like super powerful

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.880
confident women but they were very distant,

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.360
like they didn't want to like attach to you as a person.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.040
So you're really kind of fucked up but you're also

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.880
like super powerful, like you're really good at focusing

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.400
what would have been your male rage and your misogyny

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.840
into like these like powerful magic attacks

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.120
and like you hate yourself for having a penis.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.880
But it's like really effective and you're able

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.760
to climb walls and if you meditate for an hour

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.480
you can turn into a bat and it's also clear to you,

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.520
it's like that's your whole life

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.520
but then you also remember being diggins,

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:49.240
you were born in New Hampshire, you came out when you were 13.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.000
It was 1963 that was not well received

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.360
and so you ran away from home, you went to New York,

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.200
you started working in a diner, you lied about your age,

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.760
you didn't have to get a work permit and you worked at a bakery

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.640
and then the draft came along and you actually volunteered

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.280
because you're like fucking making cookies

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.560
and you wanted to do something meaningful with your life

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.680
and part of it is like proving that, you know,

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:23.040
you're trying to, you obviously can't tell your fellow soldiers

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.800
that you're gay but you like inside you're like I'm gonna

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.640
fucking be a hero, I'm gonna save this country.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.680
If not for my future gay children then at least for myself

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.080
like because I can't wait to like be at the, you know,

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:42.760
like be in this big dramatic like war and like come home alive

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.680
and then take my purple heart and be like by the way this is,

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.080
I'm a gay, I'm a gay soldier like you're kind of looking forward

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.240
to that but you ended up getting assigned

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.640
to this like weird special ops team because you're really good

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.400
because you have like this, you're not afraid of death

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.520
because you're like why do I even want to go home

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.720
where people hate me for something I can't control,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.560
it's fucking gross but you love America

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.000
because you love freedom but it's like so hypocritical

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.800
so you're like I'm either gonna die a hero

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.480
and you have a note sewn into your underwear that says

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.040
by the way I died fucking gay, fuck you America

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.080
but you hope no one ever finds it but you're like fuck it

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.960
like I kind of like it's a win-win, that's your catchphrases,

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:35.600
it's a win-win, that's your lock and load and you're like this guy

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.240
that you're the guy that like scrambles

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.960
into the like booby trapped holes with two guns

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.400
like what's his name in platoon and you don't give a fuck man,

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.920
you're like they call you the weasel

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.080
and but it's like really affectionate

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.960
because they're like fuck man we got the weasel

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.800
like that's why we're gonna win, they don't have this guy

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.360
and so you actually feel a fraternity

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:07.720
with your brothers here, Duke and Nuke, Duke Nuke and Diggins

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.160
like you guys, you guys used to be part of what they called

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:17.480
the Fantastic Four but like you guys went on this one mission

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.080
with Lieutenant Hammer and he got his arms blown off

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.480
when he fell for the oldest trick in the book, baby carriage

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.520
like he's just like sometimes this war is like coming home

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.680
and then he heard this baby crying, went up to the carriage

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.400
and fucking blew his arms off and he was like you know doing

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.480
the whole thing where he's like you hear this high-pitched

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.360
ringing in your ears while you're like watching him look

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.960
he's like where are my arms and it's like and then he fell down

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.680
and then you held him and you had to like overdose him

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:51.800
on morphine and tell him and promise him that you won the war

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:57.560
and he fucking died and that was in this weird like kind

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.840
of like pirate cove kind of town that you guys had been sent

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.320
to off the coast of Vietnam, you guys were not,

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.800
you guys were sent out of Vietnam from a military base

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.120
into a place like somewhere in the ocean where you're not

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.280
supposed to be, where America is not sanctioned

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.600
to be having a war but like who cares right

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.080
because you know that's what Vietnam is all about man

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:26.440
but you, so you're remembering all that stuff like

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.400
at the same time, at the same time.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:36.200
It sounds like, yeah.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.200
You guys are on the tarmac, you're getting

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.320
out of the helicopter and like Captain Dandy Pants is like,

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:45.760
like he's got this look on his face, he's like gentlemen

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.840
and he's like looking at you, you can see there's fear

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.160
in his eyes, he's like looking at you guys

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.240
and like he's looking you up and down

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240
and he just doesn't fucking understand what's happening.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.000
Is it a man in the high castle situation?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.520
You ask that.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520
Hey, you've seen this show.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.280
Can I get another drink?

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.000
I kind of talked for a while.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.760
Yeah, I haven't seen that show and either has this guy

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.200
so I'm sure it's based on a book that was available back then

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.960
but I can't answer that question as your dungeon master.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.880
That's fine.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.040
Captain Dandy Pants goes, am I going to have any trouble

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.320
from you gentlemen?

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.400
He's like, he's genuinely, he's really scared.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.880
I think I need to sit down.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.080
That's a lot to process.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.800
OK, well yeah, I think you need to be sat down

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.160
and just want to make sure this isn't some kind of trick

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.480
or something.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.800
Name rank and serial number.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.520
Tell me who you are, who I think you are before I take you

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.160
into the bunker because you could be like terminators

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.880
or something.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:16:00.800
My name is Tom Duke Thompson, first sergeant, Marine.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:15.560
Tell me what happened to us at the battle of lumpy bratwurst.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.160
Sir, we got our asses kicked at the battle of lumpy bratwurst,

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.520
sir, we're surrounded by a shit pot of Chinese.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.760
Good to have you back, Duke.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.480
Nuke, if that is you, tell me what your expertise is

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.400
and what we always tease you for in the barracks.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:43.000
Trace Nuke, but known for special ops and stealth

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.360
deployments and shitting his pants when he laughs too hard.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.560
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.000
There's no way the VC could have hypnotized you

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.240
into pretending that.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.880
Whoa, oh, god damn, it even smells the same.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.400
It happened again, sir, and it's still funny, sir.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.320
Diggins, tell me anything, sir.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.800
Lars Diggins, sir, special forces.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.240
I've seen too much shit, sir.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240
I'm ready to go home.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240
My bad.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:28.640
I didn't hear what you said.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.680
Oh, my god.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.680
Technically, sir, we've all been in the shit just now.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.280
All right, well, you know what?

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.760
If they've developed some ability

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.200
to replicate your fucking personalities

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.600
and that look in your fucking eyes, Diggins,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.760
then they deserve to win.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.680
Let's go see the commander.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.360
Code 310, open up the belly.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.920
What you thought were trees now reveal themselves

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.040
to be half tree, half human marines.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.880
Or are they just men in ghillie suits?

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.520
You don't know.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.160
But if they are, they're like state of the fucking art.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.880
They look like costumes from Wizard of Oz or something.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.080
They look like trees, straight up trees,

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.120
but they've got faces and they've got ammunition

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.640
and they're bandolier straps.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.600
You think to yourself, why would you

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.680
go to the trouble of disguising a man as a tree

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.520
and then put fucking belts and shit on him?

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.600
But then you think, hey, anything can be on a tree.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.240
What does a birdhouse make people go, hey,

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.720
why is there a house in that tree?

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.360
It doesn't.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.840
It's like, what about a little kid?

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.440
One of them has a kid up in his branches

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.640
who doesn't seem to even understand

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.040
that he's climbing a marine.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.560
And they start moving.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.160
Whereas before they moved, you didn't even notice them.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.920
They were just like, oh, of course there's two trees

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.360
on this beach adjacent 1970s marine base

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:16.040
and a tropical Vietnam coast base.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.280
They go over to these rocks and they touch the rocks

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.480
and these panels open on them and they're doing something.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.720
They nod at each other and they press something

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.880
at the same time.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.400
And this big, giant door starts opening

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.760
and there's like a klaxon sounding.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.760
And it's like, there's this big door opens up

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.800
and there's a staircase going down

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.960
and Dandy Pants starts heading down.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.560
And the helicopter starts taking off.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.760
Murdoch goes like, hey, keep your cocks in your socks.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.040
And he takes off.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.480
You too.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.960
Dandy Pants looks back at you and goes, gentlemen,

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.880
we don't keep Lady Liberty's mouth open

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.600
in this fucking cocks storm.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.760
She's open wide for you.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.240
You're going to go down her throat or what?

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.600
Come on.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.920
Let's go.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.680
I think I find that offensive.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.600
Well, it definitely.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.000
It's very offensive, actually, yeah.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.640
You go numb for that stuff, but it's definitely

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.040
an unapologetically homophobic culture.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.120
People are just constantly calling each other fag

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.240
and gay and implying that they're weak and all this stuff.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.080
And it's like, it drives you fucking nuts,

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.800
but it is what it is.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.320
And I was raised by women.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.120
Yeah, well, your other half was.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.920
In your Diggins half, you were just

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.520
raised by a mom, pa, kind of like,

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.640
it was just a regular kind of, like Norman Rockwell

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.520
kind of upbringing.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.360
If it weren't for your gayness, it

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.760
would have been a privileged life.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.880
But your honesty, your compulsion

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.280
to be who you really are and not put up

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.040
with torture of like having to conform,

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.000
like whereas no one else does, it made you go,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.640
like, I'm not going to do this.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.600
And my mom and dad say they love me no matter what.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.920
Your mom told you once.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.360
She said, son, do you know what love is when you were like 11?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.080
And you were just having weird feelings.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.840
Like you didn't know what if they were normal.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.440
You didn't know who to talk to about it.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.160
But your mom said to you once, son,

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.920
I want you to know what the definition of love is,

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.320
like unconditional love.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.520
It means if you ever killed somebody,

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.600
I would help you bury the body.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.560
It wouldn't matter to me if I thought you were right or wrong.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.600
I don't care if you turn out to be a serial killer.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.280
I would still try to keep you alive as long as possible.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.600
I would take a bullet for you.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.200
You're my son, and I love you.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.440
And then when you came out to her,

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.600
she acted like you were a fucking monster.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.080
And it broke your heart.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.040
It was terrible.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:49.560
Like she obviously was either lying about the death thing

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:53.080
or she really hates gay people.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.720
But in any case, it was just like you just fucking,

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720
of course, you ran away.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.040
You had to.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.440
It wasn't even out of spite for them.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:00.760
It was out of pain.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.480
You had to start a new life on your own.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.360
As a child, you were just a kid.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.440
And so now, but so you.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.160
What if she just really wanted to be an accessory to murder?

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.880
That's one of the questions you ask yourself.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.440
It's like, maybe my mom just wanted to really

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.720
hoped I would be a serial killer.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.520
Maybe she was more just disappointed.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.680
It really fucks with you.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.120
But you're in the army, but you're not out.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.000
You're not openly gay.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.400
It's literally against the rules.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.760
They would kick you out of the army

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.120
if you said that you were gay or if you like, yeah.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.320
I think you've gotten way accustomed to keeping things

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.200
way at a distance.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.200
You don't even flirt around with your closest friends

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.480
like knowing there's something that you have that.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.320
But you do think, after all the shit you've

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.960
been through with these guys, one thing

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.480
that you refuse to do is when they talk about pussy and stuff,

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.640
like, oh, OK, get back to stateside

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.440
so I can take a labia and put it on my mouth

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.800
and go, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.280
Like, you draw the line.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.320
You're not going to lie.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.960
You're not going to live a dishonest life.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.920
So you're just kind of like nod and stuff.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.480
But these guys, they were never like, what are you a faggot?

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.320
How come you don't talk about pussy with us?

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.600
They're just like, I think, but you wonder sometimes

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.560
if maybe they think like, oh, and it's like,

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.040
there's a part of you that thinks if that's the case,

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.240
if they know, and the fact that they're not

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.120
bothering to ask you about it, corner you about it,

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.240
in this fucked up, sick world, that's

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.120
like the love that your mom was trying to express to you

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:49.000
and her hypothetical thing is other men that

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.960
are agreeing to protect you unconditionally by going,

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.600
like, I'm never going to ask.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.480
And it's like, it's a really fucked up thing.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.120
So yes, it triggers you every time.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.160
Like, oh, come on, get down this cock holster.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.560
Lady Liberty doesn't suck cock.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.240
Like a gay man.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.840
She can't keep this mouth open or the Vietnamese

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.720
are going to shove their fucking dong down her throat

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.000
like she's a gay dude from San Francisco.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.160
Come on, you pinco-faggots, get down there.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.480
And you're like, you're used to it.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480
You're numb.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.560
But it's like, one of these days, man, one of these days.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.080
So yeah.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.400
Yeah, you are offended.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400
You are offended by it.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.000
Am I offended by it?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.800
Well, I'll tell you, you know that he's gay.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.480
And you're not exactly on the Kinsey scale, like fucking

01:24:53.480 --> 01:25:01.080
so far to the straight side that you find that idea offensive.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.000
Like, you're afraid to ask him about it because you're, you know.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.080
It's safer this way.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.960
You had some crazy experiences growing up

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.480
in your Midwestern hometown that's like in the fog that

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:21.920
gets created by abuse and experimentation in a society

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.040
that doesn't have conversations about it.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.680
Like, you're not even sure at this point what happened

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.960
and what didn't happen.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.240
And that was before half of your identity

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.080
was a robot from a magic land.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.560
Like, you kind of feel like maybe you

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.400
rubbed the head of your dick on your best friend's dick

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.240
at summer camp.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.480
And that you two were into it.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:54.200
But it was also like, you were so great to have a dick.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.360
Yeah, I was easy to please.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.800
Yeah, and you've talked to people that were like,

01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.880
oh, yeah, I did that too.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.400
And I'm straight as an arrow or whatever.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.960
And it's like fucking like, you don't know.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.640
But one thing's for sure, as a very thoughtful demolitions

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.520
and stealth expert, you're no stranger to self-examination.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.720
And you really admire Diggins because it's like, god damn,

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.280
if what's the case with him is what I'm thinking,

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.120
this fucking guy must have it really hard.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.760
Like, there's a really strong bond between you guys.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:31.520
And you've actually curtailed some of your pussy-eaten talk.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.880
Duke, you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:41.280
you do you you do you hurt of homosexuality but you do you

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.000
yes sir yeah yeah yeah.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.400
Familiar with a concept sir.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.420
No, oh, sorry.

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.320
I'm not, I'm not your captain right now.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.400
This isn't the debrief.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.280
Oh, oh sorry, sir.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.920
Duke of homosexuality.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.960
Yeah, so yes sir.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.840
We've got a special mission for you boy.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:10.840
You're going behind enemy lines. Are you familiar with the rising trend of disco music?

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.840
Yes, I am.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:17.840
The good news is I'm sending you back stateside. The bad news is you're a village person.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.840
No, no, no. That's a different campaign.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.840
Can I be the Native American, sir?

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.840
No, I was just going to let you know because I fleshed that out for these guys that just in case you're wondering.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:37.840
Duke, the Vietnam soldier, you just so you know, you don't know any of that stuff that I was just talking about.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:45.840
You're oblivious. You think that Lars Diggins is, you think he's boyish.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.840
Like, you know, like he's a boy scout. That's why he doesn't like to talk about like clits and stuff.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.840
Yes, he seems very innocent.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:57.840
Yeah, like you think you're just you're very confident in your masculinity and like you.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.840
Am I, sir?

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.840
I love the idea of this platoon in Vietnam.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.840
It's still it's still all officially homophobic, but it's like all like intimate.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.840
Duke, you're familiar with it.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.840
Listen, my sense of masculinity is a moving target, sir.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.840
The goalpost keeps moving.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:34.840
All right, so anyways, so you guys go down these stairs, they're they're familiar to you.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.840
Yeah, sir, are we back on Project Omega?

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840
Yeah, yeah, you're going you're going down these stairs.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:49.840
Project Omega is not, I mean, that's not what this is, but those those like those like Hanger Bay doors closed behind you.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.840
And just just before it would get pitch black, these like fluorescent lights like click on in the stairwell, the stairwell goes down, down, down, really far down.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:03.840
Like, wow, what a lot of stairs like you can't you can't you can't help but imagine like, wait, when we get deployed, do we have to go up all these stairs?

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:09.840
Table talk sidebar. Do we still have our like magical weapons from from the previous thing?

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:13.840
Are we you do you guys have all this equipment? He's still a robot.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.840
Yeah, what is my yeah, you're you're still an orc. You're like touching your lips and there's like tusks coming out of your lips.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:26.840
Okay, like, like it's you if you can cast spells like I don't know what to tell you.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.840
You know that it's you know that it's like somehow not normal.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.840
Okay, I got you. And so does obviously your superior officer.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.840
But I will say that mentally captain dandy pants.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.840
Yes, captain dandy pants.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:49.840
I will say that just did not mentally you you to I guess this is maybe a little meta.

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:52.840
Maybe I shouldn't be telling you this shit.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.840
I'm also kind of thinking out loud.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:11.840
But you guys are your your your American soldier memories are are like very quickly your bodies aren't changing,

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:18.840
but your minds are are getting more and more like you're forgetting your life in this other missed this realm,

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.840
like where you had your regular biographies.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.840
Like, for instance, you, you know, they you were abducted as a as a child.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:37.840
And when you were still human and taken to a weird cave where a dragon that commanded a bunch of golems that were like emancipated,

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:44.840
like they're like iron iron golems that had like freed themselves from their creators like so low and they belong to some.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.840
Yeah, like so probably like so low. I haven't seen it.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.840
But they yeah, they did like fucked up shit Wolverine style.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.840
Obviously, it was kind of like, you know, like they turned you into a robot.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.840
Not bad.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.840
That's why that's why you're it's not technically your race that robot thing.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:05.840
That's why that's why we thought you were human for a little bit on the jeans until you took your inspector gadget finger off.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.840
It's helpful that way.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840
Yeah.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.840
All right. Well, why are we forgetting our other memories?

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:16.840
Do you guys know that we also have alternate memories related to our fantasy backstories?

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.840
Yes.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.840
Do you have a spell that makes us remember those better?

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.840
I seem to remember when I cast spells, I cast light.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.840
Not that.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:30.840
What the fuck? Jesus, goddamn Mary and Joseph.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.840
This guy's got magic. We should find out what magic he can cast and it's mission critical.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.840
You're goddamn right. It's mission critical. I don't know what the fuck happened to all you guys.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.840
We have alternate backstories.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.840
What's wrong with your voice? You sound like a goddamn robot.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.840
You're telling me, Sarge.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.840
All right. Open up in there.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.840
It's a weirdly primitive system for all of us to do.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:03.840
He yells open up in there and a kind of submarine style door opens and you guys go into.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840
Well, it's kind of like a bomb shelter.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:12.840
It's just concrete halls painted like a drab green and there's like a guard there with a gun and he sees you guys.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:17.840
He starts freaking out.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:23.840
Get ahold of yourself fucking semen.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:28.840
What the fuck? I didn't transfer from the Navy for this.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:37.840
God damn it. You know that all branches of our armed forces have to have equal claim on this unique division.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.840
And that we, the Navy people have to guard this door.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.840
I told you you're going to see fucked up shit. Why are you acting like that?

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.840
Oh mama. Oh mama. Oh mama.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.840
You're fired. Get out of here. Report to the firing office.

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:58.840
Oh, what do I tell him? Tell him the truth. Tell him you don't belong here.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.840
Tell him you can't work here because you freaked out when you saw these guys come home.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.840
Okay. All right. Okay. Am I in trouble?

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.840
Jesus. I mean, it shouldn't be a good thing for you.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.840
Okay. Can I have one more chance?

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:19.840
What kind of fucking military commander would I be if I gave people second chances after they scream mama when they see robot people come through the door?

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.840
Yeah, but I just, I'm just fucking.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.840
All right. Fuck you. Just this once. Just this once. You little faggot. You little gay faggot.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.840
You fucking homosexual faggot.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.840
I make eye contact with Diggins.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:39.840
He gives you a look like, like, like, like, I get it. Like, don't fucking like, like, maybe even more subtle than that.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.840
Yeah, it's more subtle than that. Like, it's again, like, you don't know.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.840
Yeah, I cast call the motions.

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:50.840
You cast a call on professor. I can't get the dandy pants.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.840
Both are on the kid that's like freaking out. Yeah.

01:33:54.840 --> 01:34:02.840
Oh, okay. You cast the calm emotions on him. It's amazing. You keep rolling 19s every time you cast the spell.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:12.840
You just like do a fucking like return of the Jedi fucking gesture that nobody even knows and like the kids just like he just snaps to it and goes like,

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:20.840
Sir, I we work in extraordinary circumstances. I think it's good for me to continue to have strange reactions to them.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:32.840
I apologize. I acknowledge my offense. I commit to change and and his chest is just like he just like takes out his thing of the like the dandy pants.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.840
It's like, well, all right, then, God damn fucking navy fruits.

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:49.840
So used to water because it's like pussy fucking wet pussies fucking men fucking women, you know, that's the stuff I like to happen.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.840
All right. And then he knocks on a door.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.840
So the door opens and it's just this big like office.

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:08.840
It's like filing cabinets and fans, oscillating fans and guys in white short sleeve shirts with ties.

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.840
They got sweat stains around their armpits. It's really smoky.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:19.840
There's like bad ventilation with everyone smokes totally accepted normal thing to just smoke indoors.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.840
And this is a lot of astray is a lot of cigarettes.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.840
Duke, it makes you want to smoke a cigarette. You're a smoker.

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.840
I I pull out a cigarette.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:40.840
Well, you don't have you don't have any cigarettes on you because I pull out a cigarette out of somebody else's mouth.

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:52.840
The kind of guy horn rim glasses and white like you pull the cigarette out of his mouth and he's like, hey, don't mess with the orc.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.840
And I stick just one orc tooth out of my lip.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.840
He looks at dandy pants and dandy pants gives him this look.

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.840
It's just like, you know, just fucking roll with it.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.840
You bookworm.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.840
And another door opens on the other side of this like vast like kind of office pool is like on the other side of it.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:19.840
There's this wooden door and and the door opens and this this like general comes out.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.840
He's a full general. He's a he's a general general.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.840
We salute.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:26.840
Okay.

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.840
And give deference and four stars.

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.840
Everybody does except the. Yeah.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:35.840
I skipped four and four and a half stars four and a half stars. Nice.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.840
And one of the stars has like a tilde over it.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.840
Like it's like a special star for something like he's maybe he's bilingual or something.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.840
I don't know.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.840
But everybody yeah all the military people like the guards and stuff by the water cooler they all snap to attention and salute.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:58.840
So does you guys feel compelled like through your training you like salute the white shirted guys like they they they they they're scared of this guy.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.840
They're civilians apparently because they don't salute.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.840
He steps out he looks at dandy pants.

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:11.840
He gives him a nod dandy pants about faces and leaves through the door that he came he's gone now.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.840
And the general goes he looks up and down and looks at you guys and goes so it's true.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.840
I'll be a hot fucking butt in a Mississippi nut.

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.840
All right boys.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:30.840
Don't tie in this monkey's fist and he he'd head nods you in his direction.

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:31.840
Okay.

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.840
I go in that direction.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.840
Okay sir.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:51.840
You walk you walk through the office like your your rogue like instincts also your stealth special forces training you're kind of like looking around you see on pieces of paper or on these desks like this is it looks like a normal office but the materials on the on the desks like

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.840
are like have like really weird like kind of like runes and shit on them.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:07.840
It's like it's like you just get the impression that these guys are in the business of studying like weird shit but they're but that they're technically normal people studying it.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:22.840
So you get you get to that that end of the office area you go into this dark room and there's a there's a it's just like a big vast empty like onyx chamber.

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.840
Hell yeah.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:30.840
Yeah it's really easy to describe and it's not a lot of detail to it.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:38.840
What's cool is tired how do you do this.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.840
It's just like a like a video game.

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.840
It was like so many triangles and pixels that you can render before you're just like God damn it.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:45.840
Don't make it round.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.840
Make it a box.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:57.840
But yeah it's a big black room and there's it's like like there's like a couple chairs in the corners but at the far end of it.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:05.840
In front of a big screen is this like big desk and it's there's no one behind that desk.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:23.840
There's a name plate on the desk that says general hodge hodge and but there's a there's a standing slightly to the side of that desk is a man in a three piece suit with shock white hair pure ivory hair.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.840
Damn.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.840
It's more hair than you've ever seen and big white eyebrows.

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.840
I guess it's Matthew Maudine in Stranger Things.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840
But he also has a little goatee.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840
It's Oh it's Colonel Sanders.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.840
Oh yeah.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:49.840
But in a black suit Colonel Sanders in a black suit with horn rim glasses and he's not smoking so it doesn't bump with the smoking man in X files.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.840
It's kind of like Colonel Sanders in a black suit with glasses.

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:55.840
Colonel Sanders has glasses.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:06.840
He takes his glasses off his his piercing green eyes and you can't you can't see them closely yet.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:12.840
But boy if you ever look at his eyes closely there's like this crazy thing I'll describe.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.840
But he he says step forward into the light gentlemen.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.840
I go we we ran into mine flares.

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.840
You know about mine flares.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:27.840
I know about things that you've only just begun to understand.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.840
Well then learn that mine flares.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.840
It's crazy huh.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.840
That's bad news.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840
What's happening.

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.840
Thank you for that information soldier.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.840
Step forward into the light.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.840
Oh I do that then.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840
Let's get a look at this.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:47.840
Project Omega in all its glory.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:57.840
It seems you whippersnappers just found yourselves on the front lines of America's next brand of war.

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.840
What is that.

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:07.840
I cast I cast finished thought.

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:16.840
You do an amazing job but you're an orc fighter so you're just kind of like you just grunt at him.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.840
I'm suspicious of Colonel Sanders so from the darkness I'm going to cast detect magic him in the general actually.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.840
Oh you cast detect magic.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840
Okay interesting.

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:30.840
So Colonel Sanders not magic like you're sweeping around the room.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:36.840
Are you trying to disguise that or are you doing it sneakily.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.840
Are you is it your it's your objective to not be known so you're okay taking a penalty for that reason.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840
Sure.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.840
Okay so anyways you're fine.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:55.840
But yeah so you the Colonel Sanders is not he's not magic and the general general hodge hodge is not magic.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.840
Nothing in this room is magic except for a flower pot by one of the chairs in the corner.

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.840
There's a strange plant growing out of it and that screen behind the desk.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.840
It's like like it's it's it's that's that's magical and then there's a there's a plant that's magical.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.840
So that's glad you did that.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.840
Well I was really hoping you did that when I designed this room.

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840
Oh damn.

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.840
I elbow Tom Tom and I say hey there's something up with that plan that screen.

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.840
Yeah.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.840
I'll distract Colonel Sanders.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:27.840
Yeah.

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:28.840
To the plant.

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:29.840
Okay.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.840
Yeah.

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.840
I feel like the rogue should sneak over there though.

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.840
I'm gonna do it.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:34.840
Okay.

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:35.840
Yeah.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:45.840
So I just start engaging Colonel Sanders in conversation while well trace but trace but was it nuke.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.840
You're you're.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.840
Yeah.

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840
Oh you're you're.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:49.840
Digging.

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.840
Digging.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.840
No no you're digging.

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:52.840
I'm digging.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.840
You're digging.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.840
What are you just what are you doing you're you're.

01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.840
I'm just going to distract Colonel Sanders while while the rogue goes over there and checks out the.

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840
How are you distracting them.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:10.840
I I I I drop a knife out of my butt.

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.840
You had you had put the knife back in your butt.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:14.840
Yes.

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:15.840
Using your kind of work instincts.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:16.840
Yes.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:17.840
Like just at some point.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.840
Yeah.

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840
Okay.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:28.840
You you you you summon otherworldly anal reflexes to eject the the dagger from your ass onto

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.840
the onyx floor of the strange room.

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:36.840
It it definitely does a great job of distracting Colonel Sanders.

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:43.840
He's like well I'll be a Alabama side sloper.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.840
Side sloper.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.440
He he he waves at the the general like he's a snap stand on the general like it's like

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:55.840
rustling of the thing and it's like he pulls out like a strange kind of like bag that looks

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:00.840
like it's made out of like chamois material like like when you'd be like chamois your

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:01.840
car.

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:02.840
Yeah.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:09.440
And but it's like but it's like a forensic bag but it's like leather and he he he he

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.840
takes it over and he's got like a weird like forceps that he had in his other pocket and

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:21.920
he's like he holds up the the butt dagger and he was like do you remember that being

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:24.200
inserted in your anal cavity soldier.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:29.320
I have no memory of that sir I just know that it's been there since time immemorial.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:34.520
What do you recall about your childhood soldier.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:39.920
And I glaze over and realize I have no memories at all of my childhood.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:44.640
Okay so during this distraction yeah so you wanted this was a distraction yeah what did

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:47.600
you what did you want to do during that distraction you're going to go like to the plant you're

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.560
going to go over to it physically sure I'll look at the plant.

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:56.560
Okay you're walking casually over to the plant and they are very distracted this thing and

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.920
so you walk over to the plant.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.960
The plant it looks like a like a like a kind of like a giant version of a bamboo shoot

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.440
you know like when bamboo is first growing it's just like this little like little pointy

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.320
thing with like little things I don't know what a bamboo shoot looks like but it's a

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.600
giant version of that coming out of a medium sized pot and it's like a very rich green

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:26.240
with like a beautiful kind of like a tropical orange to yellow like accents on the edges

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.560
of the leaves and it's just it's just a vibrant plant.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.560
I reach out.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.520
It's growing in sand like white sand say what and I touch it.

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:49.720
You touch it okay okay when you when you touch it you feel like like incredibly rejuvenated

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:53.840
like like like not not in terms of health like any wounds that you sustained or any

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.000
fatigue in your muscles but you just feel like you feel like you could you could you

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.440
you could like take on the world like you just feel incredibly confident like it's like

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:11.360
a crazy otherworldly morale that you've taken on like you just feel fucking like messed

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:20.840
out or how big is this plant it's like the growth is three feet tall coming out of a

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:29.760
11 inch pot standard terracotta it's about 13 inches in diameter.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.400
Can I like hide it behind my back?

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.440
You're hiding the plant behind your back okay but you're just standing in front of the plant

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.840
like you walked over there you looked at it now you're gonna touch it now you're so okay

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:44.600
yeah so they're they're looking at the daggers so they're back to this because that's happening

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:49.880
during all of that so now back up to this point where you're saying yeah I have no memory

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:55.640
of my childhood which childhood exactly which child are we talking about my orc childhood

01:46:55.640 --> 01:47:05.480

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:20.040
and now that you've proven to be worthy test subjects it's going to get worse and worse

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:28.440
and worse and better and better and better you're gonna do so much for us we should probably tell

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:38.680
him exactly what's been going on at this point using our magic screen hit it the screen lights

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:51.720
up with imagery that elucidate the topic as they explain to you guys that um don't fail me now

01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:02.920
that the uh the the the the the the the the soviet union when it uh when it dug into

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:09.720
vietnam and korea it started realizing long before the americans knew it that uh that a cold war

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.800
was a losing one for the soviet union that capitalism was probably gonna work because

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:22.040
i mean you know we all know that now look how happy we are um it uh but they knew that they were

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:28.120
you know it wasn't gonna work in a in a square on fight so they started digging down into the earth

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:37.320
in the places like cuba and north korea and and the like and they unearthed a subterranean cavern

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:48.760
when they dug down into north korea and found a dragon egg and they heated it up with an electric

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:57.000
blanket and and they they put it in an incubator and they studied it and it started to crack and

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:05.080
hatch and when it did something crazy started happening that uh seddie the search for extraterrestrial

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.960
intelligence started reporting to them which was then a secret project no one knew that it was

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:16.680
actually started all the way back then uh and um that they were started to report like weird like

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:21.720
their equipment that they used to scan for intelligence in outer space was actually picking

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:28.200
up this weird signal that they first mistook for like is there an alien presence like two feet

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:33.640
outside of earth's uh atmosphere that we can't see but then over time they started realizing

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:39.560
that there was this throbbing presence this signal that was previously unknown to mankind

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:44.520
that was emanating from the earth itself that something was happening so over time what they

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:49.720
realized is there was some kind of like awakening of magic energy that was happening uh at the point

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:55.720
where this uh this dragon egg started hatching so they they stopped incubating the egg uh and took

01:51:55.720 --> 01:52:02.760
it to a secure facility uh more on that in the third adventure uh that we'll do uh new years um

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:12.520
but uh then they they found out that uh that so there's that you know um uh that magic is real

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:19.800
and uh and they found like uh and the and the and the and the and the russians were oh there it is

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:29.400
okay yeah they found out magic is real and uh and um and then uh so they started you they had already

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.880
been doing like these programs like uh in the american military that where they're doing like

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:39.400
remote viewing and and mk ultra and stuff like that experimenting with lsd and brainwashing and

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.920
all this stuff um so spies american spies with that that had access to the information of what

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:52.600
the soviets had uncovered uh um they uh they used it to liberate some of this uh uh uh information

01:52:52.600 --> 01:53:01.960
and used it to dig down in uh uh los alamos uh uh because and find a dragon egg of their own um

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:09.080
and uh it it they did not incubate it um but they uh they started chiseling into it and when they did

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:15.080
that um the person that was chiseling it uh got struck with a bolt in his eyeballs and he flew

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:21.320
back and his hair turned white and he became this colonel sanders guy um so so that that's this guy

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:26.440
he was like uh he's like a head scientist from mit that they entrusted with this project and

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:31.560
his name is colonel's what we gave him a name before i can't remember um let's call him colonel

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:37.960
sanders and uh he so he like and he he gained all this knowledge when he tried to like chisel into

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:43.800
this dragon egg and from his knowledge he started like dictating to uh like uh uh think tanks and

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:49.560
stuff and they started writing up all of these like uh tomes and things like uh and storing them

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:58.040
in transistorized devices and analyzing them and america so since like the 1959

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:03.160
has had this secret operation going where they've been like uh trying to like uh it's a magical

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:10.440
arms race that's been going on between the soviets and and and america uh uh all this time um uh

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:16.680
it's it's it was largely like not generating any results but they um had been like training people

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:22.280
to try to use this stuff like like they're you know like oh like like what if you uh read this

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:27.320
stuff can you try can you cast spells can you do stuff and it wasn't really working that well

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:32.200
but it was getting enough results that it's got massive funding and god forbid the russians actually

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:36.200
accomplish something before we do so that's just been going on underground which is why the defense

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:40.680
budgets are so enormous it's like how could a nuclear missile cost that much it's crazy it just

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:46.680
takes some nuclear shit and put it in a fucking uh bullet and throw it like like it's it's it's a huge

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.840
invention the idea that it takes a lot of money to make a nuclear missile all that money goes into

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.800
also schools it doesn't cost that much to teach children so all of that money uh has been secretly

01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:03.480
funneled into uh into these programs and uh uh so when you guys joined the military uh you you

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.960
you went through basic training but then like through certain tests and things they detected

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:14.120
kind of aptitude uh on your parts and then they started like funneling you over into these programs

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:21.560
um uh where you were getting uh trained for this other stuff and the the reason that we actually

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:27.080
went to vietnam isn't because we were trying to protect the you know the world from communism

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:34.040
in the sense of like vietnam being strategic it's because they there's a site in in in vietnam where

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:41.400
the soviets had found this like weird like stonehenge like structure but underground in this

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:52.040
like cavern and uh it was like this like it it it it it made more magic uh and so they sent you guys

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:58.840
on a reconnaissance mission uh and uh and then you got captured but then they put they tried some

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:04.040
weird shit on you and you had this whole adventure that we don't remember uh but you were and you

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:09.320
were in this different world and uh and then you you woke up in that in that cell and then then

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:14.520
now you're now you're remembering that this was all part of some crazy mission that started in

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:21.000
in in vietnam and you still don't understand did you go through a portal i bet you did uh

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.600
like why like like like why were you uh on the other you know in this other world so like that's

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:33.720
these guys are like they've always suspected that the reason why these dragon eggs are creating this

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:41.080
like uh magic energy is because they're the only things from a different universe that uh uh and

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:47.080
and uh that that exist in ours and that there must be some way to get to that universe where magic

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:52.920
is normal and technology isn't and if you could get there then you could take magic energy and use

01:56:52.920 --> 01:57:00.120
it for military purposes over here and so it seems like maybe the russians have found a way to get

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:05.240
to the other side and you guys must have been there and escaped i have one question for the

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:11.560
for the game i have one question for the game master mm-hmm whose turn is it um cliffhanger
