00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Music

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Music

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
From Meltdown Congress in Hollywood, California, Harmontown,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
There's now a session.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Music

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Dan Harmon.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Music

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Thank you.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Music

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
We have such an exciting show tonight.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I really feel like, yeah, I feel like it could be good.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
There's no fault of my own.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm in a pickle here, Dan.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Oh, yeah?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
See, it's already exciting.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
For those of you listening, and that's,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Jeff is literally in a pickle.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Laughter

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
$5 subscribe to see me living inside of a pickled cucumber.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
I popped the top button, the one that you button on a two-button suit.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Right.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Does anybody here have a needle and thread on them?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Seth, you do?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, I might be back in my bag.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
You got one back there?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Does anybody know how to sew a button back on a suit?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh, he tricked you.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
You do right there?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I trust you.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I trust him.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
All right, get up here.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
What's your name?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Anna.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Hannah or Anna?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hannah.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Hannah, the seamstress, everybody.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Applause

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Music

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Dan, I hate to derail the show right off the bat.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I thought you were going to keep going.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Like, does anybody have connections in the garment industry

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
that would be able to sell a good as new jacket?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And then, does anyone know,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
is anyone able to launder money?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And then he just like continues and like,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
because didn't he kind of trick us?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Because he said, does anyone have a needle and thread?

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
We were excited because we thought we were going to see like sartorial Rambo.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Now, Hannah needs the person with the needle.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Is it black thread, we hope?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, she got it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh, no.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I got to go look through my bag.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Nobody has needle and thread?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
We got Hannah here holding the button like an idiot.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm kidding.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
No.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Of course.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I mean, she's holding the bag here.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
You got the thread?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It might be at the bottom where I got it.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Seth.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm sorry.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Where's your bag?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It's in Fortin.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Fortin?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Needle and thread is in Orange County right now?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Uh-oh.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
What's happening over here?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
This is already the worst podcast I've ever been on.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
No.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Okay.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Now that there's a needle point thing happening over here.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh, that stuff.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Blue thread is fantastic.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
All right.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Hannah, may I give you my jacket?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm going to take my wallet and other pertinent things out of it.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
See what?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Thank you, sir.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
My tiered for mistrustful Mickey back there.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
He's our regular character.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
He's reminding all of us.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
All right, Dan.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
So take your phone.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I've seen it.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
What is your name, madam?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Who's got the needle and thread here?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Heather?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Heather, are you a needle point enthusiast over here?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
What's going on?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
No, my friend is.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Your friend is.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Is your friend.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
How do you know she's your friend?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Take it easy, Mickey.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
It's a general vibe.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, but how do you define it?

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
If she was on a railroad track and it was you or her?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Mistrustful Mickey is, he's endearing.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
All right.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Hannah and Heather, everybody, they're going to fix my jacket.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
What they're going to do, Dan, they're not just fixing my jacket.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
They're saving Memorial Day.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
I wouldn't think, don't you unbutton it when you sit down anyway?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Yes, but this is not business that was necessary.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
No, but I have shit to do after the show.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I can't be sewing buttons on.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, man.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I thought I would mind the vast resources of talent in our Harmontown audience.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
This is fucked up.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I guess you don't get paid to do the show, so that's fine.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
You were owed a little bit.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
You farmed labor and that's fine.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Hannah, do you feel exploited right now?

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Will you be able to enjoy and listen to the show while doing this?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
This is how she listens to podcast.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
She didn't expect to be doing it tonight.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Is there a shoe shine in the crowd right now because...

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
These little guys could use it.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Does anyone know how to hydroponically harvest soy?

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Because we're so close to our moon colony at this point.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Hannah could get started on a few jumpsuits after this.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
We've returned back to our moon colony?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, man, now more than ever.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Now that it's getting to be election season.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
Anyways, here's a segment that everyone loves called Green Room Antics.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Everyone enjoys hearing about behind the scenes at Harmontown.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
I needed a mint because I probably haven't brushed my teeth in two days.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I can't remember.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
A mint will wipe that right out.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
It's a perfect substitute for hygiene.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
It's the withdrawal of oral hygiene.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
100% effective.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
So I asked, I said, does anybody have gum or a mint?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
And then Dustin wasn't in the room.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
His girlfriend Elizabeth was.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Elizabeth said, I think Dustin has some mints.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Dustin came in, Elizabeth said, Dustin, do you have any mints?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
And Dustin said, yeah, I have some Altoids.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Can you give one to Dan?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
And Dustin was like, why, does your stomach hurt?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And Elizabeth starts laughing.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
And I don't understand what the hell is going on.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So Dustin, she's like, does your stomach hurt?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
And then Dustin leaves to go get the Altoids.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
And Elizabeth says, every time I have a stomach ache, Dustin gives me an Altoid.

06:14.000 --> 06:23.000
And I love him, so I pretend it helps my stomach ache.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And I've never told anyone this until tonight, she said.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
So she's been conditioning him to believe that Altoids are for your stomach.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Dustin, do you think Altoids are for your stomach?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Get out of here.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
Dustin Marshall, everybody.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
The same reason you get a dinner mint after you eat at a restaurant,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
because the mint settles your stomach.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
But that's the logic, since I was a child.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
That's what I learned.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
So you think when you go to a restaurant and you get that little red and white stripy circle mint thing,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
that's for your stomach?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Was it for your breath?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, I thought it was to settle your stomach.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Dustin Marshall, everybody.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
All right. Hey, who needs Letterman?

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
What a show.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
By the way, I'm sure you've noticed, you know, now that Dustin's out of the Huskow,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
you should all hide your cartoon money.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
He likes to wear that black and white striped shirt a lot.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Don't put any pies on the windowsills.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
All right, so anyways, okay, so God, I mean, I really, okay, I had so much to talk about.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
All right, so you know how in Mad Max Fury Road, everybody's got their little designations,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
their little jobs, like there's the War Boys and the other people.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
How do you get the guitar guy job?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You got to be fucking badass.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Also, you have to not mind a lot of sand in your face, because he's right out in front.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, and he's relatively, oh yeah, it did seem like he was blind, yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
That's how he got that job. He's like a prodigy or something.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Or did they poke his eyes out in some kind of ritualistic thing?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I would watch a whole movie about that guitar player guy.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, it was pretty great. Okay, good movie.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay, but you know, you don't have to...

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Uh-oh.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, I mean...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Are you qualifying your love of Fury Road right now?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
No, no, I'm not at all. Not at all.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
I just, like, I've kept my lips zipped. Aaron enjoyed that movie so much,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
and all of her friends enjoyed that movie so much.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And then on the way home, there's just that, like, she's like,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
oh man, it was so impactful, it's so good, such a refreshing change.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And then she was like, how did you enjoy the movie?

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Was that intimidating for you?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
And I was like, no, no, but inside I was like, fuck you.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And I have only said that to you guys, don't tell her.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I was just kind of like, what? Come on.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Intimidated by the feminism of the movie?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, yeah, like, oh, are you able to handle that explosion boy?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Penis man?

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Like, motherfucker, I don't care who's blowing shit up.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
I love that there's men's group that hate that movie for being too feminist.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
It's a bunch of dudes fighting and blowing shit up.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, also Mad Max as a protagonist has never been anything other than...

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
This is the best Mad Max movie ever, out of all of them, for sure.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I will say that, that's my opinion.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And I particularly love that actor playing Mad Max, and I love that performance.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And I had heard that he's like, oh, he's taking a slight backseat

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
because there's this other sort of thing happening,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
but that's not really true.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
If you watch all these movies, he's always...

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
What I like about Mad Max is that he's really more canine than human.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And it's especially brought out by the Charlize Theron character,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
is that he's like this lovable spaniel, you know?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
And that actor was so good at it, he was like, he just kept reminding me of my dog.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Like, he's just like...

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
But then, like, a good movie dog, he's not just obedient.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Like, the good movie dog turns the plot, too.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
The good movie dog, all of a sudden, is like...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
What is it? What is it?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
The movie's going in one direction, dog. What do you want?

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Which is what he does. No spoilers there.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Also, there's a lot of sand and vehicles.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
If you haven't seen it, it's pretty great.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't know what to talk about. You guys are all talking about Mad Max, which is great.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
It's a great movie. Please enjoy.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
But also, like, you know, Ripley, why didn't we make that big a deal about Ripley?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Because she had to have the panion bra scene in Alien.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, I don't know.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Because that was like a slasher movie in space.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
She was like Jamie Lee Curtis running from an alien screaming.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
She wasn't really like...

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
But aliens... She was driven by her uterus, I guess.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
She was like, I got to save that baby, because I'm a lady.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I just... I find it fascinating.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I went and did a little exploring online.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I mean, a very little, because you get...

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
A little goes a long way of reading about what the menonists, whatever the fuck they call themselves...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Menonists!

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Menonites.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Menonites on Broadway!

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
The New York Times called just menonites.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Dashing, good time.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Do I, do I, do I?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
That's like an excerpt.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Menonites have come...

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh, I've got Menonites.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
The girls are done.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
But you read a little bit about it, and they're so mad that there's women with agency in a fucking action movie.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
What do you want?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Is your stance that you want nothing but sweaty guys rubbing up against each other the whole movie?

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
It's like, what are we talking about at that point? You want no women in your movie?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Or they just have to be props? They just have to be damsels in distress?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
They want top gun. They want top gun, man.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
They want a lot of beach volleyball, baby.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't know. Who are they?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
There's a menonite inside all of us.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
They're not called menonites, they're called menonists.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Menonites are noble, weird religion.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
I think as we move forward, we need to start to... We're doing a great job accepting everything,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
and I think we need to start accepting a little bit of ignorance.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
There was an article that Emily Gordon had tweeted that I retweeted.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
She retweeted it, and I retweeted or tweeted.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
But the headline was something like, admit it, you're fav is problematic.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
And I think it was sort of like the treatise was sort of like, look,

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
a world full of people you're going to admire, and they're not all going to be mentally perfect.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
Some of them are going to have slight racist holdovers from something.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Some of them are going to need to be edified in terms of gender.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
There's a good chance that as you move forward and admire people throughout your life,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
a lot of them are going to disappoint you.

12:54.000 --> 13:02.000
If we're going to actually fix the world and become like this Roddenberry vision,

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
which I think everybody would agree with that, even though it seems like a lot of people want to fight that,

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
the real truth is if we're going to make it there, it's going to be because we actually get good at greeting ignorance

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
and saying, I know what you are, that's okay.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
You just don't know some stuff yet, and I'm not going to bully you or reverse bully you

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
or condescending you or police you.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
It's challenging, and it's not fair, but what else are we going to do?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Beat them up? What are we going to do?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes, we're going to beat them up.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
It feels good if you happen to be somebody that was bullied in your life.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Of course it feels good to finally flip them over and spit in their face,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
but maybe we can do that for a little bit.

13:47.000 --> 13:57.000
I keep saying, we oppressed people unite, but I was part of a group in the 70s called kids that throw like a girl

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
and who smell like sewage, although it wasn't born that way.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I could have done something about that.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
I presented as sewage, and I was judged for it.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
Anyways, whatever, Harmon, shut your fucking hole, but then keep talking.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
You okay, Dan? You alright?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Okay, so let's bring faucets back. I just want to make this quick.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Let's bring faucets back in public bathrooms.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
Obviously we don't have the motion detection technology.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Obviously that needs another five years in the oven.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It's not working.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It doesn't know when your hands are under the thing.

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
By the way, I'm not a biologist, but the day a germ can live on cold metal,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I think we're going to be dead before you go to a public bathroom.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, because the shit's going to be like everywhere.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
Germs tend to like moist, warm biological places, like the ones that can really hurt you.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
There's not going to be one sitting on a doorknob going like,

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
I can't wait to get inside your body and kill you.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
I feel like anything that you touch until you've finished washing your hands is...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Hannah, are you already done?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Hannah the seamstress, everybody.

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
Alright.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Alright, one more thing, and I want to bring up our first guest.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Looks good.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Thank you, Hannah. That's very lovely of you.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Why did I write the voicemail?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Oh. Oh, I want...

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Oh, that's pro. That's a good button.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
That's going to last for a while.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I guess I could try this.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
There's got to be someone here who speaks Spanish.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
We find out there's no British people last week.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I speak a touch of Spanish. Do we need lots of Spanish?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You can see what this guy is saying.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Over there.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I don't know if you'll be able to hear this.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
What's your name?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Megan.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Megan?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Megan.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Okay.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
This is a voicemail I got today when I didn't pick up.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Do we need Megan at it or translate?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Well, that's all. I'm seeing if she can hear this.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
This makes it through the speaker system.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
It's kind of... Let's see if this works here.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
You want to plug it in?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I can wire you in.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Hey, my name is Hamid.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm from Paris.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Bye.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Okay.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah, that might have been Arabic.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, it might have been pseudo-racist of me to assume that was Spanish.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I don't even know.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Whatever language he's speaking, he's mumbling in it.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
The alarming thing you can't hear is that there's a really sharp child's cough at a certain point.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
He's like, hey, what are you mumbling?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I say, what are you mumbling?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm like, do you know that you just called a fat white comic?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm not a comic. Why am I not a comic?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Should we try plugging in and hearing that?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Any kid that's in a bag is like, oh, you're a comic now.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Do you want to try plugging in and hearing that with better fidelity?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
We can try to figure this out.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I don't know how worth it that is.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm curious.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Was that a wrong number?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
No.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
It was a perfect number.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
He nailed it.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
He called exactly the right guy.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
I am life-flighting his kid to the Whooping Cough Center.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Yes, it's a wrong number.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't even know what language he's speaking.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Maybe your car was in the shop and the guy was calling you back saying your car is ready or something.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh man, my car is going to be in the shop forever.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
They need to switch departments. That guy should be working on my air filter.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I want to hear it again. Play it again.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Okay.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I think everybody get very quiet.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Hold on. I'm just 42 and it's an iPhone.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Just give me a second.

18:13.000 --> 18:25.000
Did you hear the kid?

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
I'm really concerned that I don't know how to get this guy back.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's not a listed number.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
Hello, Dr. Harmon at the Tuberculosis Society.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
My child is not going to die.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Bye.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
If you don't call back, I'll assume she's okay.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
She's turning green.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm not convinced that's Spanish.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That's not Spanish.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You heard TARDIS?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
It could have been Catalan, right?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
TARDIS? I heard later.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
They would call me later.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Later would be added at 5.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
What's that?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's Cactus.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Is that what they're doing?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
A call back to Cactus Bunch?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
That's a deep cut.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
The Cactus Bunch isn't here, right?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
The thing about the Cactus Bunch is

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
the Cactus Bunch is also 40 years old right now.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I would like to go hang out and have a drink with the Cactus Bunch.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
And ask him about the time they took my paisley bandana off me

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
and wanted me to fight them for it.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
I think I'm most scared out of all the gang bangers.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
I think I'm most scared of the Latino ones.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
Whispering doesn't make this not recorded.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Alright, alright.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
Let's bring up a friend that I've been wanting to come up here for a long time.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
He needs no introduction, which is a good thing because I'm bad at them.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
He's an amazing comment.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Senator Bernie Sanders.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Mr. Andy Kindler has come down here.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
You can have a seat in any of these seats.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Thank you for having me.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I never know how these panel things work.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Wherever you're comfortable.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I think the camera guy might have a preference.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
He's like, oh would you sit there?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Chris, is it better if he sits closer to me?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
They don't care.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Can you get us in a two shot?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't know what I'm saying.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That's what the old comics would say.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I don't know what that meant.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I'm already bombing.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
How could I be bombing that quick?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
You bomb before you sat down.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Bombing on site.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh, it's an old comedian of some type.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
I have told them about you and worshiped at your feet.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
We've got to get Kindler up here.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
He's one of the quickest bombing comics.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
The main thing is he didn't build it up too big.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I felt like I had to do that.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I didn't have to do that.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't know why I did that.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
It's not your fault.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
He's the best.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Now look at us.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
You're not responsible for their judgmental attitude.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
Kids today, they're like, yeah, you make us laugh.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
What do you got?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It's not like audiences back in the 70s.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
No, back in the 70s, they were like,

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
I hope Gallagher smashes some melon and it gets on me.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
That's what they were like.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
It was easy back then.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You guys knew what to do back then.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
What will this Robin Williams think of next, they said back then?

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Too soon, too late, too soon.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm going to do this joke every night.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm on stage for the rest of my life.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Every night, I've done it every night so far and I will do it again.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
Who died and made Jim Belushi a big star?

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I do the long stare.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
I've stolen many of your jokes and borrowed them in conversation or whatever,

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
but there's nothing I've stolen more than when you say a punchline and hold it.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And that's built on a tradition of thousands of years of Catskills comic.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Thousands of years, fuck it.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Thousands of years.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
Back in the code of Hammurabi, there was a code of Hammurabi.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
That's Karnak I'm doing.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
I did a Kermak thing last week to abject silence.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Get it out.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
They don't know anything pre-Fallon.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
I saw in the final montage of the Letterman goodbye, you popped up between two presidents.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
I can't follow Obama.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
That was a joke at one point.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
No, I couldn't believe it.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I was totally thrilled.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
I thought I saw, sometimes you're a dry guy, but sometimes you're a very sincere guy on Twitter.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
One of the things I was thrilled to talk to you about is how,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
because I am the thing that really endeared you to me,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
whereas otherwise you'd just be that really, really funny guy,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
and sometimes it's easy to hate that guy because you're like, fuck that really funny guy.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I often hate myself because I'm so funny.

23:36.000 --> 23:45.000
But you bother to argue with people on Twitter about ideological stuff.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
People pick on you about not being an atheist and you push back.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
You came to my defense with the best thing.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
You said if you don't believe in God, it's one thing.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
I said to these kids that were picking on you,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
I think you're mistaking atheism, which is I have no God,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
for antagonism, which is you have no God.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Exactly.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
And then that got retweeted so much and then there's just strangers, I posited that like I'm fucking played out.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I didn't say that on the mount.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
I was saying that to these three kids that were shaking down Andy for his lunch money,

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
because he dares to have a connection to the fucking cosmos.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
First of all, if you're 20, shut the fuck up about religion or about my lack of it.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Are you kidding me?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
You were closer to birth.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Worship your mother's vagina.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
I have his mother.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
That's what made that joke work.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I'm not doing it.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
No, you're absolutely right.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
And here's the thing is that this whole topic has enraged me,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
but it also mixes up with a lot of different things, which is like people like,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
I'll give you an example of how a lot of these atheists, first of all, it drives them.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't care if you're atheists.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Most of my friends are atheists.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
My dad was agnostic.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Some comic who I've no longer friends with was talking about how it's hard to be,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
you know, you get oppressed if you're an atheist.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And you're oppressed as an atheist in America.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
Show me where you're, you'd have to move to Alabama and specifically walk around and go,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
there's no God, you Jesus loving piece of garbage.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I don't know, that was a bad example.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
But the point is, so, so, but this is an example of how some of these people's minds work.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Someone was arguing with me and they said, they always say that religion causes,

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
you know, the Quranic causes people to become violent.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
So I said, well, stop, you know, Stalin was an atheist.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And then they go, then the guy comes back.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh, you're saying atheism causes.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
No, I'm saying none of it causes violence.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
So it's like they claim to be brilliant, but not even using their own logic.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
There's a lot of it.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah, I feel like.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm sorry, I got so excited about nothing.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
We have an understanding.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
I mean, I bet if I asked all the atheists to stand up, I don't want to risk it because they might go,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
well, I'm standing, let's walk out.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah, but I, I, look, I mean, I, I don't always like, like, like, I'm just a Joseph Campbell guy.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
And I was like, like, I was, I was an atheist slash agnostic to until I started writing and started having writer's block.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
I mean, discovered Campbell was reading this and the guy grew up a Catholic boy scout and he was smart.

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
And, and, and he, the value of mythology in your life is like, that's all I care about.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
Like I always say to people, if you're going to pop Tom, Tom Hanks is volleyball.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
What are you going to replace it with?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Cast away.

26:42.000 --> 26:49.000
They don't even, they were born after that movie came out.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
It's a, it's a young demo.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
No.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
No.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
Well, the thing is, no, no, but the thing is, it's like, the thing is the worst thing, there is no sign.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
And they drive them crazy when they go, there's absolutely, there's zero science in atheism.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Nothing.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
It's nothing scientific.

27:04.000 --> 27:13.000
Because first of all, unless you're eight years old or 12 years old, of course we're not talking about people literally believe the Bible is true.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Those are fundamentalists.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Nobody believes fundamentalists what they believe in.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Although I've met a lot of nice fundamentalists.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
I mean, then there's fundamentalists who will tell you you're bad for, for being gay.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
But the point is, you can't say something isn't true when the word God, I use it to describe something I can't describe.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm not even saying what it is.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I'm just saying I did LSD in college.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
I've had a, I've written music.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I, you know, on stage you get into, into a zone.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I take martial arts.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
They call it no mind.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
The root of, of so many things in life, meditation is a belief in some kind of transcendent experience.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
And you can't, and it seems like ridiculous that these people live in their little head.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
They really think that that's where they're going to be able to figure out everything.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Science has nothing to say about the kind of things that I'm talking about.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Right, exactly.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying the world's 3,000 years old or creationism.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
It's like, there's no scientific thing that could come out where I would go, okay, I was wrong.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Right.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
There is, there is no love.

28:13.000 --> 28:20.000
And there's a, there's a, there's a larger scale on which it's like, oh my God, well, are you, do you know that people used to put leeches on people and burn people at the stake and all that stuff?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Right.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
It's like, yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
And, and in that scale, we've won.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
There's bigger skyscrapers than churches on every skyline.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
There's like no place where there's like crucifixes everywhere and you get whipped for anything if you don't believe in anything.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Like, we're winning.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
We're, we're, we're, it's, it's, it's on schedule.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Like, like the death of religion.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
It's fine.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
We're fine.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
I can't believe I've ever had to defend organized religion.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I mean, I'm not even defending.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I'm not defending anything.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
No, they're worse than anybody.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Right.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Anything with a name on it, they can go fuck themselves.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
But wouldn't you rather hang out with the Pope than Bill Maher?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
I would.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Absolutely.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Well, this Pope, I'd rather hang out with this Pope than Bill Murray.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
This Pope is like a fucking terrorist.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
He's amazing.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
That's like the biggest compliment I can give a Pope.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
It's like a terrorist.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
He knows what, he knows, the Pope knows what he means.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
Like every other day you turn on NPR, it's like the Pope, the Pope said that people who hate gay people are going to hell.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
And like, he's just sort of like, I don't know.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
He didn't say that, but like, I mean, like, like, boy, they really put a, they put a firecracker in the old Pope seat.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Yeah, yeah, he's good.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
The Pope was in West Hollywood last night doing poppers.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
He's good.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
He's not normally a papal person.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
I've done that joke.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I've done it before.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
They love it.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
They love it.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
It's my joke I've done it before.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Jesus.

29:39.000 --> 29:49.000
He actually hit, that was, that was actual physical violence on the show for the first time, I think.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I can't believe I actually hit him with a piece of paper.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
We've had some screwballs up here and that was the first physical violent act.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
It was physical comedy.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Well, I'll give you a perfect example.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
It's like, I say online.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I say online.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
I don't know.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I don't know anything about, I don't know anything about Charlie Hebdo.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I've seen a couple of cartoons where they're showing Mohammed.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Easy, dude.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
You don't know what I'm going to say.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You don't know what I'm going to say.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Okay.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
What were you, oh, don't even start.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
No, I don't know anything about you.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
I've seen a couple of cartoons where there were Mohammed's balls.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Do you want a piece of paper and a pen to draw Mohammed right now?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
No, I don't.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
I don't.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
But the point is, I say, look, just because, of course, you know, they go, well, I don't

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
know if Charlie Hebdo, I don't know if their cartoons were racist.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
I don't know.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I guess they go, well, they shouldn't have been murdered.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yes.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I can't we stipulate that I'm against murder.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Not pro-murder.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Has there anything I've ever said to you where you go, Andy, you're not saying you're going

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
to kill that guy because he cut you off in traffic.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
But the point is, if you can't have a discussion about that there are certain things in the

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
world like those Danish guy, that Van Gogh guy who did get killed, but there's a lot of

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
people provoking people who are not in the power position in their country.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And we can't have a discussion about it.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
And Salma Rush is going to say, because some people didn't want them to get a pen award,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
that they have no character.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
That's where it's like, you know, you have to have a discussion.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
If you're telling me there's no validity to my position because you can't murder a cartoonist.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I'm against murdering cartoonists.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
They should not be murdered.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Andy.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Andy.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
If you think you're murdering a cartoonist, count to 10.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Andy.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Unless it's family circle.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
It's well documented that you've been soft on murder for a long time.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
I know.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
That's not true.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
It's a couple of times.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
I murdered a couple of people and I wasn't sorry about it.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
I will confess that I have been very, I refrain from ever speaking about the have to think

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
because I've been so confused about it because I am a rabid, mouth foaming, I don't even want

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
to say first amendment guy because I don't think, you know, the freedom of speech is

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
something you get from a lawyer.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
I think it's something you get by virtue of your humanity.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
But I'm like, anybody ever trying to stop blah, blah, blah.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
But the thing is that I had to realize, I think you retweeted an article.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Was it you?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Yes.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
That guy.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Where it was all the French muslims that was just sounding off.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Oh, yeah.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
They asked a different article.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
It was a vice magazine article and all it was, there was no agenda to the article except

32:19.000 --> 32:28.000
that it was just a bunch of French Islamic individuals commenting on the situation by

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
virtue of being asked by this journalist.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
And I was like, I just read it and I kind of like got this more distant view and started,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
I was like, oh my God, I got caught up in that age old thing that I'm always railing

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
against which is so much easier to recognize within the country where you're being told

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
falsely that you have to choose between two things.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Right.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
You have to choose between whether you love freedom or love terrorism.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Right.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
Like I got, me, me, old genius pants.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Not old genius pants.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
I got, I got, I was like, I was like, I don't understand.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
It's like, I don't, I mean anybody who's, who shoots anybody is a fucking bully.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
And so we should just always like fucking gather around and do whatever we have to and blah,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
blah, blah.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
But yeah, yes, you can still feel that way, but you can also be equally passionate about

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
everybody being respected all the time.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
This isn't, this isn't something that's up for referendum anywhere.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Right.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It's not, it's, you don't have to choose salt or pepper.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Like anything you can be like, the potatoes need some salt.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
The pepper needs some salt and the salt needs some pepper.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
And then both the other potato needs some salt and pepper.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
No, but for example, Bill Mark will quote, Bill Mark is a horrible person.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.000
He will quote, he will quote, he will say 70% of, you know, according to a Pew poll in Syria

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
where 70% of Muslims hate those cartoons.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
What does that mean?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
They're allowed to hate the cartoons.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
You're allowed to draw the cartoons.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I'm allowed to say I can't, I hate them.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
And it seems to me, I didn't see a lot of these people arguing about having mosques near 9-11.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
You know what I'm saying?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Everything in your, that's also freedom of expression.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
So everybody's freedom of expression is based on where you are in your life.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
So many of my friends have got, they almost like jumped up from the table because they're artists.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
So that's all they see in that moment.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
And it's so important to see that.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Yes, it is.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And murder is wrong.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
It's a two little family circus that guy should be allowed to walk around.

34:26.000 --> 34:35.000
You say, I measure of the extremity of artists supporting.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
Are you coming down in favor of murdering Bill Keane and family circus?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
No, I retract that.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
For a minute, I got a little angry.

34:44.000 --> 34:52.000
He's expressing his belief in non-murder to the extent that he's willing to say Bill Keane should be walking around among us, breathing our air.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
That's tolerance.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That is very tolerance.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
You think I don't want to...

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Just as card-carrying non-murderer.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
You think when Garfield doesn't like Mondays, I don't want to rip my head off?

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
But I... You don't think I want to send Jim Davis to the Eternal Monday of...

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
To the Lasagna of Hell?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Yes, I do.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
Why were you all up in arms?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Oh, okay.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But you agree that I'm right?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
That's all I care about.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
I want to be the guy who gives his opinion and is not afraid to say anything, but everybody has to love me.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Let's all just love Andy.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
That's it.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
All right, so let's talk about comedy.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Andy, what is this...

35:40.000 --> 35:48.000
You did a great thing for, I think, several years at the Just For Laugh Festival in Montreal, the state of the industry address, which is hilarious.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
What do you think the state of comedy is right now?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Well, I think the state...

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
Well, first of all, when you have a Mr. James Corden, who...

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
They don't even know who he is.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
I honestly don't either. He does the fish sticks, right?

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
No, I used to go with this, make this speech.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Now nobody even knows the references.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
Okay, I love the show B-roll with Carson Daly. Have you seen that show?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
No.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
All right, so Carson Daly doesn't even...

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Doesn't have time to be on his own show anymore.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
He doesn't do the interviews on his show.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
He throws to comedians who put their own segments together.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
Why are you not outraged by this?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Then we have the comedians.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Josh Gad is literally...

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
He's in everything.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
He's in everything.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I opened up my mailbox this morning.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Josh Gad popped out.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
He physically popped out?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Have you seen the comedians?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Yes.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
It's behind the scenes of vaudeville is what it is.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
And Josh Gad said that Billy Crystal is an encyclopedia of comedy.

36:49.000 --> 36:58.000
He didn't say that he's a 1957 world book.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Adam Sandler, he's Adam Sandler movie.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
They walked off a set of that movie.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
Even the writers of F-Troop sent them a note.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
They don't even know what Adam Sandler movie is in production.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
Hello.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
No, I'd like to drown in my own sorrow.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
Sometimes non sequiturs don't work.

37:27.000 --> 37:37.000
I would assume that you would agree that...

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Hey, Ricky Gervais, is that what you're...

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Ricky Gervais.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
No, you were onto something.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Ricky Gervais, give me some Ricky Gervais.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
Okay, Ricky Gervais spends half of his Twitter feed talking about what an atheist he is.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
Although he doesn't even understand the basic tenets of monotheism.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
Someone goes, he goes, what God do you believe in?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
We've already settled that whatever it is that people are sensing,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
it's all the same thing, viewed through different cultures.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
But this idiot doesn't even know what he's talking about.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
So half of his feeds about that.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
And then the other half of his feed is about how he doesn't care what people say about him.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Half of his tweets.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
And I want to know, can I get a price on Netflix without Derek?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
One more time, one more time, one more time.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Give me one more.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Without Derek.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Better than without Derek.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
What's the price without Derek?

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
The joke's up there, Dan.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Oh, and you're bringing it down?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Yeah.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Without Derek.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Is it like frosting?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And we're like in a gingerbread house?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I'm painting a picture for the people.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
And then always, if it doesn't get big enough laugh,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
you say something in between the jokes,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
like pretty frightening stuff, people.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I think I'm making you sick.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
No, no, no.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I'm such a bad interviewer that sometimes if you look over at me,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I'm thinking about what I should ask you next.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Is this not making you comfortable?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Let's do this.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Let's do this.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
You think I would agree with you?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
I was going to say, I would imagine you might agree or would tweak this observation

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
that there was a certain point in time when a certain kind of,

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
I always call it the apple on the teacher's desk school of comedy.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Fallon.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Let me finish, if you like.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Lay it on me.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Yes, I will say, yes, yes.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Fallon fully represents that.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
It's the mistaking fun for funny,

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
and it's also the sort of like a comedian's job isn't to upset people,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
which I don't agree with.

39:35.000 --> 39:41.000
I feel like a comedian should not be allowed to be pals with a politician.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
I think you should definitely feel that there's like a red flag happening there.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
If like, Ted Cruz is a nice man and we hang out.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
We don't talk, we play golf.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
We don't talk politics.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Funnier here.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Funnier there.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Funnier there.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
No, I know what you mean though,

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
but also that's why Letterman was so amazing was because he was himself.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Right.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
It's funny when you yourself, curmudgeoned,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Andy Rooney is still complaining about his coffin.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
He's like, why is my, why are my eyebrows still growing?

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Why didn't I get myself cremated?

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
I don't think eyebrows should keep growing after you die.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I think they should stop.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
I don't know why there's a top on the coffin.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Why is there a lid on here?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
No one's going to open this up.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Look at me.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Where am I going to go?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
I don't know where to be.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I don't need more lining.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
I understand they needed to put my body in,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
but they could have welded it shut.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it out loud,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I guess a lid makes sense.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Goodbye.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm dead Andy Rooney.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I'm dead Andy Rooney.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I found my peace.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I would love, I would love it.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
If 60 Minutes was edgy,

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
they would have a dead Andy Rooney at the end of every episode.

41:09.000 --> 41:18.000
I perceived the shift toward the Apple on the Desk philosophy of comedy

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
as coming around Chris Farley's death.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
Because I felt like it was just one too many for everybody.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
And then there was a certain like takeover of like,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
okay, now let's have the activities committee.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
What do you mean Apple on the desk?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
I don't understand.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
I just mean like, hey, who's your favorite student?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
It's me.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
What were you at home school?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
You know.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Boom!

41:40.000 --> 41:48.000
You know how in high school, there were the kids that put together the pep rally?

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
And they would like, and then Mr. Simmons from chemistry would come out

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
and he would like slip sync to an Elvis song.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
And then he would, and then Jeremy would come out who's famous for his mullet

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
and then they'd cut his mullet because he said he'd cut it if they didn't win homecoming.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
And it's like, everyone's like, woo, woo, woo!

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
It's like this fusion of popularity and comedy, but it's not really comedy.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
Like the kids that are smoking joints under the bleachers,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
like they're not all funny either.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
But like a comedian should come from the dirt, right?

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
They shouldn't come from like popular like crops of people.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
And I felt like like the edginess and that association with drugs,

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
it's always been there and it's always been like sort of a sad but realistic

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
like kind of thing is it's like comedians are terrible tortured people.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
They're in a lot of pain, they self-medicate.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
And like, so there's like, you know, as with musicians, there's just always been this kind of like,

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
okay, this comedian like, like, you know, kind of like, he's allowed to say shit

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that no one else is allowed to say and he catches flak for it,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
but he doesn't give a fuck and that's the comedian station and oh, he overdosed.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And like the...

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
It's not no one specific we're talking about.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Also not pro overdose.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Yeah. It's a hypothetical comedian.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Maybe it's my oh, like I tipped a glass of milk.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
I guess it's maybe you're like...

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
Enish Madoopy drowned in a pool of his own cocaine.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
What?

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
What's Enish P. Madoopy?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Enish Madoopy, I said.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I'm not good at...

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Enish Madoopy.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
Anyway, I just said, you know, he had his own pool of cocaine.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
You know, a lot of times it's not what some people say funny things funny,

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
but funny people say funny things, things, things.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Have you ever heard that one?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
They used to hear that one all the time.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Like, is that a bromide?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Some people say funny things.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Comics.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Comics and comedians.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Comedians say funny things, comics say...

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Say things funny.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Say things funny.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Right.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Dumb.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
I didn't say you said that.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Andy Kiddler is saying you guys said that.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
You did it.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
You guys said...

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Why would you bring that?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Your silence is consent.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
When you...

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
That's right.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
You think he's...

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
You like racism.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
You're pro-racism.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
You...

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
You sons of the...

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
When I was back there and you said about...

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
You said you were in a comic, right?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Right.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Okay.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Now, this is...

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I mean, he is a comedian, but the idea...

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Like, these people like Karola or...

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
They all of a sudden think...

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Or Gervais is another example.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Gervais thinks he's the funniest in our community in the world.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
What is wrong with your ego that you think...

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Because you've done stand-up 15 or 20 times?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And it's like to have humility.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
You have humility.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
It's like, you know you're funny, but you're not.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Right.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
You know there's a certain...

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
And these people...

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
And I can't complete sentences.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
What do you think?

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
But yeah, you and Pat Naswell sit there and it's like fucking like...

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Yeah.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
You know, you work for 10 years and the result is like a strong 15.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
I think I just insulted you guys.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's a strong...

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
11.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
No, but I mean, it's like...

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
It's fucking like...

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I mean, you torture yourselves and you like...

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
And you work it and blah, blah, blah.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
And it's like this podcasting age is a great thing,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
but I sense like with Kumail Nanjiani too.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
It's like...

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I'm about to go on stage and I'll go like...

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Or Duncan Trussell too has like been working on the road

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and the last time when he's sort of become a podcast star,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
but it's like his podcast audience is way bigger

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
than his comedian following, I think.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
So if it goes on tour with his podcast,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
he draws these huge crowds for no effort at all.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
But if he's like just touring as a stand-up,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
it's sort of like, oh, he does stand-up.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
And I remember saying to Duncan before going on stage is like,

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
are you mad about the last 20 years that we...

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Right, right.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And he's like, yeah, you know what, I am.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Yeah.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Yeah, that's really fucking enraging.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Because he's a very happy guy.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
That's a good little Duncan Trussell.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
But anyways, yeah, I don't know, I'm just babbling about that.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
And there's no value...

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
And my thing is there's no value judgment,

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
but you know, it's like that with...

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Did you see that thing where Ricky Gervais was on

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
with like Chris Rock and those guys and Louis C.K.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
and they were all talking about comedy

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
and the fact that Ricky Gervais, he's a narcissist.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
He had a thing on Twitter once,

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
my favorite example of someone who was so full of himself.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
He said, this is the only trophy hunting I believe in

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
because he's doing animal rights things

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
and he's standing in front of a case with his trophies in it.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
No.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
And I forced him to change his Twitter bio.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I absolutely am convinced of it

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
because his Twitter bio said,

46:23.000 --> 46:30.000
multi BAFTA winning 16 ME deserving writer, producer,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
actor, singer, I mean literally.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
And he goes, and a one-trick pony with a smiley face.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Ah!

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
You can't be a comedian and not realize

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
and not have any self-awareness.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
And I love the original office.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Boy is my face red.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
I guess Steven Merchant was responsible.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
He is that character.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I mean, who's the guy who played?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Merchant, you think Merchant is,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
whatever, Ricky Gervais is character?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Maybe he has a soul of some kind.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
But Ricky Gervais is that character.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
David Brent.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Yeah, he's not playing.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah, interesting.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
So, okay.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
He meant interesting.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
No, I really did mean it.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I say intriguing.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
It's not a competition.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
That's how you look at it.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Score one for Kinler.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Kinler won.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
I guess we've already circled this.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
I kind of wanted to ask you this

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
because you would be the only person

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
that I would trust to answer this question

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
in an edifying way.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
No pressure.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
But also, it's kind of a dumb question.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
So, don't answer it.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Who is Copernicus?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Doctors have this sort of central oath.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
They have the Hippocratic oath.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
They can sum up their whole shtick in one thing.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I gotta heal people.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
That's what I do.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
That's my gimmick.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
I'm a doctor.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
And whether I work on toes or noses

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
or a little bit of both,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I'm not supposed to do any harm.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
It's hard to find a good toe and nose doctor.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Doctors have an oath

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
because we had to shake them down

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
for one at some point

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
because otherwise they could just be like...

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
The leeches.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I'm gonna cut off one of your arms

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and see if that helps.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
Maybe we should have a do no harm thing.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Because Dr. Schmeck...

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Dr. Mengele is gonna stop it.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
I can't reference Dr. Mengele!

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
He's not alive!

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Are they pro-doctor Mengele?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
They're anti-irony.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
There's no such thing as context.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
Because bad people abuse the concepts of context and irony

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
to be genuinely bad people.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
So then we go,

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
what about context?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
What about irony?

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
And they're like, I heard that from Old Man Carruthers

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
and he's racist.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
So you're racist too.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Good logic.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
You little fucking high-cologram shithead.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
This is gonna be me in six months.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Look you atheist piece of shit!

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Is there a comedic oath?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
What would it be if there was one?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Obviously there isn't one

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
because there's a lot of bad approaches to comedy.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Like me personally observing,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
it's like I don't think you should be doing comedy

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
to get applause or even necessarily smiles.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I think the comedy definitely heals more people

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
and makes them feel better in the long run.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
So I've always babbled about this,

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
but it's important.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
The first joke, this is a theory,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
an anthropological theory,

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
the first joke that we hear is peekaboo

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and it's like it's half terror.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Your mom is abusing your infantile instinct

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
to shriek in terror when your mom's face goes away

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
and then she's going, I'm in on it too.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Death is a joke.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
And you're like, I don't know what the fuck this world is.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
This is insane.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
So like half of a comedian's job is,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
if you're dwelling in the world of comedy,

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
you get one foot in the river sticks, you know?

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Then you'd forget everything.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
All right, ancient Greek majors.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
Maybe if your mother wasn't holding a knife.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Well, she was doing it.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Forget about it.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
You're in that.

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
I want to hear more ancient Greek capskill comedy.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
Easy, Sisyphus.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
Work a little harder.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I can't think of one Greek name.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
Hey, Tantalus, I have a mic.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
You can't reach your beer. God has a plan.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Icarus, Andy, Icarus.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Maybe you shouldn't name your comedy,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
you know, the Iliad and the Odyssey.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I don't know.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Is that even Greek?

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Yes.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
I like them.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
People are like, yes, yes, old man.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Read something.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
I do. Here's my oath.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I do have an oath.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Here's the thing.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
The thing I think I hate more than anything else,

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
and I'm sure you agree with this,

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
is when people say, hey, if they laugh,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
you know, people are laughing, it's funny.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Well, that's just objectively wrong.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
You can't say comedy's not subjective in the sense that...

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
That's like saying if people are sneezing,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
if they're sick, or allergic,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
or anything, there's a lot of reasons to sneeze.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
We may disagree on what's funny,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
but it doesn't mean that because people can get some of the laugh,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
it's funny because that was what got me,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
where I wrote this handbook,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
which is still available on my website,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
where nothing ever changes.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Who's sick and tired of all these different dates.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So...

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
They keep changing them.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
But I don't know what I'm saying.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Your oath, the hack handbook?

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
What was the sentence before that?

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
You said you had an oath.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Oh, well, okay, so, if you're in a club,

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
and I say, are you working tonight?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
We'll get your feet off the stage.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
In the 80s, any comic, you got a laugh doing that.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And the crowd would laugh.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
You've never heard it before.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
So it's up to the comedian to take the responsibility

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
that he knows that his material is original,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
that he's not doing something hack.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
But a lot of...

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
In the 90s, when they had the first,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
quote, alternative scene since the late 70s,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
which is the real alternative explosion

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
with lettermanology,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
people like me were all squeezed out of,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
like Janeane Garofalo, all these people.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
We couldn't play comedy clothes because it was just filled

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
with hacks who just played to the audience.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
So I think the oath is that you can't,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
you have to go with what you believe is funny.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
And for me, the big breakthrough,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
but I don't know if this is enough,

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
I came 23 years in when I realized that,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
I thought I was always saying what was on my mind,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
but I realized I wasn't.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I was going to stock things about it,

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
like I hate the crowd or I hate myself.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
And that was the big breakthrough.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
And so that's kind of my oath is when things go bad,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
just to really try and be in the moment,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
but I don't know if that's enough.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Just step back and remind yourself that,

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
yeah, if you're not making yourself laugh,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
if something you genuinely feel is funny,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
then you could still be wrong.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
You could say something that you genuinely think is funny

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
and find out that you're racist on Monday night.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
And then you're like, read about it for three days

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
and come back on Thursday like, you know what,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I was racist on Monday and I found out.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
But unless you're saying what you genuinely think is funny,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
you're never, ever, ever going to,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
you're never going to be funny,

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
because you could make people laugh.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
For the wrong reasons.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I'm going to use this Got Milk formula everyone's using.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I'm going to say Got Come.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
And see, I got a chuckle.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
And Dick, for example, Dick jokes,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
and that's why you can't make any rules,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
because Dick jokes are an easy way to get people to laugh.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
But then there's always one person,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
like any rule you would make,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
and then you'd see David Tell for 10 minutes

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
be so hilarious.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
No one's funnier than him.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
You can't make any rules, so that's why

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
when politically correct things come down

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
or when they want to have to co-bear

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
or so terrible, because obviously we know he's hilarious.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
But that doesn't mean that I never

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
bought the thing where when you're on stage

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
it's a magic racer zone.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
You can say anything you want.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
A comedian should have a conscience.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
You should be able to say if you think you're wrong,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I was wrong. I hate that the comics are saying,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
or many say you should never apologize.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
You should always evaluate what you're doing.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Right, right.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I thought it was really refreshing.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Do you remember when Natasha Legerro did the thing about it?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
She did some Pearl Harbor joke.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Oh, about the, they're so old, they got their food.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Like, it's a case-by-case basis, is what you say.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
But that was such a fucking great day for me.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I like springing my step.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Because she just said, I'm not sorry.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
And I shouldn't be.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
And it's not defiance, and it's just like,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
this is not, because we are over-apologizing,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
blah, blah, blah.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
But what you're saying is, sometimes,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
you don't have to have that hard line.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
A comedian doesn't, we can't go like,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
we're comedians, we're not going to apologize.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I've been doing this podcast.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I talk two hours a week.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I have no material.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
I'm babbling, I'm drunk.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I have bruised people.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
And I have been told that I have bruised them on Twitter.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
And I have then, even in that moment,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
gone like, go fuck yourself, because I'm human.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
And I don't like being told that I did something wrong.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
But like, inevitably, I'm like,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I did something wrong.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I think that's really cool.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I could have done that differently.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
But I didn't, because I wasn't thinking the right way.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And that is a PR thing.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
You just want to say it.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
That's a PR thing.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
My people say the same thing.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Speaking of PR,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
to take it into this area,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
part of your persona is,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
the reason that we know

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
that you really follow that credo

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
is because in the brief time you've been up here,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
you have, I mean,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
I also do not like Bill Maher.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I also

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
was thinking of Jimmy Fallon

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
when you said I was thinking of Jimmy Fallon.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I also,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I didn't know Adam Carolla was racist,

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
but I'm willing to believe you.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
You go there,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
as the girls say?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I do go there.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
And the thing is,

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
everything, like, okay, so I have a joke.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I say, Jay Leno has a car that runs on the energy

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
of all the people's dreams of these crimes.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
And I kind of do,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I really don't like Jay Leno,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
but Bill Maher is in a completely different category

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
because I am very sensitive

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
to the anti,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
that people should not hate people

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
based on, I was raised,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
you don't hate people based on their religion.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
You know what I'm saying?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
That really pisses me off about Bill Maher.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
All of his dogmatic stuff,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
he has a religion, and it's atheism,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and he's as fundamentalist and dogmatic about that.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Absolutely.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
And you could possibly be about any fucking thing else.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
It would be fine if he were more charming about it,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
but charm is not what Bill Maher deals in.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
It's 9-Eleven!

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Sorry.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
That is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Andy, we're the only show

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
that people cheer when you go, it's 9-Eleven.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Oh, my God.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Have you sometimes, don't you miss it sometimes?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Sometimes we miss it.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And in the morning, I'm like, God damn it.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
But it happens again, like in the AM.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It's amazing.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
There was one time, Bill Maher...

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
One time we did like a

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
sweet, sexy ass

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
R&B song about 9-Eleven.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Yeah.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
We were thinking, we should have a tradition at 9-Eleven,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
but then it started to feel creepy.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Because I think the number's funny, you know what I mean?

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Like, it's not...

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
3,000 people nag, isn't that funny?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
I'm against it.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
The idea of a number being sacred is funny.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
They shouldn't have taken down the tower.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
No, they should not have.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
He clearly doesn't believe that.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
They should have counted to 10.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
You're right.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
You know what? Count to 11.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Yeah.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
10 soon? 10 late?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
10 is right in between 9 and 11.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Right in between them.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
They just missed 10.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
The fear is always that there's someone in the crowd

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
who's...

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I just had put it behind me.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Yeah.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Someone who started experimenting with stand-up

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
at 17, right after Jeffrey Dahmer

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
ate everyone in Milwaukee.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
And when all of the families

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
of his 17 victims

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
were going out to comedy clubs

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
to try to get away from their sorrows,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
and every comic was like,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
well, it seems like everyone else in the nation

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
thinks this is funny.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Never mind that I live in Milwaukee.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Andy, I'm sure you were doing gigs

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
in the days and weeks after 9-11,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
because I went to a show about a week after...

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
a week and a half after

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
all the shit went down.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And Warren Thomas did a set

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and did the funniest 9-11 joke of all time.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
But the audience before that,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
nobody was really quite willing

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
to laugh at anything at all, because the whole country,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
the whole world was just like

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
in a weird

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
suspension of like...

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
going to be funny for a while.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
And rightfully so.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
It's very natural.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
And some guy came on

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
before him and told a bunch of jokes

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
about how his failing acting career

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
and he's in a bunch of shows that were terrible.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
And he's talking about his career.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
And then Warren Thomas, who was a great comic,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
who died how many years ago?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
About 10 years ago, maybe?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
He's a beloved, hilarious guy.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And he comes up when his first joke was,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I saw your demo reel.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
9-11.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
That is sweet.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
The crowd did not groan.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The crowd fucking went into ecstasy

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
because we needed to fucking say something funny.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Not at the expense of what happened.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It's just that the world needed

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
somebody to fucking do the comedian's job.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
It's like let's all just fucking,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
let's all be in this room together

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and let's all laugh about anything at all.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah, I think that's...

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's a very courageous thing.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You never heard the story about Gilbert Gottfried?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I did not want to see it.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
It's a whole long thing, but I had no desire

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
to see the aristocrats.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
In some ways, I'm like an old-school guy.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I had a fear my parents are going to watch it

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
and they're going to be watching.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Something like up the ass into the coal.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And then...

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
But the premise that he had...

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Tell them what he said.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I'm going back to the thing after the Jonestown massacre.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Oh, because he said after 9-11

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
that he was late for gig because

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
he had to change planes at the Empire State Building.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh!

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And then he went into that...

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Then he went into the Empire State Building.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
The crowd grown and then he said,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I'm going to horrify you with viscera.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
But what's the joke?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I hope I'm not getting this wrong

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
because this is the story that I'm sure

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I'm going to get the details wrong.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I believe it was Gilbert Gottfried

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
at the Fillmore in San Francisco

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and from what I've heard

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
it's one of the greatest openers of all time

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and it was like a couple days or so

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
after, believe me, if I'm getting this wrong

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
somebody put online

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
the actual story of this.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But this has passed down to me through other comics.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
The Jonestown massacre, horrible thing.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Another one of those moments where nobody...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
We're against it.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Nobody knew what to think and certainly

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
we're going to a comedy show and all these people

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
have been massacred and it's a weird time

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
to go laugh about anything at all.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Especially he did the show in Jonestown.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
That was the thing.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Tough room.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I smell flesh.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I don't know

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
how they even died.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
What would they drink in the Kool-Aid?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Supposedly, he comes out

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and I don't know if he was doing the Gilbert voice then

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
or not but this was a long time ago.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I think he always kind of did it.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I can't believe we all missed the

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Two Drink Minimum

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
bit there.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
A Two Drink Minimum?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Two Drink Maximum

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Uh, Jonestown

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Two Poison

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Two Drink Maximum

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I'm really killing the night.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
So he comes out and he says,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
and forgive me if I'm getting any of this wrong

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
but the way I know the story is that

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
he comes out and he says,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I grew up in San Francisco

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
which I don't think he did.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Again, could be all wrong

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
but the point is he did this joke.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I said, like, Janis Joplin played her

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and I came here

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
as a young teenager

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and I saw Janis Joplin play here

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and I actually became friends with her

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and I met her and we hung out

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and I was actually with Janis when she died

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and I

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
held her in my arms

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
as Janis died.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
So to be here at the film hall, it's a very powerful

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
it's a very emotional thing for me.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I saw Jimi Hendrix play her.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I became friends with Jimi Hendrix.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The night that Jimi Hendrix died,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I held Jimi Hendrix in my arms

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
as he died.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I just got back from Jonestown

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and boy are my arms tired.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Yeah, fuck those people at Jonestown!

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I'm sorry, can I go too far?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
They knew what they signed up for.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
They knew, yes!

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I'll put up the quotes.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Did you ever see that thing Eric Eidel wrote

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
about how comics are licensed gestures

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
they should always have the freedom

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and it should be sanctioned

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
by everybody.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
They have the ability to be seditious

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and to be critical.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Well the trouble is that in the world

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
where gestures come from, you were vetted.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So with capitalism, everyone's a comic.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It's like open mic night

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and then some guy gets up.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We've all seen some horrible shit.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I did stand up for all of a couple years

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
bad and didn't have the discipline to do it.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I was at the safe house

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
in Milwaukee with this guy

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
who was a juggler and he was juggling

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
machetes

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and I guess

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
they weren't sharp machetes

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
but they were fucking metal

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and one of them just

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
flew out into the audience

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and almost hit a lady

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
and

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
he didn't apologize

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
which I think you should always do

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
when you almost machete someone

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
she was like whoa and she was being

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
relative to almost being machete

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
a good sport

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
and she was like

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
and I guess the machete kind of

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
went sort of in the area

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
of where it landed.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
He saw the opportunity

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
in that it landed kind of between

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
her legs

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and so he made the joke as he picked it up

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
like too bad it didn't go six inches further

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
to keep you from reproducing

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and then kept juggling.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That's funny folks come on!

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
When I think about

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
whether or not

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
we should all be knighted

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
for speaking our mind

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
we're the defenders of all this stuff

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I always remember that guy

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
that guy doesn't know what he's doing

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
he's very nervous

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
he's throwing knives around

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and when he fucks up throwing knives around

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
his mind leaps to

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
his female

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
circumcision or whatever he's

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
thinking like

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I wish that had cracked your vagina in half!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Thank God! To remove you from the gene pool!

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Tough room!

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
That's not me it's the machete guy!

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So yeah we don't

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
we don't get that jester status

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
comedy in general

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
when you're talking about comedy as a river

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
you know what should the pH level

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
of that river be

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I think it should be primarily toxic

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I think there should be a causticity

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
to things that get dipped in that river

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
But unless people

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
like someone like Brian Regan

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
who I think is hilarious

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
his mind doesn't work that way

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
his mind doesn't work that way

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
so I wouldn't call that caustic

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
No no no you don't have to be oh my God

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
please yeah I'm sorry

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
you don't have to be caustic as a comedian

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
that's my whole point I think of that kid

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I go like he should not be protected

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
by the comedian rule

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I also like on the other side of the

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
spectrum a huge thing that is violated

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
is that everybody by default thinks you

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
have to be mean to be funny and there are so

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
many wonderful, warm, sincere people

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
who are truly funny because of their love

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
of everyone around them and they think

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
you got Bill Cosby

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
oh that is inappropriate

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
that is inappropriate

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
oh no

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
there's things to be joked about

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and there's things that should be

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
capped in a small box locked away

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
shame

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
on you

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
but yes yes you're right

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
what I said

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I think there's an obligation

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
of comedy

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
that it needs to be

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I guess let me just skip to my bottom line

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and my agenda is I just don't think you

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
should be that popular

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I don't think you should be that buddy buddy

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
with the city hall and the

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I guess who's coming in tonight

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
it's the president of the school

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm on the student council and it's like

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
okay you're probably not doing comedy then

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
there's a really good chance of that

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
well Fallon is a perfect example

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and Leno was a perfect example

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
yes it worked for Johnny Carson

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
when he was the only show in the air

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
he felt like he didn't want to go too far

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
in either direction politically

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
that's fine he was Johnny Carson

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
he was hilarious but for Jay Leno

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
he said to comedians you shouldn't have a point of view

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
it's ridiculous

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
we know before we were talking about

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
the Charlie Hebdo

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and everybody upset

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
that's why there's people like Jimmy Fallon right now

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
because the uncomfortable things

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
are hard to talk to and so the people just want

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
a clown who does a potato sack

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
the irony is because comedy actually

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
comedy

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
has become

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
it has become the only powerful tool left

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
because politics have gone into the shitter

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
everyone's lying when they're breathing

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
it's so jaded and everything

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
the people that make you laugh

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
the people are getting their news from the Daily Show

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
for 15 years

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
and I don't even say that

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
like our country's son in the shitter

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
it's like yeah I got my new

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
John Stuart became Walter Cronkite

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
it was the only one

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and it was like because comedy was the only thing

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
that could be trusted

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
don't pretend you know who Walter Cronkite was

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Jesus Christmas

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
but ironically with that comes

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
that is not

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
on Logan's run point

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
with like whether or not

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Soylent Green is this or whether it's people

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I know I'm mixing movies and metaphors

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
the

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
that's the irony

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
of comedy's like

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
emergence from all this other shit

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
as like a trusted platform

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
it's like we actually need the people that make us laugh

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
so bad now that will like

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
hashtag cancel Colbert

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
because the guy that runs his Twitter feed

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
non-contextually

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
ruined one of his jokes

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
People were so upset about it

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I'll give you an example of the where

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
with the Adam Corolla thing

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
if you listen to some of his bits where he says

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Mexicans have no culture

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
they're coming up here to get our culture

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
cab drivers

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
why do you think cab drivers don't pick up black people

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
maybe they know something about black people that you don't know

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
those are not jokes

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm even willing to accept that

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Adam Corolla was

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
a huge fan but when he was on Love Line

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
whatever he could be funny

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
maybe he could be funny

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
but now when he's just spewing

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
racism he can't hide behind the fact

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
that he's a comic to justify what he's saying

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
right and so

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
it's good that we're moving into this age where we can

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
like detect that shit and call it out

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
but it's like

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
what ruins people's lives

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
not when it ruins people's lives

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
like who's lives

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Adam Corolla

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
she's not worried about Adam Corolla's life

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I'm assuming that kids worried

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
about for instance

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
no one's defending this lady

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
but the African age joke lady

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
oh yeah those things

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I think those things are sad when someone says something

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
she's not even a comedian

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
200 followers

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
she's got a bad sense of humor

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I don't even know if she was being ironic with that joke

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I made that joke on a bad day

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
out of white guilt

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm going to Africa

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
because I'm white like parentheses

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I feel bad that I live in a world

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
where an entire continent

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
is our sewer and we don't give it any

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
federal aid

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and we're like you know

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
maybe that's what she meant I don't know

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
it's the shot in Florida thing though

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
people gang up on people

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
we're like a baby finding out

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
why'd you say that

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I think it was just more the thrill of

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
and it's thrilling for everybody

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
you find out that this arm you have

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
and so a baby's like

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
just reach out for your face

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
if a baby could suddenly muster the strength

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
of a human being

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
a lot of people would lose their noses

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I think that's probably where that joke comes from

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
babies believe it's possible to get your nose

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and they don't mind trying

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
but their muscles are putty

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
so they're just like

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
baby just reaches out grabs your nose

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
as hard as it fucking can and yanks

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I wonder if I could pull this fucking thing off his face

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I don't think that's ever

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
ever is the babies dialogue

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
what's up with this guy's face

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
so like everybody made that age joke

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
walking around with that big nose on his face

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
somebody kind of for fun

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I saw a really funny joke once when it was like

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I think this happened on Twitter

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
when there was some astronaut

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
going into space or something

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
he was like

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
some retired astronaut that was going up into

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
space again for like

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
some kind of nostalgic space run

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and he was like an astronaut in the 70s

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and now he's going back up again

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
for some PR reason

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
or maybe he was needed up there

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I don't know

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
he left his golf ball he's like

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
where's my titleist

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and then somebody

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I think it was a tweet

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
like somebody tweeted

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
quick while he's in space

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
everybody put an ape mask on

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
that is the exact same principle

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
that happened with this woman

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
who made this shitty joke and she got on an airplane for Africa

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
and basically somebody made the joke

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
of like hey while she's in the air

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
let's make her famous

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
let's make her shitty joke that didn't land

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
famous and she got off the plane in Africa

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and was like wow

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
you're bigger than Tom Cruise

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
good job on that age joke you fucking dingbat

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and it's kind

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I think that everybody

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
every step of the way in that process

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
probably has at least 90%

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
of the best intentions

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
but the collective emergence

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
did you hear about those guys

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
they were like 70 year old guys

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and they were driving a hearse

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and they had a veteran

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and I guess the guy ran in

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
they had to drive for 7 hours

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
so they ran in and got a doughnut

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
and then this guy came out and said

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
you're never supposed to leave a hearse

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and these guys were in their 70s and they got fired

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
they got fired because

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
yes they were probably wrong

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
why aren't you supposed to leave a hearse

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
because you're supposed to

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
because if it's a veteran

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
and even in general with the hearse

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
you're never supposed to

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
you're never supposed to stop

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
you're not supposed to stop at a buffet

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
and then get back in

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and if you do

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
if you do you're supposed to pull around

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
these guys are in their 70s

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
the guy's online and he's saying

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I have no money I want to starve now

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
why was it that important for the other guy

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
that person

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
it really is Twitter and social networking

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
it's like when the whole Woody Allen thing

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
was happening people hated me because

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
I was saying you're basing

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
you read a Vanity Fair article

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
thank God that the Court of Public Opinion

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
is not an actual court

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
you literally have never heard anything about

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
this case but you're basing

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
your opinion on Vanity

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
we get very excited

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
the people

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
when there's a little kid that's murdered

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
and there's all of us

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
who are like man a little kid shouldn't be murdered

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I am against childs getting murdered

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
he is stipulating that

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
before he does something

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
another

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and then there's the people who drive from out of state

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and stand on the edge of the lawn

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
with pictures of dead babies

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
and hold them up and go like

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I know you're a murderer get out of there

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
that person is doing that

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
put that anywhere

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
1983

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
he's doing that

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
because it's hard to feel like a hero

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
that's not running on tap

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
in your house feeling like a hero

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
and so when you read in the papers

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
something that's real easy

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
to get behind

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
happened or get behind against

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
we react

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
it's a sign of the fact that we're being deprived

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
a healthy amount

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
of mythology and self-satisfaction

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
in our day to day lives

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
we're not going to bed at night feeling like we're good people

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
so

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
something happens on the news that's like

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
this kid got abducted and murdered and it's like

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
some people are like that is so fucked up

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
that's so fucked up

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
like no one else knows that's fucked up

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
cool down steve

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
no no I just fucked up you don't understand

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
this is a fucking kid

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
he's crying I was like what happened to steve

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
well I'll tell you

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
steve's been working for

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
eight years at Verizon

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and he's like he's itching

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
for a fucking sword to pull out of a stone

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
and that should be

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
that should be a human right to feel like

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
you're a good guy well I'll give you a perfect example

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I hate this guy I never liked this guy Jake

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Tapper I'm obsessed with these horrible

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
pundits so Jake Tapper

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
the democrats

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
that's the democratic party so I don't want to get into that thing

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
where they call him democrat but it's called the democrats

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
it's their website their twitter

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
thing so they put out a thing

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
happy memorial day

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
and then it's Obama holding

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
an ice cream cone or whatever

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
and so Jake Tapper goes respectfully

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I don't believe that was an appropriate image

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
for who in the hell is him

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
no better way to celebrate

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
to memorialize

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
memorial day

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
than to criticize

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
how other people are celebrating it

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I mean what kind of

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
that to me is so disgusting

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
that's what he's gonna do

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
he's more respectful of the dead people

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
we have to remember the brave men

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and women of the greatest generation

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
who charged Normandy's instagrams

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
and

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
you know really critiqued them

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
laid down

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
their handles

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and said this isn't bad taste

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
take that Hitler

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
that's how we won the war

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
is by knowing

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
when people were bad

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and saying so in a comment

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
it's terrible

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
you have to be the guy who's for all these things

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
why are you defending everything

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
what we're talking about

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
why don't you want the first people

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to lose their job

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
why don't you want the AIDS lady

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
she's the

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
that's what she should have done

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
towards the AIDS lady

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
every 10 minutes

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
the crowd loses a sense of humor completely

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
no I think they're excited

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
they're waiting for us to bring out Spencer Crittenden

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
no, if you would

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I got nowhere

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I got nowhere to go

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
hey guys

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
hey Spencer, sorry I worked up a steam talking to Kindles

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
no it's been great conversation

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
it's

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
you know

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I don't want to make you feel

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
on the spot here Dan

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
some of the finest interviewing I've seen

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
in some days on Harmontown

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
oh wow

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
oh okay

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
thank you

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Spencer is our dungeon master

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
not the sex

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you know what a dungeon master is

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
dungeons and horses

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
dungeons and horses

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
shoots and horses

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
shoots and baskets

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
shoots and onion rings

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
blah blah blah something something something

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Ms. Pac-Man

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
is that good?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
you still got it

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
you still got it

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
do you ever play anything

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
like a D&D role playing game

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
of any sort Andy?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
someone accused me I did some pun online

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
and they said oh I know where you got that from

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
you got that from P2P

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I don't even

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
no it was the one where you

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
you killed somebody in the car

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
oh Grand Theft Auto

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I don't know

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
yes you got that

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
you got that from Grand Theft something like that

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
and I said to the guy you're accusing me

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
of stealing I said I have never played a video game

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
in my fucking life

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
never?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
you didn't play a Frogger or a Pac-Man

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I did one like Wii doesn't count right

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
it's a ski ball you're gesturing ski ball

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I did one where you roll the ball

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
and it's like through a hole

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
it's like I'm outside now

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
oh I'm a regular alpha

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
so you did play Wii one time

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
one time I played Wii and I played the old ones

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
like a pinball machine

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
pinball

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
pinball machines

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
you played pinball

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
actual pinball

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
in my day you had to go to an actual pinball machine

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
they didn't have them on an electronic thing

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
it was

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
beyond analog

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
it's amazing to me that we still have pinball machines

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I'm not proud of it either

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I'm not proud that I haven't played these things

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I've heard rumors

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
maybe you can verify this is Will Ferrell like really

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
anti-video game

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
let me call him up

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I had heard that from Jack Black

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
name dropy doop doop

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I dropped a name

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I had heard that

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
he's just got

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
everybody's got their thing and Will Ferrell's famous for

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
having no fucking bad

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
yeah nothing bothers me

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
he even likes Hitler

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
he's like the guy

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
that says Chevy Chase has his moments

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
like

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
he can see the good in anything

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
you're catching some of

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Hitler's mojo right now

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I just wanted to make him laugh

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
but

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
everybody's got to have something

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I hate B-Pollen

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I heard a rumor

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
that he just thinks that

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
it's

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
it's a disease

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
someone yahoo it up

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I was trying to deal with yahoo

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
yahoo it

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
the reason it came up is because we wanted him to be on

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
some like video game thing

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Jack was hosting a video game award thing

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
and we were like what if we could get Will Ferrell

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
to come out and do this thing and he's like

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
yeah I think that might be hard I'm Jack Black

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
that's a bad impression

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
bad impression

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
that's a pretty good impression

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I did a little karate chop

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
because it's like holding your hair when you're doing

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Nicholson

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I'm doing Jack Black so I'll start kicking

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
you can do a Jack Black impression

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I could try

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
put the chicken salad

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
that was Wolfman Jack Black

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I could try here comes Abba

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
with Heart of Gold

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Abba never did a song called Heart of Gold

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Wolfman Jack would never introduce Abba

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Spencer

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
hey guys all I do is I go

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I'm Jack Black in high fidelity

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
that's all I do

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
did you really sign a deal with yahoo Andy?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
yahoo it

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
no one will sign a deal with me for anything

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
oh

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
maybe it sounds sad there

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I could put a word at yahoo

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I'd like to be sponsored by them

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
are you satisfied

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
with my provider

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
well

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
what's your upload speeds

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
like you're so

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
outspoken and so funny

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
and so an honest ground and you say what you feel

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and are unmistakably

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
one of the like a comics

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
comic and an audience's comic

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and so incredibly funny

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
and where is your

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
sitcom like that's run 13 episodes

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and then gotten cancelled like where is your

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
crown and glory are you

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
are you where are you at with your

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
relationship with your career

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
because you're

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
like the king of this mountain

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
that's like you I don't know how much

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
higher you can get on it but

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
like everyone respects you

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and like

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
you're not Seinfeld

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
what is your relationship with that stuff

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
well I think everybody would say

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
like I mean anything that could happen

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
where if someone said here's your sitcom

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I wouldn't turn it down I mean it's not like

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
in my mind

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
since I was 12 I like to be a movie actor

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
you know how

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Louis does those faces where he's like

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
that's the kind of thing I did when I was 12

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
but the point is that

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I always like more

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
but the truth is

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
and this is the God's honest truth

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
is that I have never been the thing I love most

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
to stand up and it doesn't mean every night

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I love it but and

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
the fact that I can pay my bills and I

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
recurring thing here or doing a little thing there

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
so I'm completely

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
completely happy the only thing that bothers me

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
is when I get towards being broke

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and otherwise

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
also I don't want to

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
personally don't want to fictionalize anything anymore

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
so I don't want to be a

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
stereo store sale well that's not even exist

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I don't want to be a

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I don't want to be an exercise

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
the funny the guy at the exercise studio

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
who puts down the other exercise

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
because

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
we're friends with Drew Carey

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
who like we watched go through

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
we didn't watch him go through it we met him when he was already

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
going through it like

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
there's a dangerous game you're playing there

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
the highest achievement is

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
you get a sitcom and you're like

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
my name's my actual name

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
but I work in an ad firm

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but it's really me

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
and so like your identity

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I remember Drew

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and expressed this at one point it's like

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
then you get canceled

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
and it's you but it's not you

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
it was you

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
when everybody was watching the Drew Carey show

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
that meant the world loved Drew Carey

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
they called it I love Drew Carey

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
they're talking about the show but it's also

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
his first and last name

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
and then when people stop watching Drew Carey

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
and stop liking Drew Carey

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
that's tough emotional grounds

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I also think the truth is

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and this is the truth to me

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
is that you really can't control

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that's why like Oprah when they would do these

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
actual ancient

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
eastern ideas but they would misappropriate them

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
like you create your own reality

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
but that doesn't work

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
if you're Jewish and you want to go into

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
concentration camp you know what I'm saying

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I'm just saying the Jews did not

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
want to go into a concentration camp

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
so if you just think you create your own

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
reality that's a misunderstanding

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
but you do put your own energy

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
in the world and you can

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
control what you do sometimes

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
but you can't always control

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
what the end result is so I'm comfortable

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
that I just don't know what's going to happen

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and that wouldn't discount anything

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I wouldn't do a show

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
called the Drew Carey show

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
you know that's off the table

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
even though

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
you don't respect copyright law but that's not

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
the reason we just wouldn't do it on a craftsmanship

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
yes it's like it's been done

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
and you don't want to do it

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I'm a stickler, I'm a stickler

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
they pitched me Seinfeld

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
that's your show, the stickler

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I'm the stickler

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
the Andy Stickler show

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Andy Kindler is the stickler

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
hey you're not getting that right

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
that's you in the round window

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
underneath Andy Kindler is the

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
stickler and then you pop up

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
hey you're not getting that right

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
it's apostrophe yes

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
yeah he comes in and yeah

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
in the words of Edwin Newman

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
anyone

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
but I would like sometimes

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I think I'd like to do a talk show

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I did a thing called Kindler Television

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
which I should probably put online

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
because no one bought it

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and so I have ideas

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I'm going to ask a question that's

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
do we cut you off or what's the deal

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I'm just quiet

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
we're going to play a game with him in a second

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
and you're captive of it

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
but do you have a podcast

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
that's like saying what's your sign

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
in the 70s

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
this is a

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
a true story

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
oh by the way one story

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
there's an absolute true story one night I'm home

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
and I'm watching Conan

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
and Warren Thomas comes on

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
and I'm not lying about this

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
a joke bombs I'm eating

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
seriously I'm eating like cereal

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
cold cereal when every time

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
the Conan came on right in the old days

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
and he goes joke bombs

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
and Warren goes oh I'm entering

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Andy Kindler bill

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I would jump

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
for joy at home

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that's praise from Caesar

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
so back in the old days

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Audible.com

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
before there were podcasts

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
you said the way you said that

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Audible.com

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
a little company called

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Audible.com

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and that company became

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Waze

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
no

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
before podcasts they said

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
would you like to do

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
but no one had a podcast

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I couldn't conceive of what am I going to talk to myself

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
so had I come up with it then

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
that was the time to do it

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
now I pride myself on being a guest

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
on podcasts

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
this isn't an exit

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
but you can come

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
work out your shit here anytime you want

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
and have a relationship with them

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
like come out and talk for a while

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and leave anytime you want

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
we love you

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I love you

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
why are you

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
why are you motioning me towards the door

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I'm not because I actually

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
am dying to see you play

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Shadowrun with us

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
you can leave but I would very much like you to stay

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I will say this

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
just on the tail of that applause

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
one things are certain

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I don't know a comic that I have any respect for

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
that doesn't respect you

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
and in the world of comedians

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
where people can be competitive

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
and dark and have their own shit

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
name one person that would go

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I'll have a comedy contest with Andy Kindler

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
we don't typically speak in that language

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I remember seeing you

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
do you remember the Onyx Cafe

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I absolutely do

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
across the street from Pedro's Grill

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
just up the road

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
by the way thanks for saying that

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
there was a tiny little coffee house

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I don't think I talked about this

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
we completely just filleted you

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
on a show a while back

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
we talked about how much we loved you for a half hour

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
there was this tiny little coffee house

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
there was never more than

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
20 people in there

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and it was run by Joshua Dianado

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and some of you started putting

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
an actual egg timer

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:31.000
and it started going

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I remember, Jeremy Kramer kicking on a football

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
and it went like 50 yards

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
it was great

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
but you came out

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
that resembled material at all

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.520
in the front row, the entire goddamn time.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.760
There was a guy that had an outfit on,

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.720
and the joke was, it was not a preposterous outfit.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.960
You just gave this guy the business about his shirts,

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.840
and it was a perfectly acceptable shirt,

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.000
but you just gave him shit.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.280
Perfectly acceptable shirt.

01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.560
And you just stormed this, the stage was like a really,

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.480
like smaller than the meltdown stage,

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.740
like probably by half, a little tiny piece of like wood

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:08.920
on wooden blocks, and you just stormed around it

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.400
like General Patton, and we were just fucking

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.080
apoplectic laughing.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.960
And also, whether it was that night or another night,

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.060
there was, these two guys came in,

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.680
we heard guitars playing up the street,

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.120
and they came down the road and came in,

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.360
and it was Jack Black and Kyle Gasson.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.200
No one had ever heard of him before.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.040
I remember this night, I remember that.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.120
And I asked Jack about it, and I said,

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.200
I saw you play at the Honest Cafe,

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.040
and he goes, that was our first show.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.200
Are you serious?

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.360
Do you remember how funny that bit they were doing was?

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.840
Yeah, they came in again.

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:35.680
Wow.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.120
Like you came in there, and you absolutely just dominated,

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.440
and then, I don't know who was on first, you or them,

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.840
but they came in, they stood back to back,

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.320
and strumming the fuck out of these acoustic guitars,

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.420
and circled around, and they sang,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:48.840
what's the song?

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.560
This is not the best song in the world.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.080
Tribute, they fucking sang Tribute,

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.160
and it was their first fucking show.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.080
And Sarah Silverman, I think Paula Tompkins,

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.720
that was maybe one of his first shows in LA,

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.040
and he had a shitty, rumpled ass, ill-fitting suit,

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:07.240
and now he's like sartorial fucking mastery.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.520
But that was a magical show.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.200
We had a great, I mean, that was unbelievable.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.600
There was all the quote-unquote independent,

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.840
in indie comics that came down from the Bay Area.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.720
Were you Bay Area?

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.240
No, I'm from, it's a long, well, not that long a story.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.560
I'm from Queens, and I moved here.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.400
Right.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.240
Uh.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.840
Don't get me started.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:31.520
No, I started here, I came out to be a musician.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.920
I started comedy here just because I would have had

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.240
to have left to start in a smaller town,

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.440
but I knew all those guys because I

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.240
used to play laughs unlimited in Sacramento.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.040
It was so magical.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:40.960
It was an amazing time.

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.320
I remember that moment of being there.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.920
Fred Belford, our friend, took me there.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:45.640
Exactly.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.600
And we sat there, and I'm not a stand-up comic,

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.240
but everybody there was either up in Cummins,

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.400
or there were people that were like, oh, you

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.520
have to see this guy, this person's from, or this gal.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.680
Like, this is Jeanine Graffo.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.320
This is Margaret Schell.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.000
There's these people that they've heard of.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.080
Everything in there was so fucking magical,

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.320
and the host was kind of at Looney Tins.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320
He really was crazy.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.160
But there was you and Jeremy Kramer, and Harlan Williams,

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.480
and fucking, it was so goddamn.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.840
And Bob Odenkirk's stand-up.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.600
Amazing stand-up.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.040
That was a magical time, and then I told them a little bit.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.040
You did a show called Hacks, Hacks, Hacks.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.960
You give me a smile like, hello.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:25.040
You and I both go, Bob Odenkirk's full of shit.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.000
Anyway, anyway, there was that magical moment

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.440
when you go like, oh, I'm allowed to like stand-up again,

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.480
because stand-up had this giant explosion in the 80s

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:36.360
where everybody that thought they were mildly entertaining

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.120
stood in front of a brick wall and bummed you the fuck out.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.560
But you can't knock that generation.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.040
I mean, it became very strange.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.880
It was like Judy Tenuta and our friend Bobcat Goldthwaite,

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.200
and there was the character comedy started to happen.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.240
It was like you really, there was this huge pressure

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:57.160
on comedians to come out, and it was like star search.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.840
You've got to fucking like, what's your deal?

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.320
Are you the guy with the penis for a head,

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.040
or are you the guy with dice on his neck,

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.480
or is your name Jacques Van Schlock and Doc?

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.680
And then the 90s, it was like this, it was the grunge thing.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.120
It was like the, but you transcend all of that

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.880
because you don't wear flannel and never have.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:25.880
I had, I wore acid washed jackets in the late 80s.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.120
It's the most oppressive thing.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.440
But I will say one thing right now.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.560
I think right now is an amazing time period

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.480
for comedy right now.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:35.400
I really do, because people are actually going out.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.440
You guys are fans of right now.

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.200
But like, I love right now.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.400
Addomium, Hannibal Burris, there's so many amazing,

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.240
it's pretty cool.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:44.080
Who are you naming?

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.400
James Adomian.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.600
Oh yeah, he was just, he was on last week.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.440
So cool.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.480
He came on and did a Bernie Sanders impression

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.600
for three hours, it was great.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.440
Yeah, it was amazing.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.960
You know Hannibal Burris, I mean there's just so many names,

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.040
and people like Todd Glass,

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.360
it was so, it was always hilarious.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.080
And it's just amazing, I don't know, it's just like.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.960
Let's not forget Jeff Dunham.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.600
He's great.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.040
He's not racist, the puppets racist.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.480
Carlos Mincia is really hitting a stride right now.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.320
Yes.

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.400
Is DeMorge Brown out there?

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.240
DeMorge, you with us?

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.680
I don't think I usually see him lingering.

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.040
No DeMorge tonight.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:24.880
Should we just do a very-

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.680
If DeMorge is listening, usually I see you lingering.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.640
Why don't we be just, I don't know if that's a note.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.680
Dan, Spencer, let me know what you think.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.880
We're running a little bit late here.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.200
Yeah, we always start late too.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.640
Why don't we, yeah.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.800
But let's maybe just play a very small lean and mean

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.120
shadow run with just the three of us.

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.280
Maybe you want to bring somebody else up

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:45.200
to play another character.

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.040
Does that muddy the waters?

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.920
I can play a very old man.

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.760
Well, I think we should, in honor of Mad Max Fury Road,

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.160
we should get a non-sexualized strong female lead

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.600
to come up and play Erin McGathy's character.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.040
Preferably someone with a robot arm.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.680
Do we have a strong female lead to play?

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.800
Hannah, the seamstress?

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.640
Oh yeah, Hannah, the seamstress.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.480
Because she's earned it.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.160
Hannah, the seamstress.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.680
She's earned it by sewing.

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.000
Think, Hannah, by the way,

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.560
that's no small favor you did for me.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.880
I really appreciate you putting the button

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.880
back on my thing.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.720
Oh, it's okay.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.960
I learned how to sew recently.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.320
I mean, I can do it too,

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.920
but I know I've sewn many buttons.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.160
I've ripped many buttons off.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.000
I can do this.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.040
I love to sew, and I do it quite often,

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:37.560
but I appreciate you doing that for me.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.440
All right, Kindler, so Hannah,

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.800
have you seen the show before?

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.800
You gotta eat the mic.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.960
Eat that mic, baby.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.800
Eat the mic.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.640
I had to quit.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.800
It's not how I'm knee-directional.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.640
And when I said baby,

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.480
I meant baby in the Sammy Davis Junior way

01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.760
that's omni-gender.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.080
Like, I didn't mean like baby.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.480
I didn't even hear the baby.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.120
Oh, okay, good.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.080
And I didn't even say it.

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.800
That's how feminist I am.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.160
When I called you a skirt,

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.960
I meant it in the...

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.840
Eat that mic, sugar.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.960
I call everyone sugar.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.720
Like a throwback, throwback.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.960
Everyone's sweet to me.

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.640
He's got two of them.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.680
I got two of them now.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.320
Yeah, so in this Manila folder,

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.880
there's like a piece of paper

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.280
with a bunch of statistics on it.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.840
Okay, numbers and keywords.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.080
This is your character.

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.240
It's as if you've been dropped

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.160
into the world's most academically intense

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.240
murder mystery night.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.920
You won't, you do not need to know any of this stuff.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.760
Who are you?

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.600
What's your name?

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.440
You probably don't even know that.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.360
Oh, I'm Kumail Nanjiani.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.200
Oh.

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.120
Which is that character?

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.680
That's Dr. Friend.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.680
Oh, Dr. Friend, okay.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.400
So you're like a doctor.

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.440
Who are you, Hannah?

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.120
Mary O'Donnell.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.080
Right, Mercy.

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.320
Mercy O'Donnell.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.800
Okay, so you're Erin's character.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.200
You've never heard us play the game, Hannah.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.280
So you said, okay.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.720
So she's like a, boy.

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:09.080
She's our negotiator.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.160
Like she's kind of our face man.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.000
She makes the deals and she's got power

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.840
over other people's minds.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.320
She's super charming, very like she has the ability

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.880
to con and kind of like negotiate wheel and deal.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.720
Okay, good, because I'm a Libra, so it's good.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.160
And Dr. Friend is kind of like a mob doctor archetype.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.360
Like you're a doctor.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.400
Oh, but it's nothing to do with Kumail.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.240
Well, Kumail often plays him.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.800
Oh, very often.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.480
So why did you say Kumail then?

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.320
Who's the doctor's name?

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.160
Kumail played him once, twice?

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.320
Like a couple, like a couple times.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.160
Oh yeah, Kumail, like yeah.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.760
Yes, Andy, the important thing is don't get too bogged down

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.720
into statistics and the numbers and things like that.

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.000
Like your weapons are in there and you're...

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.840
I got you.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.760
Just like say one of the words you see in the sheet

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.160
and be confused about it.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.000
Okay.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.240
But I'm a doctor though.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.160
I'm a table doctor.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.440
See, he's doing it.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.760
I'm an evil doctor.

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:01.880
I will kill you with my chemical protection for.

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.720
Yeah.

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.560
That's how you do it.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.000
Andy, we're basically like kind of a cyberpunk A team

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.680
out doing capers and stuff like that

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.160
for the underworld in the future.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.440
And we're active players in a narrative

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.680
that he's in charge of.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.400
If he says something happens, it happens.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.400
He tells us where we are and we tell him

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.080
what we want to do next when he asks us, basically.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.760
All right, Spencer, he tells us the results

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.480
based on systems that he understands and cheats about.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.880
It's like improvising.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.440
We have to, we're, yes, you're, we're, yes, ending it.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.280
Good, yeah.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.120
Absolutely, yeah.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:35.440
Yes, and it sounds like fun.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.280
Yeah.

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:41.200
Spencer, do you have a guest recapper for us?

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.240
Yeah, this one's by James Johnson.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.840
All right, fake name.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.840
Here we go.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.960
What it's like.

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.800
Wrong song.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.120
Okay, all right.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:57.520
Last time on Harmon Run, the gang stages a modified circle

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.200
jerk to initiate their new teammate.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.120
That's it.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:04.760
Oh, that's right.

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.720
OK, that's what we did.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.800
James, James Johnson.

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.160
And our new teammate is called what again?

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:15.680
What's up?

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.920
What's our new teammate's name again?

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:17.680
Hack Eye.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.560
Hack Eye, of course.

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.200
And he's kind of a, like, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a hacker.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.400
It's like a Technomancer.

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.920
Technomancer, right.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:26.560
All right, so.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.160
You guys, you're in Hank's last stand, the bar.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.440
You just got this job to infiltrate MindPlus Limited.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.440
It's a hospital to infiltrate the hospital and retrieve data

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.240
research for your employer.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.160
And our employer is who?

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.080
That's just the Johnson.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.080
It's the Johnson.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.320
All right.

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.520
Particularly, we're looking for data related

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.320
to the Billy Baldwin, uh, BTL chips, or is that, uh.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.640
Yes, that data.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.440
All right, you kind of smiled like I was wrong.

01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.200
Well, Billy Baldwin, BTL chips is just a great thing to say.

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.840
All right, Baldwin Brown.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.160
When I get the Billy Baldwin, BTL chips,

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:11.120
I will have achieved my goal.

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.600
I am a doctor.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.280
I will induce terrible pain.

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.760
No, no, doctor, do no harm.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.240
First, do no harm.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.200
I will, uh, just a moderate amount of pain.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.040
OK, fair enough.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.400
Do we have a location for the MindPlus Limited?

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.440
Yeah, you have an address on the map.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.520
I call an Uber.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.560
All right, you do that.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.240
It arrives outside.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.320
Let's load up, everybody.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.200
Lock and load.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.000
Mercy, how's it going?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:41.720
It's all right.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:47.920
We may need you to go into the front of the hospital

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.920
and kind of do some front stuff for us.

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.920
Oh, is it because I have exceptional charisma?

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.560
Yeah, that's the reason.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.280
It's not because I'm a woman, right?

01:40:59.280 --> 01:40:59.680
No.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.560
No, God, no.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.240
No, have you seen Mad Max?

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240
No, no.

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:13.720
I can not, the Uber driver is telling me

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.680
that he has no place to store my mystic armor.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:19.440
What will I do?

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.760
What shall I do?

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.120
I certainly hope this voice stops.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:29.120
No.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:36.160
Woman, woman, does not compute.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.200
Maybe you should just wear the mystic armor.

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.240
Oh, here's the mystic armor.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:45.040
Oh, it's really got it back from the cleaner.

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.320
All right, you guys, remember, I think we found out

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.240
that there was lots of sensors, vibration sensors,

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.440
and all sorts of security and stuff like that

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.120
when we get in there.

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:52.720
At this place?

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.880
Yeah.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.680
Right?

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.920
Are you James Johnson?

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:56.840
No, I'm Eve Libertine.

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.600
I'm an elf magician.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.520
Very, very, to talk very matter-of-factly.

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.320
Well, that's all, it's just business.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:10.200
I thought acting involved making a choice.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:10.760
That's good, yeah.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.000
Usually, my guy talks like this, yeah.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.720
Well, then I shall be the counterpoint with my Stan Bataan.

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:28.800
I agree with my chameleon suit, all right.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.040
Thank you, mumble-core.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:43.960
I send out a, I summon a butterfly that's

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.560
going to fly out ahead of us and just

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.160
going to go into the door and probably not trip any sensors

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.600
to fly around and give us some recon inside this Mind

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.320
Plus Limited.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.560
All right.

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.520
You summon a butterfly, but it takes substantial drain.

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.720
You feel your resources being drained

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.880
as you cast this magic from your body,

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.480
but there it is, a butterfly.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.800
Butterfly, are we close to the Mind Plus Limited?

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:11.080
Oh, yeah, you're close.

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:12.680
You're about five minutes off.

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.240
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.640
All right, we're here.

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.120
Did that, why did I think it was a hospital?

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:20.720
It is a hospital.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:21.440
OK, OK.

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.280
Keep it down, you circle jerks.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.760
They'll find out that we're here.

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.280
I just wanted to use circle jerks.

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:37.760
All right, so I tell the butterfly to fly in and get

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.000
the lay of the land and find out, just give us some recon.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.960
All right, it does so.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.160
Do you have to talk to the butterfly to do that?

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.280
I have a spiritual mental link to it, but I mean,

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.600
if I do, it would be in a.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.680
So we just see you, like.

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.320
When I summon a butterfly, of course,

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.160
I hold my hands up in my Comanche War Club in the air,

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.000
and I am overcome with a blue glow.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.560
And then out of my butt, a butterfly goes, pfft.

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:07.440
It's a butterfly.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.040
What?

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.560
Aha!

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.280
Does it go through stuff?

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.760
Yeah, it's a spirit.

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.200
It can dematerialize.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:19.920
OK.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.320
I like heart.

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:22.840
Art?

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.240
They did a song about the butterfly.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:24.720
Oh, heart.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.200
OK, so guys, I have a butterfly that's going in there

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.600
to fly around and get us some recon.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.720
It does that.

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.480
And then returns.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.920
Butterfly, what did you learn?

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.200
I learned it's a hospital in there.

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.640
They got a waiting room.

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.520
They got multiple floors.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.560
Great butterfly, nice going.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.280
I could have done that on my own.

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.120
Various surgical operations.

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:56.440
Did you see any defenses, anything we have to worry about?

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.560
Oh, I saw some, you know, cameras and guards.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.080
OK.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.240
They have a strange accent for a butterfly.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.520
Spencer, how much drain did I take on that?

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.680
Three boxes of non-lethal.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.960
Oh, boy.

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.840
I think, you know, what are we looking for?

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.400
We're looking for, like, data.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.680
We're going to find their data room.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.200
Right.

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.560
Does your butterfly see any data rooms?

01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.440
Butterfly, did you see a data room?

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:25.760
I saw no data room.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.760
There was some sort of security room towards the top,

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.920
but that just, you know, had cameras and a chair.

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.440
OK.

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.840
I think that's where we want to go.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.320
I think we send Mercy and Ferris just, like,

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:40.560
let's just do this like a straight, like, you know,

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.160
let her work her charm.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.400
I'll grapple up under the roof and find a vent.

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:48.200
You use your feminine wiles.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.480
OK.

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.760
I got this.

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.600
I have a key card copier, so I can maybe

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.560
make a copy of the keys that maybe the guard has.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.160
Oh, if you can pinch one, yeah.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.640
See if I can get it with my exceptional charisma.

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.760
Holy shit.

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.040
Nice work.

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.800
Maybe you can come in.

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.840
OK, I'm probably, I'm a stealthy guy,

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.520
so I'll fake a seizure or something,

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.280
and you bring me in like a person.

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.400
I'll use my exceptional charisma, and you can sneak in.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.480
And I'll try to see if I can, like, pinch a card.

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.040
Here, take my card copier, and so you can copy the card.

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.080
I'll make the sound effects.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.680
He's got the card copier now.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:29.920
I will cast a spell.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.160
I will cast a spell.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.720
The spell will be the physical barrier.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:43.760
I will create a dome and or wall of magical energy

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.880
that will keep us invisible, or something.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:54.600
If I'm invisible, I can't use my exceptional charisma.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.200
Oh, don't be funnier than me.

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:03.200
I'm enraged.

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.440
Maybe you could come along and use your doctor expertise

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.160
to make it seem more legitimate than I am.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:13.800
Call me.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.600
You should have doctor credentials on it.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.880
If you guys go in together and you're faking a seizure,

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.120
this will all look legit.

01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.640
I'm a doctor, Jim, not an opposite profession.

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.240
Call me bones.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.800
I'm going to astrally project inside from outside,

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.840
like in a safe place.

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.240
I'm going to astrally project inside so I can kind of

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:32.200
keep an eye out.

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.040
All right.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.480
Try to get me, well, I'll try to, I mean,

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.200
my goal is to get near a security guard,

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.480
because we'll see if I can pickpocket a car.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.160
I'm going to scream about my moderate egg allergy,

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.440
and I think that'll make enough of a distraction.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.480
Oh, you're going to scream about.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.280
Yeah, but with my charisma, people will come and help.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:52.600
Wait, no, no, no, I thought you were helping him

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.400
pretend to be sick.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.640
I thought, oh, you're pretending to be sick.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.200
I thought you were speaking.

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.240
Do you want to pretend to be sick?

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.880
I thought I was going to distract them

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.040
while you got the key.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.080
Right, by.

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.120
I'll give you a doctor's note.

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.920
OK, how about this?

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.160
Doctor Friend.

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.720
Doctor Friend, take Mercy in.

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.760
Yes.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.080
Say she's got an egg allergy.

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.360
She's having an anaphylactic shock.

01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.560
She's the charming one, though.

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.120
Oh, right, she has an anaphylactic shock.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.960
Then I'll just show my boobs and be charming.

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:16.400
Me too.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.000
Me too.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.320
OK, we got this.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.320
Oh, sorry.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.200
Too real.

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.400
You're sick, too.

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.920
Oh, yeah, no, I say, Mercy, you go and use your charm.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.240
Bring him in.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.600
Nightblade, you pretend to be sick.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.920
Doctor Friend, you're going to be there to make it all look

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.680
legit.

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.120
OK.

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:36.080
I believe that everything I look legitimate.

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.160
The roof has a whooping cough.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.280
That's good.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.680
All right, all right, let's do it.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.160
Yes.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:42.680
Here we go.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:43.480
We're not doing it?

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.080
We're starting this?

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:44.480
We're going.

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:45.080
We're going in.

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:45.560
Here we go.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.560
We're going in.

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.560
Help.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.400
Help, my friend is sick.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.680
He's got a seizure.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.480
It is true.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.040
I have examined him.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.480
I am Doctor Friend.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.920
It is true.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.880
I am exceptionally charismatic.

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.280
You should listen to us.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.360
Open your mouth and say, ah.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.160
He already took his temperature.

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.520
It was really high.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.760
Wait, well, I didn't hear you guys.

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.440
Aren't you still in the car, though?

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.440
No, I got, I got.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.440
We left it.

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.440
Obviously we're gone.

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440
We left it.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.920
All right, good check rehearsal, guys.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.920
All right.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.920
Guys, here we go.

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:23.440
We opened it two nights.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:23.920
All right.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.480
I must check your boobs with my stethoscope.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.480
I have to check your boobs with my stethoscope.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.480
I must check your boobs with my stethoscope.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.480
I forgot the stethoscope.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480
All right.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480
Let's go.

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.480
Let's go in and try it.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.480
Here we go.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.480
We're going to go in through the front door.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.480
Okay.

01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.480
This is what we're doing.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.480
All right.

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.480
One, two, three.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.480
Break.

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.480
Help.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.480
Help.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480
My friend is having a seizure.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.480
And I am exceptionally charismatic.

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.480
Yes.

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480
Hey.

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480
She's a dish.

01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.480
All right.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480
Let us in.

01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.480
He's a doctor.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:00.480
He's a doctor.

01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:01.480
We mean no harm.

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480
I can show you my Hippocratic Oat.

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:07.480
He needs access to doctor stuff.

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.480
What are you doing?

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:09.480
I'm having a seizure.

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:10.480
Oh, he's having a seizure.

01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.480
Look at this man.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.480
He has the least convincing case of epilepsy I've ever seen in my life.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.480
I don't want to be offensive.

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.480
I don't want to nail it.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:27.480
He has dog panting syndrome.

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:31.480
Even though I'm actually projecting, I turn to one of the security cameras and do a camera

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.480
take and go, yeah, look at these idiots.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.480
Okay.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:45.480
So you're doing all these things and the receptionist person in the waiting area is extremely alarmed.

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.480
It's like, is there a doctor?

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:48.480
Oh, we need help.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.480
Oh, sorry.

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.480
Not yet, right?

01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:51.480
No, no.

01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.480
This is exactly what we need.

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.480
I'm a doctor.

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.480
I can help.

01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:01.480
Well, would I not be a doctor if I said I was?

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.480
I don't really follow the line of questioning.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:10.480
I just can't say, you just can't walk around saying you're a doctor.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.480
That's a fair point.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:19.480
Well, that's perfect because, I mean, this is primarily for transplantation of cyberlimbs.

01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.480
We don't really deal with seizures.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.480
This man is dying.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.480
I show him.

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.480
Comedically.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.480
Hey, you.

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.480
I show him my.

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.480
Well, you're the doctor.

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:30.480
What should we do?

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480
My cyber arm.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.480
I point at my cyber arm and I kind of twitch it because I have a cyber arm.

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.480
I must take him to surgery immediately.

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:42.480
And I make the hatch on my arm that has my gun in it like a, you know, twitch or something

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.480
to indicate like cyber twitching.

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.480
It's a cyber switch.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.480
Cyber lepsi.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.480
Right.

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.480
He has cyber lepsi.

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:54.480
That's not a gun.

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.480
Don't worry.

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:56.480
All right.

01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:01.480
That's the most horrible case of cyber lepsi I've seen in quite some time.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.480
Are you, are you the receptionist?

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.480
What?

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.480
Are you the receptionist?

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.480
Yeah.

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:11.480
You are really not, not good at your job.

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.480
How'd you get this job?

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:14.480
Obamacare?

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.480
Am I right people?

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.480
Am I wrong?

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.480
Thank you.

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:27.480
Well, we need to get you guys, yeah, to some sort of room probably.

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.480
Yes.

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.480
Exactly my thoughts.

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.480
Guards.

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480
Guards.

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.480
Six guards appear.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:37.480
Take them toward C. Beta.

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.480
Any of these guards visibly have any credentials on them?

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.480
Like that kind of thing.

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480
They have guard credentials.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.480
Like on their belts or what's the deal?

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:51.480
It's part of their, it's part of their bulletproof vest is, is like a, a number that's projecting

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.480
a sort of identification hologram.

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.480
Hmm.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.480
Does it, I mean, if I were to ask you, how do I steal that?

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:03.480
You take the, take the breast thing.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480
Take the whole vest?

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480
Yeah.

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480
The vest.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.480
That's what it is.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480
Oh, okay.

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480
Okay.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:19.480
Many epileptics sing a cartoon like way.

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:25.480
Sparrows from Capistrano.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.480
You're right.

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.480
Non-copyright.

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:28.480
Quick, quick.

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.480
Someone who knows what we're doing.

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.480
Jump in.

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.480
You guys are doing great.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.480
Where are we going?

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.480
They're taking you to the room ward C or whatever.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.480
You're in the room now.

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.480
You've arrived.

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:44.480
Two of the guards stand side, but the rest go on their merry way out the door.

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.480
I've never seen anybody go on a merry way.

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.480
All right.

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:54.480
Well, this is the next thing I'm going to attempt and it's going to get sloppy.

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.480
I'm going to, I'm going to stun as many of them as I can.

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:02.480
I'm going to stun one of them and hope the other two get the hint.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.480
I mean, the other two of my friends.

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:07.480
Can I materialize from my astral projection?

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.480
Do I have to walk in?

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.480
Well, no, you have to walk in.

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.480
Okay.

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.480
You're, yeah.

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480
I'm just kidding.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:18.480
I mean, you're probably still, your corporeal body is probably still in the Uber, I think.

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480
Yeah.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.480
Right.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480
Okay.

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480
Which is a good thing.

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480
We should have gone with lift.

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480
Sorry.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480
I always panic.

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.480
All right.

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.480
Take it.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.480
Take it.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.480
I'm going to, I'm going to stun baton one.

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480
All right.

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.480
You go in for the stun baton.

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480
It works.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.480
You hit the guard right in the unprotected nape of his neck.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:45.480
That's not where you, some other part of his neck.

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:51.480
He, he goes down twitching and shocking like he has cyber lepsy.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.480
The other guard draws his pistol.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.480
It's just a pistol though.

01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:03.480
That's when I use my monocle, my monocle somehow comes into play.

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.480
You have a monocle?

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.480
I certainly do.

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.480
And three flashbangs.

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.480
Your monocle has three flashbangs?

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.480
No.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.480
Separate item.

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.480
Do you have a weapon you could use on him?

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480
Yes.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.480
To stun him or knock him out?

01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:17.480
Thank you for reminding me.

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.480
Yes.

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.480
Throw the tear gas, throw three tear gas grenades.

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.480
Are you?

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.480
You guys, you're all in the room together.

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:36.480
We're all going, if one of us goes, we all go.

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.480
Tear gas pours into the room.

01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.480
No!

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:45.480
Ah, here, here's the antidote, the antidote.

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:49.480
It will help the, all of the, you recover from the poisoning.

01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:51.480
I don't know if that's on your sheet there though.

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480
Antidote.

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.480
Why is it?

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.480
Helps target recover from poisoning.

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.480
Oh, that's a spell.

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:56.480
Okay.

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.480
Oh, okay, forget that then.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.480
Do you want to cast it?

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.480
Hey, is that a spell he can cast that can work just on his friends?

01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.480
Everyone falls to the floor choking and crying.

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.480
I have medicine.

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.480
I will use medicine.

01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.480
I have one, I have a log of medicine, six logs.

01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:15.480
I have medicinal, take these medicinal herbs, take these trick clinics.

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.480
You, get a drug dealer in here.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:29.480
Okay, I admit now that that was the wrong move.

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:33.480
I'm a, I'm a doctor, not a thinker.

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:41.480
He's just threw three tear gas cans in the room that you're in.

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:46.480
So I, I guess I, I mean, I take the medicinal herbs.

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480
Okay.

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.480
I mean, okay.

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:51.480
What about that spell you mentioned?

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.480
Antidote.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.480
Yes.

01:56:53.480 --> 01:57:00.480
Oh, I left it, oh, did I say I had an antidote?

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.480
Oh, oh, spell.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.480
I will now place a spell on you.

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:09.480
Oh, it's a, it will, bring it to you.

01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:10.480
Ragadaboo.

01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:16.480
Some people won't suffer from tear gas in this room.

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:27.480
That's how you cast a spell?

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.480
It sounded like they wanted to end the show.

01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.480
Oh, you don't want to tell?

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.480
Yeah.

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.480
Okay, it works.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.480
You want to end the show.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.480
Well, I mean, I don't know.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.480
You cast a gannadote.

01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.480
It works.

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.480
Everybody?

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:41.480
Yeah.

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.480
Jim Nightblade recovers the use of his eyes, his cyber eyes.

01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:49.480
He wasn't really afflicted, I guess.

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:52.480
Well, tear gas affects more than eyes.

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.480
Oh, yeah.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.480
Okay.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.480
Your nasal passages ease.

01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:00.480
So I stunned Baton, the other guy, I guess, the other guard.

01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:01.480
He goes down.

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.480
He's crying on the floor.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.480
All right.

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:06.480
Am I okay?

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.480
No, you're still in great pain.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:15.480
Get Ben Stein on the phone and bring him his clear eyes.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.480
I have a med kit.

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.480
You guys should probably use it.

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.480
Can they use my med kit?

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.480
Oh, totally.

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.480
Is that like a fanny pack?

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:25.480
Yeah, it is.

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:27.480
It's the fanny pack I'm wearing.

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:28.480
Oh, okay.

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.480
The med kit.

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.480
How are we going to get all this tear gas out of the room?

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.480
I think you just need to steal the key card.

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.480
Oh, yeah.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.480
Wow, my eyes.

01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.480
A smoke screen.

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.480
That's what I meant to do.

01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:43.480
It was a smoke screen.

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.480
So close.

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:45.480
So close.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:46.480
Cliff Hanger.

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.480
All right.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:48.480
There we go.

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:52.480
Thank you, Andy Kindler, for coming.

01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:53.480
Thank you.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:58.480
Thank you, Hannah, for sewing and helping.

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.480
You know everybody else.

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:06.480
Spencer Crittenden and everybody.

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.480
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller Mayor.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:14.480
One more time is Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.480
Thank you for coming.

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.480
Happy Memorial Day.

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:17.480
Drive fast.

01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:21.480
Take chances.

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.480
Did you get any of that?

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:30.480
It's a good show.
