01:46.000\nbecause didn't he kind of trick us?\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nBecause he said, does anyone have a needle and thread?\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nWe were excited because we thought we were going to see like sartorial Rambo.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nNow, Hannah needs the person with the needle.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nIs it black thread, we hope?\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nYeah,

Orange County right now?\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:23.000\nUh-oh.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:24.000\nWhat's happening over here?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nThis is already the worst podcast I've ever been on.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:27.000\nNo.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:28.000\nOkay.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nNow that there's a needle point thing happening over here.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:32.000\nOh, that stuff.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nYeah.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nBlue thread is fantastic.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:35.000\nYeah.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nAll right.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nHannah, may I give you my jacket?\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nYeah.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nI'm going to take my wallet and other pertinent things out of it.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nSee what?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nMy tiered for mistrustful Mickey back there.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nHe's our regular character.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nHe's reminding all of us.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nAll right, Dan.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nSo take your phone.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:58.000\nI've seen it.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nWhat is your name, madam?\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nWho's got the needle and thread here?\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nHeather?\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nHeather, are you a needle point enthusiast over here?\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:05.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:06.000\nNo, my friend is.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nYour friend is.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nIs your friend.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nHow do you know she's your friend?\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:15.000\nTake it easy, Mickey.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nIt's a general vibe.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nYeah, but how do you define it?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:27.000\nIf she was on a railroad track and it was you or her?\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nMistrustful Mickey is, he's endearing.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nAll right.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:36.000\nHannah and Heather, everybody, they're going to fix my jacket.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nWhat they're going to do, Dan, they're not just fixing my jacket.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nThey're saving Memorial Day.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nI wouldn't think, don't you unbutton it when you sit down anyway?\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.000\nYes, but this is not business that was necessary.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nNo, but I have shit to do after the show.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nI can't be sewing buttons on.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.000\nOh, man.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nI thought I would mind the vast resources of talent in our Harmontown audience.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nThis is fucked up.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nI guess you don't get paid to do the show, so that's fine.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nYou were owed a little bit.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nYou farmed labor and that's fine.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nHannah, do you feel exploited right now?\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:18.000\nWill you be able to enjoy and listen to the show while doing this?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nOkay.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nThis is how she listens to podcast.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nShe didn't expect to be doing it tonight.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nIs there a shoe shine in the crowd right now because...\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nThese little guys could use it.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nDoes anyone know how to hydroponically harvest soy?\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nBecause we're so close to our moon colony at this point.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:44.000\nHannah could get started on a few jumpsuits after this.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nWe've returned back to our moon colony?\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nOh, man, now more than ever.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nNow that it's getting to be election season.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:59.000\nAnyways, here's a segment that everyone loves called Green Room Antics.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nOkay.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nEveryone enjoys hearing about behind the scenes at Harmontown.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nI needed a mint because I probably haven't brushed my teeth in two days.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nI can't remember.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nA mint will wipe that right out.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:22.000\nIt's a perfect substitute for hygiene.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nIt's the withdrawal of oral hygiene.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\n100% effective.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:33.000\nSo I asked, I said, does anybody have gum or a mint?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nAnd then Dustin wasn't in the room.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nHis girlfriend Elizabeth was.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nElizabeth said, I think Dustin has some mints.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:46.000\nDustin came in, Elizabeth said, Dustin, do you have any mints?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nAnd Dustin said, yeah, I have some Altoids.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nCan you give one to Dan?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nAnd Dustin was like, why, does your stomach hurt?\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nAnd Elizabeth starts laughing.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nAnd I don't understand what the hell is going on.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nSo Dustin, she's like, does your stomach hurt?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nAnd then Dustin leaves to go get the Altoids.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:14.000\nAnd Elizabeth says, every time I have a stomach ache, Dustin gives me an Altoid.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:23.000\nAnd I love him, so I pretend it helps my stomach ache.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nAnd I've never told anyone this until tonight, she said.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:34.000\nSo she's been conditioning him to believe that Altoids are for your stomach.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nDustin, do you think Altoids are for your stomach?\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.000\nGet out of here.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:44.000\nDustin Marshall, everybody.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:47.000\nThe same reason you get a dinner mint after you eat at a restaurant,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nbecause the mint settles your stomach.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:54.000\nBut that's the logic, since I was a child.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nThat's what I learned.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:04.000\nSo you think when you go to a restaurant and you get that little red and white stripy circle mint thing,\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nthat's for your stomach?\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nWas it for your breath?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nOh, I thought it was to settle your stomach.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nDustin Marshall, everybody.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:19.000\nAll right. Hey, who needs Letterman?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:24.000\nWhat a show.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:30.000\nBy the way, I'm sure you've noticed, you know, now that Dustin's out of the Huskow,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nyou should all hide your cartoon money.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:38.000\nHe likes to wear that black and white striped shirt a lot.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nDon't put any pies on the windowsills.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:47.000\nAll right, so anyways, okay, so God, I mean, I really, okay, I had so much to talk about.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:52.000\nAll right, so you know how in Mad Max Fury Road, everybody's got their little designations,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\ntheir little jobs, like there's the War Boys and the other people.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nHow do you get the guitar guy job?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nYou got to be fucking badass.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nAlso, you have to not mind a lot of sand in your face, because he's right out in front.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nYeah, and he's relatively, oh yeah, it did seem like he was blind, yeah.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:12.000\nThat's how he got that job. He's like a prodigy or something.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nOr did they poke his eyes out in some kind of ritualistic thing?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nI would watch a whole movie about that guitar player guy.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nYeah, it was pretty great. Okay, good movie.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nOkay, but you know, you don't have to...\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nUh-oh.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nWell, I mean...\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nAre you qualifying your love of Fury Road right now?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nNo, no, I'm not at all. Not at all.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:38.000\nI just, like, I've kept my lips zipped. Aaron enjoyed that movie so much,\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nand all of her friends enjoyed that movie so much.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd then on the way home, there's just that, like, she's like,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\noh man, it was so impactful, it's so good, such a refreshing change.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nAnd then she was like, how did you enjoy the movie?\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nWas that intimidating for you?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\nAnd I was like, no, no, but inside I was like, fuck you.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nAnd I have only said that to you guys, don't tell her.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nI was just kind of like, what? Come on.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nIntimidated by the feminism of the movie?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nYeah, yeah, like, oh, are you able to handle that explosion boy?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nPenis man?\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:15.000\nLike, motherfucker, I don't care who's blowing shit up.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nI love that there's men's group that hate that movie for being too feminist.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nIt's a bunch of dudes fighting and blowing shit up.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:25.000\nWell, also Mad Max as a protagonist has never been anything other than...\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:29.000\nThis is the best Mad Max movie ever, out of all of them, for sure.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nI will say that, that's my opinion.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nAnd I particularly love that actor playing Mad Max, and I love that performance.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nAnd I had heard that he's like, oh, he's taking a slight backseat\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nbecause there's this other sort of thing happening,\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nbut that's not really true.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nIf you watch all these movies, he's always...\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:48.000\nWhat I like about Mad Max is that he's really more canine than human.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nAnd it's especially brought out by the Charlize Theron character,\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nis that he's like this lovable spaniel, you know?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd that actor was so good at it, he was like, he just kept reminding me of my dog.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nLike, he's just like...\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\nBut then, like, a good movie dog, he's not just obedient.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nLike, the good movie dog turns the plot, too.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nThe good movie dog, all of a sudden, is like...\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nWhat is it? What is it?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nThe movie's going in one direction, dog. What do you want?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nWhich is what he does. No spoilers there.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nAlso, there's a lot of sand and vehicles.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nIf you haven't seen it, it's pretty great.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nI don't know what to talk about. You guys are all talking about Mad Max, which is great.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt's a great movie. Please enjoy.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nBut also, like, you know, Ripley, why didn't we make that big a deal about Ripley?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:39.000\nBecause she had to have the panion bra scene in Alien.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nBecause that was like a slasher movie in space.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nShe was like Jamie Lee Curtis running from an alien screaming.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nShe wasn't really like...\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:51.000\nBut aliens... She was driven by her uterus, I guess.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nShe was like, I got to save that baby, because I'm a lady.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI just... I find it fascinating.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nI went and did a little exploring online.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nI mean, a very little, because you get...\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:05.000\nA little goes a long way of reading about what the menonists, whatever the fuck they call themselves...\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nMenonists!\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nYeah.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nMenonites.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.000\nMenonites on Broadway!\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nThe New York Times called just menonites.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nDashing, good time.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nDo I, do I, do I?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nThat's like an excerpt.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nMenonites have come...\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nOh, I've got Menonites.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nThe girls are done.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:35.000\nBut you read a little bit about it, and they're so mad that there's women with agency in a fucking action movie.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nWhat do you want?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:40.000\nIs your stance that you want nothing but sweaty guys rubbing up against each other the whole movie?\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt's like, what are we talking about at that point? You want no women in your movie?\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nOr they just have to be props? They just have to be damsels in distress?\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nThey want top gun. They want top gun, man.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nYeah.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nThey want a lot of beach volleyball, baby.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nI don't know. Who are they?\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nThere's a menonite inside all of us.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nThey're not called menonites, they're called menonists.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:06.000\nMenonites are noble, weird religion.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:11.000\nI think as we move forward, we need to start to... We're doing a great job accepting everything,\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nand I think we need to start accepting a little bit of ignorance.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nThere was an article that Emily Gordon had tweeted that I retweeted.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nShe retweeted it, and I retweeted or tweeted.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:28.000\nBut the headline was something like, admit it, you're fav is problematic.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:31.000\nAnd I think it was sort of like the treatise was sort of like, look,\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.000\na world full of people you're going to admire, and they're not all going to be mentally perfect.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:41.000\nSome of them are going to have slight racist holdovers from something.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:45.000\nSome of them are going to need to be edified in terms of gender.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:51.000\nThere's a good chance that as you move forward and admire people throughout your life,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\na lot of them are going to disappoint you.\n\n12:54.000 --> 13:02.000\nIf we're going to actually fix the world and become like this Roddenberry vision,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:07.000\nwhich I think everybody would agree with that, even though it seems like a lot of people want to fight that,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:14.000\nthe real truth is if we're going to make it there, it's going to be because we actually get good at greeting ignorance\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nand saying, I know what you are, that's okay.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:23.000\nYou just don't know some stuff yet, and I'm not going to bully you or reverse bully you\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nor condescending you or police you.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:31.000\nIt's challenging, and it's not fair, but what else are we going to do?\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nBeat them up? What are we going to do?\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nYes, we're going to beat them up.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nIt feels good if you happen to be somebody that was bullied in your life.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nOf course it feels good to finally flip them over and spit in their face,\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nbut maybe we can do that for a little bit.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:57.000\nI keep saying, we oppressed people unite, but I was part of a group in the 70s called kids that throw like a girl\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:03.000\nand who smell like sewage, although it wasn't born that way.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nI could have done something about that.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:13.000\nI presented as sewage, and I was judged for it.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:19.000\nAnyways, whatever, Harmon, shut your fucking hole, but then keep talking.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:24.000\nYou okay, Dan? You alright?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nOkay, so let's bring faucets back. I just want to make this quick.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nLet's bring faucets back in public bathrooms.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:35.000\nObviously we don't have the motion detection technology.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nObviously that needs another five years in the oven.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nIt's not working.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nIt doesn't know when your hands are under the thing.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:48.000\nBy the way, I'm not a biologist, but the day a germ can live on cold metal,\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nI think we're going to be dead before you go to a public bathroom.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:56.000\nYeah, because the shit's going to be like everywhere.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:03.000\nGerms tend to like moist, warm biological places, like the ones that can really hurt you.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\nThere's not going to be one sitting on a doorknob going like,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:11.000\nI can't wait to get inside your body and kill you.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:17.000\nI feel like anything that you touch until you've finished washing your hands is...\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nHannah, are you already done?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nHannah the seamstress, everybody.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:29.000\nAlright.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:34.000\nAlright, one more thing, and I want to bring up our first guest.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:37.000\nYeah.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nLooks good.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nThank you, Hannah. That's very lovely of you.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nWhy did I write the voicemail?\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nOh. Oh, I want...\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nYeah.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nOh, that's pro. That's a good button.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nThat's going to last for a while.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nYeah.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nI guess I could try this.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nThere's got to be someone here who speaks Spanish.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nWe find out there's no British people last week.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nI speak a touch of Spanish. Do we need lots of Spanish?\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nYou can see what this guy is saying.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nOver there.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nI don't know if you'll be able to hear this.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nMegan.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nMegan?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nMegan.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nOkay.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:20.000\nThis is a voicemail I got today when I didn't pick up.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nDo we need Megan at it or translate?\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nWell, that's all. I'm seeing if she can hear this.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nThis makes it through the speaker system.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:32.000\nIt's kind of... Let's see if this works here.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nYou want to plug it in?\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nYeah.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nI can wire you in.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nHey, my name is Hamid.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nI'm from Paris.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nBye.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nOkay.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nYeah, that might have been Arabic.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nYeah, it might have been pseudo-racist of me to assume that was Spanish.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nI don't even know.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nWhatever language he's speaking, he's mumbling in it.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:02.000\nThe alarming thing you can't hear is that there's a really sharp child's cough at a certain point.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nHe's like, hey, what are you mumbling?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nI say, what are you mumbling?\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nI'm like, do you know that you just called a fat white comic?\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nI'm not a comic. Why am I not a comic?\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nShould we try plugging in and hearing that?\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nAny kid that's in a bag is like, oh, you're a comic now.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nDo you want to try plugging in and hearing that with better fidelity?\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nWe can try to figure this out.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nI don't know how worth it that is.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nI'm curious.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nWas that a wrong number?\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nNo.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nIt was a perfect number.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nHe nailed it.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nHe called exactly the right guy.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nI am life-flighting his kid to the Whooping Cough Center.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nYes, it's a wrong number.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nI don't even know what language he's speaking.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nMaybe your car was in the shop and the guy was calling you back saying your car is ready or something.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.000\nOh man, my car is going to be in the shop forever.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nThey need to switch departments. That guy should be working on my air filter.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nI want to hear it again. Play it again.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nOkay.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nI think everybody get very quiet.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nHold on. I'm just 42 and it's an iPhone.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nJust give me a second.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:25.000\nDid you hear the kid?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:31.000\nI'm really concerned that I don't know how to get this guy back.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nIt's not a listed number.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:38.000\nHello, Dr. Harmon at the Tuberculosis Society.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nMy child is not going to die.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nBye.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:48.000\nIf you don't call back, I'll assume she's okay.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nShe's turning green.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nI'm not convinced that's Spanish.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nThat's not Spanish.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nYou heard TARDIS?\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nIt could have been Catalan, right?\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nTARDIS? I heard later.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nThey would call me later.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nLater would be added at 5.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nWhat's that?\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nIt's Cactus.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nIs that what they're doing?\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nA call back to Cactus Bunch?\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nThat's a deep cut.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.000\nThe Cactus Bunch isn't here, right?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nThe thing about the Cactus Bunch is\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nthe Cactus Bunch is also 40 years old right now.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nI would like to go hang out and have a drink with the Cactus Bunch.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nAnd ask him about the time they took my paisley bandana off me\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nand wanted me to fight them for it.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.000\nI think I'm most scared out of all the gang bangers.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\nI think I'm most scared of the Latino ones.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:48.000\nWhispering doesn't make this not recorded.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nAlright, alright.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:58.000\nLet's bring up a friend that I've been wanting to come up here for a long time.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nHe needs no introduction, which is a good thing because I'm bad at them.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nHe's an amazing comment.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nSenator Bernie Sanders.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nMr. Andy Kindler has come down here.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nYou can have a seat in any of these seats.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nThank you for having me.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nI never know how these panel things work.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nWherever you're comfortable.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nI think the camera guy might have a preference.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nHe's like, oh would you sit there?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.000\nChris, is it better if he sits closer to me?\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nThey don't care.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nCan you get us in a two shot?\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nI don't know what I'm saying.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nThat's what the old comics would say.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nI don't know what that meant.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:47.000\nI'm already bombing.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nHow could I be bombing that quick?\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nYou bomb before you sat down.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nBombing on site.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nOh, it's an old comedian of some type.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:02.000\nI have told them about you and worshiped at your feet.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nWe've got to get Kindler up here.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\nHe's one of the quickest bombing comics.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nThe main thing is he didn't build it up too big.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:16.000\nI felt like I had to do that.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nI didn't have to do that.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nI don't know why I did that.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nIt's not your fault.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nHe's the best.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nNow look at us.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:31.000\nYou're not responsible for their judgmental attitude.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:36.000\nKids today, they're like, yeah, you make us laugh.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.000\nWhat do you got?\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nIt's not like audiences back in the 70s.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:44.000\nNo, back in the 70s, they were like,\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:51.000\nI hope Gallagher smashes some melon and it gets on me.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nThat's what they were like.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nIt was easy back then.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nYou guys knew what to do back then.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nWhat will this Robin Williams think of next, they said back then?\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:04.000\nToo soon, too late, too soon.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nI'm going to do this joke every night.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nI'm on stage for the rest of my life.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:12.000\nEvery night, I've done it every night so far and I will do it again.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:19.000\nWho died and made Jim Belushi a big star?\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nI do the long stare.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nI've stolen many of your jokes and borrowed them in conversation or whatever,\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:31.000\nbut there's nothing I've stolen more than when you say a punchline and hold it.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nAnd that's built on a tradition of thousands of years of Catskills comic.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nThousands of years, fuck it.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nThousands of years.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:44.000\nBack in the code of Hammurabi, there was a code of Hammurabi.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nThat's Karnak I'm doing.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:52.000\nI did a Kermak thing last week to abject silence.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nGet it out.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:58.000\nThey don't know anything pre-Fallon.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:04.000\nI saw in the final montage of the Letterman goodbye, you popped up between two presidents.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nI can't follow Obama.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nThat was a joke at one point.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nNo, I couldn't believe it.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nI was totally thrilled.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:19.000\nI thought I saw, sometimes you're a dry guy, but sometimes you're a very sincere guy on Twitter.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:24.000\nOne of the things I was thrilled to talk to you about is how,\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nbecause I am the thing that really endeared you to me,\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nwhereas otherwise you'd just be that really, really funny guy,\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nand sometimes it's easy to hate that guy because you're like, fuck that really funny guy.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nI often hate myself because I'm so funny.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:45.000\nBut you bother to argue with people on Twitter about ideological stuff.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nPeople pick on you about not being an atheist and you push back.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nYou came to my defense with the best thing.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:59.000\nYou said if you don't believe in God, it's one thing.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:03.000\nI said to these kids that were picking on you,\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:06.000\nI think you're mistaking atheism, which is I have no God,\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nfor antagonism, which is you have no God.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nExactly.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:16.000\nAnd then that got retweeted so much and then there's just strangers, I posited that like I'm fucking played out.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nI didn't say that on the mount.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:23.000\nI was saying that to these three kids that were shaking down Andy for his lunch money,\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:28.000\nbecause he dares to have a connection to the fucking cosmos.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:33.000\nFirst of all, if you're 20, shut the fuck up about religion or about my lack of it.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nAre you kidding me?\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nYou were closer to birth.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:38.000\nWorship your mother's vagina.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:44.000\nI have his mother.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:47.000\nThat's what made that joke work.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nI'm not doing it.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nNo, you're absolutely right.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:54.000\nAnd here's the thing is that this whole topic has enraged me,\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nbut it also mixes up with a lot of different things, which is like people like,\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.000\nI'll give you an example of how a lot of these atheists, first of all, it drives them.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nI don't care if you're atheists.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nMost of my friends are atheists.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nMy dad was agnostic.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nSome comic who I've no longer friends with was talking about how it's hard to be,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nyou know, you get oppressed if you're an atheist.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nAnd you're oppressed as an atheist in America.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:21.000\nShow me where you're, you'd have to move to Alabama and specifically walk around and go,\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nthere's no God, you Jesus loving piece of garbage.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nI don't know, that was a bad example.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:34.000\nBut the point is, so, so, but this is an example of how some of these people's minds work.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:38.000\nSomeone was arguing with me and they said, they always say that religion causes,\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:42.000\nyou know, the Quranic causes people to become violent.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nSo I said, well, stop, you know, Stalin was an atheist.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nAnd then they go, then the guy comes back.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:50.000\nOh, you're saying atheism causes.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:54.000\nNo, I'm saying none of it causes violence.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:58.000\nSo it's like they claim to be brilliant, but not even using their own logic.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nThere's a lot of it.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nYeah, I feel like.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nI'm sorry, I got so excited about nothing.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nWe have an understanding.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:08.000\nI mean, I bet if I asked all the atheists to stand up, I don't want to risk it because they might go,\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:09.000\nwell, I'm standing, let's walk out.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:15.000\nYeah, but I, I, look, I mean, I, I don't always like, like, like, I'm just a Joseph Campbell guy.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:21.000\nAnd I was like, like, I was, I was an atheist slash agnostic to until I started writing and started having writer's block.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:26.000\nI mean, discovered Campbell was reading this and the guy grew up a Catholic boy scout and he was smart.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:34.000\nAnd, and, and he, the value of mythology in your life is like, that's all I care about.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:39.000\nLike I always say to people, if you're going to pop Tom, Tom Hanks is volleyball.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nWhat are you going to replace it with?\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nCast away.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:49.000\nThey don't even, they were born after that movie came out.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nIt's a, it's a young demo.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nNo.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nNo.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:58.000\nWell, the thing is, no, no, but the thing is, it's like, the thing is the worst thing, there is no sign.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.000\nAnd they drive them crazy when they go, there's absolutely, there's zero science in atheism.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nNothing.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nIt's nothing scientific.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:13.000\nBecause first of all, unless you're eight years old or 12 years old, of course we're not talking about people literally believe the Bible is true.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nThose are fundamentalists.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nNobody believes fundamentalists what they believe in.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nAlthough I've met a lot of nice fundamentalists.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:23.000\nI mean, then there's fundamentalists who will tell you you're bad for, for being gay.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:29.000\nBut the point is, you can't say something isn't true when the word God, I use it to describe something I can't describe.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nI'm not even saying what it is.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nI'm just saying I did LSD in college.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.000\nI've had a, I've written music.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:39.000\nI, you know, on stage you get into, into a zone.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nI take martial arts.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nThey call it no mind.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:48.000\nThe root of, of so many things in life, meditation is a belief in some kind of transcendent experience.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:53.000\nAnd you can't, and it seems like ridiculous that these people live in their little head.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:56.000\nThey really think that that's where they're going to be able to figure out everything.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.000\nScience has nothing to say about the kind of things that I'm talking about.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nRight, exactly.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:05.000\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying the world's 3,000 years old or creationism.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:11.000\nIt's like, there's no scientific thing that could come out where I would go, okay, I was wrong.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nRight.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nThere is, there is no love.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:20.000\nAnd there's a, there's a, there's a larger scale on which it's like, oh my God, well, are you, do you know that people used to put leeches on people and burn people at the stake and all that stuff?\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nRight.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nIt's like, yeah.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nAnd, and in that scale, we've won.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nThere's bigger skyscrapers than churches on every skyline.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:34.000\nThere's like no place where there's like crucifixes everywhere and you get whipped for anything if you don't believe in anything.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nLike, we're winning.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nWe're, we're, we're, it's, it's, it's on schedule.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nLike, like the death of religion.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nIt's fine.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nWe're fine.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:45.000\nI can't believe I've ever had to defend organized religion.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nI mean, I'm not even defending.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nI'm not defending anything.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nNo, they're worse than anybody.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nRight.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nAnything with a name on it, they can go fuck themselves.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nBut wouldn't you rather hang out with the Pope than Bill Maher?\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nI would.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:58.000\nWell, this Pope, I'd rather hang out with this Pope than Bill Murray.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.000\nThis Pope is like a fucking terrorist.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nHe's amazing.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nThat's like the biggest compliment I can give a Pope.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nIt's like a terrorist.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nHe knows what, he knows, the Pope knows what he means.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:14.000\nLike every other day you turn on NPR, it's like the Pope, the Pope said that people who hate gay people are going to hell.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nAnd like, he's just sort of like, I don't know.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:22.000\nHe didn't say that, but like, I mean, like, like, boy, they really put a, they put a firecracker in the old Pope seat.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nYeah, yeah, he's good.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:27.000\nThe Pope was in West Hollywood last night doing poppers.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nHe's good.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nHe's not normally a papal person.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nI've done that joke.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:33.000\nI've done it before.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.000\nThey love it.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nThey love it.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nIt's my joke I've done it before.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nJesus.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:49.000\nHe actually hit, that was, that was actual physical violence on the show for the first time, I think.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:52.000\nI can't believe I actually hit him with a piece of paper.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:56.000\nWe've had some screwballs up here and that was the first physical violent act.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nIt was physical comedy.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:00.000\nWell, I'll give you a perfect example.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nIt's like, I say online.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nI say online.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nI don't know anything about, I don't know anything about Charlie Hebdo.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.000\nI've seen a couple of cartoons where they're showing Mohammed.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nEasy, dude.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:12.000\nYou don't know what I'm going to say.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nYou don't know what I'm going to say.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nOkay.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nWhat were you, oh, don't even start.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nNo, I don't know anything about you.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:21.000\nI've seen a couple of cartoons where there were Mohammed's balls.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nDo you want a piece of paper and a pen to draw Mohammed right now?\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:24.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nI don't.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:29.000\nBut the point is, I say, look, just because, of course, you know, they go, well, I don't\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:32.000\nknow if Charlie Hebdo, I don't know if their cartoons were racist.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nI guess they go, well, they shouldn't have been murdered.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nYes.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nI can't we stipulate that I'm against murder.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nNot pro-murder.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nHas there anything I've ever said to you where you go, Andy, you're not saying you're going\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nto kill that guy because he cut you off in traffic.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:48.000\nBut the point is, if you can't have a discussion about that there are certain things in the\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:53.000\nworld like those Danish guy, that Van Gogh guy who did get killed, but there's a lot of\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:58.000\npeople provoking people who are not in the power position in their country.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nAnd we can't have a discussion about it.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd Salma Rush is going to say, because some people didn't want them to get a pen award,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nthat they have no character.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nThat's where it's like, you know, you have to have a discussion.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:13.000\nIf you're telling me there's no validity to my position because you can't murder a cartoonist.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nI'm against murdering cartoonists.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nThey should not be murdered.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nAndy.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nAndy.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:24.000\nIf you think you're murdering a cartoonist, count to 10.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nAndy.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nUnless it's family circle.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nIt's well documented that you've been soft on murder for a long time.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nI know.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nThat's not true.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nIt's a couple of times.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:36.000\nI murdered a couple of people and I wasn't sorry about it.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:42.000\nI will confess that I have been very, I refrain from ever speaking about the have to think\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:50.000\nbecause I've been so confused about it because I am a rabid, mouth foaming, I don't even want\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:55.000\nto say first amendment guy because I don't think, you know, the freedom of speech is\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nsomething you get from a lawyer.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:59.000\nI think it's something you get by virtue of your humanity.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nBut I'm like, anybody ever trying to stop blah, blah, blah.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:05.000\nBut the thing is that I had to realize, I think you retweeted an article.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nWas it you?\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nYes.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nThat guy.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:11.000\nWhere it was all the French muslims that was just sounding off.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nThey asked a different article.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:19.000\nIt was a vice magazine article and all it was, there was no agenda to the article except\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:28.000\nthat it was just a bunch of French Islamic individuals commenting on the situation by\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nvirtue of being asked by this journalist.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:35.000\nAnd I was like, I just read it and I kind of like got this more distant view and started,\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:39.000\nI was like, oh my God, I got caught up in that age old thing that I'm always railing\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:44.000\nagainst which is so much easier to recognize within the country where you're being told\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:47.000\nfalsely that you have to choose between two things.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nRight.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:52.000\nYou have to choose between whether you love freedom or love terrorism.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nRight.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:56.000\nLike I got, me, me, old genius pants.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nNot old genius pants.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nI got, I got, I was like, I was like, I don't understand.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:04.000\nIt's like, I don't, I mean anybody who's, who shoots anybody is a fucking bully.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:08.000\nAnd so we should just always like fucking gather around and do whatever we have to and blah,\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nblah, blah.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:13.000\nBut yeah, yes, you can still feel that way, but you can also be equally passionate about\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\neverybody being respected all the time.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:18.000\nThis isn't, this isn't something that's up for referendum anywhere.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nRight.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nIt's not, it's, you don't have to choose salt or pepper.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:24.000\nLike anything you can be like, the potatoes need some salt.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.000\nThe pepper needs some salt and the salt needs some pepper.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nYeah.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:32.000\nAnd then both the other potato needs some salt and pepper.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:36.000\nNo, but for example, Bill Mark will quote, Bill Mark is a horrible person.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:43.000\nHe will quote, he will quote, he will say 70% of, you know, according to a Pew poll in Syria\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:47.000\nwhere 70% of Muslims hate those cartoons.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nThey're allowed to hate the cartoons.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nYou're allowed to draw the cartoons.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nI'm allowed to say I can't, I hate them.\n\n33:54.000 --> 34:00.000\nAnd it seems to me, I didn't see a lot of these people arguing about having mosques near 9-11.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nEverything in your, that's also freedom of expression.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:08.000\nSo everybody's freedom of expression is based on where you are in your life.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:13.000\nSo many of my friends have got, they almost like jumped up from the table because they're artists.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nSo that's all they see in that moment.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nAnd it's so important to see that.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nYes, it is.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nAnd murder is wrong.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:26.000\nIt's a two little family circus that guy should be allowed to walk around.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou say, I measure of the extremity of artists supporting.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:41.000\nAre you coming down in favor of murdering Bill Keane and family circus?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nNo, I retract that.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nFor a minute, I got a little angry.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:52.000\nHe's expressing his belief in non-murder to the extent that he's willing to say Bill Keane should be walking around among us, breathing our air.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nThat's tolerance.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nThat is very tolerance.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nYou think I don't want to...\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nJust as card-carrying non-murderer.\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:02.000\nYou think when Garfield doesn't like Mondays, I don't want to rip my head off?\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:08.000\nBut I... You don't think I want to send Jim Davis to the Eternal Monday of...\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:12.000\nTo the Lasagna of Hell?\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nYes, I do.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:20.000\nWhy were you all up in arms?\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nOh, okay.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nBut you agree that I'm right?\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nThat's all I care about.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:30.000\nI want to be the guy who gives his opinion and is not afraid to say anything, but everybody has to love me.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nLet's all just love Andy.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nThat's it.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:38.000\nAll right, so let's talk about comedy.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nAndy, what is this...\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:48.000\nYou did a great thing for, I think, several years at the Just For Laugh Festival in Montreal, the state of the industry address, which is hilarious.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nWhat do you think the state of comedy is right now?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nWell, I think the state...\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:55.000\nWell, first of all, when you have a Mr. James Corden, who...\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nThey don't even know who he is.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\nI honestly don't either. He does the fish sticks, right?\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:03.000\nNo, I used to go with this, make this speech.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nNow nobody even knows the references.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:10.000\nOkay, I love the show B-roll with Carson Daly. Have you seen that show?\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nNo.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nAll right, so Carson Daly doesn't even...\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nDoesn't have time to be on his own show anymore.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:18.000\nHe doesn't do the interviews on his show.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:23.000\nHe throws to comedians who put their own segments together.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:26.000\nWhy are you not outraged by this?\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nThen we have the comedians.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nJosh Gad is literally...\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nHe's in everything.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nHe's in everything.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nI opened up my mailbox this morning.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:37.000\nJosh Gad popped out.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nHe physically popped out?\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nHave you seen the comedians?\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nYes.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:44.000\nIt's behind the scenes of vaudeville is what it is.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:49.000\nAnd Josh Gad said that Billy Crystal is an encyclopedia of comedy.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:58.000\nHe didn't say that he's a 1957 world book.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:01.000\nAdam Sandler, he's Adam Sandler movie.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:04.000\nThey walked off a set of that movie.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:08.000\nEven the writers of F-Troop sent them a note.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:14.000\nThey don't even know what Adam Sandler movie is in production.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:18.000\nHello.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:23.000\nNo, I'd like to drown in my own sorrow.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:27.000\nSometimes non sequiturs don't work.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:37.000\nI would assume that you would agree that...\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nHey, Ricky Gervais, is that what you're...\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nRicky Gervais.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nNo, you were onto something.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nRicky Gervais, give me some Ricky Gervais.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:49.000\nOkay, Ricky Gervais spends half of his Twitter feed talking about what an atheist he is.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:52.000\nAlthough he doesn't even understand the basic tenets of monotheism.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:55.000\nSomeone goes, he goes, what God do you believe in?\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nWe've already settled that whatever it is that people are sensing,\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nit's all the same thing, viewed through different cultures.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:04.000\nBut this idiot doesn't even know what he's talking about.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nSo half of his feeds about that.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:10.000\nAnd then the other half of his feed is about how he doesn't care what people say about him.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:11.000\nHalf of his tweets.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:15.000\nAnd I want to know, can I get a price on Netflix without Derek?\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nOne more time, one more time, one more time.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nGive me one more.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nWithout Derek.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:28.000\nBetter than without Derek.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nWhat's the price without Derek?\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:33.000\nThe joke's up there, Dan.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nOh, and you're bringing it down?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nYeah.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:36.000\nWithout Derek.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nIs it like frosting?\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nAnd we're like in a gingerbread house?\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nI'm painting a picture for the people.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nAnd then always, if it doesn't get big enough laugh,\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nyou say something in between the jokes,\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nlike pretty frightening stuff, people.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nI think I'm making you sick.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:52.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nI'm such a bad interviewer that sometimes if you look over at me,\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nI'm thinking about what I should ask you next.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nIs this not making you comfortable?\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nLet's do this.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nLet's do this.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nYou think I would agree with you?\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:05.000\nI was going to say, I would imagine you might agree or would tweak this observation\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:09.000\nthat there was a certain point in time when a certain kind of,\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:13.000\nI always call it the apple on the teacher's desk school of comedy.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.000\nFallon.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nLet me finish, if you like.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:21.000\nLay it on me.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nYes, I will say, yes, yes.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nFallon fully represents that.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:28.000\nIt's the mistaking fun for funny,\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:33.000\nand it's also the sort of like a comedian's job isn't to upset people,\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nwhich I don't agree with.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:41.000\nI feel like a comedian should not be allowed to be pals with a politician.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:46.000\nI think you should definitely feel that there's like a red flag happening there.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:49.000\nIf like, Ted Cruz is a nice man and we hang out.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nWe don't talk, we play golf.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nWe don't talk politics.\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.000\nFunnier here.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:00.000\nFunnier there.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:01.000\nFunnier there.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.000\nNo, I know what you mean though,\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:06.000\nbut also that's why Letterman was so amazing was because he was himself.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:07.000\nRight.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nIt's funny when you yourself, curmudgeoned,\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:12.000\nAndy Rooney is still complaining about his coffin.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:17.000\nHe's like, why is my, why are my eyebrows still growing?\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:20.000\nWhy didn't I get myself cremated?\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:24.000\nI don't think eyebrows should keep growing after you die.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nI think they should stop.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.000\nI don't know why there's a top on the coffin.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nWhy is there a lid on here?\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nNo one's going to open this up.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:35.000\nLook at me.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nWhere am I going to go?\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:40.000\nI don't know where to be.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nI don't need more lining.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nI understand they needed to put my body in,\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nbut they could have welded it shut.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nActually, now that I'm thinking about it out loud,\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nI guess a lid makes sense.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:54.000\nGoodbye.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:55.000\nI'm dead Andy Rooney.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nI'm dead Andy Rooney.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nI found my peace.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nI would love, I would love it.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nIf 60 Minutes was edgy,\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:07.000\nthey would have a dead Andy Rooney at the end of every episode.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:18.000\nI perceived the shift toward the Apple on the Desk philosophy of comedy\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.000\nas coming around Chris Farley's death.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nBecause I felt like it was just one too many for everybody.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nAnd then there was a certain like takeover of like,\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nokay, now let's have the activities committee.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:30.000\nWhat do you mean Apple on the desk?\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\nI don't understand.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:34.000\nI just mean like, hey, who's your favorite student?\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nIt's me.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:36.000\nWhat were you at home school?\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:37.000\nYou know.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:40.000\nBoom!\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:48.000\nYou know how in high school, there were the kids that put together the pep rally?\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:55.000\nAnd they would like, and then Mr. Simmons from chemistry would come out\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nand he would like slip sync to an Elvis song.\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:01.000\nAnd then he would, and then Jeremy would come out who's famous for his mullet\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:04.000\nand then they'd cut his mullet because he said he'd cut it if they didn't win homecoming.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:07.000\nAnd it's like, everyone's like, woo, woo, woo!\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:11.000\nIt's like this fusion of popularity and comedy, but it's not really comedy.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:14.000\nLike the kids that are smoking joints under the bleachers,\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nlike they're not all funny either.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.000\nBut like a comedian should come from the dirt, right?\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:24.000\nThey shouldn't come from like popular like crops of people.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:28.000\nAnd I felt like like the edginess and that association with drugs,\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:32.000\nit's always been there and it's always been like sort of a sad but realistic\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:35.000\nlike kind of thing is it's like comedians are terrible tortured people.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:40.000\nThey're in a lot of pain, they self-medicate.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nAnd like, so there's like, you know, as with musicians, there's just always been this kind of like,\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:49.000\nokay, this comedian like, like, you know, kind of like, he's allowed to say shit\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nthat no one else is allowed to say and he catches flak for it,\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:54.000\nbut he doesn't give a fuck and that's the comedian station and oh, he overdosed.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nAnd like the...\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:59.000\nIt's not no one specific we're talking about.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nAlso not pro overdose.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:05.000\nYeah. It's a hypothetical comedian.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:08.000\nMaybe it's my oh, like I tipped a glass of milk.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:09.000\nI guess it's maybe you're like...\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:13.000\nEnish Madoopy drowned in a pool of his own cocaine.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nWhat?\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nWhat's Enish P. Madoopy?\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:23.000\nEnish Madoopy, I said.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nI'm not good at...\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nEnish Madoopy.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:32.000\nAnyway, I just said, you know, he had his own pool of cocaine.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:36.000\nYou know, a lot of times it's not what some people say funny things funny,\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:40.000\nbut funny people say funny things, things, things.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nHave you ever heard that one?\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nThey used to hear that one all the time.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:45.000\nLike, is that a bromide?\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:46.000\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nSome people say funny things.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:49.000\nComics.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:50.000\nComics and comedians.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nComedians say funny things, comics say...\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:53.000\nSay things funny.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:54.000\nSay things funny.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:55.000\nRight.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:56.000\nDumb.\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:01.000\nI didn't say you said that.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nAndy Kiddler is saying you guys said that.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nYou did it.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:05.000\nYou guys said...\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:06.000\nWhy would you bring that?\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nYour silence is consent.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:09.000\nWhen you...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:10.000\nThat's right.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:11.000\nYou think he's...\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:12.000\nYou like racism.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nYou're pro-racism.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nYou...\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:15.000\nYou sons of the...\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nWhen I was back there and you said about...\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nYou said you were in a comic, right?\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:20.000\nRight.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:21.000\nOkay.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:22.000\nNow, this is...\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nI mean, he is a comedian, but the idea...\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.000\nLike, these people like Karola or...\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nThey all of a sudden think...\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nOr Gervais is another example.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nGervais thinks he's the funniest in our community in the world.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nWhat is wrong with your ego that you think...\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:39.000\nBecause you've done stand-up 15 or 20 times?\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nAnd it's like to have humility.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nYou have humility.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nIt's like, you know you're funny, but you're not.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:45.000\nRight.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:46.000\nYou know there's a certain...\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:47.000\nAnd these people...\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nAnd I can't complete sentences.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:49.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:52.000\nBut yeah, you and Pat Naswell sit there and it's like fucking like...\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nYeah.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:57.000\nYou know, you work for 10 years and the result is like a strong 15.\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:00.000\nI think I just insulted you guys.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nIt's a strong...\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\n11.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nNo, but I mean, it's like...\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.000\nIt's fucking like...\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nI mean, you torture yourselves and you like...\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nAnd you work it and blah, blah, blah.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nAnd it's like this podcasting age is a great thing,\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nbut I sense like with Kumail Nanjiani too.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.000\nIt's like...\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nI'm about to go on stage and I'll go like...\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:19.000\nOr Duncan Trussell too has like been working on the road\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nand the last time when he's sort of become a podcast star,\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nbut it's like his podcast audience is way bigger\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nthan his comedian following, I think.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nSo if it goes on tour with his podcast,\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nhe draws these huge crowds for no effort at all.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nBut if he's like just touring as a stand-up,\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nit's sort of like, oh, he does stand-up.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:36.000\nAnd I remember saying to Duncan before going on stage is like,\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:39.000\nare you mad about the last 20 years that we...\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:40.000\nRight, right.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, you know what, I am.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nYeah.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nYeah, that's really fucking enraging.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nBecause he's a very happy guy.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nThat's a good little Duncan Trussell.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:51.000\nBut anyways, yeah, I don't know, I'm just babbling about that.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nAnd there's no value...\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nAnd my thing is there's no value judgment,\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nbut you know, it's like that with...\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nDid you see that thing where Ricky Gervais was on\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:59.000\nwith like Chris Rock and those guys and Louis C.K.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nand they were all talking about comedy\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:04.000\nand the fact that Ricky Gervais, he's a narcissist.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:05.000\nHe had a thing on Twitter once,\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:08.000\nmy favorite example of someone who was so full of himself.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:11.000\nHe said, this is the only trophy hunting I believe in\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nbecause he's doing animal rights things\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:16.000\nand he's standing in front of a case with his trophies in it.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:17.000\nNo.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:20.000\nAnd I forced him to change his Twitter bio.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nI absolutely am convinced of it\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:23.000\nbecause his Twitter bio said,\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:30.000\nmulti BAFTA winning 16 ME deserving writer, producer,\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:33.000\nactor, singer, I mean literally.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:36.000\nAnd he goes, and a one-trick pony with a smiley face.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nAh!\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:41.000\nYou can't be a comedian and not realize\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nand not have any self-awareness.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:46.000\nAnd I love the original office.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nBoy is my face red.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.000\nI guess Steven Merchant was responsible.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nHe is that character.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nI mean, who's the guy who played?\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nMerchant, you think Merchant is,\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nwhatever, Ricky Gervais is character?\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nMaybe he has a soul of some kind.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:07.000\nBut Ricky Gervais is that character.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:08.000\nDavid Brent.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nYeah, he's not playing.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:12.000\nYeah, interesting.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nSo, okay.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nHe meant interesting.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nNo, I really did mean it.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nI say intriguing.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nIt's not a competition.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nThat's how you look at it.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nScore one for Kinler.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nKinler won.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:37.000\nI guess we've already circled this.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nI kind of wanted to ask you this\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nbecause you would be the only person\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:43.000\nthat I would trust to answer this question\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nin an edifying way.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:46.000\nNo pressure.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nBut also, it's kind of a dumb question.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nSo, don't answer it.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nWho is Copernicus?\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:55.000\nDoctors have this sort of central oath.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nThey have the Hippocratic oath.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:00.000\nThey can sum up their whole shtick in one thing.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nI gotta heal people.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:03.000\nThat's what I do.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nThat's my gimmick.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:05.000\nI'm a doctor.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:08.000\nAnd whether I work on toes or noses\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nor a little bit of both,\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nI'm not supposed to do any harm.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:16.000\nIt's hard to find a good toe and nose doctor.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nDoctors have an oath\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nbecause we had to shake them down\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.000\nfor one at some point\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nbecause otherwise they could just be like...\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:23.000\nThe leeches.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nI'm gonna cut off one of your arms\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nand see if that helps.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:30.000\nMaybe we should have a do no harm thing.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:31.000\nBecause Dr. Schmeck...\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:34.000\nDr. Mengele is gonna stop it.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:38.000\nI can't reference Dr. Mengele!\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:42.000\nHe's not alive!\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.000\nAre they pro-doctor Mengele?\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nThey're anti-irony.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:53.000\nThere's no such thing as context.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:57.000\nBecause bad people abuse the concepts of context and irony\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:01.000\nto be genuinely bad people.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nSo then we go,\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:03.000\nwhat about context?\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:04.000\nWhat about irony?\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:07.000\nAnd they're like, I heard that from Old Man Carruthers\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:08.000\nand he's racist.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nSo you're racist too.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:11.000\nGood logic.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:14.000\nYou little fucking high-cologram shithead.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nThis is gonna be me in six months.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nLook you atheist piece of shit!\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:24.000\nIs there a comedic oath?\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nWhat would it be if there was one?\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nObviously there isn't one\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:30.000\nbecause there's a lot of bad approaches to comedy.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nLike me personally observing,\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:35.000\nit's like I don't think you should be doing comedy\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:39.000\nto get applause or even necessarily smiles.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nI think the comedy definitely heals more people\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:44.000\nand makes them feel better in the long run.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nSo I've always babbled about this,\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:47.000\nbut it's important.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:50.000\nThe first joke, this is a theory,\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:51.000\nan anthropological theory,\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nthe first joke that we hear is peekaboo\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nand it's like it's half terror.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nYour mom is abusing your infantile instinct\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nto shriek in terror when your mom's face goes away\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:05.000\nand then she's going, I'm in on it too.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nDeath is a joke.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nAnd you're like, I don't know what the fuck this world is.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nThis is insane.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:13.000\nSo like half of a comedian's job is,\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nif you're dwelling in the world of comedy,\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:18.000\nyou get one foot in the river sticks, you know?\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:19.000\nThen you'd forget everything.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:22.000\nAll right, ancient Greek majors.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:25.000\nMaybe if your mother wasn't holding a knife.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nWell, she was doing it.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:30.000\nForget about it.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nYou're in that.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:37.000\nI want to hear more ancient Greek capskill comedy.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:40.000\nEasy, Sisyphus.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:44.000\nWork a little harder.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nI can't think of one Greek name.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:49.000\nHey, Tantalus, I have a mic.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:54.000\nYou can't reach your beer. God has a plan.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nIcarus, Andy, Icarus.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nMaybe you shouldn't name your comedy,\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nyou know, the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nI don't know.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nIs that even Greek?\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nYes.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nI like them.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nPeople are like, yes, yes, old man.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nRead something.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:11.000\nI do. Here's my oath.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:12.000\nI do have an oath.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:13.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nThe thing I think I hate more than anything else,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:16.000\nand I'm sure you agree with this,\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:17.000\nis when people say, hey, if they laugh,\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nyou know, people are laughing, it's funny.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nWell, that's just objectively wrong.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:24.000\nYou can't say comedy's not subjective in the sense that...\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nThat's like saying if people are sneezing,\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nif they're sick, or allergic,\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nor anything, there's a lot of reasons to sneeze.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nWe may disagree on what's funny,\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:35.000\nbut it doesn't mean that because people can get some of the laugh,\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:38.000\nit's funny because that was what got me,\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nwhere I wrote this handbook,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nwhich is still available on my website,\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nwhere nothing ever changes.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:48.000\nWho's sick and tired of all these different dates.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nSo...\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:53.000\nThey keep changing them.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nBut I don't know what I'm saying.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:58.000\nYour oath, the hack handbook?\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:01.000\nWhat was the sentence before that?\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nYou said you had an oath.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:06.000\nOh, well, okay, so, if you're in a club,\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:07.000\nand I say, are you working tonight?\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nWe'll get your feet off the stage.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nIn the 80s, any comic, you got a laugh doing that.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nAnd the crowd would laugh.\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nYou've never heard it before.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:18.000\nSo it's up to the comedian to take the responsibility\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:21.000\nthat he knows that his material is original,\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nthat he's not doing something hack.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nBut a lot of...\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nIn the 90s, when they had the first,\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nquote, alternative scene since the late 70s,\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nwhich is the real alternative explosion\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nwith lettermanology,\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:36.000\npeople like me were all squeezed out of,\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nlike Janeane Garofalo, all these people.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nWe couldn't play comedy clothes because it was just filled\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nwith hacks who just played to the audience.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nSo I think the oath is that you can't,\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:47.000\nyou have to go with what you believe is funny.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nAnd for me, the big breakthrough,\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nbut I don't know if this is enough,\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:55.000\nI came 23 years in when I realized that,\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:58.000\nI thought I was always saying what was on my mind,\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nbut I realized I wasn't.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nI was going to stock things about it,\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:05.000\nlike I hate the crowd or I hate myself.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nAnd that was the big breakthrough.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:10.000\nAnd so that's kind of my oath is when things go bad,\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\njust to really try and be in the moment,\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nbut I don't know if that's enough.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:17.000\nJust step back and remind yourself that,\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:20.000\nyeah, if you're not making yourself laugh,\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nif something you genuinely feel is funny,\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nthen you could still be wrong.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nYou could say something that you genuinely think is funny\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nand find out that you're racist on Monday night.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nAnd then you're like, read about it for three days\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nand come back on Thursday like, you know what,\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nI was racist on Monday and I found out.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:38.000\nBut unless you're saying what you genuinely think is funny,\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nyou're never, ever, ever going to,\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nyou're never going to be funny,\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nbecause you could make people laugh.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nFor the wrong reasons.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nI'm going to use this Got Milk formula everyone's using.\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nI'm going to say Got Come.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nAnd see, I got a chuckle.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nAnd Dick, for example, Dick jokes,\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nand that's why you can't make any rules,\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nbecause Dick jokes are an easy way to get people to laugh.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nBut then there's always one person,\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nlike any rule you would make,\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nand then you'd see David Tell for 10 minutes\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nbe so hilarious.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nNo one's funnier than him.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nYou can't make any rules, so that's why\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nwhen politically correct things come down\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nor when they want to have to co-bear\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nor so terrible, because obviously we know he's hilarious.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nBut that doesn't mean that I never\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nbought the thing where when you're on stage\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nit's a magic racer zone.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nYou can say anything you want.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nA comedian should have a conscience.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nYou should be able to say if you think you're wrong,\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nI was wrong. I hate that the comics are saying,\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nor many say you should never apologize.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nYou should always evaluate what you're doing.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nRight, right.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nI thought it was really refreshing.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nDo you remember when Natasha Legerro did the thing about it?\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nShe did some Pearl Harbor joke.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nOh, about the, they're so old, they got their food.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nLike, it's a case-by-case basis, is what you say.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nBut that was such a fucking great day for me.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nI like springing my step.\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nBecause she just said, I'm not sorry.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nAnd I shouldn't be.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nAnd it's not defiance, and it's just like,\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nthis is not, because we are over-apologizing,\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nBut what you're saying is, sometimes,\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nyou don't have to have that hard line.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nA comedian doesn't, we can't go like,\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nwe're comedians, we're not going to apologize.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nI've been doing this podcast.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nI talk two hours a week.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nI have no material.\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nI'm babbling, I'm drunk.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nI have bruised people.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nAnd I have been told that I have bruised them on Twitter.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nAnd I have then, even in that moment,\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\ngone like, go fuck yourself, because I'm human.\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nAnd I don't like being told that I did something wrong.\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nBut like, inevitably, I'm like,\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nI did something wrong.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nI think that's really cool.\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nI could have done that differently.\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nBut I didn't, because I wasn't thinking the right way.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nAnd that is a PR thing.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nYou just want to say it.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nThat's a PR thing.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nMy people say the same thing.\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nSpeaking of PR,\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nto take it into this area,\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\npart of your persona is,\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nthe reason that we know\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nthat you really follow that credo\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nis because in the brief time you've been up here,\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nyou have, I mean,\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nI also do not like Bill Maher.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nI also\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nwas thinking of Jimmy Fallon\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nwhen you said I was thinking of Jimmy Fallon.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nI also,\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nI didn't know Adam Carolla was racist,\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nbut I'm willing to believe you.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nYou go there,\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nas the girls say?\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nI do go there.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nAnd the thing is,\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\neverything, like, okay, so I have a joke.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nI say, Jay Leno has a car that runs on the energy\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nof all the people's dreams of these crimes.\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nAnd I kind of do,\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nI really don't like Jay Leno,\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nbut Bill Maher is in a completely different category\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nbecause I am very sensitive\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nto the anti,\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nthat people should not hate people\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nbased on, I was raised,\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nyou don't hate people based on their religion.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nThat really pisses me off about Bill Maher.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nAll of his dogmatic stuff,\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nhe has a religion, and it's atheism,\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nand he's as fundamentalist and dogmatic about that.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nAnd you could possibly be about any fucking thing else.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nIt would be fine if he were more charming about it,\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nbut charm is not what Bill Maher deals in.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nIt's 9-Eleven!\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nSorry.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nThat is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\nAndy, we're the only show\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nthat people cheer when you go, it's 9-Eleven.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nOh, my God.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nHave you sometimes, don't you miss it sometimes?\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nSometimes we miss it.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nAnd in the morning, I'm like, God damn it.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nBut it happens again, like in the AM.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nThere was one time, Bill Maher...\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.000\nOne time we did like a\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nsweet, sexy ass\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nR&B song about 9-Eleven.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nYeah.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nWe were thinking, we should have a tradition at 9-Eleven,\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nbut then it started to feel creepy.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nBecause I think the number's funny, you know what I mean?\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nLike, it's not...\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\n3,000 people nag, isn't that funny?\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nI'm against it.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nThe idea of a number being sacred is funny.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nThey shouldn't have taken down the tower.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nNo, they should not have.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nHe clearly doesn't believe that.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nThey should have counted to 10.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nYou're right.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nYou know what? Count to 11.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nYeah.\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\n10 soon? 10 late?\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\n10 is right in between 9 and 11.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nRight in between them.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nThey just missed 10.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nThe fear is always that there's someone in the crowd\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nwho's...\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nI just had put it behind me.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nYeah.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nSomeone who started experimenting with stand-up\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nat 17, right after Jeffrey Dahmer\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nate everyone in Milwaukee.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nAnd when all of the families\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nof his 17 victims\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nwere going out to comedy clubs\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nto try to get away from their sorrows,\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nand every comic was like,\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nwell, it seems like everyone else in the nation\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nthinks this is funny.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nNever mind that I live in Milwaukee.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nAndy, I'm sure you were doing gigs\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nin the days and weeks after 9-11,\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nbecause I went to a show about a week after...\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\na week and a half after\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nall the shit went down.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nAnd Warren Thomas did a set\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nand did the funniest 9-11 joke of all time.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nBut the audience before that,\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nnobody was really quite willing\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nto laugh at anything at all, because the whole country,\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nthe whole world was just like\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nin a weird\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nsuspension of like...\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\ngoing to be funny for a while.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nAnd rightfully so.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nIt's very natural.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nAnd some guy came on\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nbefore him and told a bunch of jokes\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nabout how his failing acting career\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nand he's in a bunch of shows that were terrible.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nAnd he's talking about his career.\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nAnd then Warren Thomas, who was a great comic,\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nwho died how many years ago?\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nAbout 10 years ago, maybe?\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nHe's a beloved, hilarious guy.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nAnd he comes up when his first joke was,\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nI saw your demo reel.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\n9-11.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nThat is sweet.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nThe crowd did not groan.\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nThe crowd fucking went into ecstasy\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nbecause we needed to fucking say something funny.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nNot at the expense of what happened.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nIt's just that the world needed\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nsomebody to fucking do the comedian's job.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nIt's like let's all just fucking,\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nlet's all be in this room together\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nand let's all laugh about anything at all.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nYeah, I think that's...\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nIt's a very courageous thing.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nYou never heard the story about Gilbert Gottfried?\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nI did not want to see it.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nIt's a whole long thing, but I had no desire\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nto see the aristocrats.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nIn some ways, I'm like an old-school guy.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI had a fear my parents are going to watch it\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nand they're going to be watching.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nSomething like up the ass into the coal.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nAnd then...\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nBut the premise that he had...\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nTell them what he said.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nI'm going back to the thing after the Jonestown massacre.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nOh, because he said after 9-11\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nthat he was late for gig because\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nhe had to change planes at the Empire State Building.\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nOh!\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nAnd then he went into that...\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nThen he went into the Empire State Building.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nThe crowd grown and then he said,\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nI'm going to horrify you with viscera.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nBut what's the joke?\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nI hope I'm not getting this wrong\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nbecause this is the story that I'm sure\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nI'm going to get the details wrong.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nI believe it was Gilbert Gottfried\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nat the Fillmore in San Francisco\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nand from what I've heard\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nit's one of the greatest openers of all time\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nand it was like a couple days or so\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nafter, believe me, if I'm getting this wrong\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nsomebody put online\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nthe actual story of this.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nBut this has passed down to me through other comics.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nThe Jonestown massacre, horrible thing.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nAnother one of those moments where nobody...\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nWe're against it.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nNobody knew what to think and certainly\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nwe're going to a comedy show and all these people\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nhave been massacred and it's a weird time\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nto go laugh about anything at all.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nEspecially he did the show in Jonestown.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nThat was the thing.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nTough room.\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nI smell flesh.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nI don't know\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nhow they even died.\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nWhat would they drink in the Kool-Aid?\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nSupposedly, he comes out\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nand I don't know if he was doing the Gilbert voice then\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nor not but this was a long time ago.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nI think he always kind of did it.\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nI can't believe we all missed the\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nTwo Drink Minimum\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nbit there.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nA Two Drink Minimum?\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nTwo Drink Maximum\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nUh, Jonestown\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nTwo Poison\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nTwo Drink Maximum\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nI'm really killing the night.\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nSo he comes out and he says,\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nand forgive me if I'm getting any of this wrong\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nbut the way I know the story is that\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nhe comes out and he says,\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nI grew up in San Francisco\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nwhich I don't think he did.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nAgain, could be all wrong\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nbut the point is he did this joke.\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nI said, like, Janis Joplin played her\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nand I came here\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nas a young teenager\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nand I saw Janis Joplin play here\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nand I actually became friends with her\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nand I met her and we hung out\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nand I was actually with Janis when she died\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nand I\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nheld her in my arms\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nas Janis died.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nSo to be here at the film hall, it's a very powerful\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nit's a very emotional thing for me.\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nI saw Jimi Hendrix play her.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nI became friends with Jimi Hendrix.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nThe night that Jimi Hendrix died,\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nI held Jimi Hendrix in my arms\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nas he died.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nI just got back from Jonestown\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nand boy are my arms tired.\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nYeah, fuck those people at Jonestown!\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nI'm sorry, can I go too far?\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nThey knew what they signed up for.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nThey knew, yes!\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nI'll put up the quotes.\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nDid you ever see that thing Eric Eidel wrote\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nabout how comics are licensed gestures\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nand\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nthey should always have the freedom\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nand it should be sanctioned\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nby everybody.\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nThey have the ability to be seditious\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nand to be critical.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nWell the trouble is that in the world\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nwhere gestures come from, you were vetted.\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nSo with capitalism, everyone's a comic.\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nIt's like open mic night\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nand then some guy gets up.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nWe've all seen some horrible shit.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nI did stand up for all of a couple years\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nbad and didn't have the discipline to do it.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nI was at the safe house\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nin Milwaukee with this guy\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nwho was a juggler and he was juggling\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nmachetes\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nand I guess\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nthey weren't sharp machetes\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nbut they were fucking metal\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nand one of them just\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nflew out into the audience\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nand almost hit a lady\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nand\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nhe didn't apologize\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nwhich I think you should always do\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nwhen you almost machete someone\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nand\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nshe was like whoa and she was being\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nrelative to almost being machete\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\na good sport\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nand she was like\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nand I guess the machete kind of\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nwent sort of in the area\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nof where it landed.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nHe saw the opportunity\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nin that it landed kind of between\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nher legs\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nand so he made the joke as he picked it up\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nlike too bad it didn't go six inches further\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nto keep you from reproducing\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nand then kept juggling.\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nThat's funny folks come on!\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nWhen I think about\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nwhether or not\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nwe should all be knighted\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nfor speaking our mind\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nwe're the defenders of all this stuff\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nI always remember that guy\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nthat guy doesn't know what he's doing\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nhe's very nervous\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nhe's throwing knives around\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nand when he fucks up throwing knives around\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nhis mind leaps to\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nhis female\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\ncircumcision or whatever he's\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nthinking like\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nI wish that had cracked your vagina in half!\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nThank God! To remove you from the gene pool!\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nTough room!\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nThat's not me it's the machete guy!\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nSo yeah we don't\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nwe don't get that jester status\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\ncomedy in general\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nwhen you're talking about comedy as a river\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nyou know what should the pH level\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nof that river be\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nI think it should be primarily toxic\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nI think there should be a causticity\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nto things that get dipped in that river\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nBut unless people\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nlike someone like Brian Regan\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nwho I think is hilarious\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nhis mind doesn't work that way\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nhis mind doesn't work that way\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nso I wouldn't call that caustic\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nNo no no you don't have to be oh my God\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nplease yeah I'm sorry\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nyou don't have to be caustic as a comedian\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nthat's my whole point I think of that kid\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nI go like he should not be protected\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nby the comedian rule\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nI also like on the other side of the\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nspectrum a huge thing that is violated\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nis that everybody by default thinks you\n\n01:06:34.000 -->

exercise\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nbecause\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nwe're friends with Drew Carey\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nwho like we watched go through\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nwe didn't watch him go through it we met him when he was already\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\ngoing through it like\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nthere's a dangerous game you're playing there\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nthe highest achievement is\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nyou get a sitcom and you're like\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nmy name's my actual name\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nbut I work in an ad firm\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nbut it's really me\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nand so like your identity\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nI remember Drew\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nand expressed this at one point it's like\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nthen you get canceled\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nand it's you but it's not you\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nit was you\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nwhen everybody was watching the Drew Carey show\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nthat meant the world loved Drew Carey\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nthey called it I love Drew Carey\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nthey're talking about the show but it's also\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nhis first and last name\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nand then when people stop watching Drew Carey\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nand stop liking Drew Carey\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nthat's tough emotional grounds\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nI also think the truth is\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nand this is the truth to me\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nis that you really can't control\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nthat's why like Oprah when they would do these\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nactual ancient\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\neastern ideas but they would misappropriate them\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nlike you create your own reality\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nbut that doesn't work\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nif you're Jewish and you want to go into\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nconcentration camp you know what I'm saying\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nI'm just saying the Jews did not\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nwant to go into a concentration camp\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nso if you just think you create your own\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nreality that's a misunderstanding\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nbut you do put your own energy\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nin the world and you can\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000\ncontrol what you do sometimes\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nbut you can't always control\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nwhat the end result is so I'm comfortable\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nthat I just don't know what's going to happen\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nand that wouldn't discount anything\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nI wouldn't do a show\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\ncalled the Drew Carey show\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nyou know that's off the table\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000\neven though\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nyou don't respect copyright law but that's not\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nthe reason we just wouldn't do it on a craftsmanship\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nyes it's like it's been done\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nand you don't want to do it\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nI'm a stickler, I'm a stickler\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nthey pitched me

01:26:10.000\nunderneath Andy Kindler is the\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nstickler and then you pop up\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nhey you're not getting that right\n\n01:26:14.000 -->

do\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nacross the street from Pedro's Grill\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000\njust up the road\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nby the way thanks for saying that\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nthere was a tiny little coffee house\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nI don't think I talked about this\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nwe completely just filleted you\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000\non a show a while back\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nwe talked about how much we loved you for a half hour\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nthere was this tiny little coffee house\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nthere was never more than\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\n20 people in there\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nand it was run by Joshua Dianado\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nand some of you started putting\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nan actual egg timer\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nand it started going\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nI remember, Jeremy Kramer kicking on a football\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nand it went like 50 yards\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nit was great\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nbut you came out\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nthat resembled material at all\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.520\nin the front row, the entire goddamn time.\n\n01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.760\nThere was a guy that had an outfit on,\n\n01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.720\nand the joke was, it was not a preposterous outfit.\n\n01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.960\nYou just gave this guy the business about his shirts,\n\n01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.840\nand it was a perfectly acceptable shirt,\n\n01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.000\nbut you just gave him shit.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.280\nPerfectly acceptable shirt.\n\n01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.560\nAnd you just stormed this, the stage was like a really,\n\n01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.480\nlike smaller than the meltdown stage,\n\n01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.740\nlike probably by half, a little tiny piece of like wood\n\n01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:08.920\non wooden blocks, and you just stormed around it\n\n01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.400\nlike General Patton, and we were just fucking\n\n01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.080\napoplectic laughing.\n\n01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.960\nAnd also, whether it was that night or another night,\n\n01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.060\nthere was, these two guys came in,\n\n01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.680\nwe heard guitars playing up the street,\n\n01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.120\nand they came down the road and came in,\n\n01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.360\nand it was Jack Black and Kyle Gasson.\n\n01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.200\nNo one had ever heard of him before.\n\n01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.040\nI remember this night, I remember that.\n\n01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.120\nAnd I asked Jack about it, and I said,\n\n01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.200\nI saw you play at the Honest Cafe,\n\n01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.040\nand he goes, that was our first show.\n\n01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.200\nAre you serious?\n\n01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.360\nDo you remember how funny that bit they were doing was?\n\n01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.840\nYeah, they came in again.\n\n01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:35.680\nWow.\n\n01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.120\nLike you came in there, and you absolutely just dominated,\n\n01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.440\nand then, I don't know who was on first, you or them,\n\n01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.840\nbut they came in, they stood back to back,\n\n01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.320\nand strumming the fuck out of these acoustic guitars,\n\n01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.420\nand circled around, and they sang,\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:48.840\nwhat's the song?\n\n01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.560\nThis is not the best song in the world.\n\n01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.080\nTribute, they fucking sang Tribute,\n\n01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.160\nand it was their first fucking show.\n\n01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.080\nAnd Sarah Silverman, I think Paula Tompkins,\n\n01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.720\nthat was maybe one of his first shows in LA,\n\n01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.040\nand he had a shitty, rumpled ass, ill-fitting suit,\n\n01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:07.240\nand now he's like sartorial fucking mastery.\n\n01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.520\nBut that was a magical show.\n\n01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.200\nWe had a great, I mean, that was unbelievable.\n\n01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.600\nThere was all the quote-unquote independent,\n\n01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.840\nin indie comics that came down from the Bay Area.\n\n01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.720\nWere you Bay Area?\n\n01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.240\nNo, I'm from, it's a long, well, not that long a story.\n\n01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.560\nI'm from Queens, and I moved here.\n\n01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.400\nRight.\n\n01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.240\nUh.\n\n01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.840\nDon't get me started.\n\n01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:31.520\nNo, I started here, I came out to be a musician.\n\n01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.920\nI started comedy here just because I would have had\n\n01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.240\nto have left to start in a smaller town,\n\n01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.440\nbut I knew all those guys because I\n\n01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.240\nused to play laughs unlimited in Sacramento.\n\n01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.040\nIt was so magical.\n\n01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:40.960\nIt was an amazing time.\n\n01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.320\nI remember that moment of being there.\n\n01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.920\nFred Belford, our friend, took me there.\n\n01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:45.640\nExactly.\n\n01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.600\nAnd we sat there, and I'm not a stand-up comic,\n\n01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.240\nbut everybody there was either up in Cummins,\n\n01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.400\nor there were people that were like, oh, you\n\n01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.520\nhave to see this guy, this person's from, or this gal.\n\n01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.680\nLike, this is Jeanine Graffo.\n\n01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.320\nThis is Margaret Schell.\n\n01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.000\nThere's these people that they've heard of.\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.080\nEverything in there was so fucking magical,\n\n01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.320\nand the host was kind of at Looney Tins.\n\n01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320\nHe really was crazy.\n\n01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.160\nBut there was you and Jeremy Kramer, and Harlan Williams,\n\n01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.480\nand fucking, it was so goddamn.\n\n01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.840\nAnd Bob Odenkirk's stand-up.\n\n01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.600\nAmazing stand-up.\n\n01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.040\nThat was a magical time, and then I told them a little bit.\n\n01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.040\nYou did a show called Hacks, Hacks, Hacks.\n\n01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.960\nYou give me a smile like, hello.\n\n01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:25.040\nYou and I both go, Bob Odenkirk's full of shit.\n\n01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.000\nAnyway, anyway, there was that magical moment\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.440\nwhen you go like, oh, I'm allowed to like stand-up again,\n\n01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.480\nbecause stand-up had this giant explosion in the 80s\n\n01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:36.360\nwhere everybody that thought they were mildly entertaining\n\n01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.120\nstood in front of a brick wall and bummed you the fuck out.\n\n01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.560\nBut you can't knock that generation.\n\n01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.040\nI mean, it became very strange.\n\n01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.880\nIt was like Judy Tenuta and our friend Bobcat Goldthwaite,\n\n01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.200\nand there was the character comedy started to happen.\n\n01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.240\nIt was like you really, there was this huge pressure\n\n01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:57.160\non comedians to come out, and it was like star search.\n\n01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.840\nYou've got to fucking like, what's your deal?\n\n01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.320\nAre you the guy with the penis for a head,\n\n01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.040\nor are you the guy with dice on his neck,\n\n01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.480\nor is your name Jacques Van Schlock and Doc?\n\n01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.680\nAnd then the 90s, it was like this, it was the grunge thing.\n\n01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.120\nIt was like the, but you transcend all of that\n\n01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.880\nbecause you don't wear flannel and never have.\n\n01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:25.880\nI had, I wore acid washed jackets in the late 80s.\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.120\nIt's the most oppressive thing.\n\n01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.440\nBut I will say one thing right now.\n\n01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.560\nI think right now is an amazing time period\n\n01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.480\nfor comedy right now.\n\n01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:35.400\nI really do, because people are actually going out.\n\n01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.440\nYou guys are fans of right now.\n\n01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.200\nBut like, I love right now.\n\n01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.400\nAddomium, Hannibal Burris, there's so many amazing,\n\n01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.240\nit's pretty cool.\n\n01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:44.080\nWho are you naming?\n\n01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.400\nJames Adomian.\n\n01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.600\nOh yeah, he was just, he was on last week.\n\n01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.440\nSo cool.\n\n01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.480\nHe came on and did a Bernie Sanders impression\n\n01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.600\nfor three hours, it was great.\n\n01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.440\nYeah, it was amazing.\n\n01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.960\nYou know Hannibal Burris, I mean there's just so many names,\n\n01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.040\nand people like Todd Glass,\n\n01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.360\nit was so, it was always hilarious.\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.080\nAnd it's just amazing, I don't know, it's just like.\n\n01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.960\nLet's not forget Jeff Dunham.\n\n01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.600\nHe's great.\n\n01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.040\nHe's not racist, the puppets racist.\n\n01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.480\nCarlos Mincia is really hitting a stride right now.\n\n01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.320\nYes.\n\n01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.400\nIs DeMorge Brown out there?\n\n01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.240\nDeMorge, you with us?\n\n01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.680\nI don't think I usually see him lingering.\n\n01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.040\nNo DeMorge tonight.\n\n01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:24.880\nShould we just do a very-\n\n01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.680\nIf DeMorge is listening, usually I see you lingering.\n\n01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.640\nWhy don't we be just, I don't know if that's a note.\n\n01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.680\nDan, Spencer, let me know what you think.\n\n01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.880\nWe're running a little bit late here.\n\n01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.200\nYeah, we always start late too.\n\n01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:36.640\nWhy don't we, yeah.\n\n01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.800\nBut let's maybe just play a very small lean and mean\n\n01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.120\nshadow run with just the three of us.\n\n01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.280\nMaybe you want to bring somebody else up\n\n01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:45.200\nto play another character.\n\n01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.040\nDoes that muddy the waters?\n\n01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.920\nI can play a very old man.\n\n01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.760\nWell, I think we should, in honor of Mad Max Fury Road,\n\n01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.160\nwe should get a non-sexualized strong female lead\n\n01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.600\nto come up and play Erin McGathy's character.\n\n01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.040\nPreferably someone with a robot arm.\n\n01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.680\nDo we have a strong female lead to play?\n\n01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.800\nHannah, the seamstress?\n\n01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.640\nOh yeah, Hannah, the seamstress.\n\n01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.480\nBecause she's earned it.\n\n01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.160\nHannah, the seamstress.\n\n01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.680\nShe's earned it by sewing.\n\n01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.000\nThink, Hannah, by the way,\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.560\nthat's no small favor you did for me.\n\n01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.880\nI really appreciate you putting the button\n\n01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.880\nback on my thing.\n\n01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.720\nOh, it's okay.\n\n01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.960\nI learned how to sew recently.\n\n01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.320\nI mean, I can do it too,\n\n01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.920\nbut I know I've sewn many buttons.\n\n01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.160\nI've ripped many buttons off.\n\n01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.000\nI can do this.\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.040\nI love to sew, and I do it quite often,\n\n01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:37.560\nbut I appreciate you doing that for me.\n\n01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.440\nAll right, Kindler, so Hannah,\n\n01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.800\nhave you seen the show before?\n\n01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.800\nYou gotta eat the mic.\n\n01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.960\nEat that mic, baby.\n\n01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.800\nEat the mic.\n\n01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.640\nI had to quit.\n\n01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.800\nIt's not how I'm knee-directional.\n\n01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.640\nAnd when I said baby,\n\n01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.480\nI meant baby in the Sammy Davis Junior way\n\n01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.760\nthat's omni-gender.\n\n01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.080\nLike, I didn't mean like baby.\n\n01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.480\nI didn't even hear the baby.\n\n01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.120\nOh, okay, good.\n\n01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.080\nAnd I didn't even say it.\n\n01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.800\nThat's how feminist I am.\n\n01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.160\nWhen I called you a skirt,\n\n01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.960\nI meant it in the...\n\n01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.840\nEat that mic, sugar.\n\n01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.960\nI call everyone sugar.\n\n01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.720\nLike a throwback, throwback.\n\n01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.960\nEveryone's sweet to me.\n\n01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.640\nHe's got two of them.\n\n01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.680\nI got two of them now.\n\n01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.320\nYeah, so in this Manila folder,\n\n01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.880\nthere's like a piece of paper\n\n01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.280\nwith a bunch of statistics on it.\n\n01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.840\nOkay, numbers and keywords.\n\n01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.080\nThis is your character.\n\n01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.240\nIt's as if you've been dropped\n\n01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.160\ninto the world's most academically intense\n\n01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.240\nmurder mystery night.\n\n01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.920\nYou won't, you do not need to know any of this stuff.\n\n01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.760\nWho are you?\n\n01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.600\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.440\nYou probably don't even know that.\n\n01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.360\nOh, I'm Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.200\nOh.\n\n01:36:46.760 -->

O'Donnell.\n\n01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.800\nOkay, so you're Erin's character.\n\n01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.200\nYou've never heard us play the game, Hannah.\n\n01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.280\nSo you said, okay.\n\n01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.720\nSo she's like a, boy.\n\n01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:09.080\nShe's our negotiator.\n\n01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.160\nLike she's kind of our face man.\n\n01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.000\nShe makes the deals and she's got power\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.840\nover other people's minds.\n\n01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.320\nShe's super charming, very

nothing to do with Kumail.\n\n01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.240\nWell, Kumail often plays him.\n\n01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.800\nOh, very often.\n\n01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.480\nSo why did you say Kumail then?\n\n01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.320\nWho's the doctor's name?\n\n01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.160\nKumail played him once, twice?\n\n01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.320\nLike a couple, like a couple times.\n\n01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.160\nOh yeah, Kumail, like yeah.\n\n01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.760\nYes, Andy, the important thing is don't get too bogged down\n\n01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.720\ninto statistics and the numbers and things like that.\n\n01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.000\nLike your weapons are in there and you're...\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:47.840\nI got

01:38:03.560\nThat's how you do it.\n\n01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.000\nAndy, we're basically like kind of a cyberpunk A team\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.680\nout doing capers and stuff like that\n\n01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.160\nfor the underworld in the future.\n\n01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.440\nAnd we're active players in a narrative\n\n01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.680\nthat he's in charge of.\n\n01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.400\nIf he says something happens, it happens.\n\n01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.400\nHe tells us where we are and we tell him\n\n01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.080\nwhat we want to do next when he asks us, basically.\n\n01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.760\nAll right, Spencer, he tells us the results\n\n01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.480\nbased on systems that he understands and cheats about.\n\n01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.880\nIt's like improvising.\n\n01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.440\nWe have to, we're, yes, you're, we're, yes, ending it.\n\n01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.280\nGood,

terrible pain.\n\n01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.760\nNo, no, doctor, do no harm.\n\n01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.240\nFirst, do no harm.\n\n01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.200\nI will, uh, just a moderate amount of pain.\n\n01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.040\nOK, fair enough.\n\n01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.400\nDo we have a location for the MindPlus Limited?\n\n01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.440\nYeah, you have an address on the map.\n\n01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.520\nI call an Uber.\n\n01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.560\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.240\nIt arrives outside.\n\n01:40:36.240

01:40:54.920\nOh, is it because I have exceptional charisma?\n\n01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.560\nYeah, that's the reason.\n\n01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.280\nIt's not because I'm a woman, right?\n\n01:40:59.280 --> 01:40:59.680\nNo.\n\n01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.560\nNo, God, no.\n\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.240\nNo, have you seen Mad Max?\n\n01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240\nNo, no.\n\n01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:13.720\nI can not, the Uber driver is telling me\n\n01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.680\nthat he has no place to store my mystic armor.\n\n01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:19.440\nWhat will I do?\n\n01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.760\nWhat shall I do?\n\n01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.120\nI certainly hope this voice stops.\n\n01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:29.120\nNo.\n\n01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:36.160\nWoman, woman, does not compute.\n\n01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.200\nMaybe you should just wear the mystic armor.\n\n01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.240\nOh, here's the mystic armor.\n\n01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:45.040\nOh, it's really got it back from the cleaner.\n\n01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.320\nAll right, you guys, remember, I think we found out\n\n01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.240\nthat there was lots of sensors, vibration sensors,\n\n01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.440\nand all sorts of security and stuff like that\n\n01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.120\nwhen we get in there.\n\n01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:52.720\nAt this place?\n\n01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.880\nYeah.\n\n01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.680\nRight?\n\n01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.920\nAre you James Johnson?\n\n01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:56.840\nNo, I'm Eve Libertine.\n\n01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.600\nI'm an elf magician.\n\n01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.520\nVery, very, to talk very matter-of-factly.\n\n01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.320\nWell, that's all, it's just business.\n\n01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:10.200\nI thought acting involved making a choice.\n\n01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:10.760\nThat's good, yeah.\n\n01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.000\nUsually, my guy talks like this, yeah.\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.720\nWell, then I shall be the counterpoint with my Stan Bataan.\n\n01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:28.800\nI agree with my chameleon suit, all right.\n\n01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.040\nThank you, mumble-core.\n\n01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:43.960\nI send out a, I summon a butterfly that's\n\n01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.560\ngoing to fly out ahead of us and just\n\n01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.160\ngoing to go into the door and probably not trip any sensors\n\n01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.600\nto fly around and give us some recon inside this Mind\n\n01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.320\nPlus Limited.\n\n01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.560\nAll right.\n\n01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.520\nYou summon a butterfly, but it takes substantial drain.\n\n01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.720\nYou feel your resources being drained\n\n01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.880\nas you cast this magic from your body,\n\n01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.480\nbut there it is, a butterfly.\n\n01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.800\nButterfly, are we close to the Mind Plus Limited?\n\n01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:11.080\nOh, yeah, you're close.\n\n01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:12.680\nYou're about five minutes off.\n\n01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.240\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.\n\n01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.640\nAll right, we're here.\n\n01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.120\nDid that, why did I think it was a hospital?\n\n01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:20.720\nIt is a hospital.\n\n01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:21.440\nOK, OK.\n\n01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.280\nKeep it down, you circle jerks.\n\n01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.760\nThey'll find out that we're here.\n\n01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.280\nI just wanted to use circle jerks.\n\n01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:37.760\nAll right, so I tell the butterfly to fly in and get\n\n01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.000\nthe lay of the land and find out, just give us some recon.\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.960\nAll right, it does so.\n\n01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:45.160\nDo you have to talk to the butterfly to do that?\n\n01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.280\nI have a spiritual mental link to it, but I mean,\n\n01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.600\nif I do, it would be in a.\n\n01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.680\nSo we just see you, like.\n\n01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.320\nWhen I summon a butterfly, of course,\n\n01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.160\nI hold my hands up in my Comanche War Club in the air,\n\n01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.000\nand I am overcome with a blue glow.\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.560\nAnd then out of my butt, a butterfly goes, pfft.\n\n01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:07.440\nIt's a butterfly.\n\n01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.040\nWhat?\n\n01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.560\nAha!\n\n01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.280\nDoes it go through stuff?\n\n01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.760\nYeah, it's a spirit.\n\n01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.200\nIt can dematerialize.\n\n01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:19.920\nOK.\n\n01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.320\nI like heart.\n\n01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:22.840\nArt?\n\n01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.240\nThey did a song about the butterfly.\n\n01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:24.720\nOh, heart.\n\n01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.200\nOK, so guys, I have a butterfly that's going in there\n\n01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.600\nto fly around and get us some recon.\n\n01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:32.720\nIt does that.\n\n01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.480\nAnd then returns.\n\n01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.920\nButterfly, what did you learn?\n\n01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.200\nI learned it's a hospital in there.\n\n01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.640\nThey got a waiting room.\n\n01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.520\nThey got multiple floors.\n\n01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.560\nGreat butterfly, nice going.\n\n01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.280\nI could have done that on my own.\n\n01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.120\nVarious surgical operations.\n\n01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:56.440\nDid you see any defenses, anything we have to worry about?\n\n01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.560\nOh, I saw some, you know, cameras and guards.\n\n01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.080\nOK.\n\n01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.240\nThey have a strange accent for a butterfly.\n\n01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.520\nSpencer, how much drain did I take on that?\n\n01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.680\nThree boxes of non-lethal.\n\n01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.960\nOh, boy.\n\n01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.840\nI think, you know, what are we looking for?\n\n01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.400\nWe're looking for, like, data.\n\n01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.680\nWe're going to find their data room.\n\n01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.200\nRight.\n\n01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.560\nDoes your butterfly see any data rooms?\n\n01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.440\nButterfly, did you see a data room?\n\n01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:25.760\nI saw no data room.\n\n01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.760\nThere was some sort of security room towards the top,\n\n01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.920\nbut that just, you know, had cameras and a chair.\n\n01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.440\nOK.\n\n01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.840\nI think that's where we want to go.\n\n01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.320\nI think we send Mercy and Ferris just, like,\n\n01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:40.560\nlet's just do this like a straight, like, you know,\n\n01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.160\nlet her work her charm.\n\n01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.400\nI'll grapple up under the roof and find a vent.\n\n01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:48.200\nYou use your feminine wiles.\n\n01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.480\nOK.\n\n01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.760\nI got this.\n\n01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.600\nI have a key card copier, so I can maybe\n\n01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.560\nmake a copy of the keys that maybe the guard has.\n\n01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.160\nOh, if you can pinch one, yeah.\n\n01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.640\nSee if I can get it with my exceptional charisma.\n\n01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.760\nHoly shit.\n\n01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.040\nNice work.\n\n01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.800\nMaybe you can come in.\n\n01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.840\nOK, I'm probably, I'm a stealthy guy,\n\n01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.520\nso I'll fake a seizure or something,\n\n01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.280\nand you bring me in like a person.\n\n01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.400\nI'll use my exceptional charisma, and you can sneak in.\n\n01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.480\nAnd I'll try to see if I can, like, pinch a card.\n\n01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.040\nHere, take my card copier, and so you can copy the card.\n\n01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.080\nI'll make the sound effects.\n\n01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.680\nHe's got the card copier now.\n\n01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:29.920\nI will cast a spell.\n\n01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.160\nI will cast a spell.\n\n01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.720\nThe spell will be the physical barrier.\n\n01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:43.760\nI will create a dome and or wall of magical energy\n\n01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.880\nthat will keep us invisible, or something.\n\n01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:54.600\nIf I'm invisible, I can't use my exceptional charisma.\n\n01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.200\nOh, don't be funnier than me.\n\n01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:03.200\nI'm enraged.\n\n01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.440\nMaybe you could come along and use your doctor expertise\n\n01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.160\nto make it seem more legitimate than I am.\n\n01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:13.800\nCall me.\n\n01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.600\nYou should have doctor credentials on it.\n\n01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.880\nIf you guys go in together and you're faking a seizure,\n\n01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.120\nthis will all look legit.\n\n01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.640\nI'm a doctor, Jim, not an opposite profession.\n\n01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.240\nCall me bones.\n\n01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.800\nI'm going to astrally project inside from outside,\n\n01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.840\nlike in a safe place.\n\n01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.240\nI'm going to astrally project inside so I can kind of\n\n01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:32.200\nkeep an eye out.\n\n01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.040\nAll right.\n\n01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.480\nTry to get me, well, I'll try to, I mean,\n\n01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.200\nmy goal is to get near a security guard,\n\n01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.480\nbecause we'll see if I can pickpocket a car.\n\n01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.160\nI'm going to scream about my moderate egg allergy,\n\n01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.440\nand I think that'll make enough of a distraction.\n\n01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.480\nOh, you're going to scream about.\n\n01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.280\nYeah, but with my charisma, people will come and help.\n\n01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:52.600\nWait, no, no, no, I thought you were helping him\n\n01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.400\npretend to be sick.\n\n01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.640\nI thought, oh, you're pretending to be sick.\n\n01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.200\nI thought you were speaking.\n\n01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.240\nDo you want to pretend to be sick?\n\n01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.880\nI thought I was going to distract them\n\n01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.040\nwhile you got the key.\n\n01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.080\nRight, by.\n\n01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.120\nI'll give you a doctor's note.\n\n01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.920\nOK, how about this?\n\n01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.160\nDoctor Friend.\n\n01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.720\nDoctor Friend, take Mercy in.\n\n01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.760\nYes.\n\n01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.080\nSay she's got an egg allergy.\n\n01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.360\nShe's having an anaphylactic shock.\n\n01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.560\nShe's the charming one, though.\n\n01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.120\nOh, right, she has an anaphylactic shock.\n\n01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.960\nThen I'll just show my boobs and be charming.\n\n01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:16.400\nMe too.\n\n01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.000\nMe too.\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.320\nOK, we got this.\n\n01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.320\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.200\nToo real.\n\n01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.400\nYou're sick, too.\n\n01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.920\nOh, yeah, no, I say, Mercy, you go and use your charm.\n\n01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.240\nBring him in.\n\n01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.600\nNightblade, you pretend to be sick.\n\n01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.920\nDoctor Friend, you're going to be there to make it all look\n\n01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.680\nlegit.\n\n01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.120\nOK.\n\n01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:36.080\nI believe that everything I look legitimate.\n\n01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.160\nThe roof has a whooping cough.\n\n01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.280\nThat's good.\n\n01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.680\nAll right, all right, let's do it.\n\n01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.160\nYes.\n\n01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:42.680\nHere we go.\n\n01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:43.480\nWe're not doing it?\n\n01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.080\nWe're starting this?\n\n01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:44.480\nWe're going.\n\n01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:45.080\nWe're going in.\n\n01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:45.560\nHere we go.\n\n01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.560\nWe're going in.\n\n01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.560\nHelp.\n\n01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.400\nHelp, my friend is sick.\n\n01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.680\nHe's got a seizure.\n\n01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.480\nIt is true.\n\n01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.040\nI have examined him.\n\n01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.480\nI am Doctor Friend.\n\n01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.920\nIt is true.\n\n01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.880\nI am exceptionally charismatic.\n\n01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.280\nYou should listen to us.\n\n01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.360\nOpen your mouth and say, ah.\n\n01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.160\nHe already took his temperature.\n\n01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.520\nIt was really high.\n\n01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.760\nWait, well, I didn't hear you guys.\n\n01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.440\nAren't you still in the car, though?\n\n01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.440\nNo, I got, I got.\n\n01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.440\nWe left it.\n\n01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.440\nObviously we're gone.\n\n01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440\nWe left it.\n\n01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.920\nAll right, good check rehearsal, guys.\n\n01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.920\nAll right.\n\n01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.920\nGuys, here we go.\n\n01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:23.440\nWe opened it two nights.\n\n01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:23.920\nAll right.\n\n01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.480\nI must check your boobs with my stethoscope.\n\n01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.480\nI have to check your boobs with my stethoscope.\n\n01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.480\nI must check your boobs with my stethoscope.\n\n01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.480\nI forgot the stethoscope.\n\n01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480\nAll right.\n\n01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480\nLet's go.\n\n01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.480\nLet's go in and try it.\n\n01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.480\nHere we go.\n\n01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.480\nWe're going to go in through the front door.\n\n01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.480\nOkay.\n\n01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.480\nThis is what we're doing.\n\n01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.480\nAll right.\n\n01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.480\nOne, two, three.\n\n01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.480\nBreak.\n\n01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.480\nHelp.\n\n01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.480\nHelp.\n\n01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480\nMy friend is having a seizure.\n\n01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.480\nAnd I am exceptionally charismatic.\n\n01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.480\nYes.\n\n01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480\nHey.\n\n01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480\nShe's a dish.\n\n01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.480\nAll right.\n\n01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480\nLet us in.\n\n01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.480\nHe's a doctor.\n\n01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:00.480\nHe's a doctor.\n\n01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:01.480\nWe mean no harm.\n\n01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.480\nI can show you my Hippocratic Oat.\n\n01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:07.480\nHe needs access to doctor stuff.\n\n01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.480\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:09.480\nI'm having a seizure.\n\n01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:10.480\nOh, he's having a seizure.\n\n01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.480\nLook at this man.\n\n01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.480\nHe has the least convincing case of epilepsy I've ever seen in my life.\n\n01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.480\nI don't want to be offensive.\n\n01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.480\nI don't want to nail it.\n\n01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:27.480\nHe has dog panting syndrome.\n\n01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:31.480\nEven though I'm actually projecting, I turn to one of the security cameras and do a camera\n\n01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.480\ntake and go, yeah, look at these idiots.\n\n01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.480\nOkay.\n\n01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:45.480\nSo you're doing all these things and the receptionist person in the waiting area is extremely alarmed.\n\n01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.480\nIt's like, is there a doctor?\n\n01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:48.480\nOh, we need help.\n\n01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.480\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.480\nNot yet, right?\n\n01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:51.480\nNo, no.\n\n01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.480\nThis is exactly what we need.\n\n01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.480\nI'm a doctor.\n\n01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.480\nI can help.\n\n01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:01.480\nWell, would I not be a doctor if I said I was?\n\n01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.480\nI don't really follow the line of questioning.\n\n01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:10.480\nI just can't say, you just can't walk around saying you're a doctor.\n\n01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.480\nThat's a fair point.\n\n01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:19.480\nWell, that's perfect because, I mean, this is primarily for transplantation of cyberlimbs.\n\n01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.480\nWe don't really deal with seizures.\n\n01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.480\nThis man is dying.\n\n01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.480\nI show him.\n\n01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.480\nComedically.\n\n01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.480\nHey, you.\n\n01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.480\nI show him my.\n\n01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.480\nWell, you're the doctor.\n\n01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:30.480\nWhat should we do?\n\n01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480\nMy cyber arm.\n\n01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.480\nI point at my cyber arm and I kind of twitch it because I have a cyber arm.\n\n01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.480\nI must take him to surgery immediately.\n\n01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:42.480\nAnd I make the hatch on my arm that has my gun in it like a, you know, twitch or something\n\n01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.480\nto indicate like cyber twitching.\n\n01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.480\nIt's a cyber switch.\n\n01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.480\nCyber lepsi.\n\n01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.480\nRight.\n\n01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.480\nHe has cyber lepsi.\n\n01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:54.480\nThat's not a gun.\n\n01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.480\nDon't worry.\n\n01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:56.480\nAll right.\n\n01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:01.480\nThat's the most horrible case of cyber lepsi I've seen in quite some time.\n\n01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.480\nAre you, are you the receptionist?\n\n01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.480\nWhat?\n\n01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.480\nAre you the receptionist?\n\n01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.480\nYeah.\n\n01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:11.480\nYou are really not, not good at your job.\n\n01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.480\nHow'd you get this job?\n\n01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:14.480\nObamacare?\n\n01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.480\nAm I right people?\n\n01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.480\nAm I wrong?\n\n01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.480\nThank you.\n\n01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:27.480\nWell, we need to get you guys, yeah, to some sort of room probably.\n\n01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.480\nYes.\n\n01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.480\nExactly my thoughts.\n\n01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.480\nGuards.\n\n01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480\nGuards.\n\n01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.480\nSix guards appear.\n\n01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:37.480\nTake them toward C. Beta.\n\n01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:40.480\nAny of these guards visibly have any credentials on them?\n\n01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.480\nLike that kind of thing.\n\n01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480\nThey have guard credentials.\n\n01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.480\nLike on their belts or what's the deal?\n\n01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:51.480\nIt's part of their, it's part of their bulletproof vest is, is like a, a number that's projecting\n\n01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.480\na sort of identification hologram.\n\n01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.480\nHmm.\n\n01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.480\nDoes it, I mean, if I were to ask you, how do I steal that?\n\n01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:03.480\nYou take the, take the breast thing.\n\n01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480\nTake the whole vest?\n\n01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480\nYeah.\n\n01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480\nThe vest.\n\n01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.480\nThat's what it is.\n\n01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480\nOh, okay.\n\n01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480\nOkay.\n\n01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:19.480\nMany epileptics sing a cartoon like way.\n\n01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:25.480\nSparrows from Capistrano.\n\n01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.480\nYou're right.\n\n01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.480\nNon-copyright.\n\n01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:28.480\nQuick, quick.\n\n01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.480\nSomeone who knows what we're doing.\n\n01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.480\nJump in.\n\n01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.480\nYou guys are doing great.\n\n01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.480\nWhere are we going?\n\n01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.480\nThey're taking you to the room ward C or whatever.\n\n01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:37.480\nYou're in the room now.\n\n01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.480\nYou've arrived.\n\n01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:44.480\nTwo of the guards stand side, but the rest go on their merry way out the door.\n\n01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.480\nI've never seen anybody go on a merry way.\n\n01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.480\nAll right.\n\n01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:54.480\nWell, this is the next thing I'm going to attempt and it's going to get sloppy.\n\n01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.480\nI'm going to, I'm going to stun as many of them as I can.\n\n01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:02.480\nI'm going to stun one of them and hope the other two get the hint.\n\n01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.480\nI mean, the other two of my friends.\n\n01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:07.480\nCan I materialize from my astral projection?\n\n01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.480\nDo I have to walk in?\n\n01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.480\nWell, no, you have to walk in.\n\n01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.480\nOkay.\n\n01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.480\nYou're, yeah.\n\n01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480\nI'm just kidding.\n\n01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:18.480\nI mean, you're probably still, your corporeal body is probably still in the Uber, I think.\n\n01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480\nYeah.\n\n01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.480\nRight.\n\n01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480\nOkay.\n\n01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480\nWhich is a good thing.\n\n01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480\nWe should have gone with lift.\n\n01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480\nSorry.\n\n01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480\nI always panic.\n\n01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.480\nAll right.\n\n01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.480\nTake it.\n\n01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.480\nTake it.\n\n01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.480\nI'm going to, I'm going to stun baton one.\n\n01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480\nAll right.\n\n01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.480\nYou go in for the stun baton.\n\n01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480\nIt works.\n\n01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.480\nYou hit the guard right in the unprotected nape of his neck.\n\n01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:45.480\nThat's not where you, some other part of his neck.\n\n01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:51.480\nHe, he goes down twitching and shocking like he has cyber lepsy.\n\n01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.480\nThe other guard draws his pistol.\n\n01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.480\nIt's just a pistol though.\n\n01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:03.480\nThat's when I use my monocle, my monocle somehow comes into play.\n\n01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.480\nYou have a monocle?\n\n01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.480\nI certainly do.\n\n01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.480\nAnd three flashbangs.\n\n01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.480\nYour monocle has three flashbangs?\n\n01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.480\nNo.\n\n01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.480\nSeparate item.\n\n01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.480\nDo you have a weapon you could use on him?\n\n01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480\nYes.\n\n01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.480\nTo stun him or knock him out?\n\n01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:17.480\nThank you for reminding me.\n\n01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.480\nYes.\n\n01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.480\nThrow the tear gas, throw three tear gas grenades.\n\n01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.480\nAre you?\n\n01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.480\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.480\nYou guys, you're all in the room together.\n\n01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:36.480\nWe're all going, if one of us goes, we all go.\n\n01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.480\nTear gas pours into the room.\n\n01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.480\nNo!\n\n01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:45.480\nAh, here, here's the antidote, the antidote.\n\n01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:49.480\nIt will help the, all of the, you recover from the poisoning.\n\n01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:51.480\nI don't know if that's on your sheet there though.\n\n01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480\nAntidote.\n\n01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.480\nWhy is it?\n\n01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.480\nHelps target recover from poisoning.\n\n01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.480\nOh, that's a spell.\n\n01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:56.480\nOkay.\n\n01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.480\nOh, okay, forget that then.\n\n01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.480\nDo you want to cast it?\n\n01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.480\nHey, is that a spell he can cast that can work just on his friends?\n\n01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.480\nEveryone falls to the floor choking and crying.\n\n01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.480\nI have medicine.\n\n01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.480\nI will use medicine.\n\n01:56:06.480 -->

the use of his eyes, his cyber eyes.\n\n01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:49.480\nHe wasn't really afflicted, I guess.\n\n01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:52.480\nWell, tear gas affects more than eyes.\n\n01:57:52.480 -->
