00:00.000 --> 00:29.840
Hello everybody, my name is Jeff V. Davis, and I'm back in Harmontown.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.560
From Burbank, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:35.560 --> 00:45.760
Oh yeah, hello everybody, from beautiful uptown Burbank, Harmontown is once again in session.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
I'm happy to be back.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
My name is Jeff, your Comptroller.

00:47.760 --> 00:58.680
Let's give it up for the Game Master, ex-terroritinaire, Spencer Crittenden.

00:58.680 --> 01:03.840
He's lost a little bit of weight, but it doesn't mean he's lost his powers.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.840
Let's hear it for the Mayor of Harmontown, Daniel Harmon.

01:08.840 --> 01:09.840
Yo.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840

01:16.840 --> 01:17.840

01:17.840 --> 01:18.840

01:18.840 --> 01:19.840

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840

01:20.840 --> 01:21.840

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840

01:33.840 --> 01:34.840

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840

01:35.840 --> 01:36.840

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
Yo.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
Yo.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
Yo.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
Yo.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
Yo.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
Yo.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
Yo.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
Yo.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
Yo.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Yo.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.840
Yo.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.840
Yo.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
Yo.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.840
Yo.

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
Yo.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.840
Yo.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.840
Yo.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
Yo.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.400
slow rappers like a pimple.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.600
I squeeze them from the outside to the center,

01:58.600 --> 02:00.200
and when I go back inside,

02:00.200 --> 02:02.320
I find them more bent-er than ever.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.920
They're bent in half in sideways,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.320
and they say, why'd you do that?

02:05.320 --> 02:07.520
You gave me a ride.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.360
Dates.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.040
Over the years, we have never backed off

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
on the quality of the process.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.080
Just listen to Professor Kensington,

02:14.080 --> 02:17.920
who I sampled at my rap classes.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.920
Now, fast rapper, you don't seem to be rapping

02:19.920 --> 02:21.480
particularly fast so far.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.720
Are you gearing up to a really fast rap?

02:24.720 --> 02:26.040
I'm glad you asked that.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.920
I'm going to answer it right now.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.760
I'm a slave to the beat I'm provided.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.760
I fucked your mama so hard it was her pussy that I ride it.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.280
And the beat sometimes drops out,

02:36.280 --> 02:39.320
but that puts emphasis on what I'm about to shout.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.760
I just got to go with the beat that I know.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.120
I'm a slave to the beat.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.000
It's how I flow.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.840
When the beat comes out, that's what I do.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.880
It comes from my head to my mouth and then my shoe.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.240
In my shoe, the beat goes to my toe.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.920
After it goes from my toe, it goes, I don't know.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.680
That's no longer my problem after it leaves my foot.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.040
It goes into a chimney and maybe dies in soot,

03:00.040 --> 03:02.320
like Santa Claus, coming from the North Pole.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.360
Fucked your mama so hard, she's got an extra hole.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.000
It's a USB port, it charges my phone.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.920
I fucked your mama, but it was consensual.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.320
Now she's alone.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.800
She broke it off with me.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.760
I fucked your mama, then I took a pee.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.240
This is the bridge.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.080
Fast rapper.

03:20.080 --> 03:20.920
Can I ask you a question?

03:20.920 --> 03:21.760
Fast rapper?

03:21.760 --> 03:22.600
Of course.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.480
I'm always, Fast Rapper is famous for his accessibility.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.840
Your rhymes are so delicious.

03:28.840 --> 03:29.880
They're almost yummy.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.000
Is it true that you rap faster when you lift up your shirt

03:32.000 --> 03:33.040
and show us your tummy?

03:34.800 --> 03:35.640
Yes.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.520
Fast rapper, faster rapping with my tummy.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.760
Gonna fat rap so fast it's gonna be extra yummy.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.520
Gonna eat some candy down here and I'm looking fat

03:44.520 --> 03:46.080
and it makes showing my stomach.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
And what do you think about that?

03:47.080 --> 03:49.560
You're treating me like a chunk on the goonies.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.520
I don't like it.

03:50.520 --> 03:51.760
I'm not...

03:51.760 --> 03:57.560
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.400
You can put your shirt back down.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.240
You can put your shirt back down.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.080
It's okay.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.680
What was his name?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.080
Actor.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.720
A famous child actor.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.520
Probably the year we have membered back

04:11.520 --> 04:13.120
to us on the call of the Fod.

04:13.120 --> 04:13.960
Runi.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.040
Our ingredients.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.600
If you were 599, six back.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.160
He was a, he played an Asian fella

04:19.160 --> 04:20.800
in the breakfast at Tiffany's.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.640
Short round.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.560
Oh, Mickey Rooney.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.060
Mickey.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.000
Mickey.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.320
All right.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.120
Well, that was a good wrap.

04:25.120 --> 04:25.640
That was a good wrap.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.680
All right, as long as we can do to keep the energy up

04:27.680 --> 04:28.640
when we start the show.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.920
That's what's important.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.400
Oh, boy.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.000
Good to see you, Dan.

04:31.000 --> 04:31.520
Happy New Year.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.320
Happy New Year, Spencer.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.360
I haven't seen you guys in a long time.

04:33.360 --> 04:33.800
Yeah.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.880
Where have you been, Jeff?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.440
I was in India, California.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.520
No, India, Asia.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.080
India near East Asia.

04:39.080 --> 04:39.920
India, California.

04:39.920 --> 04:40.360
India?

04:40.360 --> 04:43.760
No, I was in India with church, and we had a big time.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.800
Sometimes I get excited when we take these long breaks,

04:45.800 --> 04:46.640
because I'm like, oh, man, we're

04:46.640 --> 04:48.480
going to have so much to talk about, but then we

04:48.480 --> 04:51.600
can go so long that we have nothing to talk about.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.240
Oh, yeah.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.480
We have plenty to talk about.

04:53.480 --> 04:53.980
We got.

04:53.980 --> 04:55.720
I can't really remember anything.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.720
Your house got run into by a drunk driver.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.200
There you go.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.760
And you're living in a hotel now, like a fancy person.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.720
Yeah, a dude ran an Acura into my garage at about 40 miles

05:05.720 --> 05:07.240
an hour, as far as I could tell.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.120
More like an inaccurate.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.680
That was Dan's joke.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.440
I stole Dan's joke, but for that first two seconds,

05:15.440 --> 05:16.800
you thought I was a fucking genius.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.480
It depends on what he was trying to do.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.560
It might be the most accurate in the world

05:20.560 --> 05:24.320
if he was trying to take out my garage.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.800
But I don't think so.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.440
Because you live right at the top of a hill,

05:27.440 --> 05:29.840
which is like a skateboard ramp that you just

05:29.840 --> 05:32.840
drive straight into your garage, and that guy did it.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.640
Yeah, I think he was trying.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.360
I looked at my security cameras, because I'm Batman,

05:38.360 --> 05:41.600
and they don't really get down that far that you could actually

05:41.600 --> 05:45.480
see what's going on, but you see headlights coming up.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.640
One of the cameras, there's a camera on the wall

05:47.640 --> 05:48.440
that he took out.

05:48.440 --> 05:53.840
So you know what time he hit, because the wall just,

05:53.840 --> 05:56.680
the camera just changes position.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.320
And then one of the cameras, you can see headlights

06:00.320 --> 06:03.760
ripping up the street, and then they just disappear.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.120
And then there's footage of one dude,

06:05.120 --> 06:06.440
the passenger, just boning out.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.000
He just gets out of the car and leaves his friend there to die.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.200
Passenger, driver, I don't know.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.720
The cops made it clear that they did not

06:13.720 --> 06:17.840
know whether the guy that ran was the driver or a passenger,

06:17.840 --> 06:21.440
which confirms the fact that the cops were not chasing

06:21.440 --> 06:24.400
these guys, or at least they were not on their tail.

06:24.400 --> 06:30.040
Because Cody and I heard a boom that sounded to us

06:30.040 --> 06:34.240
like somebody was kicking the back door of the house.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.000
And I went downstairs, and I went out

06:36.000 --> 06:39.480
back with my police dog Harvey and let him run around

06:39.480 --> 06:40.160
the backyard.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.720
And I was like, there's nobody out here.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.440
I wonder what that big boom was.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.160
Somebody kicking our door.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.440
And then went to the front of the house,

06:48.440 --> 06:54.960
and there were cherries flying, kind of illuminating

06:54.960 --> 06:56.960
the dark living room.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.240
And down by my garage, there were six squad cars

07:01.240 --> 07:05.000
in the street with the silhouettes of police,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.480
all with their guns drawn and shouting,

07:07.480 --> 07:09.560
which you've heard a million times in movies,

07:09.560 --> 07:12.200
but I've never heard in real life.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.000
Just like, get out of there.

07:14.000 --> 07:14.880
Get out of here.

07:14.880 --> 07:15.760
Get out.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.400
Just everybody shouting, different shit at the same time.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.920
Get out of the car.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.240
Get on the ground.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.520
Hands in the air.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.240
Don't move.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.800
It's no wonder that a lot of people

07:26.800 --> 07:28.960
get shot by the police, really, because there's

07:28.960 --> 07:30.440
a lot of mixed messages.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.480
And of course, Cody was on mushrooms,

07:34.480 --> 07:37.080
which I thought was a great choice for that particular moment.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.800
And I wasn't on them.

07:39.800 --> 07:45.680
She was coming back from a get-together with some great

07:45.680 --> 07:46.800
influences.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.280
Were you commenting the whole night

07:48.280 --> 07:50.040
as the police were doing their work

07:50.040 --> 07:53.600
that it was really great that Cody had done those mushrooms?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.160
Yes.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.640
It felt like it kept coming up.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.000
To whom?

07:59.000 --> 08:04.600
Just people in the neighborhood.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.920
I don't know if you're doing a joke or what.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.200
Yeah, no, I am.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.320
He was doing a very subtle esoteric bit.

08:12.320 --> 08:12.920
All right, yeah.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.760
I kept telling everyone in the neighborhood

08:14.760 --> 08:16.440
that she was on mushrooms.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.760
That's basically my joke, yeah.

08:21.800 --> 08:26.360
So the thing is that the collision with my garage

08:26.360 --> 08:30.280
took out a quarter of a wall of my garage

08:30.280 --> 08:38.480
that then was moved into the front of my gate that

08:38.480 --> 08:42.440
lets you into up to my house.

08:42.440 --> 08:47.280
Hashtag privilege, hashtag what neighborhood do you live in.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.720
But yeah, that is part of it.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.080
As I was really actually, this is a story about how cool it

08:54.080 --> 08:59.480
is to have a little bit of money because my garage is down

08:59.480 --> 09:03.280
by the street, and I have insurance, and I have.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.600
I think it's essential that garages be on the street.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.520
I have assistance.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.280
I find that always to be an advantage.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.840
I like to come up a flight of stairs.

09:10.840 --> 09:15.760
And so you guys are hilarious.

09:15.760 --> 09:16.760
Thank you.

09:16.760 --> 09:22.400
The garage is typically in a normal average American home

09:22.400 --> 09:26.760
would probably be kind of connected to the house.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.440
And so someone smashing into it might kill your daughter,

09:30.440 --> 09:35.360
or dog, or destroy more than just some of your property.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.160
So is what I meant.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.880
And because I have a more sprawling estate.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.600
Because the average American family

09:42.600 --> 09:43.960
keeps their daughter in the garage.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.800
That's what you guys.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.400
Ha ha ha.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.920
Yeah, with the snake tank.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.920
Yeah, nothing really got.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.880
What got fucked up was there was a pipe

09:53.880 --> 09:55.280
in the wall of my garage.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.680
I do find this a little, I guess I

09:57.680 --> 09:58.800
shouldn't be surprised by this.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.800
I guess water pipes are like veins or arteries.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.960
They run everywhere.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.040
If you break it at any point, there's just like,

10:07.040 --> 10:11.200
there was like, when I went down there, there was coplights.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.760
And there was this huge carport that had been my garage.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.640
Because they just took out the whole door of the garage.

10:18.640 --> 10:23.880
And then there was this very cinematic spraying of water

10:23.880 --> 10:27.200
that's always a part of every car wreck in the movies.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.880
Even though there was no fire hydrant involved,

10:28.880 --> 10:31.160
there was just like the sound of like,

10:31.160 --> 10:33.520
I felt like it was like a diehard movie or something.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.600
Like there was just water everywhere.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.200
And the cops kept saying, you got to call the DWP

10:39.200 --> 10:40.880
and have them shut off the water.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.600
Because otherwise, this is bad.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.000
And I had to do that.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.920
And for that reason, and the fact

10:45.920 --> 10:50.080
that the wall of the garage is blocking my gate.

10:50.080 --> 10:56.000
And this is a thing that would have crippled the life

10:56.000 --> 10:59.400
of a normal person.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.400
But I had Steve Levy, who, fresh back from his vacation,

11:04.400 --> 11:08.280
was able to get me and Cody into a hotel room, a suite,

11:08.280 --> 11:10.720
in fact, in West Hollywood, where

11:10.720 --> 11:14.160
we were able to spend New Year's Eve with my friends.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.600
And it's actually, I hate to admit it,

11:17.600 --> 11:20.040
but it's kind of been a blast having a guy drive

11:20.040 --> 11:26.880
into my garage and destroy your daughter, my daughter.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.600
Because it didn't really, I'm the last person

11:29.600 --> 11:30.680
that had actually affected.

11:30.680 --> 11:36.320
But don't rip this video and use it in his, I don't know,

11:36.320 --> 11:37.680
hearing court case.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.880
I don't necessarily need this guy to suffer either.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.200
I mean, I need him to have insurance and pay

11:45.200 --> 11:49.520
for my garage construction.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.560
So I don't think he can use me saying,

11:52.560 --> 11:56.200
it was kind of fun having you destroy my garage against me

11:56.200 --> 11:58.360
in any way, because it still needs to be rebuilt.

11:58.360 --> 12:02.200
But hopefully, he's OK.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.840
Hopefully, his friend didn't do anything desperate

12:04.840 --> 12:09.400
in Amy Mann's backyard when he ran eastbound up

12:09.400 --> 12:11.600
into the hills of Las Feliz.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.200
I almost murdered Amy Mann.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.200
She was coming down the corner on her beach cruiser bicycle.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.520
And I almost completely demolished her.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.360
She was just jamming around the corner.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.280
I have like three phone numbers of people

12:25.280 --> 12:28.880
that I know live in the direction that the kid ran,

12:28.880 --> 12:30.280
that I saw running from the car.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.800
So I went through my phone.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.040
I'm like, who lives over there?

12:33.040 --> 12:34.080
I'm just going to warn him.

12:34.080 --> 12:34.920
There's a guy on foot.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.280
He's running from the cops.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.560
He could actually, if he's desperate,

12:38.560 --> 12:43.240
he could actually do something desperate.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.360
Maybe it's actually better.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.280
These cops, they see him.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.800
I'm not going to, I'm not throwing them under the bus.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.200
They don't, they're admitting they haven't found the guy.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.440
They don't, I don't know how well they're doing it,

12:53.440 --> 12:54.560
finding him.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.240
I'm going to, I'm just going to text a couple warnings

12:57.240 --> 13:00.640
to a couple people that I know live in that direction.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.320
And one of them was Edgar Wright, director of Baby Driver.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.560
And then halfway through, the message is like, wait a minute.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.360
What am I doing?

13:07.360 --> 13:08.280
This is his fault.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.560
I'm sure this guy was.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.400
Was Baby Driver.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.520
Yeah, exactly.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.680
Like, stop making those movies, Edgar.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.320
Or live with this guy in your pool shed.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.680
Welcome to your fucked up version of ET,

13:19.680 --> 13:21.800
where you have to befriend this guy and get him back home

13:21.800 --> 13:23.160
to England.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.880
Apparently, both the driver and the passenger

13:24.880 --> 13:26.080
were not injured, though, right?

13:26.080 --> 13:28.240
The only real tragedy of this was that we found out

13:28.240 --> 13:31.240
that you have a sad segue in your garage.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.440
It was truly, and I'm not being, I mean, yeah.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.480
It's become a joke, but it's really, it really is.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.040
The only segue is like, what?

13:37.040 --> 13:39.040
It really was the most embarrassing thing.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.840
First, it started with the LAPD making fun of the segue.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.760
And that's part of it, is like, you only

13:44.760 --> 13:46.680
have to mention the segue to make fun of it.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.560
Like, so the LAPD was like, I was like,

13:48.560 --> 13:49.720
what's the damage like over there?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.160
I can't even get out the gate to see.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.120
And they're like, don't worry, bro, the segue's OK.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.680
There was segue shaming you?

13:57.680 --> 13:58.640
Yeah.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.480
But then Cody's like, how's my Prius?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.760
Or, you know, she's on mushrooms, so a more accurate thing

14:02.760 --> 14:04.280
would be like, how's my Prius?

14:04.280 --> 14:07.680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.400
But then the cops were like, other than the fact

14:10.400 --> 14:11.480
that it's a hybrid.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.200
And then I was like, OK, I see your formula.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.360
You can take your hybrid shaming.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.080
You can put it in the, I'll take it.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.800
I'll put it in the bin with all the cop insults.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.880
You guys just have a formula here.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.600
But yeah, no.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.360
They were hybrid shaming too?

14:26.360 --> 14:28.600
They were, you know, it's cop humor.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.560
What are they going to do?

14:29.560 --> 14:31.000
Are they going to?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.880
When someone's using less gas than the maximum amount

14:33.880 --> 14:34.680
to get around?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.400
You know, they don't know what they're doing.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.480
It's cop humor.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.560
They're connecting dots.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.520
I would rather my cops be linear thinkers, really,

14:41.520 --> 14:42.000
frankly.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.760
I don't want them to be that creative with their guns

14:44.760 --> 14:45.480
and their handcuffs.

14:45.480 --> 14:50.360
I'd rather they just be like, OK, you're stealing that car,

14:50.360 --> 14:54.600
which is illegal, so here's your rights to remain silent.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.160
I don't want them to be like, hey, I'm in my blue period.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.160
OK.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.400
The men in blue period.

15:02.400 --> 15:07.440
But very impressively diverse, multiracial.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.280
I'm always impressed when the LAPD shows up at my house.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.600
And I like the diversity.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.240
It looks like when you look at the LAPD,

15:17.240 --> 15:21.040
when they come in mass, it looks like a pamphlet.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.120
It looks like a pamphlet.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.120
It looks like it's comforting.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.680
You've got systems working.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.440
Everything's fine.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.320
I'll just go back in my house and eat crackers

15:29.320 --> 15:32.120
and oppress the poor.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.360
And that always includes, the diversity includes,

15:35.360 --> 15:38.720
there's always incredibly handsome young white dudes

15:38.720 --> 15:41.120
that look like they belong in a boy band.

15:41.120 --> 15:47.960
Very, very, very sexy white male cops among the rainbow

15:47.960 --> 15:48.760
of justice.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.600
Get a room.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.560
Yeah.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.800
But that was the guy that was busting the balls the hardest.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.440
Yeah, it's an old story, NASA.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.840
It almost feels like it's like graham crackers telling it,

16:00.840 --> 16:02.040
but that's what happened.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.200
It's a big die.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.160
I wish for this podcast.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.240
It happened yesterday because it'd

16:05.240 --> 16:07.320
be all excited about it and explaining every detail.

16:07.320 --> 16:11.680
But a dude hit my garage and destroyed a water pipe.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.440
So I got to stay in a hotel suite.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.520
It was fun.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.480
I had a very good time in India with church.

16:16.480 --> 16:20.400
We had a beautiful little excursion out there.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.240
It's just like a mind-numbing, mind-blowing,

16:24.240 --> 16:28.600
like overwhelming explosion of kaleidoscopic madness.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.000
It's so fucking cool.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.120
Did you guys get any illnesses?

16:33.120 --> 16:36.600
No, I felt like crap believing because you

16:36.600 --> 16:39.840
take these malaria pills, and I got really nauseous on it,

16:39.840 --> 16:41.160
nauseated.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.400
But you're not supposed to drink alcohol with them,

16:43.400 --> 16:44.320
and I did, of course.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.880
And so I felt like a bum.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.480
But when I got to India, then I felt amazing the entire time,

16:48.480 --> 16:49.880
just ate the best food in the world.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.200
Then we came back, and then we got sick,

16:52.200 --> 16:53.800
just because we were traveling a lot.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.080
Yeah.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.400
Church might have malaria.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.600
Church, do you have malaria, or are you surviving now?

17:00.600 --> 17:03.920
Last night, you thought you had malaria.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.600
We'll see.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.080
I'm preoccupied by this thing.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.880
I got to get it done.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.160
I've had people telling me I've had a lot of advice.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.000
Don't talk about it.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.280
You don't have to talk about it.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.600
It's done.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
Legal advice.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.400
Don't talk about it.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.120
You open it yourself up.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.680
The most important advice I've gotten

17:21.680 --> 17:27.400
is from women that I respect that do what I do,

17:27.400 --> 17:33.760
that are respected, and that spoke to me privately,

17:33.760 --> 17:37.400
and said, if you're true to your word,

17:37.400 --> 17:38.920
and you are sincere about how you want

17:38.920 --> 17:44.440
to be part of the solution, not part of the problem,

17:44.440 --> 17:47.520
please talk about how you've been part of the problem.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.840
That's truly the most helpful thing you can do.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.120
Please appreciate, if you're listening to me,

17:53.120 --> 17:55.240
that the tightrope I have to walk here

17:55.240 --> 18:01.040
is I have to make this a normal part of the process,

18:01.040 --> 18:06.360
because it should be healthy, and easy, and graceful.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.320
It should be a thing that can be done,

18:08.320 --> 18:12.240
and doesn't have to create civil war and hysteria,

18:12.240 --> 18:16.520
that doesn't make people get re-victimized and attacked.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.040
You're not doing me any favors at all.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.720
You're only hurting everybody, especially me,

18:21.720 --> 18:29.360
if this topic causes you to attack anybody involved.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.760
You may think it's in my defense.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.400
You may think it's in defense of fairness.

18:32.400 --> 18:37.920
I ask you to think about what you think fair is.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.800
That's enough disclaiming.

18:39.800 --> 18:46.120
I have really, really had to think about this.

18:46.120 --> 18:51.680
And decided I need to talk about it.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.880
I want to target about, what, five to seven minutes?

18:55.880 --> 18:59.760
And then pull me out of here, after which hopefully I've

18:59.760 --> 19:02.200
done some good by just talking about this.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.080
This is about for your life closing down, right?

19:04.080 --> 19:04.600
Yes.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.400
For your life recently, close down.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.840
In 2000, whatever, whatever, I can't remember.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.440
2009, 2006, 2000, something, something,

19:16.440 --> 19:20.600
I had the privilege of running a network sitcom.

19:20.600 --> 19:27.640
And I was attracted to a employee.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.160
I really want to be careful about that language.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.000
I think a huge part of the problem

19:33.000 --> 19:37.400
is a culture of feeling things that you think

19:37.400 --> 19:41.080
are unique and significant because they're happening to you

19:41.080 --> 19:46.120
and saying things like, I had feelings for and I,

19:46.120 --> 19:47.880
I fell for and all these things.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.600
I mean, the most clinical way I can put it and fessing up

19:50.600 --> 19:55.400
to my crimes is that I was attracted to a writer

19:55.400 --> 19:59.560
that I had power over because I was a show runner.

19:59.560 --> 20:08.440
And I knew enough to know that these feelings were bad news.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.320
That was easy enough to know.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.920
I knew that they ran the risk of undercutting people's faith

20:13.920 --> 20:19.280
in my judgment, her faith in her talent,

20:19.280 --> 20:21.600
the other writer's respect for me,

20:21.600 --> 20:25.360
the entire production, the audience.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.880
I knew that I wasn't doing anybody any favors

20:28.880 --> 20:32.280
by feeling these things.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.200
And so I did the cowardly easiest, laziest thing

20:35.200 --> 20:36.560
you could do with feelings like that.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.680
And I didn't deal with them.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.680
And in not dealing with them, I made everybody else

20:40.680 --> 20:46.240
deal with them, especially her.

20:46.240 --> 20:51.640
Flirty, creepy, everything other than overt enough

20:51.640 --> 20:56.320
to constitute betraying your live-in girlfriend to whom

20:56.320 --> 21:00.280
you're going home every night who is actually smart enough

21:00.280 --> 21:02.480
and respectful enough to ask you,

21:02.480 --> 21:04.480
do you have feelings for that young writer

21:04.480 --> 21:06.840
that you're talking about, that you're

21:06.840 --> 21:10.080
paying all this attention to, and saying to her,

21:10.080 --> 21:13.920
no, because the trick is, if you lie to yourself,

21:13.920 --> 21:14.960
you can lie to everybody.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.240
It's really easy.

21:18.240 --> 21:24.080
And so that's what I continued to do, telling myself

21:24.080 --> 21:29.320
and anybody that threatened to confront me with it,

21:29.320 --> 21:32.920
that if you thought what I was doing was creepy or flirty

21:32.920 --> 21:35.600
or unprofessional, then it's because you were the sexist.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
You were jealous.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.800
I was supporting this person.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
I'm a mentor.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.760
I'm a feminist.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.000
It's your problem, not mine.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.320
You're the one that actually is seeing things

21:48.320 --> 21:49.600
through that lens.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.400
And so I let myself keep doing it.

21:53.400 --> 22:00.480
And it's not as if this person didn't repeatedly communicate

22:00.480 --> 22:04.520
to me the idea that what I was doing

22:04.520 --> 22:09.240
was divesting her of a recourse to integrity.

22:09.240 --> 22:17.120
I just didn't hear it because it didn't profit me to hear it.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.080
And this was after all happening to me, right?

22:21.080 --> 22:30.520
And so after a season of playing it that way,

22:30.520 --> 22:34.320
I broke up with my girlfriend, who I had lied to the whole time

22:34.320 --> 22:36.840
while lying to myself, lied to her about why

22:36.840 --> 22:39.240
I was breaking up with her.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.880
Because I thought that would make having inappropriate feelings

22:41.880 --> 22:46.440
for a co-worker appropriate if I wasn't involved.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.160
I want you to be the one to examine this

22:49.160 --> 22:51.360
and every step of the way decide for yourself

22:51.360 --> 22:53.080
where I'm making mistakes.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.760
I don't want to explain to you what I've learned.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.760
I want you to look at this.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.360
And I want it to sound relatively unremarkable to you

23:03.360 --> 23:04.680
because that's the danger.

23:07.440 --> 23:13.000
I broke up with my girlfriend, then I went full steam

23:13.000 --> 23:17.280
into creeping on my employee.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.640
Now it was even less appropriate after all.

23:19.640 --> 23:23.400
Now I wasn't in danger of being a bad person.

23:26.840 --> 23:32.400
And then after that season, I got overt

23:32.400 --> 23:39.320
about my feelings after it was wrapped and said, oh, I love you.

23:39.320 --> 23:43.680
And she said the same thing she'd been saying the entire time

23:43.680 --> 23:46.040
in one language or another.

23:46.040 --> 23:51.320
Please don't you understand that focusing on me like this,

23:51.320 --> 23:55.080
liking me like this, preferring me like this,

23:55.080 --> 23:58.040
I can't say no to it.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.520
And when you do it, it makes me unable to know

24:01.520 --> 24:02.880
whether I'm good at my job.

24:07.640 --> 24:13.280
And because I finally got to the point where I said to her,

24:13.280 --> 24:20.240
oh, I love you because that's what I thought it was

24:20.240 --> 24:25.200
when you target somebody for two years.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.520
And it was therefore rejected that way.

24:28.520 --> 24:33.160
I was humiliated.

24:33.160 --> 24:37.600
And so I continued to do the cowardly thing

24:37.600 --> 24:41.120
and continued to do the selfish thing.

24:41.120 --> 24:45.680
Now I wanted to teach her a lesson.

24:45.680 --> 24:51.320
I wanted to show her that if she didn't like being liked in that

24:51.320 --> 24:54.720
way, then oh boy, she should get over her soft after off.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.840
You're just going to be a writer,

24:55.840 --> 25:00.320
and then this is how just writers get treated.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.120
And that was probably the darkest of it all.

25:03.120 --> 25:07.520
I'm going to assume that when she tweets about it

25:07.520 --> 25:17.720
and refers to trauma that that's probably it because I drank,

25:17.720 --> 25:22.400
I took pills, I crushed on her and resented her

25:22.400 --> 25:24.600
for not reciprocating it.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.800
And the entire time I was the one writing her paychecks

25:26.800 --> 25:30.080
and in control of whether she stayed or went

25:30.080 --> 25:33.000
and whether she felt good about herself or not

25:33.000 --> 25:39.120
and said horrible things, just treated her cruelly,

25:39.120 --> 25:42.240
pointedly, things that I would never, ever, ever

25:42.240 --> 25:45.840
have done if she had been male.

25:45.840 --> 25:49.520
And if I had never had those feelings for her.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.400
And I lied to myself the entire time about it.

25:52.400 --> 25:59.800
And I lost my job, I ruined my show,

25:59.800 --> 26:05.440
I betrayed the audience, I destroyed everything,

26:05.440 --> 26:07.320
and I damaged her internal compass.

26:11.920 --> 26:15.560
And I moved on.

26:15.560 --> 26:26.320
And I never did it before, and I will never do it again.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.960
But I certainly wouldn't have been

26:27.960 --> 26:31.960
able to do it if I had any respect for women.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.800
On a fundamental level, I was thinking about them

26:35.800 --> 26:37.680
as different creatures.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.360
I was thinking about the ones that I

26:39.360 --> 26:44.560
liked as having some special role in my life.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.520
And I did it all by not thinking about it.

26:48.520 --> 26:52.480
So I just want to say, in addition to obviously being

26:52.480 --> 26:57.200
sorry, but that's really not the important thing,

26:57.200 --> 27:00.400
I want to say I did it by not thinking about it.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.280
And I got away with it by not thinking about it.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.440
And if she hadn't mentioned something on Twitter,

27:07.440 --> 27:11.240
I would have continued to not have to think about it.

27:11.240 --> 27:18.360
Although I did walk around with my stomach and not about it.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.120
But I wouldn't have had to talk about it.

27:20.120 --> 27:25.000
And the last and most important thing I can say

27:25.000 --> 27:27.120
is just think about it.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.480
No matter who you are at work, no matter where you're working,

27:29.480 --> 27:31.240
no matter what field you're in, no matter what position

27:31.240 --> 27:34.280
you have over or under or side by side with somebody,

27:34.280 --> 27:36.520
just think about it.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.160
Because if you don't think about it,

27:38.160 --> 27:40.720
you're going to get away with not thinking about it.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.640
And you could cause a lot of damage

27:43.640 --> 27:51.160
that is technically legal and hurts everybody.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.560
And I think that we're living in a good time right now

27:54.560 --> 27:58.400
because we're not going to get away with it anymore.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.720
And if we can make it a normal part of our culture

28:02.720 --> 28:06.480
that we think about it and possibly talk about it,

28:06.480 --> 28:08.840
then maybe we can get to a better place

28:08.840 --> 28:11.560
where that stuff doesn't happen.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.240
So that's it.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.280
Please don't hurt her.

28:17.280 --> 28:25.560
Please don't make this worse on anybody but me.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.800
And let's move on.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.720
I'm bad at ending things.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.000
I'm going to now have a drink.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.720
That was seven minutes exactly.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.800
Oh, well, it was totally rehearsed.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.440
Jeff, tell us about India.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.880
This is kind of a tough act to follow, man.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.680
Well, India is certainly the means to do it.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.520
You know, it was amazing.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.720
Are there cows there?

28:47.720 --> 28:48.360
The cows were.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.800
Those are illegal, right?

28:49.800 --> 28:52.560
Cows are not only legal.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.000
They have their own lane.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.720
The traffic there is insane.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.160
And I was told that it goes in order of the size of the car,

28:58.160 --> 28:59.640
like the bigger cars get the right of way

28:59.640 --> 29:02.480
and then all the way down to the people on scooters.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.080
But if you're a cow, everybody gets out of your way.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.760
They call it the cow lane.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.600
And the cows just cruise down the street.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.840
They're kind of like cats.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.520
Like they hang out in the hurry.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.560
They hang out in the daytime.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.560
They go, they get gallivants around town,

29:15.560 --> 29:17.320
eating whatever they find on the street,

29:17.320 --> 29:19.440
sometimes pilot trash or whatever.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.000
And then they all seem to be going home in the same direction

29:22.000 --> 29:22.720
at the end of the day.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.360
Like they're all kind of coming back home.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.400
It's their day job is like to get garbage.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.440
You know, it's crazy.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.080
When Church and I checked in, we landed at like 3 AM.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.720
We got to the hotel at like 4 AM.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.160
And this beautiful hotel in Bangalore.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.440
And they put the little, I forget.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.680
What do they call it?

29:37.680 --> 29:39.280
Church with a little red blessing on your forehead?

29:39.280 --> 29:40.120
A dot.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.400
Tulaka.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.720
And they give you a little.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.240
A tulaka.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.120
And they put the thing and they gave us a little mango drink.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.840
And there was Christmas decorations everywhere.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.800
Because we got to like around the 20th, right?

29:51.800 --> 29:52.480
Something like that?

29:52.480 --> 29:53.480
No, no, before that.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.240
I think before.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.320
Yeah.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.720
But it was, you know, the build up to Christmas,

29:58.720 --> 29:59.640
they love Christmas there.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.880
Like more Christmas decorations than you see here.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.360
And everywhere, like the malls and the hotel lobbies

30:05.360 --> 30:06.520
and the airports.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.960
It was just like Santa Claus' and Christmas trees everywhere.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.520
And I asked this woman, Needy, kind of our driver, handler,

30:12.520 --> 30:16.000
like chaperone, do you guys love Christmas?

30:16.000 --> 30:20.280
You know, we celebrate every holiday here.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.840
Hindu holidays are every day.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.320
They have 1,000 festivals and stuff.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.880
Like we love all festivals.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.400
I go, do you celebrate all Christian festivals?

30:27.400 --> 30:28.560
I go, yes, all of them.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.960
And they go, because Christmas is the festival of lights

30:31.960 --> 30:32.920
and gift giving.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.280
And they all dress up as Santa Claus

30:34.280 --> 30:35.440
and give each other gifts.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.880
I go, do you celebrate all, like, Islamic festivals too?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.200
Yes, all of them too.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.680
I go, what, Jewish festivals?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.080
And she goes, no.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.960
But not because the anti-Semitism.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.880
I think they're like, no, but those aren't as fun.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.320
They're not flashy, certainly.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.720
But you should have said meh.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.320
Meh?

30:51.320 --> 30:52.040
Yeah, you should.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.200
I mean, come on.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.800
You know, what I found weird is that they treated us so well,

30:57.800 --> 31:00.400
they gave us, me and Greg Proops were doing comedy shows

31:00.400 --> 31:01.480
there.

31:01.480 --> 31:05.400
And we were surrounded by a phalanx of security

31:05.400 --> 31:08.720
when we would do these shows and walk to go to the bar.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.120
And there would just be seven or eight buff Indian dudes

31:11.120 --> 31:13.880
in black t-shirts just following you around everywhere.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.680
And they're under strict orders, like,

31:15.680 --> 31:17.400
don't let this guy out of your sight.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.520
Like, we were like big hot shot Bollywood stars.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.720
I'm like, no, I think you'll find that nobody really

31:21.720 --> 31:23.240
knows who I am here.

31:23.240 --> 31:23.920
But it was great.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.520
The people there are fantastic.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.560
They called you Sahib.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.840
I didn't know that until after the fact that I was Jeff Sahib.

31:30.840 --> 31:35.680
I found out later on that that was my handle.

31:35.680 --> 31:40.720
Was that a thing that, was it a Greg Proops gig?

31:40.720 --> 31:43.720
Yeah, Greg and I once in a while will get corporate shows.

31:43.720 --> 31:48.760
Usually they're in Houston or Ohio or corporate gigs

31:48.760 --> 31:50.080
around America.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.880
But he said, hey, Jeff, we got this cushy gig

31:51.880 --> 31:55.200
for this alcohol company called Black Dog in India.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.560
And they just treated us like royalty.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.080
It was fantastic.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.120
It was really, like, it's not funny.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.000
I don't have a hilarious joke about it.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
But like, if you've not been, the people

32:06.000 --> 32:08.040
that are listening that have been to India or from India,

32:08.040 --> 32:12.040
they know, I hope, like how special and really, like,

32:12.040 --> 32:12.840
marvelous.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.160
Like, there's so many people.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.760
It's so crowded.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.280
There's so much noise and color and sights and smells

32:19.280 --> 32:21.200
and sounds and things.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.280
But nobody's angry.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.240
Like, everybody just was chilled out and just relaxed.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.640
And if you follow a church on her Instagram at Cassandra

32:28.640 --> 32:31.800
Church, there's a picture that she took when we were at,

32:31.800 --> 32:34.720
it was a Charamara Palace.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.520
Charamara?

32:35.520 --> 32:36.520
Charamara?

32:36.520 --> 32:37.520
Charamara.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.000
Charamara?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.480
Something like that.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.120
Charamara.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.040
Doop, doo, doo, doo, doo.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.360
And she took a picture of these five women just sitting down

32:46.360 --> 32:47.240
on their break.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.600
And it was like, it's so captivating.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.320
I don't know.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.360
I'm kind of nerded out on India.

32:53.360 --> 32:57.800
And I really, really, like, would love to go back at any time.

32:57.800 --> 33:01.760
I'm working with a writer that was in Eastern Europe.

33:01.760 --> 33:05.400
And he, you can tell from the way he talks about it

33:05.400 --> 33:08.480
that he really wants to just go there and live there forever.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.240
Sometimes you can feel that way and be wrong.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.360
Like, you'd go out there and find out you were totally wrong

33:12.360 --> 33:14.320
and you just have an infatuation with a place.

33:14.320 --> 33:17.760
Like, I felt that way about Portland for a while.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.480
But I don't know.

33:20.480 --> 33:25.040
I wonder if everybody has, like, a city somewhere on the planet

33:25.040 --> 33:27.560
where they would be extra activated.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.520
I mean, India is such a giant.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.920
Like, it's almost its own continent.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.600
And every city, from what I've heard,

33:35.600 --> 33:38.880
is really different in lots of ways.

33:38.880 --> 33:43.080
It's, you know, 100,000 languages and all this different,

33:43.080 --> 33:45.360
like, just from neighborhood to neighborhood is so different.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.160
I would love to go back and explore more of it.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.960
Like, some people go to Thailand and fall in love with it

33:48.960 --> 33:52.720
and go, OK, I could live in Thailand.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.720
I don't know that I would necessarily need to go live

33:54.720 --> 33:55.920
in India, but it's certainly a place.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.400
Like, Church has a friend, he's a composer who,

33:58.400 --> 34:00.760
my name is Michael Dana, who, like, he goes there

34:00.760 --> 34:02.960
for months, right?

34:02.960 --> 34:06.200
Yeah, and like, he's in love with India.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.760
And you can see why.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.160
It's like, just walking down the street,

34:10.160 --> 34:13.960
old ladies wearing these brilliantly colored saris

34:13.960 --> 34:16.520
or kurtees or whatever, and just walking down the road.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.720
And Church was dressed, you know, like in a black Vivian

34:18.720 --> 34:20.320
westward suit the first day.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.600
And not getting, like, hostile looks,

34:22.600 --> 34:25.560
but just kind of getting side eyes from the ladies.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.440
And then we got her some local gear.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.520
Like, you got some clothes there.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.200
You want to come up and talk about it?

34:32.200 --> 34:35.200
Church, come on up.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.200
Church!

34:41.200 --> 34:45.680
Let's not talk about her like she's not here.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.160
And bring her up on stage.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.720
So these women, like, walking down the road,

34:54.720 --> 34:56.520
and then she kind of put, like, some linen-y,

34:56.520 --> 34:58.440
like, we got some, like, local, like,

34:58.440 --> 34:59.920
kind of more local-looking clothes.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.640
And then women just sort of smiling at her.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.120
And then we're walking down, like, these, like,

35:03.120 --> 35:07.480
the old city in Hyderabad, which is much more Islamic.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.400
Like, a lot of burkas and the full-on head covering stuff.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.200
And little girls were just coming up to Church

35:12.200 --> 35:13.240
and just taking photos with her,

35:13.240 --> 35:14.400
like she was, like, Lady Gaga.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.400
It was fucking rad.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.320
It was really good.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.120
Yeah, they don't get a lot of Westerners

35:19.120 --> 35:20.840
coming to Hyderabad.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.760
There's, it's not really a tourist spot.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.760
So we stood out.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.840
Yeah, I looked like Godzilla.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.760
And she looked like Yolande from a fucking dn-word.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.760
I mean, you hear that, you hear that a lot about Thailand.

35:34.760 --> 35:39.480
And I didn't, I wasn't sure if India was like that.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.040
But then again, India's gigantic.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.400
And so it probably vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.360
But that, that, I didn't know if that was also a thing

35:46.360 --> 35:47.200
that was still happening.

35:47.200 --> 35:52.000
In the 80s, I would hear that that if you're an American

35:52.000 --> 35:54.240
or a European and you're like, and you

35:54.240 --> 35:58.680
go to some of these countries that people,

35:58.680 --> 36:01.720
everybody just wants to, like, pose with you

36:01.720 --> 36:03.880
and touch your clothes and all this stuff.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.840
And it, it's the kind of thing that it,

36:06.840 --> 36:12.840
as a white American, you, you don't want to,

36:12.840 --> 36:14.440
it feels racist.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.440
Like, you, it feels.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.440
It also feels antiquated.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.320
I actually didn't expect that that would still be a thing

36:19.320 --> 36:22.480
now that like, I don't know, post internet or something.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.160
And the way that you can get anything now

36:24.160 --> 36:26.400
and most places are becoming more and more Western.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.640
I really didn't expect to really feel so foreign.

36:29.640 --> 36:30.200
Yeah.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.360
And that was a tech city.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.360
These were tech cities.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.840
These are sort of not even the places that you see

36:34.840 --> 36:36.120
in most of the travel photos.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.880
These are the progressive kind of areas.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.600
It's possible that the reason we think that way,

36:41.600 --> 36:44.000
and then we think that it's wrong to think that way

36:44.000 --> 36:47.200
or whatever, is that because we have a perverted relationship

36:47.200 --> 36:51.840
with fame and with selfies and, and we,

36:51.840 --> 36:55.720
how we conflate it with social status so that we have this,

36:55.720 --> 36:57.960
like, oh, if you come up to somebody and say,

36:57.960 --> 37:02.840
can I take a picture with you that you're taking something

37:02.840 --> 37:06.440
from them slash giving them something and there's an exchange

37:06.440 --> 37:12.520
happening, whereas they, as a more ancient founded culture,

37:12.520 --> 37:16.520
like, are just going, you look crazy.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.280
They just walk up and say, can I take a selfie with you?

37:19.280 --> 37:19.760
Yeah.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.960
Like, and there's no shame at all.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.840
In fact, I noticed, I don't know if you noticed this,

37:22.840 --> 37:25.200
did you see all the billboards advertising phones

37:25.200 --> 37:26.280
that take better selfies?

37:26.280 --> 37:27.920
And it's just on billboards everywhere,

37:27.920 --> 37:30.320
specifically advertising phones based

37:30.320 --> 37:31.880
on having good selfies?

37:31.880 --> 37:32.760
You didn't notice that?

37:32.760 --> 37:33.840
They were everywhere.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.520
Jeff was telling me about the headwag thing

37:36.520 --> 37:42.840
that I found so fascinating that there's this, I mean,

37:42.840 --> 37:44.160
I don't know how else to describe it.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.800
It could be like, maybe, or like, oh, I'm thinking, or.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.240
It's like saying, um.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.440
And like, while you're like, you're saying, hey,

37:50.440 --> 37:52.080
so if we're going to leave for the airport,

37:52.080 --> 37:56.920
and while you're saying, like, the person's trying to go,

37:56.920 --> 37:58.560
that's them cogitating.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.240
It's an acknowledgement of what you're saying being processed.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.520
So I was kind of like reading it.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.520
As opposed to just immediately babbling and saying, um, er,

38:05.520 --> 38:07.120
well, let me see, I don't know.

38:07.120 --> 38:11.800
Which I would imagine during that crucial phase, a lot of us,

38:11.800 --> 38:13.840
that's when a lot of us say no to each other.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.320
Because we don't know what to do.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.040
And hey, do you know how to?

38:17.040 --> 38:19.000
No, no, no.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.440
But then maybe if we did have a thing in our culture where

38:21.440 --> 38:22.840
it's like, well, don't do that.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.960
Don't just diarrhea some nose at each other.

38:25.960 --> 38:29.560
Don't feel the need to, like, barf up information.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.600
Actually, if you're on pause, it's

38:32.600 --> 38:38.040
like a little pinwheel thing in an operating system

38:38.040 --> 38:41.520
that someone's going like this while they heard me.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.760
I think it means lots of different things

38:43.760 --> 38:47.160
and we weren't there long enough to totally learn.

38:47.160 --> 38:52.720
But it's just you don't see that little chin-wag thing.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.880
It felt like it made sense after about a day.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.200
It was sort of strange at first.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.800
And then I kind of got just, it's

38:58.800 --> 39:01.160
like when you're trying to pick up a new language

39:01.160 --> 39:03.800
and you start to learn things based on just the context

39:03.800 --> 39:05.240
of what's happening.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.080
You know, it's just body language.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.920
And it's like, oh, well, he's saying, yeah.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.040
By the way, his eyes look.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.640
I can tell it's like, yeah, maybe.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.640
Like this other point is like, oh, yes, absolutely.

39:14.640 --> 39:15.880
I can do that.

39:15.880 --> 39:16.880
Here's something I noticed.

39:16.880 --> 39:17.880
Sorry.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.680
Did I cut you off?

39:18.680 --> 39:21.000
No, go ahead.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.480
This is fucked up.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.760
You know how people think on Twitter

39:25.760 --> 39:28.520
that I wrote Teen Wolf on the MTV show.

39:28.520 --> 39:31.000
In India, people kept coming up to me.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.080
And they go, at the hotel, like, we're these nice hotels.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.120
And it's two waitresses come up to me.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.480
I'm having breakfast.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.960
And they go, pardon me, Mr. Davis, Jeff Davis?

39:41.960 --> 39:44.120
Yeah, they go, we are such big fans of yours.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.840
And there's a lot of Who's Line fans there.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.840
Like, it's been syndicated there for ages.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.040
So a lot of people really know Who's Line, which

39:50.040 --> 39:52.360
is why they brought us out there, I suppose.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.960
There, everyone thinks I'm Jeff.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.520
The same Jeff Davis that wrote Teen Wolf,

39:55.520 --> 39:59.200
but for their money, they're giant criminal minds fans.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.960
And everybody thought I was the Jeff Davis

40:00.960 --> 40:02.440
that wrote Criminal Minds, because that's

40:02.440 --> 40:04.160
the same Jeff Davis that wrote Teen Wolf.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.040
We've got to get this guy on the show.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.160
It shouldn't be.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.480
I don't want to insult him by saying it shouldn't be that hard.

40:09.480 --> 40:13.040
But I'm just assuming if he works in LA and his name's

40:13.040 --> 40:15.600
Jeff Davis, he must want to talk about this.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.200
We did a show in Bangalore.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.200
Greg and I were doing it.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.080
Then we're doing it, like, a photo op meet and greet.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.880
People come up and take photos and stuff

40:21.880 --> 40:22.880
like that with a backdrop.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.760
And the whole paparazzi kind of flim flam.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.200
And security and stuff.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.840
These guys that look like straight up Harmontown age,

40:30.840 --> 40:33.960
Harmontown nerdy looking fans, they come up and they're like,

40:33.960 --> 40:35.720
oh, we have big fans of yours, big fans of yours.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.800
Like, oh, thank you.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.560
You like the show?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.360
Like, we love the show, Criminal Minds, the best show

40:39.360 --> 40:39.840
in the world.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.120
Criminal Minds.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.680
But they just saw me perform improv.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.480
And they still think that I'm the Jeff Davis

40:45.480 --> 40:46.280
from Criminal Minds.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.880
Well, yeah, I mean, that's to live in their world,

40:48.880 --> 40:52.320
where you're like, yeah, I'm creating Criminal Minds

40:52.320 --> 40:54.240
and Teen Wolf, and then fuck it, let's play.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.400
Let's play emotional parties.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.520
As a sideline, I tell dick jokes.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.960
But I'm not being a show writer.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.120
But wait, what's Criminal Minds again?

41:01.120 --> 41:02.000
I don't know.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.800
I think Padgett Brewster was on it at some point.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.400
No, is that?

41:05.400 --> 41:06.280
Really?

41:06.280 --> 41:07.080
I think.

41:07.080 --> 41:07.440
I don't know.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.560
I've never seen that or Teen Wolf.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.680
I don't know.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.280
I just know that.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.160
I told you about my accountant calling me up and saying that,

41:14.160 --> 41:16.800
did you spend $5,000 on limousines last night?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.560
No.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.840
I got billed for the other Jeff Davis's limo rides

41:20.840 --> 41:22.400
to the Emmys or something like that.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.200
Oh, man.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.520
It's like, we were.

41:24.520 --> 41:27.280
When they come up with TV show names, are they trying?

41:27.280 --> 41:29.320
Are they, is part of it like, well,

41:29.320 --> 41:33.960
we want it to sound like other shows

41:33.960 --> 41:37.760
because that's part of the appeal of TV, if it sounds

41:37.760 --> 41:41.720
too much like a bus, people won't know they should watch it.

41:41.720 --> 41:45.120
So let's call it TV show.

41:45.120 --> 41:48.480
But we'll just technically change the title

41:48.480 --> 41:49.920
so that you can find it.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.280
I think especially for procedurals and stuff.

41:52.280 --> 41:53.760
That's absolutely a huge.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.880
Like, there's always NYP, or I don't know.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.600
It's like, then there was Chicago and Chicago Fire.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.800
And it's like, they're trying to just cash on the,

42:01.800 --> 42:05.160
it's just these words that are like things you like, right?

42:05.160 --> 42:06.000
Television.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.400
It makes sense.

42:07.400 --> 42:11.040
In an ideal culture, you could call it anything.

42:11.040 --> 42:16.560
You could call it, Gadzooka Muka colon, a crime procedural.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.640
And then people would go, oh, Gadzooka Muka.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.400
At least I can remember that.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.240
Who's forgetting it?

42:23.240 --> 42:23.640
Whatever.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.240
If you're into that, I guess you're remembering them.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.680
What's the elevator pitch for a Gadzooka Muka?

42:27.680 --> 42:33.400
It's just seven experts from different fields

42:33.400 --> 42:38.720
forced to work on a task force in downtown Cincinnati

42:38.720 --> 42:43.680
due to the recent string of abductions.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.880
And then at the end of the season, if you watch it,

42:45.880 --> 42:49.560
then at the end of it, they're like, well, I guess that's it.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.280
They got all the boxes packed up.

42:51.280 --> 42:54.120
And the sets are, the bulletin boards are emptied.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.320
And then the guy comes out from the office

42:56.320 --> 43:00.160
and goes like, that's so fast, jackasses.

43:00.160 --> 43:04.240
A homeless guy just got eaten by a Loch Ness Monster in Scotland.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.520
But eight Loch Ness Monsters.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.760
And then the quiz that that's like, how many Loch Ness Monsters?

43:08.760 --> 43:09.760
We're going to Scotland.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.760
Oh, you're there.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.160
Cincinnati's being overrun by Loch Ness Monsters.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.040
Yeah, I wonder what it would take to write a procedural.

43:21.040 --> 43:25.000
I guess a healthy dose of watching procedurals.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.160
That seems like everybody.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.680
Yeah, I think you have to have someone

43:28.680 --> 43:31.240
like a consulting producer that used

43:31.240 --> 43:33.840
to work on one of those things that knows all the full plans.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.040
Let's see if we could just improvise a procedural,

43:36.040 --> 43:37.720
just as a radio play.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.800
We don't have to act it out.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.300
OK.

43:39.300 --> 43:41.200
I'm not as familiar with them as you are.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.760
I don't really watch them, but I'll do my best.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.560
I think you could take my lead.

43:44.560 --> 43:49.840
I'm like Marty McFly saying to the band,

43:49.840 --> 43:52.560
watch me for the changes, try to keep up.

43:52.560 --> 43:57.400
All right, so the cold open, I think we could put a pin in.

43:57.400 --> 44:01.600
But let's just say it's like a paper plate factory

44:01.600 --> 44:04.520
and a guy's finishing making the paper plates.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.080
And he goes like, I'm all done here.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.720
And his off-screen voice says, are you?

44:12.640 --> 44:13.240
Yeah.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.480
There's more in here, though.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.920
In here where it's dark and not surveilled.

44:18.920 --> 44:21.720
And then he walks into the back room.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.300
And you don't even hear what happens.

44:27.800 --> 44:32.200
I got to admit, I didn't expect this guy to be the victim,

44:32.200 --> 44:33.000
but it's OK.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.200
But if we don't see what happened, all right,

44:35.200 --> 44:37.120
well, do we hear a sound like a silencer?

44:37.120 --> 44:38.920
No, it goes to silent.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.320
Like it kind of sounds faint now.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.280
Then we cut to a woman in bed, and she's

44:44.280 --> 44:47.280
looking like she's nervously sleeping and reaches over,

44:47.280 --> 44:48.440
and there's nobody there.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.080
And she sees the clock, and it's 2.30 AM.

44:51.080 --> 44:56.240
And she picks up her phone and starts calling somebody.

44:56.240 --> 45:00.920
But a cold open, we're going to need to punch this thing.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.360
Like, we want to blow to our cold open.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.240
And it can't be a guy walking in the darkness.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.960
It can't be a lady checking her phone.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.920
But she's like, where is it?

45:08.920 --> 45:10.080
Now he's disappeared.

45:10.080 --> 45:10.800
Now where is he?

45:10.800 --> 45:12.280
That's the assumption we're making, right?

45:12.280 --> 45:15.080
So now he's disappeared at the paper plate factory.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.840
He was supposed to be home hours ago.

45:16.840 --> 45:19.720
So then cut to her, because it's a cold open.

45:19.720 --> 45:20.720
We got to keep it short.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.040
So now, but now, doesn't the story

45:22.040 --> 45:25.160
change into her finding her guy who disappeared?

45:25.160 --> 45:27.600
So she cut to her pulling up.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
And let's just save money.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.400
Now she's going to the paper plate factory.

45:29.400 --> 45:32.040
And she cut to her at the same set where he was.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.040
Yeah.

45:33.040 --> 45:36.200
She's wearing a fur coat, or whatever she threw on.

45:36.200 --> 45:40.920
A fur coat, because she's the rich wife of a paper plate

45:40.920 --> 45:42.080
factory worker.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.880
Well, I think that's a clue.

45:43.880 --> 45:44.680
It's a gift.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.000
I don't want to blow the whole plot,

45:46.000 --> 45:47.920
but I think that's going to be a thing.

45:47.920 --> 45:52.640
And so she walks into that back room

45:52.640 --> 45:53.920
that Spencer described.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.320
And then she turns on a light.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.480
And the camera kind of goes busters on her.

45:58.480 --> 46:00.240
And she goes, oh!

46:00.240 --> 46:02.360
OK, so then you can go to your title sequence.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.200
CSI and letters.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.840
And it's like crime, conspiracies, international.

46:06.840 --> 46:07.520
No, that's wrong.

46:07.520 --> 46:08.480
That's not a good title.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.720
It's Gadsukamuka.

46:09.720 --> 46:10.440
Gadsukamuka.

46:10.440 --> 46:11.240
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.320
Gadsukamuka.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.160
Which is the name of the plate company.

46:14.160 --> 46:16.160
Oh.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.960
It's centered, it's a serious centered around the intrigue

46:18.960 --> 46:20.080
of the plate company.

46:20.080 --> 46:21.560
All right, Gadsukamuka plates.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.240
OK, all right.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.680
Gadsukamuka plates.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.280
You know what?

46:26.280 --> 46:29.240
And the billboards for the show say, you know what?

46:31.800 --> 46:33.360
Now serving murder.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.960
As murder serves three.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.680
Come back for seconds.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.760
Degrees, murders.

46:40.760 --> 46:45.880
The plates are disposable, but the crimes last forever.

46:45.880 --> 46:50.560
Kind of thing, like, heartache is forever.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.200
I don't want to keep developing this show.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.160
Not because I don't believe in it,

46:55.160 --> 46:57.280
because I'm starting to get greedy.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.600
Right, yeah, I don't want people to know about this.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.160
I have a first look with FX.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.400
I don't want to believe this.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.600
Gadsukamuka plates.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.320
I mean, I think this is probably like a six episode

47:07.320 --> 47:08.600
Netflix-y kind of thing, right?

47:08.600 --> 47:10.280
I mean, you like spotlight.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.840
Yeah, which was a six episode.

47:11.840 --> 47:15.320
Well, shit, if it's on Netflix, well, it's not develop it.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.240
Let's just make it a 10 hour story,

47:17.240 --> 47:19.440
chop it into six parts, and go home.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.960
Uh-oh.

47:20.960 --> 47:24.560
Shots fired on Netflix.

47:24.560 --> 47:28.440
Shots fired most successful TV venue.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.400
I warmed up to Mindhunter, but it

47:31.400 --> 47:33.280
couldn't use more paper plates.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.720
There are Mindhunters in criminal minds, I think.

47:36.720 --> 47:40.120
Like, I think most of the show is a bunch of Mindhunters.

47:40.120 --> 47:44.240
Did the Golden Globes go off without a hitch?

47:44.240 --> 47:49.760
Oh my god, I am still recovering after that Oprah speech.

47:49.760 --> 47:51.320
That's all I'm seeing on Instagram

47:51.320 --> 47:53.200
is people posting pictures of Oprah.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.760
Just the most generic things about it, too.

47:55.760 --> 47:59.120
Just like you had to have been either very impressive

47:59.120 --> 48:00.320
or very not impressive.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.240
Did she go there, or did she not go there?

48:02.240 --> 48:04.160
I think she went there.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.680
She gave everyone a car.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.400
The disappointing thing would be amazing if she literally

48:08.400 --> 48:11.760
gave everyone a car, not just the people at the Golden Globes,

48:11.760 --> 48:13.760
just everyone, all of us.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.800
We all get a car.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.280
As a measure of her actual wealth.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.720
That we're sitting here snarking her,

48:17.720 --> 48:20.640
and then we go home and we have a car.

48:20.640 --> 48:21.960
And then, yeah.

48:21.960 --> 48:25.760
It's in your busted garage right now, next to the Segway.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.160
I'm the only one that doesn't have a car,

48:27.160 --> 48:31.840
because my garage door is busted, so everyone took my car.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.080
Is the Segway still down there?

48:33.080 --> 48:34.280
Did you remove it?

48:34.280 --> 48:34.840
No, we didn't.

48:34.840 --> 48:35.680
The Segway never existed.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.520
Yeah, it was a trick of the line.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.440
I was cooler than that.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.280
The Segway, I got.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.640
You missed an opportunity in that photo

48:41.640 --> 48:45.160
that you and Cody both posted photos of it, I think.

48:45.160 --> 48:47.080
And what you do, the way you get away

48:47.080 --> 48:49.640
with you having an embarrassing Segway in your garage,

48:49.640 --> 48:52.280
is you say that that's what the drunk driver was on.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.280
I know.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.960
He drove the Segway through your garage door.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.760
I kept going until he hit the back wall.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.520
I figured that out after you said it.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.800
I mean, bonus points for actually taking the Segway

49:01.800 --> 49:04.760
and placing it at the point of impact.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.160
Do you think that would be too much?

49:06.160 --> 49:08.760
You just tipped over sideways with a couple of beer cans.

49:08.760 --> 49:12.080
Put a chalk line that's shaped like a Segway in front

49:12.080 --> 49:13.560
of the garage.

49:13.560 --> 49:21.040
Speaking of Hollywood gossip, I don't want to get you guys

49:21.040 --> 49:22.840
in trouble because of your personal relationships.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.040
Can I just say I was at a party?

49:26.040 --> 49:28.560
There was a birthday party of a famous musician.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.840
Yeah, can we talk about this, or can we not talk about this?

49:31.840 --> 49:35.040
All I want to say is, let me vet this with you

49:35.040 --> 49:36.640
and you tell me if I can say it.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.200
I just want to say that Johnny Depp was at the party,

49:39.200 --> 49:42.680
and I think he was literally wearing a hat on a hat.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.040
I can confirm this.

49:45.040 --> 49:49.360
He was literally, he was like a beanie on a beanie.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.920
He was wearing all of the costumes

49:51.920 --> 49:55.040
from the last eight Pirates movies at the same time.

49:55.040 --> 49:57.400
He had a lot of shit on him.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.400
I couldn't believe it.

49:59.400 --> 50:00.880
Yeah, he was wearing layers.

50:00.880 --> 50:02.080
I'm so celebrity blind.

50:02.080 --> 50:03.760
I didn't know that I was standing next to Courtney

50:03.760 --> 50:06.440
left for 10 minutes until somebody pointed out

50:06.440 --> 50:08.400
that I was Courtney left standing.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.520
She really gave me the heebie-jeebies.

50:10.520 --> 50:14.800
Just in the vein of harmless gossip,

50:14.800 --> 50:17.240
I'm not going to cross a threshold into defamation

50:17.240 --> 50:18.000
or anything like that.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.560
I think she'd be happy to hear this, me gossiping about this.

50:22.560 --> 50:26.480
But at the same time, it's totally shallow crap

50:26.480 --> 50:28.240
that's just starfuckery.

50:28.240 --> 50:30.000
I was at a party and Courtney Love was there.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.920
But it was noteworthy to me.

50:33.920 --> 50:39.720
I was like, wow, she looks healthy.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.600
She looks great.

50:40.600 --> 50:42.160
Yeah, that's all I wanted to say.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.520
She looks better than she did 10 years ago, which is something.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.240
It takes on a new tone now because you're

50:46.240 --> 50:48.080
like, oh, you're not supposed to judge people,

50:48.080 --> 50:49.080
objectify on that stuff.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.680
But Courtney Love, I think, is a special case

50:50.680 --> 50:52.000
because it's like, well, she's Courtney Love.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.600
She was sort of like a tarot card for like,

50:54.600 --> 50:58.240
she was the American, I don't know.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.160
We always have these archetypes that we sell.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.640
And we go like, oh, she's crazy.

51:01.640 --> 51:02.960
She's doing, she's drunk.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.880
Yeah, she's had her ups and downs.

51:04.880 --> 51:10.520
But for somebody who had that archetype and that power,

51:10.520 --> 51:14.840
she was like, yeah, she looked very healthy.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.640
Who cares about my opinion about who looks healthy?

51:17.640 --> 51:18.920
I think that gets into character.

51:18.920 --> 51:20.480
I find that being an accused murderist

51:20.480 --> 51:22.280
takes a lot of years off.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.960
What did you say?

51:23.960 --> 51:26.680
Being an accused murderist.

51:26.680 --> 51:29.600
I didn't mean to make you repeat it.

51:29.600 --> 51:30.560
What's the deal with that?

51:30.560 --> 51:31.440
Can we talk about Charles Fleischer, though?

51:31.440 --> 51:34.000
You know, let's talk about Courtney Love's

51:34.000 --> 51:36.080
involvement in Kurt Cobain's death.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.680
Well, I think if we talk about that

51:37.680 --> 51:39.360
and then talk about Charles Fleischer,

51:39.360 --> 51:42.080
we'll definitely never be invited to any parties ever again.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.280
That'll be the only result.

51:44.280 --> 51:46.480
Charles Fleischer, the voice of Roger Rabbit.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.840
But it is important to say, Charles Fleischer

51:48.840 --> 51:50.240
has become physically specific.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.720
He's become a mythical creature.

51:51.720 --> 51:54.560
What happened with Charles Fleischer?

51:54.560 --> 51:57.000
That is for God to answer.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.120
Did you guys listen to Skulljuice?

51:59.120 --> 52:00.600
Is that what you're talking about?

52:00.600 --> 52:01.760
No.

52:01.760 --> 52:04.320
But if you have not heard the Skulljuice episode

52:04.320 --> 52:06.840
with Dino Stamatopoulos and Andy Dick or Charles Fleischer,

52:06.840 --> 52:08.680
it's momentarily a guest.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.680
It's arguably the only listen episode.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.680
Dino throws him off the show kind of.

52:12.680 --> 52:15.080
No, he just drives him off the show.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.240
It was fucking.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.280
It's the best episode.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.160
It's the only episode you've got to listen to.

52:19.160 --> 52:21.720
I think it's the best episode of a podcast I've ever heard.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.520
It was amazing.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.520
It was certainly like this belongs in a museum.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.400
You don't have to love or hate Roger Rabbit

52:26.400 --> 52:30.400
or no Dino or Andy Dick or give a shit about podcasts

52:30.400 --> 52:31.320
who love this episode.

52:31.320 --> 52:34.920
Because the amount of conflict that happens in the first four

52:34.920 --> 52:37.520
minutes is outrageous.

52:37.520 --> 52:38.020
Yeah.

52:38.020 --> 52:40.120
Charles Fleischer was just kind of haunting the party.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.400
And when the cake came out, he just

52:41.400 --> 52:42.680
wanted to eat all the cake.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.960
Do you think it's OK to talk about just the one thing

52:44.960 --> 52:48.680
that I think the listeners would be interested in without?

52:48.680 --> 52:50.840
We don't have to talk about whose house the party was at,

52:50.840 --> 52:55.160
but just the interesting fact about how the party kind of

52:55.160 --> 52:56.320
went off the rails.

52:56.320 --> 52:56.880
Is that?

52:56.880 --> 52:59.000
Do you think that's too?

52:59.000 --> 53:03.080
Well, let me tell it then carefully,

53:03.080 --> 53:05.600
because I don't want anybody to get upset,

53:05.600 --> 53:07.560
because I did do some looking.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.640
And thankfully, it didn't seem to explode online or anything.

53:10.640 --> 53:11.840
And there hasn't been any gossip,

53:11.840 --> 53:14.040
so I don't want it to start here.

53:14.040 --> 53:18.120
But someone made the mistake as anyone

53:18.120 --> 53:20.080
who's ever been to a Hollywood party, which I'm sure

53:20.080 --> 53:22.840
is all of these listeners knows.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.160
You're not supposed to say where you're at,

53:25.160 --> 53:26.520
and it's pretty tight.

53:26.520 --> 53:30.200
And you don't want anybody just showing up

53:30.200 --> 53:31.840
to like a house party or whatever.

53:31.840 --> 53:32.920
If you can't believe you're there.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.320
When you have Johnny Dapp there or whatever, like, yeah.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.040
If you can't believe it.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.200
Don't put the address on Facebook.

53:37.200 --> 53:39.120
I didn't know that you and Cody are going to be there.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.400
I was blown away that you and Cody and just couldn't believe

53:41.400 --> 53:41.880
you were there.

53:41.880 --> 53:42.400
I know.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.520
There were so many people who didn't belong there.

53:43.520 --> 53:47.400
Who let this rabble in?

53:47.400 --> 53:50.400
And already, it was a little bit too loose of a guest list.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.600
Like, once we came in, the owner of the house

53:52.600 --> 53:55.400
was not too pleased with just how many people were in his house.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.280
He wasn't quite prepared for that.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.320
But someone had the bright idea to like,

53:59.320 --> 54:02.800
I don't know if they deliberately posted it on Instagram

54:02.800 --> 54:07.560
or if they location tagged where they were without thinking

54:07.560 --> 54:08.240
or something.

54:08.240 --> 54:11.400
But somehow, the address got out.

54:11.400 --> 54:15.040
And like, teenagers started showing up.

54:15.040 --> 54:19.960
Like, young fans of the, it was just like,

54:19.960 --> 54:22.600
they were pounding on the gates.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.560
And there had been, like, ballet.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.160
We can say it was Sting's house.

54:27.160 --> 54:28.160
It was Sting's house.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.000
No, it was Sting's house.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
We can talk about this now.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.680
It was Steve's place.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.200
No, Sting's house.

54:34.200 --> 54:38.000
The phrase Sting's house is already funny.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.200
Like, I never imagined him living in a house.

54:40.200 --> 54:46.080
I would imagine him living in a nest, like under the Aurora

54:46.080 --> 54:46.840
Borealis.

54:46.840 --> 54:49.640
Like, it was a nice tree house.

54:49.640 --> 54:52.320
It was the biggest tree house party I've ever been to.

54:52.320 --> 54:56.400
Sting lives in an igloo that's.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.800
Inside of a yurt.

54:57.800 --> 55:02.400
He has a, yeah, inside his yoga sweat lodge is an igloo.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.280
He lives, yeah, he lives in an igloo inside a yurt.

55:05.280 --> 55:07.560
And all of his appliances are powered

55:07.560 --> 55:11.360
by the temperature differential between the yurt

55:11.360 --> 55:12.560
and the igloo.

55:12.560 --> 55:17.920
So yurt compound connected with hammocks.

55:17.920 --> 55:22.200
It has a half-life of 700 years and two orgasms.

55:22.200 --> 55:27.160
All of the electricity is powered by his own self-interest.

55:27.160 --> 55:27.640
OK.

55:27.640 --> 55:28.160
Fuck Sting.

55:28.160 --> 55:30.160
We can't punish Sting for our interest in him.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.120
Sting's the worst.

55:31.120 --> 55:31.760
All right.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.880
You were at his house.

55:33.880 --> 55:35.520
We weren't really at Sting's house.

55:35.520 --> 55:37.200
For the purposes of this story, we're just

55:37.200 --> 55:39.120
going to keep pretending it's Sting's house.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.320
So it's Sting's house.

55:40.320 --> 55:43.040
I'm sorry if anybody thought that we were at Sting's house.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.000
We got derailed just because the phrase Sting's house

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
was really entertaining to me.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.640
But basically, the end of the story

55:47.640 --> 55:49.320
is that there was property damage

55:49.320 --> 55:52.400
because someone leaked a location of this party.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.720
And these kids broke like the front gate and the back gate.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.080
We're talking about stealing.

55:56.080 --> 55:59.640
And it ended up in this everybody out scenario

55:59.640 --> 56:02.000
that sent the kids who were trying

56:02.000 --> 56:06.760
to break in with the party guests, including Courtney Love

56:06.760 --> 56:10.400
and anybody else who was like some hot shot out

56:10.400 --> 56:12.920
on the street at the exact same moment all trying

56:12.920 --> 56:14.560
to get cars at the same time.

56:14.560 --> 56:15.920
And that's kind of fun for the kids

56:15.920 --> 56:17.520
to know that if you're at a Hollywood party

56:17.520 --> 56:20.400
and shit goes sideways enough, you

56:20.400 --> 56:23.280
will get shoved into the street with famous people.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.480
Yeah, now it's going to be the goal, right, like after this.

56:26.480 --> 56:29.880
You and Cody had left before the fur hit the fire.

56:29.880 --> 56:31.360
Right before.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.320
Then things got crazy and everyone's being yelled at.

56:33.320 --> 56:38.600
And the guy who threw the party was mad at the birthday person.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.800
But we found out, I thought Johnny Depp got thrown out

56:40.800 --> 56:42.560
with us because we all got thrown out.

56:42.560 --> 56:44.840
We all made our way out the door at the same time.

56:44.840 --> 56:47.840
Johnny Depp was apparently there at 3.30.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.000
No, he stuck around.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.120
Cleaning up.

56:50.120 --> 56:50.600
Whoa.

56:50.600 --> 56:51.800
He apparently went to work.

56:51.800 --> 56:52.560
That's all right, man.

56:52.560 --> 56:53.000
That's all right.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.640
And used one of his 9,000 scarves

56:54.640 --> 56:57.000
to wipe down the fucking kitchen counter.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.960
And while the birthday boy was being bitched out

57:00.960 --> 57:05.400
by the host and being surly and, you know,

57:05.400 --> 57:07.800
petulant on the couch, Johnny Depp was up there cleaning up

57:07.800 --> 57:10.440
cups and fucking wiping down the fucking shit.

57:10.440 --> 57:12.760
And he was being like the mensch of the party.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.960
And he was the good friend who stuck around

57:14.960 --> 57:16.200
and tried to make it better.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.120
Johnny Depp had a hefty bag, like red solo cups.

57:18.120 --> 57:18.120
Oh, no.

57:18.120 --> 57:18.600
It's cool.

57:18.600 --> 57:19.760
No, no, it's all right.

57:19.760 --> 57:21.360
No, no, Johnny, you don't have to do it.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.240
No, it's all right, man.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.400
It's all right.

57:23.400 --> 57:27.920
Oh, man, anything I can do to help, man.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.560
But he and Courtney sang a song together.

57:29.560 --> 57:30.640
And I got to say.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.080
Johnny never sang, but yeah.

57:32.080 --> 57:32.680
He played guitar.

57:32.680 --> 57:33.360
He played guitar.

57:33.360 --> 57:34.080
And Courtney sang.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.720
It was not that good.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.440
I was disappointed.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.040
Oh, come on.

57:37.040 --> 57:40.160
It was like a little impromptu, like, living room set.

57:40.160 --> 57:40.840
What was bad?

57:40.840 --> 57:41.640
The song?

57:41.640 --> 57:43.200
The music or the lyrics?

57:43.200 --> 57:43.680
I don't know.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.680
I just, at some point, the party.

57:45.680 --> 57:48.840
I want to know who's worse at singing or guitar.

57:48.840 --> 57:49.840
I don't know.

57:49.840 --> 57:50.480
Come on.

57:50.480 --> 57:53.440
So anyway, I'm fucking Sting.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.480
And I mean fucking him.

57:55.480 --> 57:59.720
And Sting is still coming.

57:59.720 --> 58:05.080
I made him come for the first time since Quadrophenia.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.600
It's a movie.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.760
Yeah, well, so we'll find out what Oprah did.

58:09.760 --> 58:14.640
And I don't think she did something encouraging.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.800
Joe Perry from Aerosmith is walking around a bunch.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.040
And I was very excited about that.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.960
I wanted to meet him, but he was too afraid.

58:19.960 --> 58:21.360
How thoroughly effective.

58:21.360 --> 58:23.280
I didn't quite, Cody sent me a link

58:23.280 --> 58:25.720
so I could try to understand the context.

58:25.720 --> 58:29.120
But I was preoccupied, the all black thing.

58:29.120 --> 58:34.960
What was the, that was an Amber Tamblyn spearheaded thing.

58:34.960 --> 58:37.440
And what was the definition of it?

58:37.440 --> 58:41.080
It was, if you're a woman and you're going to the Golden

58:41.080 --> 58:42.600
Globes, wear all black.

58:42.600 --> 58:43.440
Is that it?

58:43.440 --> 58:45.720
It was, I saw something about this

58:45.720 --> 58:49.480
that was about showing solidarity for women in the workplace

58:49.480 --> 58:51.480
at the Golden Globes by wearing all black.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.560
Because I saw, and I did the article,

58:53.560 --> 58:56.960
I feel embarrassed saying I skimmed to a bram,

58:56.960 --> 58:58.280
like I barely read it.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.720
But it was because I was preoccupied.

59:00.720 --> 59:05.800
But it was brooded in a narrative

59:05.800 --> 59:10.600
about the culture of super slim dresses

59:10.600 --> 59:12.280
and worrying about your weight and all this stuff.

59:12.280 --> 59:15.360
But I didn't quite understand, I didn't

59:15.360 --> 59:18.600
make the connection from zooming through the thing.

59:18.600 --> 59:23.000
Why, if let's wear all black, really just meant let's just

59:23.000 --> 59:26.280
wear whatever and not worry about jamming ourselves

59:26.280 --> 59:28.960
into a sequined tube.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.080
I have no idea if it had.

59:31.080 --> 59:33.600
Amber, all it had to do.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.040
Oh, oh, oh, she didn't spearhead it.

59:35.040 --> 59:37.000
OK, sorry, that was Cody.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.040
Cody, do you know a lot about this?

59:39.040 --> 59:41.360
Cody's so high, I'm fucking mescaline right now.

59:41.360 --> 59:42.760
She can't even understand what's going on.

59:42.760 --> 59:45.880
Cody will come up here, she's tripping balls on fucking peyote.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.080
We're going to have to Google Oprah and this all black stuff

59:48.080 --> 59:49.520
and everything after this.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.600
I'm so jealous, Cody.

59:50.600 --> 59:51.920
You look so comfy over there.

59:51.920 --> 59:55.320
This article associates the all black wearing thing

59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.280
with the time's up movement, which just went public recently.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.200
Yeah, so that's like a coalition of women in the industry

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.120
that are coming together.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.840
Time's up is Shannon Doherty.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.560
Me too is Rose McGowan.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.360
And I've had it is Alyssa Milano, right?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.160
Why am I doing that vein of joke?

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.560
That's really going to help my cause.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.040
Well, yeah, because those are the charmed girls and whatever.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.960
Man, I used to have coasters that had charmed stuff on it.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.760
Like it had all the girls and it had charmed

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:38.280
and it had like weeknights at 7 PM on WB.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.480
I had all the Burger King collectible Empire Strikes

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.920
back glasses when I was a kid.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.320
And we had all these awesome in the wrapper Star Wars toys,

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.320
like memorabilia.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.640
And then we just gave them all away to garage sale.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.680
Did you say Star Wars wrapper? Hit it.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.480
Oh, hang on.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.320
Don't fucking just spring it on me.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.280
What you need?

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.800
Oh, hit it.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.480
Just hit it.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.640
Yo.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.720
Yo.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.400
Oh, shit.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.280
Star Wars wrapper.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.000
Yo, have you seen the recent movie?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.880
Yeah, so good.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:26.880
Star Wars Force, Waking Up Last Saber Jedi.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.840
It's the fourth in the prequel series, Star Wars.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.320
This one was directed by the director of Born Identity

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:48.840
and written by seven people, Shane Black,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.560
Scarlett Johansson.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.080
Did you see it or?

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.960
Sure, I saw it.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.440
Well, it opens like, well, don't throw me off.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.920
Let me drop my Star Wars synopsis science.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.480
And description of the last Star Wars movie.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.920
Here we go by the Star Wars wrapper.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.200
Full synopsis, full synopsis.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.080
I'm about to describe the Star Wars movie I saw.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.520
And I've seen them all, I've seen every Star Wars

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.080
that's ever happened from the beginning in 1977.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.160
Take it to the crawl.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.360
The crawl starts by saying it's a dark time for outer space.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.080
And you better believe they make good on that promise.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.080
Buluulu.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.040
After some more words in the crawl,

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.720
it pans down to something that you never, ever saw,

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.720
a big, long spaceship and or planet.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.600
Then you go and something lands on it and a robot probes

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.680
some shit and then some other robots start looking at it.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.560
Then something happens and a laser comes out and, oh my god,

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.440
America shouts, this is the best or worst Star Wars movie ever.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.560
It's not unremarkable garbage at all.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.560
It's not styrofoam.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.080
It's important in some way.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.880
It's either the best or the worst.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.200
It's got to either deny you or quench your thirst

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.520
for a Star Wars movie because God knows

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.840
you can take a franchise and just franchise it.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.280
It's never, ever going to lose any momentum.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.120
Take it to the spoilers.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.600
Just ask the Muppets.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.560
Well, I'm a Muppet rapper.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.920
Oh, I'm a Star Wars rapper.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.360
I'm a Pokemon rapper.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.800
Hey, we all work for Time Warner, Disney, and Marvel.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.280
Oh, the Star Wars movie happened.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.440
And, man, oh, man, you've never seen so many spaceships.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.920
Could you believe that scene where Yoda did more things

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.400
than Yoda should be able to do?

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.800
Shit.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.320
May the force be with you.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.280
Fishman was a new classic.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.640
I'm glad they invented him.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.720
I hope he doesn't get blasted in the next thing.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.600
But that after the title sequence,

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.440
teaser made me think that maybe he might be evil

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.840
or his father might be his mother's sister.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.080
I'm not being sarcastic.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.480
I love rapping about Star Wars.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.960
I'm a Star Wars rapper.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.560
I love this franchise.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.600
I got a lot of faith in it.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.520
Please keep making these movies.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.680
Make 100 more.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.000
Make 1,000 more.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.240
Make a million more.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.760
Keep asking me to come to the theater door.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.520
I'm going to camp outside on the sidewalk all night.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.640
I'm going to get into a horrible night

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.480
fight with other nerds about whether we

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.040
should wait longer or who cut in line.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.880
And meanwhile, the country is crumbling.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.960
Well, I am mumbling about enamel pins with Princess Leia's

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.800
good CG face out of Star Wars.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.200
When they're going to fight those Star Wars.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.080
I'm a Star Wars rapper.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.040
You won the battle, the Star Battle, but not the Star War.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.540
Oh.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.960
Thank you.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.960
Thank you.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:34.720
Darth Ga Ga, the newest Sith Lord with a lightsaber

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.800
that has two blades coming out of the handle

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.280
and, of course, little tiny lightsaber hand guards

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.480
coming out of the hilt.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.440
What could be cooler and smarter and sexier than that?

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.680
A lightsaber with fucking little baby lightsabers

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.640
that come out in case someone tries to do that move where

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.240
they slide their lightsaber down yours

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.720
and cut your fingers.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.520
You'd be like, psych.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.320
No, it's like, yeah, it makes sense.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.920
You buy a big book of swords, and you get out your sketchbook

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.840
and you design new lightsabers, because that's

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.320
where we needed to innovate.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.760
Nothing was really working about the lightsaber.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.320
Really?

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.240
I mean, was it a stick with a laser

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.200
that's still coming out of it?

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.640
Oh, jeez, let's reboot that.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.880
I mean, people are probably sick of that shit.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.000
And after all, really, didn't the person

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.520
that designed the original lightsaber,

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.640
weren't they really working within limitations?

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.880
I mean, and weren't they defined by them?

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.640
There was no imagination happening

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.040
in the original Star Wars.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.720
It's not like now that you have computer technology,

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.080
you should just go, OK, that shit is designed,

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.760
how it's designed.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.440
It happened a long, long time ago

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.120
in the fucking galaxy far, far away.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.600
So why would you upgrade the goddamn fucking?

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.120
Why would you have a lightsaber with two blades?

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.360
I want to fart on your shit and eat it.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.480
Have you considered that it's actually extremely badass?

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320
To be fair, you have to have a high IQ

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.680
to like the new Star Wars.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.240
But the technology improved in prequels.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240
Well, it's hard to argue that.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240
Which means it kind of went back in time

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.120
getting better lightsabers.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.720
It's extremely badass.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.560
Can you imagine the ultimate insult of you taking a shit

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.880
and somebody walking over and farting on your shit?

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.280
And then eating it.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.120
Oh, sorry.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.800
It's me.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.160
It's me, the Star Trek rapper.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.760
We should also revisit that franchise a thousand times.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.920
You know what we should really, generally do

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:06.200
is only make things that have already been made.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.000
It makes sense.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.440
Everybody knows that.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.600
It's this new sustainability.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.360
It's recycling.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.520
Do you think have the Star Wars and Star Trek

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.200
rappers ever collaborated together?

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.800
Was there ever a song that you got together?

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.120
I'm already exhausting myself.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.600
And I can already feel like, why am I

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.800
trying to get people to hate me?

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.560
Yeah.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.560
Hey, don't forget me, the Blade Runner rapper.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.520
Yo, Blade Runner.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.520
Blade Runner 2049.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.440
Yo, yo, a Blade Runner reboot, reboot, reboot, reboot,

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.920
reboot, reboot, reboot, Blade Runner.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.840
Yo, you are a robot.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.720
Are you a robot?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.480
Or are you a human?

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.520
Yo, I'm going to haunt you down,

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.040
but I'm wearing ghastly not Harrison Ford.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.760
But Harrison Ford's still in the movie

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.040
because he's still alive.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.280
So put him in the movie.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.080
But put him in three quarters of the way through

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.080
and then make him co-star and put him on the poster.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.480
Yo, it's a brilliant movie.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.520
You're not allowed to hate it.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.160
Because they used Vangelis in the soundtrack

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.040
and made it totally fucking up.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.400
So it's Citizen Godney fucking Kane.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400
Except here's the thing.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:28.760
It's boring.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.640
B to the O to the I and G. I saw Blade Runner.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.800
It bored me.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.040
I'm 45 years old.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.240
I don't give a fuck.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.920
You can't convince me that I had a good time.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.640
You can't convince me I'm sneezing.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.960
You can't convince me I'm laughing.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.440
You can't convince me it's pleasing.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.960
I'm not entertained.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.200
I didn't like it.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.400
Blade Runner was dumb.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.800
I won't take it away from you.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.800
I won't try to convince you that you didn't like it.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.520
However, if you yell at me for not liking it,

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.720
I will make fun of you.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.360
And I will know that you're 25.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.640
Blade Runner 2049.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.880
Very boring movie.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.600
Shouldn't have waited in line.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.560
You were stupid.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.000
I got a screener.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Don't be mad.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.680
Don't be meaner.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.120
You suck my dick.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.120
It fucking, it was boring.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.640
Why would I care about your hologram girlfriend?

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.480
You didn't hack the circuitry.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.920
She's not special.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.320
She's not Johnny Five.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.840
She's a fucking hologram.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.440
She's not alive.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.600
So she gets stepped on at the end.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.280
I don't fucking care.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.920
It doesn't send me into fucking any kind of arc.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.280
She never existed.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.160
She's a fart.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.400
She's a cloud.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.120
He's a fucking robot.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.320
None of it matters.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.000
Nothing matters.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.040
The whole movie didn't matter.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.480
Nothing happened that mattered.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.240
The movie didn't matter.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.240
By the way, the one thing that mattered

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.000
is the idea that robots were making babies.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.040
And it was never explained.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.600
What the fuck?

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.880
Robot babies?

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.160
The robots are making babies.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.600
All right.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.640
So they're not robots, then?

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.400
Who cares?

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.960
Robots are made of metal and can run through walls.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.480
And if you shoot them, they don't fall down as quickly.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.320
They're like zombies that way.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.200
That's what makes them cool.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.600
And you can tell convicting stories

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.400
about what it's like to be something that's not human,

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.640
like Frankenstein or the original Blade Runner.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.400
But then if you make a movie based on a movie that you liked,

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.800
you run the risk of making a Xerox of a Xerox

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.960
of a phantom of a thought.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.000
And you might be just stupid and pretending to be smart.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.600
Blade Runner sucked.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.200
Blade Runner sucked.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.200
Given a million awards, I don't care.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.520
Kick me out of Hollywood.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.880
Put me in prison.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.080
It fucking sucked.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080
If I have to pretend Blade Runner was good,

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.400
and we're going to keep working here, I will kill myself.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400
Sorry.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.600
Blade Runner sucked.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600
You know what was pretty good?

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.920
What was good?

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.040
Eitania was good.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.400
It was a movie about a figure skater.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.600
Sorry.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.760
Eitania was pretty fun.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.800
But you know, that means I'm getting old.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.280
I'm getting old.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.360
But I don't think 18-year-olds liked Blade Runner 2092

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360
or whatever it is.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.600
I think it's people my age that were like,

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.120
well, Blade Runner was awesome.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.240
And I understand the emotional concept

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.440
that you were terrified that they were going to fuck up

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.920
Blade Runner when they fucked up Robocop,

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.160
the way they fucked up everything,

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.080
that we've gotten so scared that they're going to fuck

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.520
everything up that you were relieved that it wasn't fucked up.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.240
But not fucked up doesn't mean good.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:12.120
And you know, if you don't believe that,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.320
call a Lyft and have your driver be either fucked up

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.600
or not fucked up.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.400
And do you want to drive you home?

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.560
We had a Lyft with a dog in it the other day.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.120
A little puppy named Phoenix was in the front seat.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.720
And she just jumped in the back seat with us

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.680
and laid in our laps and wanted tum-tum rubs.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.960
And it was the best thing in the world.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.080
That was the best Lyft ever.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.240
Although I couldn't help but think, you know,

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.560
what if you were allergic and you'd gotten to that Lyft?

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.160
You just, it would be a nightmare.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.280
I walked in, I was already happy because I looked,

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.800
Phoenix's little puppy was in the front seat.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.160
I didn't see the dog.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.200
I saw a nice, brand new lint roller in the little mesh,

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.520
you know, seat pouch, you know, thing, seat back thing.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.120
Oh, that's nice.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.200
He has a lint roller.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.160
And then you find out why, because it's a little dummy.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.600
Head pops around the corner.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.280
And a little dummy in it.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.680
And this one's tum-tum rubs.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.760
Aw, Phoenix.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.840
Phoenix seemed to be trained, too.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.680
This seemed to be a thing.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.440
Phoenix knew to wait for the signal

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.680
that the people in the back seat wanted Phoenix in the back seat

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.080
and then jumped back there.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.000
And then knew when our ride was over

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.680
and hopped back into the front seat.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.760
Knew it when the car came to a stop and the thing,

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.240
like, you have arrived at your destination.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.360
And Phoenix got out of our way so we could, you know,

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360
get out and do our thing.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.800
It was adorable.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.240
He's got it.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.880
Yeah, baby, he's got it.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880
I'm your Phoenix.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.560
Uber Phoenix.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.680
Oh, sorry.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.160
Uber Phoenix.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:37.920
What time?

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.360
I can't.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.680
Let's get some Levy up here.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.400
Steve Levy?

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:42.760
OK.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.960
Come join us, Levy.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.040
But I'm warning you now.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.760
Yeah.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.920
Haircut, Levy.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.840
He's got a haircut, Levy.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.840
What's up, Steve?

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.600
Were you in Miami?

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.040
I don't know.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.640
I went to school there.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.040
Yeah.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.560
How was your holidays?

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.160
Did you travel?

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:04.880
I think you did, right?

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.320
Yeah, I went home.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.840
It was not good.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.560
You almost died, you said, outside?

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.320
I did, yeah.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.240
It was hard.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.760
It was a hard week for me.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.440
Just weather-wise or emotionally?

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.160
I was freezing.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.640
I mean, I got sick.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.160
So I was bedridden for like three or four days.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.520
And the first morning, I was sick.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.160
I woke up and I couldn't move my arm.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.040
Couldn't move it more than this.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.360
And it was really painful.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.680
For $5 a month, you can subscribe to Hymontown

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.840
and see how much his arm could move.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.360
And I couldn't sleep because every little movement

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.200
hurt my arm.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.800
It was just so painful.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.880
What happened to your arm?

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.360
Well, I thought, like, oh, this will get better.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.040
And I was just in bed for a couple of days.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.040
I was getting over this cold, whatever it was.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.440
So you thought maybe you slept on it?

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:54.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.320
I thought, like, yeah, a little circulation or something.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.480
And then my mom was like, you have to go to the doctor.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.800
And we go to this old Jewish doctor.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.320
And he's cracking all these jokes.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.880
And I was just in a lot of pain.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.040
He's like, we got to x-ray this thing.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.200
Well, that's not a joke.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.360
That's the thing doctors say.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.480
No, yeah.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.440
Did he say we have bad news and we have worse news?

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.720
Well, he took the x-ray chart, put it on the light thing,

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.880
and circled this thing in my shoulder.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.840
And he was just like, sorry.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.120
You're way too young to be getting this.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.920
It's ultra rare for anyone your age to really get this.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.640
I don't know what to tell you, but you

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:40.280
have a calcium deposit in your rotator cuff.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:40.760
Oh, no.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.280
For real?

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.160
Yeah.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.560
And it's.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.920
Is this part of the joke?

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.400
No.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.960
OK.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.120
And calcium's good for you.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.320
Well, yeah.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.120
But I don't think it's.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:52.960
Not when it deposits.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.960
I don't think it's.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:54.460
Yeah.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.360
I don't think it's related.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.360
But he was just like, essentially, the tissue cells

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.840
and the calcium cells are very, very close.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.480
So your body, when it was making tissue cell,

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.240
it ended up being calcium cell, which is essentially bone.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:21.040
It's like a physical thing that grew in my shoulder.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.520
I mean, all cells are tissue cells.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.760
There's no actual thing called tissue in your body.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.240
I mean, everything's tissue.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.320
You know, he was trying to simplify it, I guess.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.280
But so when I was moving, there was just like this like.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.080
So now there's bone there interfering

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.960
with the rotation of your shoulder.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.840
Well, how are you moving your arm now?

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.400
Well, so what he did was he was like, OK,

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.040
this is going to really suck for you.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:45.800
Oh, no.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.840
So sorry about that.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.520
Oh, my god.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.560
Let's pinpoint where your pain is.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:49.840
Oh, no.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.240
And he was like pushing on certain areas.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.200
He was like, ah, OK, here's the area.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.920
And he takes out this giant needle.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.040
And he goes, OK, on the count of three, I guess,

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.320
this is going to be terrible.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.560
On the count of three, I guess.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.280
Smash it?

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.560
And what he did was he went like this.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.480
What?

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.160
What does he do?

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.120
Is it an ice pick?

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:12.720
What is he doing?

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.440
It's a needle.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.520
And he finds the calcium deposit,

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.920
and he just keeps pushing it in and out like this

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920
to break it apart.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.000
Like a fucking, like he's mashing potatoes?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.080
Yeah, and then he's moving it around like this.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.240
He's scraping it out of your rotator cuff.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.080
This happened for like a minute and 30 seconds.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080
He didn't give you anything before he fucking did that.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.440
It was the weirdest sensation.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.440
Did he give you a belt to bite or something like a stick?

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.280
I was biting my lip.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.920
It actually really hurt.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.840
And you could feel like hitting stuff in there.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.480
No.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.280
And he's like, and then he injects.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.760
Are you sure he was a doctor?

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.240
And he injected cortisone, which is what they give the athletes

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.160
when they're injured.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.800
And he was like, all right, man.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.880
When did he give you the cortisone?

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.440
Like intermittently while through the stabbing.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.800
It was a needle full of cortisone that he squirted out

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.680
while.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.120
Yeah, she's a ling.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.840
But he used it as an ice pick.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.080
Yeah, to break apart a crack.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.720
This sounds like, did he say, hold on,

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.400
I got an idea before he started doing this?

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.240
Oh, he was like, this is what.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.800
This doesn't sound like a procedure that's legitimate.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.240
I'd like to see his diploma.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:14.840
Yeah.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.240
So anyway, he was like.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.200
Jeff, he was Jewish.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.760
He was like, you would think the worst part is over, right?

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.680
And I think it is.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.920
But it's only going to get worse before it gets better.

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.640
Oh, no.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.000
So he's like, the next two days are really going to suck me.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:27.240
What?

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.040
Fuck.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.520
And he's like, you probably won't

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.840
be able to move it as much.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.320
And you'll experience a lot more pain.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.520
And then hopefully over the next couple of days,

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.760
you'll get some movement back and it'll be less tight.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.280
And it's still tight, but.

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.240
And it doesn't hurt.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.840
And not in a millennial way.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.760
It's not tight like it's like lit.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760
Not like cool.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760
Yeah.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.760
Sick.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.080
So then I was bedridden all that day.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.960
And then the next day, my mom was like,

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.400
will you come out to dinner with us?

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.760
It's my boyfriend's 60th birthday.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.960
And it's the doctor.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.460
No.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:02.960
Yeah.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.720
And his daughter's going to come.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.960
And I was like, it'll be a nice thing.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:08.760
I was like, OK, fine.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.960
So we go to dinner.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.520
And like halfway through the meal,

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.440
we're eating and took a bite of this piece of steak.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.400
And it's Saturday night, we're at this popular restaurant.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.920
And it's not going down right.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.960
And I was like, this is not feeling good.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.400
It starts to burn a little bit.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.880
So I drank a bunch of water.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.040
And then I couldn't breathe.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040
I couldn't breathe at all.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.240
It was really bad.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.200
And I was like, in my head, everyone's looking at me like,

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:38.800
are you OK?

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.960
Is it like struggling and making faces?

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.000
When you're really choking, you can't even make a sound.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.400
So people are just looking at you like, what?

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.480
And they're looking.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.560
And I was just like, in my head, I was like, OK,

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.640
there's a 50% chance I could clear this on my own.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.320
And I kind of wanted to.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.240
But it was like, why are you doing this?

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.400
Just take the easy way out.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.520
They're saying, are you OK?

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.800
Do the, you're supposed to do this.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.840
And I was like, I have to give the universal symbol

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.400
for choking.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.120
Did you do it?

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.280
Yeah, so I went like this.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.200
And then my mom was like, oh my god.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.960
And then her boyfriend was just like,

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.120
do you need the Heimlich maneuver?

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.760
And I was like, yes.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.680
And so I had to stand up in the middle of this restaurant.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.040
All of the air just got sucked out of the restaurant.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.440
Everyone stopped what they were doing.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.640
All the tables were looking at me.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.080
I was so fucking embarrassed.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.320
All the waiter was like, oh my god, oh my god.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.000
And then my mom's boyfriend gave me

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.080
the Heimlich maneuver, which wasn't painful at all.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.840
I thought it would be, maybe it was the adrenaline,

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.840
but for 15 seconds.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.480
And then I just started regurgitating all this water

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.320
onto my plate on the table, into the middle of the restaurant.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.560
Everyone's looking at me.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.760
I'm just so fucking embarrassed.

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.680
Please tell me it was like an Olive Garden or something.

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.680
No, no, it was like a really nice.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.240
What was it?

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.280
Why did we spend this podcast talking

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.440
about my harassment of employees?

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.840
This is the.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.640
I had a, it was a really bad, it was a really bad vacation.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.240
Jesus, is that why it took so long for you

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.720
to get on fixing my garage?

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.440
I'm kidding.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.120
God damn it.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.560
The joke is I'm a bad boss.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.280
So then, so then, so then that happens.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.920
And the thing is, you were choking on the steak or no?

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.000
Yeah, it was a piece of steak.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:21.960
It wasn't going down right.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.440
I was like having a hard time breathing.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.480
So it's not related to the cortisone and the shoulder

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:25.720
step.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.920
No, this is a separate thing.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.960
You're choking.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.720
I got sick for four days.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.760
I, well, I, yeah, my arm broke down and then I almost died.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.640
Well, I guess a cortisone could like maybe constrict

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.080
your throat or something.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.160
It was, it was, it was so weird to not be able to breathe.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.960
Like it, it was like simulated drowning.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.200
Like it's happened.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.120
It's happened to probably a lot of people in this room.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.440
There's like a burning here.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.960
And then it was like a cool sensation

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.360
because there was water on top and just like no, just no.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.360
That moment where you realize it was,

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.880
you can't do anything about it.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.400
That it's like actually happening.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.160
And then the weirdest thing we've talked about it

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.880
on this podcast is like the strangest thing happens.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.680
That you, you get ashamed of it.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.080
You don't want it to be happening.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.280
So you want to, you, you kind of have an instinct

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.520
to like get out of there and go die in an alley.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.840
Most choking victims die in the bathroom alone.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.800
They get up and go to the ladies room or the men's room

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.640
and die.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.400
That actually almost, I have the perils of like living alone.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.760
I woke up, I was telling Levi outside

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.520
because he was telling me that he almost died for choking.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.760
A few years ago, I went to a Chinese restaurant

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.040
that I always go to in Chinatown

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.120
and ordered the same thing I always do, the duck.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:41.480
And it was bad duck, evidently, because I woke up

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.160
at like four in the morning with food poisoning

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.120
and couldn't stop vomiting, like projectile vomiting

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:52.320
to the point where it blocked my nasal cavities.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.680
So the nasal cavities get blocked with vomit.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.640
And then I'm continuing to vomit without being able to stop.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.560
And I couldn't take a breath.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.360
And I'm thinking the whole time, I'm like,

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360
isn't this what they tell you about how you can choke

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.520
on your own vomit?

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.640
Isn't this, this must be what it's like when people die

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.520
and how many days is it gonna be before someone finds me?

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520
And I'm like thinking all of this before finally,

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.960
like something happens and like one nostril

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.480
gets just the tiniest bit of air that I'm able to then go,

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.080
like, and I'm still vomiting, but now I've just got

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.160
that little bit of life-saving air.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.240
And I'm like looking at my cat, like how many days

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.200
would it have been before you started eating my face?

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.720
Like I just don't, it was like, wow, like this close,

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.680
like who would have found me?

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.240
How long before someone would have like suspected something?

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.880
Like do cats eat your face when they get hungry?

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.680
The cats start almost immediately.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.800
You stop moving and they're like,

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.640
so you're never gonna feed me.

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.360
Yeah, food runs out and then they're like, well,

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.800
yeah, you look like a big bowl.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.480
Dogs take a couple of days because they're like,

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.160
I feel like this is a test.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.840
This is like him, he fucks with me.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.480
But cats are like, I've been waiting for this.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.840
The weird thing though is in public,

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.000
not that they can do anything,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.560
but as soon as it's over with,

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.480
everyone goes right back to their conversations

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.280
and eating like nothing ever happened.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:08.600
But you know they're not,

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.960
they can't be talking about Game of Thrones.

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.840
They must all be going like, what's up with that dude?

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.680
He choked.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.840
Yeah, I know, I saw him.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.240
It took me like 10 minutes to recover.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.960
I couldn't, I didn't eat the rest of the night

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.440
because I was like, this is, I can't, I just, I can't do it.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.640
And then the next morning I woke up to text from you

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.320
going, a guy drunk drove through my garage.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.560
I'm like, hello.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.960
Wow, Levy.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.840
That was my break.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.600
And I mean, you didn't text back.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.800
I almost died and a guy stabbed me

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800
with an ice pick covered in cortisone.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.160
Can't you deal with it yourself?

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.720
Right, cause you know I would have fired you.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.880
On it.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.800
And then I was stood up on New Year's.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.760
That was fun.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.360
And then, yeah.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.520
Stood up.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.360
Yeah, like we, you know,

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.600
I was supposed to hang out with somebody and then.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.320
Like they flaked or are they,

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.600
I mean like, were you standing?

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.640
Like a hot date, like a New Year's kiss you at midnight?

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.240
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.080
Maybe.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.480
And she fucking boned out on you?

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.400
She didn't come.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.520
There was, I don't know.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520
She didn't show.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.880
Nothing happened, yeah.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.160
Nothing happened, meaning she didn't show up

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.000
or nothing happened?

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:15.840
Yeah, no, no.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.680
No plans happened.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.040
You said stood up.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.240
Yeah, I mean, like we were like, yeah,

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.080
let's hang out in New Year's.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.200
And then, and then we were like, you know,

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.720
this time and then, nope.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.480
They just didn't show up.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.880
Yeah.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.720
Levy.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.720
You're breaking my heart over here, Steve.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.160
Levy.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.200
Well, it was a hard, it was a hard week.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.360
It's only up from there?

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.800
Yeah, I hope so.

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.640
That was on there.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.320
It was a tough first day back at work too.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.760
You know, lots of stuff going on.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.520
Yeah.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.840
Yeah, there's a lot of upheaval.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.120
What are we supposed to do to make this right?

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:51.960
There's not.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.360
Play a little, play a little D&D, I think.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.320
I think we, we forget our work-a-day cares

01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.040
and get into a realm of fantasy and adventure.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.600
Just one shout out about this, about the set design

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.600
and the ongoing technical efforts of our crew.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.840
I don't know, it's beautiful.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.680
It looks great.

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.640
We had a great Christmas.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.680
I mean, our Christmas episode was like whatever

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.760
in terms of content, but the fucking set was like.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.600
That was amazing.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.440
It was great.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.000
I was really envious to not be there for that one

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.200
because it looked so like resplendent.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.160
I loved it.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.760
Is this all Chris and Sarah, like who made all this?

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.600
Awesome.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.200
Oh, thank you.

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.040
I'm a load of water.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:32.880
Thank you.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.600
You want a water, Chris?

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.400
Levy, we got to get you retired.

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.800
I mean, you get bone, bone things.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.760
I kept saying to my mom, I'm dying.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.920
And she's like, you're dying.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.760
Stop it.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.880
But like, I feel like I'm falling apart a little bit.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.600
Well, I mean, I want you, yeah.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.600
We got to get you, we got to get you-

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.920
Between the psoriasis and the-

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.880
I don't want you to die my assistance.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.160
I mean, I want you to-

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.040
I went and got my annual physical

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:57.880
and my doctor told me

01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.360
that I had to stop masturbating.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.200
What?

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.020
I said, why?

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.440
And he goes, because I'm trying to give you a physical.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.280
Oh.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.840
Thanks, Jeff.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.680
You know what?

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.840
There is one thing, I think Chris may have said

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.800
these lights are programmed to the way the show,

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.720
like our voices, like as we talk-

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.560
They light up when the show's going well.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.400
Yeah.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.720
They twinkle.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.600
Each one of those lights is someone on Reddit

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.680
making a comment, it's either positive or negative.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.240
It's based on equalizer, I think,

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.480
like as the levels, it like flickers, I don't know.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.800
I might have made that up.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.360
Is this like bone growth in your shoulder

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.320
going to keep growing?

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.800
He said, it could come back, it may not, who knows.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.280
And then I found out this week, my mom was going,

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:53.280
my mom was complaining about my dad's side,

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.240
like the genetics, the genetics are so bad,

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.680
you're going to end up with all these terrible diseases.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.080
Your grandmother's telling me you need to get a colonoscopy

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080
and I was like, all right.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.120
Wait, your mom said that?

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:03.960
Yeah.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.960
I thought you said, this is a roller coaster.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.080
You said, mom, I'm dying.

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.160
She said, you'll be fine.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.000
I know.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:09.840
And then she walked up the drain and then she came back

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.640
and she's like, well, okay, a few things.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.200
She blames all the bad genetics on my dad's side.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.880
Like I have the psoriasis and whatever,

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.560
my dad died early.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.440
But she was in the throes of being hot

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.160
for this dude that saved your life.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.080
Her boyfriend, her date saved her son from dying.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.520
And that's when she was like driving home and going like,

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.520
plus your dad's full of diseases

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.760
and his whole side of the family's awful.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.840
Cause she was like pumped about this guy.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.960
These are different times.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.840
They're having it different times.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.920
And then she calls me and she goes,

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.680
yeah, my brother gets those all the time.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.800
It might be genetic.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.880
You may get more of them in different places in your body.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.440
Yeah, cause now you know that you're prone to this, right?

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.680
So is there something that he,

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.320
did you get any advice on how to prevent these?

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.040
No, he said it's impossible.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.760
It just like will happen.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.080
You should stop eating calcium.

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.080
Now you just have a new thing to fear.

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.240
I don't know that it's related.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.960
It's like, well, it's a calcium deposit.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.000
So it's kind of related.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.320
They're just growths.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.600
It's like some people grow skin tags and stuff.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.440
It's just like a growth.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.200
Right, I was just gonna say, my Polish genes make it so,

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.000
well, I can't, sometimes they fall off.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.960
I just have erasers that grow on my body.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.080
Yeah, skin tags.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.920
My 100 year old grandma was covered in them.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.240
But I did, so this guy that's dating your mom

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.040
who saved your life, literally saved your life.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:41.880
Yeah, he did, yeah.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.840
On his birthday.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.920
On his birthday.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.960
So let's say things don't work out

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.400
between him and your mom.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.560
And let's say you're at baseball practice

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.200
or at Astronomy Club.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.120
As I usually am.

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:58.080
And he pulls up in his car and he's like toot toot.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.800
And you're like, oh.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.120
And he's like, and you're like,

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.920
you look around for your mom

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.040
and because you know they broke up,

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.000
then it cuts to you getting in the car because, yeah.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.920
And then he's like, hey, I just wanted to hang out

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.320
and how's your mom doing?

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.320
And you're like, Michael, I don't know.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.120
Well, you know, I don't know if this is appropriate or,

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.760
look, what do you, and he's like,

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.680
listen, would you just put in a good word for me?

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.360
You know, be a good guy.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.200
Right.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.080
Tell her I made some mistakes,

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:33.080
but she can record TLCs trading spaces in a schedule

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.680
that if there's too many coal bears,

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.040
you know, it'll balance out.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.560
Like, I'm sorry, that's the fight we got into

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.000
when we broke up and just tell her

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.800
we can share the DVR space.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:51.480
And you're like, Michael, look,

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.400
my mom's her own woman, you know?

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.120
And he's like, you owe me.

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.280
Saved your life, dude.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.280
Yeah.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.080
Like, you weren't talking about how it's her own life

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.040
when you were choking on water and steak.

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.720
And you're gonna be like, yeah, what are you gonna do?

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.440
No, I'll vouch for him.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.280
Oh, okay.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.840
No, yeah, I think he's a good dude.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.800
But all you have to do is go to your mom and say,

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.200
Michael showed up, it was kind of predatory,

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.800
and like, he wants me to put in a good word for him.

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.840
He did save my life, so I have to, I'm passing along.

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.200
He's, yeah.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.720
Yeah, he's not the guy that would,

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.000
a kind of guy that would do that, but yeah.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.040
What if you said no and he like stuffed

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.640
a chunk of steak down your throat?

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.800
I was like, I take this back.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.120
Yeah.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:39.120
He does the ninja thing with the string and the poison,

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.960
except it's a chunk of steak.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.800
Like a troupe here.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.640
Dripping down the string.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.640
I brought you into this world

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.480
and I can take you back out.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.480
I didn't bring you into this world,

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.480
but I did keep you from leaving this world,

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.200
and so I think I might be able to take you out

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.880
if I can convince you to be vulnerable

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880
while you're eating.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.680
Okay, you guys playing?

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.520
Yeah, well, personally, indeed.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.920
I'm gonna excuse myself from the stage then.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.760
Let's thank Church for coming out.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.600
Thank you, Church.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.080
Thank you for taking us to you.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.080
Chords, Chords.

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.120
I call her Chords.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.080
Did we tell the Chords story in the show before, Church?

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:16.920
No.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920
Where were you in Columbia?

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.600
Yeah, I was in Columbia.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.560
Yeah, she was in a Starbucks in Columbia,

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.920
and they asked her what her name was

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.440
to write on her coffee cup, and she said Church,

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.120
and her cup came back and it was Chords, C-H-O-R-T-S.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.040
So guess what she is called

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.960
around the house all the time now?

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.800
Chords.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.080
All right, Suspenser,

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.040
it's been a good long time since I've been here,

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.680
and we haven't played D&D in a long time.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.200
So would you catch me up, and the audience up maybe,

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.160
and kind of give us a brief recap

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.400
of what the hell's going on?

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.240
Yeah.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.360
Do you want the music or no music?

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.320
Whatever you want.

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.120
I'm gonna give you some music, man.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.440
So while this is happening, think about questions

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.200
that might be relevant to getting you guys

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.280
personally back on track with understanding

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.480
what's going on, as I say these things.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.920
Last time on Harmon Quest,

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.000
our heroes had just gotten to Doornester.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.120
They got past the guards after a scuffle

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.480
with undead outside the city.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.440
The guards were sleepy, it seemed, and they got inside,

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.040
and once they were in Doornester,

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.800
they were like, what are we supposed to do

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.000
because they were on the quest for Patchen's gem?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.280
He's gonna keep shoving that up her ass.

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.560
Well, it's not, it's what's happening.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.320
While in Doornester, they split up to look for clues

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.120
and get a lay of the land in the sense of the city.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.920
Jeff or Chad and Diarrhea went to the open air black market

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.480
where they purchased clothes and did aerobics

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.840
with the church of the body temple.

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.080
Meanwhile, Carlos went to the church

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:03.080
where he saw Geffen was making everyone doin' crazy exercises

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.880
because he said they were all on weed.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.000
And then Carlos talked to one of the people

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.120
from the church and realized that this city employs

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.080
a very conspicuous theater as one of its industries.

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.160
And was the theater involved in any of the intrigue?

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.440
It might be the case that it was,

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.440
but we'll find out now on Harmontown Time,

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.120
the quest.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.440
Nice, all right, so are we all together?

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.280
Are we still separated?

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.800
Me and Diarrhea, who were together?

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.960
You had just met back up to kind of discuss

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.560
some of your findings, but yeah, you came to the town,

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.400
you came with Patchen's to help with the quest

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.760
for Patchen's gem because he was going to get the gem back

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.480
because it was important to him.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.040
So you snuck into the town,

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.320
or you got into the town, it wasn't really sneaking.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.040
And Patchen's is not with us, right?

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.560
Patchen's is kind of with you.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.680
He's not like at your beck and call.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.120
Like he kind of shows up and leaves and stuff.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:35:59.960
But yeah.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.920
But he knows that we're a fan.

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.680
He knows that we feel the...

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.520
Rick Elsatran.

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.160
He's anxious and trying to find the gem.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.360
He understands that you're trying to find the gem.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.480
To help him find his gem.

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.320
Yeah, okay, so...

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.560
And reluctant about it.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:14.360
Yeah.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.880
Let's go to this theater.

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.720
Let's go to the theater.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.240
Now, when we get there, let Patchen's do all the talking.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.080
Okay.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.480
Can we just watch Spencer play D&D by himself?

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.960
I'll be so good.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.160
Hey, what's going on?

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.600
What are you talking about?

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.440
Does that happen?

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.280
That happens.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:37.240
All right.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.120
You make your way to the Dornester Theater Company.

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.200
It's one of the biggest buildings in town.

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.440
It's a modern looking building made out of stained planks.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.040
They're stained almost like a black color.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.600
And then the theater itself has a nice sign

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:54.200
that's immaculately and intricately painted

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.800
that says Dornester Theater, now playing.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.160
What's playing?

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.000
It has, it looks like it says the sands,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.760
but it looks like a bunch of letters are missing.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.600
So it probably said something else at one point.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.440
Can we buy tickets to the show?

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.280
The box office isn't open.

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:14.880
Why did we want it?

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.400
What was the point of going to the theater?

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.400
When Dan was at the church, he talked to Peach,

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.760
who was one of the people who had been working

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.120
at the church and stuff.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.240
And he asked if there was any industries.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.280
And Peach said that the only industries were farming,

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.960
milling flour, baking bread, and the theater.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.680
And so...

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.520
I try to open the door.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.480
It's locked.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.080
It's a heavy double door like an audience facing door.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.360
I try to open the door.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.360
It's locked.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.560
It's locked.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.200
Can you pick the lock?

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.320
He's not...

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.280
What hour of the day is it?

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.240
Sorry.

01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:56.600
Let's say it's 1 p.m.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.800
Okay.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.080
And I put my ear to the door.

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.320
Is there a production going on within?

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.640
There are, you hear voices and you hear the sounds

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:09.480
of movement, like, you know, loud steps and stomps.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.200
I knock on the door.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.040
All right.

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:12.880
You knock on the door.

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.680
Like a polite individual.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.400
I do a comedic wince because I had my ear to the door

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.280
when he knocked on it.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.060
So there's like a little, there's room for comedy there,

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.440
but it's execution dependent.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.840
Yeah.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.000
You find room for comedy.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.720
It, the door slowly opens.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.240
Well, it doesn't slowly open.

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.100
After a time, the door opens and there's a big fat guy.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.360
He's wearing all black and he's wearing black tights

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.980
and he's kind of like just poking through the door

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.240
a little bit and he's like, you guys aren't,

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.200
you guys aren't with us.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.400
What does that mean?

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.680
You're not with the theater.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.400
Well, I came to audition.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.240
No, you didn't.

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.560
But why not?

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.840
We're not having audition.

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.440
We don't just have auditions.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.980
Well, I think I'd be perfect for the sands.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.800
What?

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.860
In the new play that I've written,

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.000
which is guaranteed to double your audience size

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.720
and the funding for your theater.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.000
It's about horses.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.040
Well, that all sounds very great.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.400
You want to talk to Shrove.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.480
He's kind of the master of the theater.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.800
Yeah, let's talk to that guy.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.640
Thank you.

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.460
He's not here.

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.200
Where do we find him?

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.040
Small town.

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.160
He's probably around.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.960
He's usually out and about.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.800
Who knows?

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.480
What grabs his attention most?

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.120
What grabs his attention most?

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:35.480
I'd say a snappy loot tune.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.320
Oh.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.160
Snappy loot tune.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.000
Should we go to the center of town

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.280
and start doing our song?

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.080
Just a couple more questions for fatty tights.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.400
Sure.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:52.400
Are you guys doing a performance soon?

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.760
Yeah, we're kind of behind schedule right now,

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.400
but we're trying to get some of the understudies

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.920
up and going with the saints of virtue.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.820
That's the one we're putting on.

01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:03.960
Well, we'd love to come see a performance.

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.800
Yeah.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.920
Well, it's going to be this Saturday,

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.040
which isn't for a while,

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.520
but we got a lot of work till then.

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.760
What happened to your main cast

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.520
that you need to get the understudies ready?

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.360
What?

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.800
You heard him.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:17.640
No, I didn't.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:18.480
What?

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.040
He said, what happened to your main cast

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.240
that had created such a demand for understudies?

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.960
The guy who was playing Saint Aurora

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.360
and the guys that were playing the cunning nests

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.520
and the dashing Fredo both fell absent.

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.360
Yeah.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.560
Both, all three of them.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560
That's a lot of people falling absent.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.760
Yeah, people come and go and kind of like,

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.360
sometimes they go out on little troops

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.280
to do traveling shows and stuff,

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.800
but it's not normal that a bunch of people

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.120
go missing as a result.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.120
How many days have they been missing for?

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.320
Seven, six or seven?

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.120
There are a lot of banditos in this show you're putting on.

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:56.960
What do you mean?

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.640
Bandito characters, traveling, brigands, highway robbers.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:03.920
This whole city is such.

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.760
Look.

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.520
No, they mean in your show.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.080
In the character?

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.560
Yeah, in this show, the Guides of St. Clarice

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.400
or whatever you're putting on.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.560
The Saints of Virtue.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.400
Yeah.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:18.520
The Guides of St. Clarice.

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.400
What's the elevator pitch for that when we had been?

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.280
Never mind.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.360
There's elevators.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.440
OK, well, what's the hand-cranked elevator

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.400
pitch for Clarice's dementia?

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.600
Well, Saint Aurora was the famous Saint of Virtue

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.240
along with his kind of, what do you call it, swordsman,

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.240
his vanguard.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.560
They were known as the Saints of Virtue,

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.320
and they stood for the various goods of the world

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.840
and prevented them from falling into corruption.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.960
Oh, those were the guys that wore the purple costumes.

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.560
And they had the, like in the stories,

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:57.000
they always had the big capes and the crazy purple hats.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.880
I don't remember them being purple.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.160
What did they do?

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.600
No, how did they dress again?

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.040
Oh, how did the Saints of Virtue dress in the play?

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.360
They dress kind of as like Paladins

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.200
or royal, royal, churchly knights, huh?

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.280
I thought I could do a thing about it.

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.160
I pulled diarrhea and Carlos aside,

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.040
and I looked at them and I go, are you guys

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.480
thinking what I'm thinking?

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.680
Pizza.

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.360
Pizza party.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.240
All right, well, what was your name again?

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.120
Gretel.

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:29.960
Gretel.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.520
Gretel.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.320
I thought it was Shrove.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.200
No, that's the master.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.280
Shrove's the theater.

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.640
Well, we'll tell Shrove you said hi.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:36.600
Thank you, Gretel.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.840
I didn't say hi.

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.520
Don't tell him that.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.600
What was something going down between you and Shrove?

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.360
No.

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:43.960
You just don't say hi to each other?

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.720
I just didn't.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.720
I didn't want to.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.120
I mean, we'll say hi to him.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.800
Yeah, no, that makes this a lot simpler

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.000
if I just choose to do that.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.760
And then you know what I'm not going to say to him?

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.400
Is that we had to do this negotiation,

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.520
because he might take offense.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
Yeah, that would be great for me.

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.800
Rope, Shrove.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.800
Break a leg out there for a Saints of Virtue.

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.080
It's an expression.

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.840
It means good luck doing your performance.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.040
Right.

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.560
Good luck.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.600
OK.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.840
Actors are superstitious.

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.160
So if you say break a leg, although some people think

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.480
the etymology is more about just the traditional breaking

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.000
of a leg, meaning you bow.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.120
Right.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.000
What do you guys think we should do?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.600
Well, I pitched a pizza party, but let's go find Shrove.

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.520
Do we?

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.280
I mean.

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.000
Yeah, let's head into the center of town

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.040
where the action is.

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.440
Is there kind of like a main act,

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.720
like active hub in town, Spencer?

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.160
The center of town is kind of the market that you were at.

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.040
You guys want to get on the same page real quick,

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.480
just because I think we're thinking at this point.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:50.480
And it's a long shot, but that this mysterious theater

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.800
troop, because this town is so not, it's not New York.

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.680
I mean, there's not like fucking thieves' guilds

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.480
everywhere, that maybe this theater guild, which

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.720
is a little active for this small town.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.880
And now we're finding out how these actors that have all

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.520
disappeared in the time frame that we got mugged.

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.120
Can I go back in my head and imagine, you know,

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.120
just because we were in that combat,

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.400
like how many dudes we killed, and does that correspond

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.800
with the number of actors?

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.240
The Bandidos, yeah.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.880
I want to say you killed more than three people,

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.080
like maybe five, or maybe two more.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.600
You saying that we might have killed the actors?

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.720
That is what he's saying.

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.560
I'm a wall, I don't mean to high road you.

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.760
I'm just saying, like, this is the thin fucking line.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.240
High road, Martin.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.600
This is the thing we're following.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.760
It's the lead that we got.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.240
It's the idea that in this town, when

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.760
you hire people to do crazy shit,

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.080
you hire these actors, that it's like Patrick Swayze's

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.640
troop in point blank, like they're surfers.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.080
You don't expect them to be bank robbers.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:00.580
Yeah.

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.180
Jeez, all right, well, let's just go find Shrove.

01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.620
And we can crash the thing into the ground,

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.900
you know, this theory.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.300
Yeah, no, I'm just going through my notes.

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.620
It's been so long, I'm a little confused.

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.500
Well, I'm not to.

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.980
I'm going to make you, you take the lead on this one.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.300
Well, let me just verbally, well, we have this chance,

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.260
because I don't want to do this in front of non-player

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.900
characters.

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:26.140
This will help all of us.

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:27.540
This is my working theory.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:33.100
But it's not, I don't believe in it, really, half a wit.

01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:36.940
That we were on the road, we were way-laid by bandits,

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:39.620
they fucked us up, they took Patchen's gem,

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.180
then we came to this town.

01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.100
We're looking around for people that you might hire to do

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.180
such tasks, because the only thing we had to go on

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.300
was a letter that we can't really read, because it's

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.620
written in this kind of guild script.

01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:53.380
The guild script just means that they're professionals

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.780
that were hired.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:57.540
There is no guild in this town, you can't just go to a place

01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.020
that says, like, here's the place where people go,

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.660
you hire people that rob people.

01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:03.900
There's just people that churn butter, cut hair,

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:05.340
and are in this theater troupe.

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:10.540
The theater troupe is the crazy people.

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:13.060
You would expect a theater troupe to be smaller in a town

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.500
this size, it should be like three people doing improv,

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:18.020
like in Green Bay or something, and it'd just be like,

01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.020
kind of, the two of them would be bowlers, and one of them

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.420
would be the guy that hangs up the fly, and one of them

01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.020
would be the guy that hangs up the flyers,

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.860
and the other two are tolerating, because they secretly

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:28.460
fantasize about kicking them out of the troupe,

01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:30.380
but they don't want to do the heavy work.

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:34.860
And instead, we got, like, whoa, we got a bunch of people

01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:39.900
entertaining a small town, and so that's it, that's it.

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:40.860
That's all we got.

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:43.180
OK, so let's go back and infiltrate this theater company,

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:43.820
I think.

01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:46.060
We got to find Rob Schrove.

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:47.620
Schrove.

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:52.220
I'll be the first to admit, I've been fucking this up forever.

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:54.860
I've become a bad leader, this is why they had me locked away.

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.580
Well, now you're shot at redemption here, why don't you take?

01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.820
Yeah, but this has been my shot at redemption,

01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:01.300
I've already fucked it up.

01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.820
I took the lead on this, I'm the reason we're here,

01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:06.180
I'm the reason we took Patchen's gem quest instead of the one

01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:07.740
that was being dangled in front of us,

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:09.580
I feel bad about all of this.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.300
Is Patchen's here?

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.060
Patchen shows up.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:16.460
Patchen's, I just want to say to you, I'm sorry, you know?

01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.660
For what?

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:23.260
For insisting on helping you, when in fact,

01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:26.820
we're the reasons why you needed help.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.980
The last people, you had it right the whole time, man.

01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:32.540
Thanks, man, that means a lot.

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:36.540
But it happens, though.

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.980
So I just wanted to say that clearly,

01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.980
I don't feel like I've been doing this right.

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:41.700
I think you're beating yourself up for no reason,

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.660
I think we've all made mistakes, I think it's, you know,

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:45.900
we're just.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:47.940
I got to tell you something, beating myself up

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.180
is all I know how to do.

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.860
It's the only thing I know that I'm going to do

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.620
that I can do and finish doing.

01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:54.860
Everything else, I stop beating myself up,

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:58.820
I try something, and I just fuck it up.

01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:01.660
And I'm sorry.

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:04.820
All right, the table talk here, Dan, you've got the fucking,

01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.500
I've been away for so long, I don't really

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.060
remember what the hell's fucking happening.

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:11.060
So you think that the actors might be related to those bandits

01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.100
that we got way later?

01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.500
Yeah, I guess, I mean, it's a working theory, but it's like,

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:18.900
I say we just like, let's just dive into it,

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.980
let's go find Shrove, throw him up against a wall,

01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:22.940
say, what are you doing?

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.380
Not literally, I don't mean it that way.

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:25.460
Yeah, I got you.

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:25.980
OK, so.

01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.260
Is this, is your theater troupe, did you

01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.100
get a bunch of guys that died because we killed them

01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:33.500
on a road?

01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.220
We go back into the marketplace.

01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:35.980
All right.

01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:41.100
And we, I asked like a local shopkeeper that looks like some

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:45.140
of them, you know, knows his or her way around town.

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.300
You talked to the fabricators Guild Gnome

01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:48.460
that gave you those clothes.

01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:50.780
Oh, I got flashy clothes now.

01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.860
Am I wearing those now?

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:53.660
Yep, they put a pep in your step.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.660
They did.

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:57.020
I said, hey, do you know a cat named Shrove?

01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:01.020
Yeah, Shrove is like, he's a big, big guy around here,

01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:01.980
like everyone knows Shrove.

01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:02.900
Have you seen him around today?

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:04.380
We're trying to track him down.

01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:08.380
I don't think I've seen him since last evening or so.

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.900
I don't know, I haven't seen him today.

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.620
Does he have a local like haunt that he hangs out at?

01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.060
Sometimes he's at the tavern.

01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.100
I guess most people are sometimes at the tavern.

01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:18.140
OK, we go to the tavern.

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.420
Yeah, I mean.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.940
Oh, OK, bye.

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.300
Oh, thank you.

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:24.540
And nice to see you again.

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:26.300
Would you like to come with us to the tavern?

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:27.700
No, no.

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:28.260
I'm busy.

01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.700
I didn't mean to be so preemptory.

01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.260
To the tavern.

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.380
All right.

01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:36.100
What a tavern is something.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:37.460
The leaky grieve.

01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:41.300
All right, this tavern is labeled the leaky grieve.

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:47.340
As you enter, you instantly feel kind of at ease.

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.660
You don't even necessarily notice.

01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:53.100
But as of getting into this town, maybe even earlier,

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.300
you've just had a sense of dread and foreboding and sadness

01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:59.820
and angst kind of sitting in and settling over your body.

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.180
And you barely even noticed it until you set into this tavern.

01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:05.980
And it actually feels quote unquote right.

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:08.020
And it's great.

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.580
There's yelling and singing, and it's raucous and wild.

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:12.220
And it really has the vibe of what

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.140
you think Dornester seems like it should be.

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:17.420
This town of ruffians that are going hog wild.

01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:18.740
It's a tavern.

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.220
They're yelling and singing, and people are throwing shit.

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:26.100
Yeah, there's a big, big beardy guy

01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.780
who looks like he's over 100, even though he's a human,

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.020
which is weird.

01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.900
Well, it usually implies some magic.

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.260
There's an old dude, and he's behind the bar,

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.540
and he's wiping down the bar.

01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:44.780
And then there's just a bunch of random brigand types.

01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:47.060
They just all kind of look dirty and wild,

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:48.900
and they're kind of scattered around the bar.

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:50.860
Mr. Barkeep.

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.540
Yeah.

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.500
Hey, how's it going?

01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:53.580
You guys are new, huh?

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.660
Yeah.

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.420
The name's Cool Dennis.

01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:59.220
Oh, thanks, Cool Dennis.

01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:00.660
Cool is your first name?

01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:01.740
No.

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.140
I'm so new, I hardly know the prices here,

01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:08.060
but I'd be happy to give you a whole gold piece for a drink

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:11.740
and a little bit of information around town.

01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:14.020
Yeah, man, that's why people come around here.

01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.100
Sure.

01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:18.420
Well, just looking for a fellow named Shrove.

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.340
Shrove?

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.900
I think he's here.

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.420
He's looking around.

01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.820
Maybe he left.

01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:26.780
I think he's here.

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:27.580
I don't see him.

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.020
He's like, he's looking around.

01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.380
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:31.660
He might be in the bathroom.

01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:33.100
Trying to read your face, Cool Dennis,

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:39.900
can't tell if you're shaking me down for an extra gold piece.

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:40.620
He's not.

01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:41.820
OK.

01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:42.380
Never what?

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.180
Never mind.

01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.660
I was thinking out loud.

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:45.900
Here's your gold piece.

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:46.740
Oh, thanks, man.

01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:47.420
I appreciate it.

01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:48.340
Here's your beverage.

01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:50.060
I'll have a dragon's snout.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.780
Here's that beverage.

01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:55.700
I checked the bathroom.

01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.860
It's locked.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:57.700
What?

01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:00.140
I walk up to the old 100-year-old man.

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.380
That's the bartender.

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.420
Oh, so I just stay right where I was?

01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.100
Yeah.

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.380
OK.

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:08.580
Was he in the bathroom?

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:09.220
The bathroom's locked.

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:10.980
Cool Dennis, why is the bathroom locked?

01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.180
Because it's like a one-person bathroom.

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.060
So I don't need a key.

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.140
It's just someone's in there?

01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.380
Yeah.

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.380
You think they're pooping?

01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:20.140
I hate to speculate.

01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:22.180
I stake out the bathroom.

01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:23.220
OK.

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.060
That's weird.

01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:25.140
But yeah.

01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:28.580
Well, that's not something Cool Dennis would do, but.

01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.460
Cool Dennis, why do they call you Cool?

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.860
That's a great question.

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:34.980
I don't really know.

01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:36.300
You seem pretty cool.

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.860
I guess that's why, huh?

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.100
All right.

01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.340
I'd like a drink, too.

01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:42.980
Do you have a specialty cocktail or a special kind of brew

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.420
here?

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:44.940
I have a stout dragon.

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.180
I'll take a stout dragon.

01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:48.020
Hey, Cool Dennis, are there any rumors

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:51.020
in town about ancillary treasures

01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.540
that I could hyper-focus on and turn into our new quest

01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.980
and totally frustrate everybody?

01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.020
I hear there's a bag of holding full beef jerky in town.

01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:02.420
Wait, how much beef jerky is in the bag of holding?

01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.100
10 by 10 by 10 feet of beef jerky.

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:07.500
That's a lot of beef jerky.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.100
So people just hear a bag like that in town?

01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:13.900
They don't.

01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:16.620
I thought that was exactly what you were asking for.

01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.580
I mean, I guess.

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.220
I'm telling you, it is in this town.

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.540
I know for a fact.

01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:23.620
What's happening in the bathroom?

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.580
Bathroom stuff.

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.620
Yeah, you hear pooping.

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:27.780
I hear pooping?

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.060
How about another random one?

01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:31.580
Can I just refresh?

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:34.500
I've been told there's art objects in a locker somewhere.

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.420
I want another one.

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.500
Give me another one.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.580
Some say the plants outside of Miss Marple's kitchen

01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.180
aid travelers?

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.980
One more, one more.

01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.940
I want one more of these.

01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.100
The rocks on the left side of the tree line outside of the west

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.660
are known for their ability to skip

01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:00.940
better than most others.

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.900
I kind of want to see what that planned about.

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.060
The Miss Marple one sounds the promising one.

01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:08.740
I mean, I'd love a bag of holding empty out the beef jerky.

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:09.660
Never will we try to make all that.

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:11.500
But knowing a bag of beef jerky's in town

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.980
does not help you find it.

01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:13.740
No.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:17.940
So we're for, guys, we're on the quest for patches.

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:18.980
Hey, listen, man.

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:23.140
We didn't get on the patch of the quest for patches

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:28.420
here. Remember when we tried to make our own quest?

01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.260
Yeah, let's think about the time when you guys tried

01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:31.540
to make your own beef jerky.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.060
Who's the jerky?

01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.820
Speaking of beef jerky, I wonder how long

01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:41.660
that guy's going to keep pooping in there.

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:45.940
Yeah, I use perception on the bathroom.

01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.540
That's how you heard the pooping sounds.

01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:48.780
Oh, OK.

01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:51.700
Steve, you get smashed in the face by a bottle.

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.020
What the fuck?

01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.060
What the ow?

01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:54.780
What the fuck?

01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:00.780
It only does one damage.

01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.420
Who did that?

01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.180
Steve.

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.100
I examine my surroundings.

01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.380
You see, there's an old dirty hobo.

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.900
He looks even older than Cool Dennis,

01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.660
although he just looks like shit.

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:18.580
And he's wrapped in a dirty, filthy robe

01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.540
that's covered in dried, crusted blood.

01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:23.460
And it seems like it has a bunch of stab wounds on it.

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:27.300
On closer inspection, it seems like the cloak that

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:30.420
got stolen off of what do you call it?

01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.940
Patchens when he got robbed.

01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:34.780
Whoa.

01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:35.380
Wait.

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.460
I don't know if you remember, but when Patchens got robbed,

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.460
they took all his clothes and left naked.

01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:40.940
So this guy's wearing Patchens' cloak?

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.420
Yeah.

01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:42.340
Or it appears to be?

01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:45.620
Hey, why did you fucking, what the hell, man?

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:47.780
Why are you listening to people poop, man?

01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.900
My name's diarrhea.

01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:50.860
That's a great reason.

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.780
I don't know who else is listening to people poop, yeah.

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.860
Well, now I feel foolish.

01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:01.380
Why are you wearing our friend's cloak?

01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.420
This is mine, man.

01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:03.380
This was given to me.

01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.340
By who?

01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.580
The guy that's pooping in that there bathroom.

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:07.940
Whoa.

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.860
Was he jackpot?

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:09.700
I'm great at this.

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:11.140
What's his name?

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.380
What's his name?

01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:13.300
The pooping guy.

01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:13.940
I don't know.

01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:16.220
I'm just some asshole.

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.060
Why do you say that about yourself?

01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.460
I'll tell you my name.

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:20.100
What's your name?

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.300
Mollerous.

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.060
Mollerous?

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:22.660
Yeah.

01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:24.540
And I'm an asshole, and I feel bad.

01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:25.100
Why?

01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:26.140
Why are you an asshole?

01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:27.100
Just look at me.

01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.300
I'm a piece of shit.

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:31.220
He's like all, he's all staggering around.

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.540
No, no.

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.500
I've got to wear this dead cloak.

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:35.740
You're great, dude.

01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:37.420
Why are you wearing that cloak?

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.220
It was given to me.

01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:38.940
I'm a hobo.

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:40.100
By the pooper?

01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:41.140
Yeah, by the pooper.

01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:43.780
I kicked the bathroom door down.

01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:44.620
Damn.

01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:45.340
You kick it down?

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:46.420
You're a no, but not very strong.

01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:47.340
I try to kick it in.

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:48.500
I try to fucking give it my.

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:49.940
What's your strength?

01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:51.780
What's your strength?

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:52.280
12.

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.420
My strength is 10.

01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.580
Yeah, you don't kick it in.

01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:00.740
OK, then I just knock.

01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.220
I kick it and then knock.

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.780
I pretend like my first kick was just my first knock.

01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:09.380
You hear a, yeah, hold on, yeah.

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.740
OK, what did you fall in there?

01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:12.700
What's going on?

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.100
No, just no.

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.540
Other people got a poop, you know?

01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:16.820
Yeah, I believe it.

01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:19.060
Need some Pepto?

01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:22.820
Go around outside and see if there's a window.

01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:25.620
Yes, and don't let anybody get out of it.

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:28.620
Spence, I go around the thing to see if there's a window.

01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.140
You do that.

01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.860
There's a window, yeah.

01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:34.460
Moulrus, how much is that robe worth to you?

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:39.420
A gold.

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:41.540
Here, I'll give you one.

01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:42.780
I'd like it, please.

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:45.060
Thanks, man.

01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:49.140
Now, tell me more details about the sale of it.

01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.260
As many as you have.

01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:51.540
It was just given to me.

01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:52.940
Well, if that's all you have, then you

01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.180
don't get another gold piece.

01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:56.500
But the most things you can remember

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.780
are going to get you all the way up to another gold piece.

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:02.580
Well, there I was in the leaky grieve, completely nude,

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:04.940
as is normal.

01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.380
We have an arrangement around here,

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:10.340
because I'm kind of a known quantity, you see.

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:14.420
But then in comes this guy clutching his gut

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:17.380
and holding a filthy, disgusting,

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:19.700
robe full of crusted blood and stab wounds.

01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:20.300
We got it.

01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.500
Yeah.

01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.060
That's our pooper reserve.

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:23.900
So proud of myself.

01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:25.220
We got the pooper on the pot.

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:26.580
I was just, that was table talk.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:30.420
He looks at me, he looks me up and down,

01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:33.100
and he tosses this thing at me, and he's like,

01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.380
you might need this, certainly more than me.

01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:37.380
I wouldn't even wear this.

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.620
Do you know the guy's name as he's a stranger to you?

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:42.660
He's a stranger to me, a drunken asshole.

01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:44.420
OK.

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:45.700
Because now he's completely naked,

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.380
and he's just holding a gold piece.

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:48.740
He's got nowhere to put it.

01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.100
You totally stripped him naked.

01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:51.780
Got this guy exactly where we want him.

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:55.540
I thought we got the evidence, and he's cornered in the bathroom.

01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.980
I take up a position on one side of the door.

01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:00.020
Wait, don't I get another gold piece?

01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:00.540
Yes, you do.

01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:01.140
I give it to him.

01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:02.780
I've given him two, one for the robe,

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:03.940
and one for his information.

01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.700
I gave one to a cool dentist.

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.260
I am liked in this bar.

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:09.580
I've caused no trouble.

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:11.500
I got my eyes on the bathroom, and I'm

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:15.220
going to go over my loadout, because I'm going to fucking,

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.580
it's time to kick ass in the name of the Lord.

01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:18.180
All right.

01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.380
Mulruth scurries out with the money and naked.

01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:22.580
OK.

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:26.180
So we stake out, we got DJ outside,

01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:28.780
guard in the window of the privy,

01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:31.860
and we got me and Carlos guarding both sides of the door.

01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:34.820
I know you guys can't hear me, but I

01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:37.740
feel like we should catch him on the shitter,

01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.420
unless you want to have a civil conversation.

01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:40.700
We've caught him on the shitter.

01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:43.260
Yeah, no, but I mean, like, don't let him wipe in flush.

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:46.660
Like, he's stuck with his pants down.

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.420
You're talking about old school shit, Buster.

01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:50.220
That might be the title.

01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:53.500
Don't let him wipe in flush.

01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:56.380
Yeah, the old, I think Clint Eastwood

01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.620
said that in Unforgiven.

01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:59.540
It's the cowboy code.

01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:00.740
Don't let him wipe flush.

02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:01.780
Shoot him right at the.

02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.100
So we wait him out, Spencer.

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:04.860
We wait for this guy to get off the pot.

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:08.140
Well, I want to just, well, before we fast forward to that,

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.140
I want to, can we just, because we have nothing to do,

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:14.380
but wait, can we, let's talk strategy,

02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:16.740
because we're waiting for a perp to come out of this bathroom.

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.100
We could really do this right.

02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:19.700
Hatch him with his pants down.

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.780
I'm going to use Flare to dazzle him.

02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.980
I got, can you advise me on my loadout?

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:28.540
What do you mean?

02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:29.500
Well, I just don't know.

02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:30.500
I don't remember.

02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:32.820
I didn't keep track of, like, what I'm assuming.

02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:34.700
I think I was, I'm probably, by default,

02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:36.100
going offensive loadout.

02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:38.580
That's probably, I'm going to assume that's what I've been doing.

02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:40.820
I don't remember what I've used.

02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:43.580
I don't think we've used any spells since the last time

02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:47.340
we've refreshed spells, so you should be good for whatever.

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.900
All right, so my best bet at close quarters

02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:51.100
is inflict light wounds.

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:57.220
It's a touch that deals 1-8 damage plus 1.

02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:01.020
And I'm level 3, right?

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.780
So that means, oh, I could inflict moderate wounds.

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.540
Am I right about that?

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:06.860
If it's on your spell sheet.

02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:07.740
Right, oh, OK.

02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:08.380
I see.

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:09.660
Yeah, I could, I mean, I'm not going

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:11.060
to summon a monster in this place.

02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:12.100
I don't want a reputation.

02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:16.340
But yeah, I mean, do I have to touch somebody to inflict wounds?

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:17.140
Yeah.

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:19.820
All right, so I'm going to, and what's your?

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:21.900
When he comes out, I'm going to dazzle him with a Flare.

02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:22.420
OK.

02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:25.380
So he's going to be bewildered, and you got to drop on him.

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.060
But how do we, you know, the best thing would be,

02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:30.900
if we were pros, we'd fucking do that and then restrain him.

02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:34.700
You know, like, do we have an ability to, like, instead

02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:37.060
of killing him, like, just getting him, you know,

02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:39.340
and just hauling him into the church and being like,

02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:40.220
I have chains.

02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.260
Oh, wait, wait, wait a minute.

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.580
What am I talking about?

02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.980
We're on the quest to Patchen's gem.

02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.340
We can't haul him into the church.

02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.420
We could haul him into the theater.

02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:52.100
We're going to haul him into an alien.

02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:54.140
I mean, I don't even know what we're doing.

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.340
We're over our head.

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:55.660
I don't even know.

02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:59.020
It's three minutes after 10, so we've got to get going.

02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:00.260
Well, no, I feel good.

02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:01.300
Let's keep going.

02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:02.580
What?

02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:04.660
You're outside the, no.

02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:06.500
I mean, but this is serious stuff.

02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:09.460
Like, I mean, I'm OK landing here.

02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:10.380
It'll give me time to think.

02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:12.500
But for real, I didn't know we were

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:13.620
going to be this successful.

02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:14.740
We haven't done it.

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:16.820
Don't get cocky, because we all know there's a guy.

02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:19.420
The guy that killed, tried to took Patchen's gem

02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:22.340
or at least knows who did is in that bathroom, for sure.

02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:25.060
I mean, he'd fucking, like, we are just definitive,

02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:27.060
unless Mulris is a naked liar that

02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:30.900
does crazy labyrinthine tricks on people.

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.180
The guy that's pooping in there is our man.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:37.660
This is our, I've been locked up in the, you know,

02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:41.700
like, I can prove myself here.

02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:42.900
OK.

02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:44.060
So time has passed.

02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.700
This guy's taking the longest shit

02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:48.580
in the history of the leaky green.

02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.580
I think time's dilating.

02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.460
Should we push through or should we just fucking pinch it?

02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.540
I think it's funny to leave it as a cliffhanger.

02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.700
But, you know, whatever you want.

02:02:57.700 --> 02:02:58.460
We'll be back next week.

02:02:58.460 --> 02:02:59.300
Yeah.

02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:02.420
It's just funny the idea that you got someone in a bathroom.

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.300
But we're, as it stands, we're very excited

02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:09.620
that we got a guy pooping that we're pretty sure knows,

02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.100
like, we're on the right track here.

02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:12.900
Well, last time we kind of thought we knew what we were doing,

02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.620
we ended up burning a family's house down

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:17.060
and kind of destroying a town.

02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:19.340
I would love it if we could, like, nail this, you know,

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:20.580
doorknester mission.

02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:24.020
I feel like we got the energy to do it right now.

02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:25.820
Well, cool Dennis is like, you guys

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:28.820
look like you're gearing up to start a bunch of shit in my bar,

02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:29.220
man.

02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:31.940
Cool Dennis, if you want to keep your name fucking piped.

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:32.900
Do we hear a flush?

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:33.660
Whoa.

02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.380
Sorry, cool Dennis.

02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:35.820
I didn't really mean it that way.

02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:37.740
What are you?

02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:38.820
Let's unpack this.

02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.060
What is that?

02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:42.900
I don't want to unpack anything.

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.540
No, I'm saying we're table talk.

02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.460
We're saying we should wrap it up because it's 10

02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.340
and then we'll do it next week.

02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:50.740
OK, I mean, give us, like, do we hear a flush?

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:52.900
Are we like, like, like, like, we're just still

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:54.060
just waiting outside.

02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:56.060
What are the noises that we hear?

02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:59.980
You hear, like, really ominous music.

02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.140
And then, yeah, you hear a flush.

02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:07.140
Cliffhanger, pooping, flushing.

02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:08.100
Thank you so much, everybody.

02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:10.420
Let's hear it for Steve Levy.

02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:12.060
Church.

02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:15.020
Yeah.

02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:18.340
Spencer Crittenden and the Game Master, everybody.

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:21.420
Give it up for Noah and Sarah and Chris and Zach and everybody

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:22.860
here with a wonderful.

02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:23.860
Yeah, Nolan.

02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:26.660
Yeah, Nolan, I mean.

02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.580
We love you all.

02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:31.020
Let's give it up for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:32.020
Yo.

02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.420
Yeah.

02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:35.500
Zach, you got beats.

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.260
You end your show with a guy taking poops.

02:04:47.260 --> 02:05:12.660
2018, 2018, going to be different, 201, and then

02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:19.460
two zeros on top of each other, hard to make new years, glasses

02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:25.980
out of those, numbers need a one on the bridge of your nose.

02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:49.940
2018, wolf created by a team, know what all my brothers mean,

02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:56.460
2018, waffles on toast.

02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:17.060
Did you get any of that?

02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:20.060
It's a good show.
