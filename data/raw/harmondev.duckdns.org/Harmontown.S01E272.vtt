01:56.400\nslow rappers like a pimple.\n\n01:56.400 --> 01:58.600\nI squeeze them from the outside to the center,\n\n01:58.600 --> 02:00.200\nand when I go back inside,\n\n02:00.200 --> 02:02.320\nI find them more bent-er than ever.\n\n02:02.320 --> 02:03.920\nThey're bent in half in sideways,\n\n02:03.920 --> 02:05.320\nand they say, why'd you do that?\n\n02:05.320 --> 02:07.520\nYou gave me a ride.\n\n02:07.520 --> 02:08.360\nDates.\n\n02:08.360 --> 02:10.040\nOver the years, we have never backed off\n\n02:10.040 --> 02:12.040\non the quality of the process.\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:14.080\nJust listen to Professor Kensington,\n\n02:14.080 --> 02:17.920\nwho I sampled at my rap classes.\n\n02:17.920 --> 02:19.920\nNow, fast rapper, you don't seem to be rapping\n\n02:19.920 --> 02:21.480\nparticularly fast so far.\n\n02:21.480 --> 02:24.720\nAre you gearing up to a really fast rap?\n\n02:24.720 --> 02:26.040\nI'm glad you asked that.\n\n02:26.040 --> 02:28.920\nI'm going to answer it right now.\n\n02:28.920 --> 02:30.760\nI'm a slave to the beat I'm provided.\n\n02:30.760 --> 02:34.760\nI fucked your mama so hard it was her pussy that I ride it.\n\n02:34.760 --> 02:36.280\nAnd the beat sometimes drops out,\n\n02:36.280 --> 02:39.320\nbut that puts emphasis on what I'm about to shout.\n\n02:39.320 --> 02:41.760\nI just got to go with the beat that I know.\n\n02:41.760 --> 02:43.120\nI'm a slave to the beat.\n\n02:43.120 --> 02:44.000\nIt's how I flow.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.840\nWhen the beat comes out, that's what I do.\n\n02:46.840 --> 02:49.880\nIt comes from my head to my mouth and then my shoe.\n\n02:49.880 --> 02:52.240\nIn my shoe, the beat goes to my toe.\n\n02:52.240 --> 02:54.920\nAfter it goes from my toe, it goes, I don't know.\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:57.680\nThat's no longer my problem after it leaves my foot.\n\n02:57.680 --> 03:00.040\nIt goes into a chimney and maybe dies in soot,\n\n03:00.040 --> 03:02.320\nlike Santa Claus, coming from the North Pole.\n\n03:02.320 --> 03:05.360\nFucked your mama so hard, she's got an extra hole.\n\n03:05.360 --> 03:08.000\nIt's a USB port, it charges my phone.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.920\nI fucked your mama, but it was consensual.\n\n03:09.920 --> 03:11.320\nNow she's alone.\n\n03:11.320 --> 03:13.800\nShe broke it off with me.\n\n03:13.800 --> 03:15.760\nI fucked your mama, then I took a pee.\n\n03:17.240 --> 03:19.240\nThis is the bridge.\n\n03:19.240 --> 03:20.080\nFast rapper.\n\n03:20.080 --> 03:20.920\nCan I ask you a question?\n\n03:20.920 --> 03:21.760\nFast rapper?\n\n03:21.760 --> 03:22.600\nOf course.\n\n03:22.600 --> 03:25.480\nI'm always, Fast Rapper is famous for his accessibility.\n\n03:27.720 --> 03:28.840\nYour rhymes are so delicious.\n\n03:28.840 --> 03:29.880\nThey're almost yummy.\n\n03:29.880 --> 03:32.000\nIs it true that you rap faster when you lift up your shirt\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.040\nand show us your tummy?\n\n03:34.800 --> 03:35.640\nYes.\n\n03:37.280 --> 03:39.520\nFast rapper, faster rapping with my tummy.\n\n03:39.520 --> 03:41.760\nGonna fat rap so fast it's gonna be extra yummy.\n\n03:41.760 --> 03:44.520\nGonna eat some candy down here and I'm looking fat\n\n03:44.520 --> 03:46.080\nand it makes showing my stomach.\n\n03:46.080 --> 03:47.080\nAnd what do you think about that?\n\n03:47.080 --> 03:49.560\nYou're treating me like a chunk on the goonies.\n\n03:49.560 --> 03:50.520\nI don't like it.\n\n03:50.520 --> 03:51.760\nI'm not...\n\n03:51.760 --> 03:57.560\nI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.\n\n03:57.560 --> 03:58.400\nYou can put your shirt back down.\n\n03:58.400 --> 03:59.240\nYou can put your shirt back down.\n\n03:59.240 --> 04:00.080\nIt's okay.\n\n04:02.840 --> 04:03.680\nWhat was his name?\n\n04:07.240 --> 04:08.080\nActor.\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:10.720\nA famous child actor.\n\n04:10.720 --> 04:11.520\nProbably the year we have membered back\n\n04:11.520 --> 04:13.120\nto us on the call of the Fod.\n\n04:13.120 --> 04:13.960\nRuni.\n\n04:13.960 --> 04:15.040\nOur ingredients.\n\n04:15.040 --> 04:16.600\nIf you were 599, six back.\n\n04:16.600 --> 04:19.160\nHe was a, he played an Asian fella\n\n04:19.160 --> 04:20.800\nin the breakfast at Tiffany's.\n\n04:20.800 --> 04:21.640\nShort round.\n\n04:21.640 --> 04:22.560\nOh, Mickey Rooney.\n\n04:22.560 --> 04:23.060\nMickey.\n\n04:23.060 --> 04:24.000\nMickey.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:24.320\nAll right.\n\n04:24.320 --> 04:25.120\nWell, that was a good wrap.\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:25.640\nThat was a good wrap.\n\n04:25.640 --> 04:27.680\nAll right, as long as we can do to keep the energy up\n\n04:27.680 --> 04:28.640\nwhen we start the show.\n\n04:28.640 --> 04:29.920\nThat's what's important.\n\n04:29.920 --> 04:30.400\nOh, boy.\n\n04:30.400 --> 04:31.000\nGood to see you, Dan.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:31.520\nHappy New Year.\n\n04:31.520 --> 04:32.320\nHappy New Year, Spencer.\n\n04:32.320 --> 04:33.360\nI haven't seen you guys in a long time.\n\n04:33.360 --> 04:33.800\nYeah.\n\n04:33.800 --> 04:34.880\nWhere have you been, Jeff?\n\n04:34.880 --> 04:36.440\nI was in India, California.\n\n04:36.440 --> 04:37.520\nNo, India, Asia.\n\n04:37.520 --> 04:39.080\nIndia near East Asia.\n\n04:39.080 --> 04:39.920\nIndia, California.\n\n04:39.920 --> 04:40.360\nIndia?\n\n04:40.360 --> 04:43.760\nNo, I was in India with church, and we had a big time.\n\n04:43.760 --> 04:45.800\nSometimes I get excited when we take these long breaks,\n\n04:45.800 --> 04:46.640\nbecause I'm like, oh, man, we're\n\n04:46.640 --> 04:48.480\ngoing to have so much to talk about, but then we\n\n04:48.480 --> 04:51.600\ncan go so long that we have nothing to talk about.\n\n04:51.600 --> 04:52.240\nOh, yeah.\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:53.480\nWe have plenty to talk about.\n\n04:53.480 --> 04:53.980\nWe got.\n\n04:53.980 --> 04:55.720\nI can't really remember anything.\n\n04:55.720 --> 04:57.720\nYour house got run into by a drunk driver.\n\n04:57.720 --> 04:58.200\nThere you go.\n\n04:58.200 --> 05:01.760\nAnd you're living in a hotel now, like a fancy person.\n\n05:01.760 --> 05:05.720\nYeah, a dude ran an Acura into my garage at about 40 miles\n\n05:05.720 --> 05:07.240\nan hour, as far as I could tell.\n\n05:07.240 --> 05:10.120\nMore like an inaccurate.\n\n05:10.120 --> 05:11.680\nThat was Dan's joke.\n\n05:11.680 --> 05:15.440\nI stole Dan's joke, but for that first two seconds,\n\n05:15.440 --> 05:16.800\nyou thought I was a fucking genius.\n\n05:16.800 --> 05:18.480\nIt depends on what he was trying to do.\n\n05:18.480 --> 05:20.560\nIt might be the most accurate in the world\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:24.320\nif he was trying to take out my garage.\n\n05:24.320 --> 05:25.800\nBut I don't think so.\n\n05:25.800 --> 05:27.440\nBecause you live right at the top of a hill,\n\n05:27.440 --> 05:29.840\nwhich is like a skateboard ramp that you just\n\n05:29.840 --> 05:32.840\ndrive straight into your garage, and that guy did it.\n\n05:32.840 --> 05:34.640\nYeah, I think he was trying.\n\n05:34.640 --> 05:38.360\nI looked at my security cameras, because I'm Batman,\n\n05:38.360 --> 05:41.600\nand they don't really get down that far that you could actually\n\n05:41.600 --> 05:45.480\nsee what's going on, but you see headlights coming up.\n\n05:45.480 --> 05:47.640\nOne of the cameras, there's a camera on the wall\n\n05:47.640 --> 05:48.440\nthat he took out.\n\n05:48.440 --> 05:53.840\nSo you know what time he hit, because the wall just,\n\n05:53.840 --> 05:56.680\nthe camera just changes position.\n\n05:56.680 --> 06:00.320\nAnd then one of the cameras, you can see headlights\n\n06:00.320 --> 06:03.760\nripping up the street, and then they just disappear.\n\n06:03.760 --> 06:05.120\nAnd then there's footage of one dude,\n\n06:05.120 --> 06:06.440\nthe passenger, just boning out.\n\n06:06.440 --> 06:09.000\nHe just gets out of the car and leaves his friend there to die.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.200\nPassenger, driver, I don't know.\n\n06:11.200 --> 06:13.720\nThe cops made it clear that they did not\n\n06:13.720 --> 06:17.840\nknow whether the guy that ran was the driver or a passenger,\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:21.440\nwhich confirms the fact that the cops were not chasing\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:24.400\nthese guys, or at least they were not on their tail.\n\n06:24.400 --> 06:30.040\nBecause Cody and I heard a boom that sounded to us\n\n06:30.040 --> 06:34.240\nlike somebody was kicking the back door of the house.\n\n06:34.240 --> 06:36.000\nAnd I went downstairs, and I went out\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.480\nback with my police dog Harvey and let him run around\n\n06:39.480 --> 06:40.160\nthe backyard.\n\n06:40.160 --> 06:41.720\nAnd I was like, there's nobody out here.\n\n06:41.720 --> 06:43.440\nI wonder what that big boom was.\n\n06:43.440 --> 06:45.160\nSomebody kicking our door.\n\n06:45.160 --> 06:48.440\nAnd then went to the front of the house,\n\n06:48.440 --> 06:54.960\nand there were cherries flying, kind of illuminating\n\n06:54.960 --> 06:56.960\nthe dark living room.\n\n06:56.960 --> 07:01.240\nAnd down by my garage, there were six squad cars\n\n07:01.240 --> 07:05.000\nin the street with the silhouettes of police,\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.480\nall with their guns drawn and shouting,\n\n07:07.480 --> 07:09.560\nwhich you've heard a million times in movies,\n\n07:09.560 --> 07:12.200\nbut I've never heard in real life.\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:14.000\nJust like, get out of there.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:14.880\nGet out of here.\n\n07:14.880 --> 07:15.760\nGet out.\n\n07:15.760 --> 07:19.400\nJust everybody shouting, different shit at the same time.\n\n07:19.400 --> 07:20.920\nGet out of the car.\n\n07:20.920 --> 07:22.240\nGet on the ground.\n\n07:22.240 --> 07:23.520\nHands in the air.\n\n07:23.520 --> 07:25.240\nDon't move.\n\n07:25.240 --> 07:26.800\nIt's no wonder that a lot of people\n\n07:26.800 --> 07:28.960\nget shot by the police, really, because there's\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:30.440\na lot of mixed messages.\n\n07:32.880 --> 07:34.480\nAnd of course, Cody was on mushrooms,\n\n07:34.480 --> 07:37.080\nwhich I thought was a great choice for that particular moment.\n\n07:37.080 --> 07:39.800\nAnd I wasn't on them.\n\n07:39.800 --> 07:45.680\nShe was coming back from a get-together with some great\n\n07:45.680 --> 07:46.800\ninfluences.\n\n07:46.800 --> 07:48.280\nWere you commenting the whole night\n\n07:48.280 --> 07:50.040\nas the police were doing their work\n\n07:50.040 --> 07:53.600\nthat it was really great that Cody had done those mushrooms?\n\n07:53.600 --> 07:55.160\nYes.\n\n07:55.160 --> 07:57.640\nIt felt like it kept coming up.\n\n07:57.640 --> 07:59.000\nTo whom?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.600\nJust people in the neighborhood.\n\n08:04.600 --> 08:07.920\nI don't know if you're doing a joke or what.\n\n08:07.920 --> 08:09.200\nYeah, no, I am.\n\n08:09.200 --> 08:12.320\nHe was doing a very subtle esoteric bit.\n\n08:12.320 --> 08:12.920\nAll right, yeah.\n\n08:12.920 --> 08:14.760\nI kept telling everyone in the neighborhood\n\n08:14.760 --> 08:16.440\nthat she was on mushrooms.\n\n08:16.440 --> 08:17.760\nThat's basically my joke, yeah.\n\n08:21.800 --> 08:26.360\nSo the thing is that the collision with my garage\n\n08:26.360 --> 08:30.280\ntook out a quarter of a wall of my garage\n\n08:30.280 --> 08:38.480\nthat then was moved into the front of my gate that\n\n08:38.480 --> 08:42.440\nlets you into up to my house.\n\n08:42.440 --> 08:47.280\nHashtag privilege, hashtag what neighborhood do you live in.\n\n08:47.280 --> 08:49.720\nBut yeah, that is part of it.\n\n08:49.720 --> 08:54.080\nAs I was really actually, this is a story about how cool it\n\n08:54.080 --> 08:59.480\nis to have a little bit of money because my garage is down\n\n08:59.480 --> 09:03.280\nby the street, and I have insurance, and I have.\n\n09:03.280 --> 09:06.600\nI think it's essential that garages be on the street.\n\n09:06.600 --> 09:07.520\nI have assistance.\n\n09:07.520 --> 09:09.280\nI find that always to be an advantage.\n\n09:09.280 --> 09:10.840\nI like to come up a flight of stairs.\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:15.760\nAnd so you guys are hilarious.\n\n09:15.760 --> 09:16.760\nThank you.\n\n09:16.760 --> 09:22.400\nThe garage is typically in a normal average American home\n\n09:22.400 --> 09:26.760\nwould probably be kind of connected to the house.\n\n09:26.760 --> 09:30.440\nAnd so someone smashing into it might kill your daughter,\n\n09:30.440 --> 09:35.360\nor dog, or destroy more than just some of your property.\n\n09:35.360 --> 09:37.160\nSo is what I meant.\n\n09:37.160 --> 09:40.880\nAnd because I have a more sprawling estate.\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:42.600\nBecause the average American family\n\n09:42.600 --> 09:43.960\nkeeps their daughter in the garage.\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:44.800\nThat's what you guys.\n\n09:44.800 --> 09:47.400\nHa ha ha.\n\n09:47.400 --> 09:48.920\nYeah, with the snake tank.\n\n09:48.920 --> 09:50.920\nYeah, nothing really got.\n\n09:50.920 --> 09:53.880\nWhat got fucked up was there was a pipe\n\n09:53.880 --> 09:55.280\nin the wall of my garage.\n\n09:55.280 --> 09:57.680\nI do find this a little, I guess I\n\n09:57.680 --> 09:58.800\nshouldn't be surprised by this.\n\n09:58.800 --> 10:03.800\nI guess water pipes are like veins or arteries.\n\n10:03.800 --> 10:04.960\nThey run everywhere.\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:07.040\nIf you break it at any point, there's just like,\n\n10:07.040 --> 10:11.200\nthere was like, when I went down there, there was coplights.\n\n10:11.200 --> 10:15.760\nAnd there was this huge carport that had been my garage.\n\n10:15.760 --> 10:18.640\nBecause they just took out the whole door of the garage.\n\n10:18.640 --> 10:23.880\nAnd then there was this very cinematic spraying of water\n\n10:23.880 --> 10:27.200\nthat's always a part of every car wreck in the movies.\n\n10:27.200 --> 10:28.880\nEven though there was no fire hydrant involved,\n\n10:28.880 --> 10:31.160\nthere was just like the sound of like,\n\n10:31.160 --> 10:33.520\nI felt like it was like a diehard movie or something.\n\n10:33.520 --> 10:36.600\nLike there was just water everywhere.\n\n10:36.600 --> 10:39.200\nAnd the cops kept saying, you got to call the DWP\n\n10:39.200 --> 10:40.880\nand have them shut off the water.\n\n10:40.880 --> 10:42.600\nBecause otherwise, this is bad.\n\n10:42.600 --> 10:44.000\nAnd I had to do that.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.920\nAnd for that reason, and the fact\n\n10:45.920 --> 10:50.080\nthat the wall of the garage is blocking my gate.\n\n10:50.080 --> 10:56.000\nAnd this is a thing that would have crippled the life\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.400\nof a normal person.\n\n10:59.400 --> 11:04.400\nBut I had Steve Levy, who, fresh back from his vacation,\n\n11:04.400 --> 11:08.280\nwas able to get me and Cody into a hotel room, a suite,\n\n11:08.280 --> 11:10.720\nin fact, in West Hollywood, where\n\n11:10.720 --> 11:14.160\nwe were able to spend New Year's Eve with my friends.\n\n11:14.160 --> 11:17.600\nAnd it's actually, I hate to admit it,\n\n11:17.600 --> 11:20.040\nbut it's kind of been a blast having a guy drive\n\n11:20.040 --> 11:26.880\ninto my garage and destroy your daughter, my daughter.\n\n11:26.880 --> 11:29.600\nBecause it didn't really, I'm the last person\n\n11:29.600 --> 11:30.680\nthat had actually affected.\n\n11:30.680 --> 11:36.320\nBut don't rip this video and use it in his, I don't know,\n\n11:36.320 --> 11:37.680\nhearing court case.\n\n11:37.680 --> 11:41.880\nI don't necessarily need this guy to suffer either.\n\n11:41.880 --> 11:45.200\nI mean, I need him to have insurance and pay\n\n11:45.200 --> 11:49.520\nfor my garage construction.\n\n11:49.520 --> 11:52.560\nSo I don't think he can use me saying,\n\n11:52.560 --> 11:56.200\nit was kind of fun having you destroy my garage against me\n\n11:56.200 --> 11:58.360\nin any way, because it still needs to be rebuilt.\n\n11:58.360 --> 12:02.200\nBut hopefully, he's OK.\n\n12:02.200 --> 12:04.840\nHopefully, his friend didn't do anything desperate\n\n12:04.840 --> 12:09.400\nin Amy Mann's backyard when he ran eastbound up\n\n12:09.400 --> 12:11.600\ninto the hills of Las Feliz.\n\n12:11.600 --> 12:13.200\nI almost murdered Amy Mann.\n\n12:13.200 --> 12:17.200\nShe was coming down the corner on her beach cruiser bicycle.\n\n12:17.200 --> 12:19.520\nAnd I almost completely demolished her.\n\n12:19.520 --> 12:23.360\nShe was just jamming around the corner.\n\n12:23.360 --> 12:25.280\nI have like three phone numbers of people\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:28.880\nthat I know live in the direction that the kid ran,\n\n12:28.880 --> 12:30.280\nthat I saw running from the car.\n\n12:30.280 --> 12:31.800\nSo I went through my phone.\n\n12:31.800 --> 12:33.040\nI'm like, who lives over there?\n\n12:33.040 --> 12:34.080\nI'm just going to warn him.\n\n12:34.080 --> 12:34.920\nThere's a guy on foot.\n\n12:34.920 --> 12:36.280\nHe's running from the cops.\n\n12:36.280 --> 12:38.560\nHe could actually, if he's desperate,\n\n12:38.560 --> 12:43.240\nhe could actually do something desperate.\n\n12:43.240 --> 12:44.360\nMaybe it's actually better.\n\n12:44.360 --> 12:45.280\nThese cops, they see him.\n\n12:45.280 --> 12:47.800\nI'm not going to, I'm not throwing them under the bus.\n\n12:47.800 --> 12:51.200\nThey don't, they're admitting they haven't found the guy.\n\n12:51.200 --> 12:53.440\nThey don't, I don't know how well they're doing it,\n\n12:53.440 --> 12:54.560\nfinding him.\n\n12:54.560 --> 12:57.240\nI'm going to, I'm just going to text a couple warnings\n\n12:57.240 --> 13:00.640\nto a couple people that I know live in that direction.\n\n13:00.640 --> 13:04.320\nAnd one of them was Edgar Wright, director of Baby Driver.\n\n13:04.320 --> 13:06.560\nAnd then halfway through, the message is like, wait a minute.\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:07.360\nWhat am I doing?\n\n13:07.360 --> 13:08.280\nThis is his fault.\n\n13:08.280 --> 13:09.560\nI'm sure this guy was.\n\n13:09.560 --> 13:10.400\nWas Baby Driver.\n\n13:10.400 --> 13:11.520\nYeah, exactly.\n\n13:11.520 --> 13:13.680\nLike, stop making those movies, Edgar.\n\n13:13.680 --> 13:17.320\nOr live with this guy in your pool shed.\n\n13:17.320 --> 13:19.680\nWelcome to your fucked up version of ET,\n\n13:19.680 --> 13:21.800\nwhere you have to befriend this guy and get him back home\n\n13:21.800 --> 13:23.160\nto England.\n\n13:23.160 --> 13:24.880\nApparently, both the driver and the passenger\n\n13:24.880 --> 13:26.080\nwere not injured, though, right?\n\n13:26.080 --> 13:28.240\nThe only real tragedy of this was that we found out\n\n13:28.240 --> 13:31.240\nthat you have a sad segue in your garage.\n\n13:31.240 --> 13:33.440\nIt was truly, and I'm not being, I mean, yeah.\n\n13:33.440 --> 13:35.480\nIt's become a joke, but it's really, it really is.\n\n13:35.480 --> 13:37.040\nThe only segue is like, what?\n\n13:37.040 --> 13:39.040\nIt really was the most embarrassing thing.\n\n13:39.040 --> 13:42.840\nFirst, it started with the LAPD making fun of the segue.\n\n13:42.840 --> 13:44.760\nAnd that's part of it, is like, you only\n\n13:44.760 --> 13:46.680\nhave to mention the segue to make fun of it.\n\n13:46.680 --> 13:48.560\nLike, so the LAPD was like, I was like,\n\n13:48.560 --> 13:49.720\nwhat's the damage like over there?\n\n13:49.720 --> 13:51.160\nI can't even get out the gate to see.\n\n13:51.160 --> 13:53.120\nAnd they're like, don't worry, bro, the segue's OK.\n\n13:56.480 --> 13:57.680\nThere was segue shaming you?\n\n13:57.680 --> 13:58.640\nYeah.\n\n13:58.640 --> 14:00.480\nBut then Cody's like, how's my Prius?\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:02.760\nOr, you know, she's on mushrooms, so a more accurate thing\n\n14:02.760 --> 14:04.280\nwould be like, how's my Prius?\n\n14:04.280 --> 14:07.680\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n14:07.680 --> 14:10.400\nBut then the cops were like, other than the fact\n\n14:10.400 --> 14:11.480\nthat it's a hybrid.\n\n14:11.480 --> 14:13.200\nAnd then I was like, OK, I see your formula.\n\n14:13.200 --> 14:14.360\nYou can take your hybrid shaming.\n\n14:14.360 --> 14:17.080\nYou can put it in the, I'll take it.\n\n14:17.080 --> 14:19.800\nI'll put it in the bin with all the cop insults.\n\n14:19.800 --> 14:22.880\nYou guys just have a formula here.\n\n14:22.880 --> 14:24.600\nBut yeah, no.\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:26.360\nThey were hybrid shaming too?\n\n14:26.360 --> 14:28.600\nThey were, you know, it's cop humor.\n\n14:28.600 --> 14:29.560\nWhat are they going to do?\n\n14:29.560 --> 14:31.000\nAre they going to?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.880\nWhen someone's using less gas than the maximum amount\n\n14:33.880 --> 14:34.680\nto get around?\n\n14:34.680 --> 14:36.400\nYou know, they don't know what they're doing.\n\n14:36.400 --> 14:37.480\nIt's cop humor.\n\n14:37.480 --> 14:38.560\nThey're connecting dots.\n\n14:38.560 --> 14:41.520\nI would rather my cops be linear thinkers, really,\n\n14:41.520 --> 14:42.000\nfrankly.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.760\nI don't want them to be that creative with their guns\n\n14:44.760 --> 14:45.480\nand their handcuffs.\n\n14:45.480 --> 14:50.360\nI'd rather they just be like, OK, you're stealing that car,\n\n14:50.360 --> 14:54.600\nwhich is illegal, so here's your rights to remain silent.\n\n14:54.600 --> 14:59.160\nI don't want them to be like, hey, I'm in my blue period.\n\n14:59.160 --> 15:00.160\nOK.\n\n15:00.160 --> 15:02.400\nThe men in blue period.\n\n15:02.400 --> 15:07.440\nBut very impressively diverse, multiracial.\n\n15:07.440 --> 15:10.280\nI'm always impressed when the LAPD shows up at my house.\n\n15:10.280 --> 15:13.600\nAnd I like the diversity.\n\n15:13.600 --> 15:17.240\nIt looks like when you look at the LAPD,\n\n15:17.240 --> 15:21.040\nwhen they come in mass, it looks like a pamphlet.\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:22.120\nIt looks like a pamphlet.\n\n15:22.120 --> 15:24.120\nIt looks like it's comforting.\n\n15:24.120 --> 15:25.680\nYou've got systems working.\n\n15:25.680 --> 15:26.440\nEverything's fine.\n\n15:26.440 --> 15:29.320\nI'll just go back in my house and eat crackers\n\n15:29.320 --> 15:32.120\nand oppress the poor.\n\n15:32.120 --> 15:35.360\nAnd that always includes, the diversity includes,\n\n15:35.360 --> 15:38.720\nthere's always incredibly handsome young white dudes\n\n15:38.720 --> 15:41.120\nthat look like they belong in a boy band.\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:47.960\nVery, very, very sexy white male cops among the rainbow\n\n15:47.960 --> 15:48.760\nof justice.\n\n15:48.760 --> 15:49.600\nGet a room.\n\n15:49.600 --> 15:50.560\nYeah.\n\n15:50.560 --> 15:54.800\nBut that was the guy that was busting the balls the hardest.\n\n15:54.800 --> 15:57.440\nYeah, it's an old story, NASA.\n\n15:57.440 --> 16:00.840\nIt almost feels like it's like graham crackers telling it,\n\n16:00.840 --> 16:02.040\nbut that's what happened.\n\n16:02.040 --> 16:03.200\nIt's a big die.\n\n16:03.200 --> 16:04.160\nI wish for this podcast.\n\n16:04.160 --> 16:05.240\nIt happened yesterday because it'd\n\n16:05.240 --> 16:07.320\nbe all excited about it and explaining every detail.\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:11.680\nBut a dude hit my garage and destroyed a water pipe.\n\n16:11.680 --> 16:13.440\nSo I got to stay in a hotel suite.\n\n16:13.440 --> 16:14.520\nIt was fun.\n\n16:14.520 --> 16:16.480\nI had a very good time in India with church.\n\n16:16.480 --> 16:20.400\nWe had a beautiful little excursion out there.\n\n16:20.400 --> 16:24.240\nIt's just like a mind-numbing, mind-blowing,\n\n16:24.240 --> 16:28.600\nlike overwhelming explosion of kaleidoscopic madness.\n\n16:28.600 --> 16:30.000\nIt's so fucking cool.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.120\nDid you guys get any illnesses?\n\n16:33.120 --> 16:36.600\nNo, I felt like crap believing because you\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:39.840\ntake these malaria pills, and I got really nauseous on it,\n\n16:39.840 --> 16:41.160\nnauseated.\n\n16:41.160 --> 16:43.400\nBut you're not supposed to drink alcohol with them,\n\n16:43.400 --> 16:44.320\nand I did, of course.\n\n16:44.320 --> 16:45.880\nAnd so I felt like a bum.\n\n16:45.880 --> 16:48.480\nBut when I got to India, then I felt amazing the entire time,\n\n16:48.480 --> 16:49.880\njust ate the best food in the world.\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:52.200\nThen we came back, and then we got sick,\n\n16:52.200 --> 16:53.800\njust because we were traveling a lot.\n\n16:53.800 --> 16:55.080\nYeah.\n\n16:55.080 --> 16:56.400\nChurch might have malaria.\n\n16:56.400 --> 17:00.600\nChurch, do you have malaria, or are you surviving now?\n\n17:00.600 --> 17:03.920\nLast night, you thought you had malaria.\n\n17:03.920 --> 17:05.600\nWe'll see.\n\n17:05.600 --> 17:07.080\nI'm preoccupied by this thing.\n\n17:07.080 --> 17:08.880\nI got to get it done.\n\n17:08.880 --> 17:13.160\nI've had people telling me I've had a lot of advice.\n\n17:13.160 --> 17:14.000\nDon't talk about it.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.280\nYou don't have to talk about it.\n\n17:15.280 --> 17:16.600\nIt's done.\n\n17:16.600 --> 17:17.600\nLegal advice.\n\n17:17.600 --> 17:18.400\nDon't talk about it.\n\n17:18.400 --> 17:20.120\nYou open it yourself up.\n\n17:20.120 --> 17:21.680\nThe most important advice I've gotten\n\n17:21.680 --> 17:27.400\nis from women that I respect that do what I do,\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:33.760\nthat are respected, and that spoke to me privately,\n\n17:33.760 --> 17:37.400\nand said, if you're true to your word,\n\n17:37.400 --> 17:38.920\nand you are sincere about how you want\n\n17:38.920 --> 17:44.440\nto be part of the solution, not part of the problem,\n\n17:44.440 --> 17:47.520\nplease talk about how you've been part of the problem.\n\n17:47.520 --> 17:50.840\nThat's truly the most helpful thing you can do.\n\n17:50.840 --> 17:53.120\nPlease appreciate, if you're listening to me,\n\n17:53.120 --> 17:55.240\nthat the tightrope I have to walk here\n\n17:55.240 --> 18:01.040\nis I have to make this a normal part of the process,\n\n18:01.040 --> 18:06.360\nbecause it should be healthy, and easy, and graceful.\n\n18:06.360 --> 18:08.320\nIt should be a thing that can be done,\n\n18:08.320 --> 18:12.240\nand doesn't have to create civil war and hysteria,\n\n18:12.240 --> 18:16.520\nthat doesn't make people get re-victimized and attacked.\n\n18:16.520 --> 18:19.040\nYou're not doing me any favors at all.\n\n18:19.040 --> 18:21.720\nYou're only hurting everybody, especially me,\n\n18:21.720 --> 18:29.360\nif this topic causes you to attack anybody involved.\n\n18:29.360 --> 18:30.760\nYou may think it's in my defense.\n\n18:30.760 --> 18:32.400\nYou may think it's in defense of fairness.\n\n18:32.400 --> 18:37.920\nI ask you to think about what you think fair is.\n\n18:37.920 --> 18:39.800\nThat's enough disclaiming.\n\n18:39.800 --> 18:46.120\nI have really, really had to think about this.\n\n18:46.120 --> 18:51.680\nAnd decided I need to talk about it.\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:55.880\nI want to target about, what, five to seven minutes?\n\n18:55.880 --> 18:59.760\nAnd then pull me out of here, after which hopefully I've\n\n18:59.760 --> 19:02.200\ndone some good by just talking about this.\n\n19:02.200 --> 19:04.080\nThis is about for your life closing down, right?\n\n19:04.080 --> 19:04.600\nYes.\n\n19:04.600 --> 19:06.400\nFor your life recently, close down.\n\n19:10.120 --> 19:13.840\nIn 2000, whatever, whatever, I can't remember.\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:16.440\n2009, 2006, 2000, something, something,\n\n19:16.440 --> 19:20.600\nI had the privilege of running a network sitcom.\n\n19:20.600 --> 19:27.640\nAnd I was attracted to a employee.\n\n19:27.640 --> 19:31.160\nI really want to be careful about that language.\n\n19:31.160 --> 19:33.000\nI think a huge part of the problem\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.400\nis a culture of feeling things that you think\n\n19:37.400 --> 19:41.080\nare unique and significant because they're happening to you\n\n19:41.080 --> 19:46.120\nand saying things like, I had feelings for and I,\n\n19:46.120 --> 19:47.880\nI fell for and all these things.\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:50.600\nI mean, the most clinical way I can put it and fessing up\n\n19:50.600 --> 19:55.400\nto my crimes is that I was attracted to a writer\n\n19:55.400 --> 19:59.560\nthat I had power over because I was a show runner.\n\n19:59.560 --> 20:08.440\nAnd I knew enough to know that these feelings were bad news.\n\n20:08.440 --> 20:10.320\nThat was easy enough to know.\n\n20:10.320 --> 20:13.920\nI knew that they ran the risk of undercutting people's faith\n\n20:13.920 --> 20:19.280\nin my judgment, her faith in her talent,\n\n20:19.280 --> 20:21.600\nthe other writer's respect for me,\n\n20:21.600 --> 20:25.360\nthe entire production, the audience.\n\n20:25.360 --> 20:28.880\nI knew that I wasn't doing anybody any favors\n\n20:28.880 --> 20:32.280\nby feeling these things.\n\n20:32.280 --> 20:35.200\nAnd so I did the cowardly easiest, laziest thing\n\n20:35.200 --> 20:36.560\nyou could do with feelings like that.\n\n20:36.560 --> 20:37.680\nAnd I didn't deal with them.\n\n20:37.680 --> 20:40.680\nAnd in not dealing with them, I made everybody else\n\n20:40.680 --> 20:46.240\ndeal with them, especially her.\n\n20:46.240 --> 20:51.640\nFlirty, creepy, everything other than overt enough\n\n20:51.640 --> 20:56.320\nto constitute betraying your live-in girlfriend to whom\n\n20:56.320 --> 21:00.280\nyou're going home every night who is actually smart enough\n\n21:00.280 --> 21:02.480\nand respectful enough to ask you,\n\n21:02.480 --> 21:04.480\ndo you have feelings for that young writer\n\n21:04.480 --> 21:06.840\nthat you're talking about, that you're\n\n21:06.840 --> 21:10.080\npaying all this attention to, and saying to her,\n\n21:10.080 --> 21:13.920\nno, because the trick is, if you lie to yourself,\n\n21:13.920 --> 21:14.960\nyou can lie to everybody.\n\n21:14.960 --> 21:18.240\nIt's really easy.\n\n21:18.240 --> 21:24.080\nAnd so that's what I continued to do, telling myself\n\n21:24.080 --> 21:29.320\nand anybody that threatened to confront me with it,\n\n21:29.320 --> 21:32.920\nthat if you thought what I was doing was creepy or flirty\n\n21:32.920 --> 21:35.600\nor unprofessional, then it's because you were the sexist.\n\n21:35.600 --> 21:36.600\nYou were jealous.\n\n21:36.600 --> 21:37.800\nI was supporting this person.\n\n21:37.800 --> 21:38.800\nI'm a mentor.\n\n21:38.800 --> 21:39.760\nI'm a feminist.\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:45.000\nIt's your problem, not mine.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:48.320\nYou're the one that actually is seeing things\n\n21:48.320 --> 21:49.600\nthrough that lens.\n\n21:49.600 --> 21:53.400\nAnd so I let myself keep doing it.\n\n21:53.400 --> 22:00.480\nAnd it's not as if this person didn't repeatedly communicate\n\n22:00.480 --> 22:04.520\nto me the idea that what I was doing\n\n22:04.520 --> 22:09.240\nwas divesting her of a recourse to integrity.\n\n22:09.240 --> 22:17.120\nI just didn't hear it because it didn't profit me to hear it.\n\n22:17.120 --> 22:21.080\nAnd this was after all happening to me, right?\n\n22:21.080 --> 22:30.520\nAnd so after a season of playing it that way,\n\n22:30.520 --> 22:34.320\nI broke up with my girlfriend, who I had lied to the whole time\n\n22:34.320 --> 22:36.840\nwhile lying to myself, lied to her about why\n\n22:36.840 --> 22:39.240\nI was breaking up with her.\n\n22:39.240 --> 22:41.880\nBecause I thought that would make having inappropriate feelings\n\n22:41.880 --> 22:46.440\nfor a co-worker appropriate if I wasn't involved.\n\n22:46.440 --> 22:49.160\nI want you to be the one to examine this\n\n22:49.160 --> 22:51.360\nand every step of the way decide for yourself\n\n22:51.360 --> 22:53.080\nwhere I'm making mistakes.\n\n22:53.080 --> 22:56.760\nI don't want to explain to you what I've learned.\n\n22:56.760 --> 22:59.760\nI want you to look at this.\n\n22:59.760 --> 23:03.360\nAnd I want it to sound relatively unremarkable to you\n\n23:03.360 --> 23:04.680\nbecause that's the danger.\n\n23:07.440 --> 23:13.000\nI broke up with my girlfriend, then I went full steam\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.280\ninto creeping on my employee.\n\n23:17.280 --> 23:19.640\nNow it was even less appropriate after all.\n\n23:19.640 --> 23:23.400\nNow I wasn't in danger of being a bad person.\n\n23:26.840 --> 23:32.400\nAnd then after that season, I got overt\n\n23:32.400 --> 23:39.320\nabout my feelings after it was wrapped and said, oh, I love you.\n\n23:39.320 --> 23:43.680\nAnd she said the same thing she'd been saying the entire time\n\n23:43.680 --> 23:46.040\nin one language or another.\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:51.320\nPlease don't you understand that focusing on me like this,\n\n23:51.320 --> 23:55.080\nliking me like this, preferring me like this,\n\n23:55.080 --> 23:58.040\nI can't say no to it.\n\n23:58.040 --> 24:01.520\nAnd when you do it, it makes me unable to know\n\n24:01.520 --> 24:02.880\nwhether I'm good at my job.\n\n24:07.640 --> 24:13.280\nAnd because I finally got to the point where I said to her,\n\n24:13.280 --> 24:20.240\noh, I love you because that's what I thought it was\n\n24:20.240 --> 24:25.200\nwhen you target somebody for two years.\n\n24:25.200 --> 24:28.520\nAnd it was therefore rejected that way.\n\n24:28.520 --> 24:33.160\nI was humiliated.\n\n24:33.160 --> 24:37.600\nAnd so I continued to do the cowardly thing\n\n24:37.600 --> 24:41.120\nand continued to do the selfish thing.\n\n24:41.120 --> 24:45.680\nNow I wanted to teach her a lesson.\n\n24:45.680 --> 24:51.320\nI wanted to show her that if she didn't like being liked in that\n\n24:51.320 --> 24:54.720\nway, then oh boy, she should get over her soft after off.\n\n24:54.720 --> 24:55.840\nYou're just going to be a writer,\n\n24:55.840 --> 25:00.320\nand then this is how just writers get treated.\n\n25:00.320 --> 25:03.120\nAnd that was probably the darkest of it all.\n\n25:03.120 --> 25:07.520\nI'm going to assume that when she tweets about it\n\n25:07.520 --> 25:17.720\nand refers to trauma that that's probably it because I drank,\n\n25:17.720 --> 25:22.400\nI took pills, I crushed on her and resented her\n\n25:22.400 --> 25:24.600\nfor not reciprocating it.\n\n25:24.600 --> 25:26.800\nAnd the entire time I was the one writing her paychecks\n\n25:26.800 --> 25:30.080\nand in control of whether she stayed or went\n\n25:30.080 --> 25:33.000\nand whether she felt good about herself or not\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:39.120\nand said horrible things, just treated her cruelly,\n\n25:39.120 --> 25:42.240\npointedly, things that I would never, ever, ever\n\n25:42.240 --> 25:45.840\nhave done if she had been male.\n\n25:45.840 --> 25:49.520\nAnd if I had never had those feelings for her.\n\n25:49.520 --> 25:52.400\nAnd I lied to myself the entire time about it.\n\n25:52.400 --> 25:59.800\nAnd I lost my job, I ruined my show,\n\n25:59.800 --> 26:05.440\nI betrayed the audience, I destroyed everything,\n\n26:05.440 --> 26:07.320\nand I damaged her internal compass.\n\n26:11.920 --> 26:15.560\nAnd I moved on.\n\n26:15.560 --> 26:26.320\nAnd I never did it before, and I will never do it again.\n\n26:26.320 --> 26:27.960\nBut I certainly wouldn't have been\n\n26:27.960 --> 26:31.960\nable to do it if I had any respect for women.\n\n26:31.960 --> 26:35.800\nOn a fundamental level, I was thinking about them\n\n26:35.800 --> 26:37.680\nas different creatures.\n\n26:37.680 --> 26:39.360\nI was thinking about the ones that I\n\n26:39.360 --> 26:44.560\nliked as having some special role in my life.\n\n26:44.560 --> 26:48.520\nAnd I did it all by not thinking about it.\n\n26:48.520 --> 26:52.480\nSo I just want to say, in addition to obviously being\n\n26:52.480 --> 26:57.200\nsorry, but that's really not the important thing,\n\n26:57.200 --> 27:00.400\nI want to say I did it by not thinking about it.\n\n27:00.400 --> 27:05.280\nAnd I got away with it by not thinking about it.\n\n27:05.280 --> 27:07.440\nAnd if she hadn't mentioned something on Twitter,\n\n27:07.440 --> 27:11.240\nI would have continued to not have to think about it.\n\n27:11.240 --> 27:18.360\nAlthough I did walk around with my stomach and not about it.\n\n27:18.360 --> 27:20.120\nBut I wouldn't have had to talk about it.\n\n27:20.120 --> 27:25.000\nAnd the last and most important thing I can say\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.120\nis just think about it.\n\n27:27.120 --> 27:29.480\nNo matter who you are at work, no matter where you're working,\n\n27:29.480 --> 27:31.240\nno matter what field you're in, no matter what position\n\n27:31.240 --> 27:34.280\nyou have over or under or side by side with somebody,\n\n27:34.280 --> 27:36.520\njust think about it.\n\n27:36.520 --> 27:38.160\nBecause if you don't think about it,\n\n27:38.160 --> 27:40.720\nyou're going to get away with not thinking about it.\n\n27:40.720 --> 27:43.640\nAnd you could cause a lot of damage\n\n27:43.640 --> 27:51.160\nthat is technically legal and hurts everybody.\n\n27:51.160 --> 27:54.560\nAnd I think that we're living in a good time right now\n\n27:54.560 --> 27:58.400\nbecause we're not going to get away with it anymore.\n\n27:58.400 --> 28:02.720\nAnd if we can make it a normal part of our culture\n\n28:02.720 --> 28:06.480\nthat we think about it and possibly talk about it,\n\n28:06.480 --> 28:08.840\nthen maybe we can get to a better place\n\n28:08.840 --> 28:11.560\nwhere that stuff doesn't happen.\n\n28:11.560 --> 28:14.240\nSo that's it.\n\n28:14.240 --> 28:17.280\nPlease don't hurt her.\n\n28:17.280 --> 28:25.560\nPlease don't make this worse on anybody but me.\n\n28:25.560 --> 28:27.800\nAnd let's move on.\n\n28:27.800 --> 28:29.720\nI'm bad at ending things.\n\n28:29.720 --> 28:32.000\nI'm going to now have a drink.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.720\nThat was seven minutes exactly.\n\n28:33.720 --> 28:36.800\nOh, well, it was totally rehearsed.\n\n28:36.800 --> 28:40.440\nJeff, tell us about India.\n\n28:40.440 --> 28:42.880\nThis is kind of a tough act to follow, man.\n\n28:42.880 --> 28:45.680\nWell, India is certainly the means to do it.\n\n28:45.680 --> 28:46.520\nYou know, it was amazing.\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:47.720\nAre there cows there?\n\n28:47.720 --> 28:48.360\nThe cows were.\n\n28:48.360 --> 28:49.800\nThose are illegal, right?\n\n28:49.800 --> 28:52.560\nCows are not only legal.\n\n28:52.560 --> 28:54.000\nThey have their own lane.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.720\nThe traffic there is insane.\n\n28:55.720 --> 28:58.160\nAnd I was told that it goes in order of the size of the car,\n\n28:58.160 --> 28:59.640\nlike the bigger cars get the right of way\n\n28:59.640 --> 29:02.480\nand then all the way down to the people on scooters.\n\n29:02.480 --> 29:05.080\nBut if you're a cow, everybody gets out of your way.\n\n29:05.080 --> 29:06.760\nThey call it the cow lane.\n\n29:06.760 --> 29:08.600\nAnd the cows just cruise down the street.\n\n29:08.600 --> 29:10.840\nThey're kind of like cats.\n\n29:10.840 --> 29:12.520\nLike they hang out in the hurry.\n\n29:12.520 --> 29:13.560\nThey hang out in the daytime.\n\n29:13.560 --> 29:15.560\nThey go, they get gallivants around town,\n\n29:15.560 --> 29:17.320\neating whatever they find on the street,\n\n29:17.320 --> 29:19.440\nsometimes pilot trash or whatever.\n\n29:19.440 --> 29:22.000\nAnd then they all seem to be going home in the same direction\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:22.720\nat the end of the day.\n\n29:22.720 --> 29:25.360\nLike they're all kind of coming back home.\n\n29:25.360 --> 29:27.400\nIt's their day job is like to get garbage.\n\n29:27.400 --> 29:28.440\nYou know, it's crazy.\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:31.080\nWhen Church and I checked in, we landed at like 3 AM.\n\n29:31.080 --> 29:32.720\nWe got to the hotel at like 4 AM.\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:35.160\nAnd this beautiful hotel in Bangalore.\n\n29:35.160 --> 29:36.440\nAnd they put the little, I forget.\n\n29:36.440 --> 29:37.680\nWhat do they call it?\n\n29:37.680 --> 29:39.280\nChurch with a little red blessing on your forehead?\n\n29:39.280 --> 29:40.120\nA dot.\n\n29:40.120 --> 29:41.400\nTulaka.\n\n29:41.400 --> 29:43.720\nAnd they give you a little.\n\n29:43.720 --> 29:44.240\nA tulaka.\n\n29:44.240 --> 29:47.120\nAnd they put the thing and they gave us a little mango drink.\n\n29:47.120 --> 29:48.840\nAnd there was Christmas decorations everywhere.\n\n29:48.840 --> 29:51.800\nBecause we got to like around the 20th, right?\n\n29:51.800 --> 29:52.480\nSomething like that?\n\n29:52.480 --> 29:53.480\nNo, no, before that.\n\n29:53.480 --> 29:54.240\nI think before.\n\n29:54.240 --> 29:56.320\nYeah.\n\n29:56.320 --> 29:58.720\nBut it was, you know, the build up to Christmas,\n\n29:58.720 --> 29:59.640\nthey love Christmas there.\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:02.880\nLike more Christmas decorations than you see here.\n\n30:02.880 --> 30:05.360\nAnd everywhere, like the malls and the hotel lobbies\n\n30:05.360 --> 30:06.520\nand the airports.\n\n30:06.520 --> 30:08.960\nIt was just like Santa Claus' and Christmas trees everywhere.\n\n30:08.960 --> 30:12.520\nAnd I asked this woman, Needy, kind of our driver, handler,\n\n30:12.520 --> 30:16.000\nlike chaperone, do you guys love Christmas?\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:20.280\nYou know, we celebrate every holiday here.\n\n30:20.280 --> 30:21.840\nHindu holidays are every day.\n\n30:21.840 --> 30:24.320\nThey have 1,000 festivals and stuff.\n\n30:24.320 --> 30:25.880\nLike we love all festivals.\n\n30:25.880 --> 30:27.400\nI go, do you celebrate all Christian festivals?\n\n30:27.400 --> 30:28.560\nI go, yes, all of them.\n\n30:28.560 --> 30:31.960\nAnd they go, because Christmas is the festival of lights\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:32.920\nand gift giving.\n\n30:32.920 --> 30:34.280\nAnd they all dress up as Santa Claus\n\n30:34.280 --> 30:35.440\nand give each other gifts.\n\n30:35.440 --> 30:37.880\nI go, do you celebrate all, like, Islamic festivals too?\n\n30:37.880 --> 30:39.200\nYes, all of them too.\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:40.680\nI go, what, Jewish festivals?\n\n30:40.680 --> 30:43.080\nAnd she goes, no.\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:44.960\nBut not because the anti-Semitism.\n\n30:44.960 --> 30:46.880\nI think they're like, no, but those aren't as fun.\n\n30:46.880 --> 30:48.320\nThey're not flashy, certainly.\n\n30:48.320 --> 30:50.720\nBut you should have said meh.\n\n30:50.720 --> 30:51.320\nMeh?\n\n30:51.320 --> 30:52.040\nYeah, you should.\n\n30:52.040 --> 30:54.200\nI mean, come on.\n\n30:54.200 --> 30:57.800\nYou know, what I found weird is that they treated us so well,\n\n30:57.800 --> 31:00.400\nthey gave us, me and Greg Proops were doing comedy shows\n\n31:00.400 --> 31:01.480\nthere.\n\n31:01.480 --> 31:05.400\nAnd we were surrounded by a phalanx of security\n\n31:05.400 --> 31:08.720\nwhen we would do these shows and walk to go to the bar.\n\n31:08.720 --> 31:11.120\nAnd there would just be seven or eight buff Indian dudes\n\n31:11.120 --> 31:13.880\nin black t-shirts just following you around everywhere.\n\n31:13.880 --> 31:15.680\nAnd they're under strict orders, like,\n\n31:15.680 --> 31:17.400\ndon't let this guy out of your sight.\n\n31:17.400 --> 31:19.520\nLike, we were like big hot shot Bollywood stars.\n\n31:19.520 --> 31:21.720\nI'm like, no, I think you'll find that nobody really\n\n31:21.720 --> 31:23.240\nknows who I am here.\n\n31:23.240 --> 31:23.920\nBut it was great.\n\n31:23.920 --> 31:25.520\nThe people there are fantastic.\n\n31:25.520 --> 31:27.560\nThey called you Sahib.\n\n31:27.560 --> 31:30.840\nI didn't know that until after the fact that I was Jeff Sahib.\n\n31:30.840 --> 31:35.680\nI found out later on that that was my handle.\n\n31:35.680 --> 31:40.720\nWas that a thing that, was it a Greg Proops gig?\n\n31:40.720 --> 31:43.720\nYeah, Greg and I once in a while will get corporate shows.\n\n31:43.720 --> 31:48.760\nUsually they're in Houston or Ohio or corporate gigs\n\n31:48.760 --> 31:50.080\naround America.\n\n31:50.080 --> 31:51.880\nBut he said, hey, Jeff, we got this cushy gig\n\n31:51.880 --> 31:55.200\nfor this alcohol company called Black Dog in India.\n\n31:55.200 --> 31:56.560\nAnd they just treated us like royalty.\n\n31:56.560 --> 31:58.080\nIt was fantastic.\n\n31:58.080 --> 32:00.120\nIt was really, like, it's not funny.\n\n32:00.120 --> 32:02.000\nI don't have a hilarious joke about it.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nBut like, if you've not been, the people\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.040\nthat are listening that have been to India or from India,\n\n32:08.040 --> 32:12.040\nthey know, I hope, like how special and really, like,\n\n32:12.040 --> 32:12.840\nmarvelous.\n\n32:12.840 --> 32:14.160\nLike, there's so many people.\n\n32:14.160 --> 32:15.760\nIt's so crowded.\n\n32:15.760 --> 32:19.280\nThere's so much noise and color and sights and smells\n\n32:19.280 --> 32:21.200\nand sounds and things.\n\n32:21.200 --> 32:22.280\nBut nobody's angry.\n\n32:22.280 --> 32:25.240\nLike, everybody just was chilled out and just relaxed.\n\n32:25.240 --> 32:28.640\nAnd if you follow a church on her Instagram at Cassandra\n\n32:28.640 --> 32:31.800\nChurch, there's a picture that she took when we were at,\n\n32:31.800 --> 32:34.720\nit was a Charamara Palace.\n\n32:34.720 --> 32:35.520\nCharamara?\n\n32:35.520 --> 32:36.520\nCharamara?\n\n32:36.520 --> 32:37.520\nCharamara.\n\n32:37.520 --> 32:39.000\nCharamara?\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:40.480\nSomething like that.\n\n32:40.480 --> 32:42.120\nCharamara.\n\n32:42.120 --> 32:44.040\nDoop, doo, doo, doo, doo.\n\n32:44.040 --> 32:46.360\nAnd she took a picture of these five women just sitting down\n\n32:46.360 --> 32:47.240\non their break.\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:50.600\nAnd it was like, it's so captivating.\n\n32:50.600 --> 32:51.320\nI don't know.\n\n32:51.320 --> 32:53.360\nI'm kind of nerded out on India.\n\n32:53.360 --> 32:57.800\nAnd I really, really, like, would love to go back at any time.\n\n32:57.800 --> 33:01.760\nI'm working with a writer that was in Eastern Europe.\n\n33:01.760 --> 33:05.400\nAnd he, you can tell from the way he talks about it\n\n33:05.400 --> 33:08.480\nthat he really wants to just go there and live there forever.\n\n33:08.480 --> 33:10.240\nSometimes you can feel that way and be wrong.\n\n33:10.240 --> 33:12.360\nLike, you'd go out there and find out you were totally wrong\n\n33:12.360 --> 33:14.320\nand you just have an infatuation with a place.\n\n33:14.320 --> 33:17.760\nLike, I felt that way about Portland for a while.\n\n33:17.760 --> 33:20.480\nBut I don't know.\n\n33:20.480 --> 33:25.040\nI wonder if everybody has, like, a city somewhere on the planet\n\n33:25.040 --> 33:27.560\nwhere they would be extra activated.\n\n33:27.560 --> 33:29.520\nI mean, India is such a giant.\n\n33:29.520 --> 33:31.920\nLike, it's almost its own continent.\n\n33:31.920 --> 33:35.600\nAnd every city, from what I've heard,\n\n33:35.600 --> 33:38.880\nis really different in lots of ways.\n\n33:38.880 --> 33:43.080\nIt's, you know, 100,000 languages and all this different,\n\n33:43.080 --> 33:45.360\nlike, just from neighborhood to neighborhood is so different.\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:47.160\nI would love to go back and explore more of it.\n\n33:47.160 --> 33:48.960\nLike, some people go to Thailand and fall in love with it\n\n33:48.960 --> 33:52.720\nand go, OK, I could live in Thailand.\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:54.720\nI don't know that I would necessarily need to go live\n\n33:54.720 --> 33:55.920\nin India, but it's certainly a place.\n\n33:55.920 --> 33:58.400\nLike, Church has a friend, he's a composer who,\n\n33:58.400 --> 34:00.760\nmy name is Michael Dana, who, like, he goes there\n\n34:00.760 --> 34:02.960\nfor months, right?\n\n34:02.960 --> 34:06.200\nYeah, and like, he's in love with India.\n\n34:06.200 --> 34:07.760\nAnd you can see why.\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:10.160\nIt's like, just walking down the street,\n\n34:10.160 --> 34:13.960\nold ladies wearing these brilliantly colored saris\n\n34:13.960 --> 34:16.520\nor kurtees or whatever, and just walking down the road.\n\n34:16.520 --> 34:18.720\nAnd Church was dressed, you know, like in a black Vivian\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:20.320\nwestward suit the first day.\n\n34:20.320 --> 34:22.600\nAnd not getting, like, hostile looks,\n\n34:22.600 --> 34:25.560\nbut just kind of getting side eyes from the ladies.\n\n34:25.560 --> 34:27.440\nAnd then we got her some local gear.\n\n34:27.440 --> 34:29.520\nLike, you got some clothes there.\n\n34:29.520 --> 34:32.200\nYou want to come up and talk about it?\n\n34:32.200 --> 34:35.200\nChurch, come on up.\n\n34:35.200 --> 34:36.200\nChurch!\n\n34:41.200 --> 34:45.680\nLet's not talk about her like she's not here.\n\n34:45.680 --> 34:48.160\nAnd bring her up on stage.\n\n34:53.120 --> 34:54.720\nSo these women, like, walking down the road,\n\n34:54.720 --> 34:56.520\nand then she kind of put, like, some linen-y,\n\n34:56.520 --> 34:58.440\nlike, we got some, like, local, like,\n\n34:58.440 --> 34:59.920\nkind of more local-looking clothes.\n\n34:59.920 --> 35:01.640\nAnd then women just sort of smiling at her.\n\n35:01.640 --> 35:03.120\nAnd then we're walking down, like, these, like,\n\n35:03.120 --> 35:07.480\nthe old city in Hyderabad, which is much more Islamic.\n\n35:07.480 --> 35:10.400\nLike, a lot of burkas and the full-on head covering stuff.\n\n35:10.400 --> 35:12.200\nAnd little girls were just coming up to Church\n\n35:12.200 --> 35:13.240\nand just taking photos with her,\n\n35:13.240 --> 35:14.400\nlike she was, like, Lady Gaga.\n\n35:14.400 --> 35:15.400\nIt was fucking rad.\n\n35:15.400 --> 35:16.320\nIt was really good.\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:19.120\nYeah, they don't get a lot of Westerners\n\n35:19.120 --> 35:20.840\ncoming to Hyderabad.\n\n35:20.840 --> 35:23.760\nThere's, it's not really a tourist spot.\n\n35:23.760 --> 35:26.760\nSo we stood out.\n\n35:26.760 --> 35:27.840\nYeah, I looked like Godzilla.\n\n35:27.840 --> 35:31.760\nAnd she looked like Yolande from a fucking dn-word.\n\n35:31.760 --> 35:34.760\nI mean, you hear that, you hear that a lot about Thailand.\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:39.480\nAnd I didn't, I wasn't sure if India was like that.\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:41.040\nBut then again, India's gigantic.\n\n35:41.040 --> 35:43.400\nAnd so it probably vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:46.360\nBut that, that, I didn't know if that was also a thing\n\n35:46.360 --> 35:47.200\nthat was still happening.\n\n35:47.200 --> 35:52.000\nIn the 80s, I would hear that that if you're an American\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.240\nor a European and you're like, and you\n\n35:54.240 --> 35:58.680\ngo to some of these countries that people,\n\n35:58.680 --> 36:01.720\neverybody just wants to, like, pose with you\n\n36:01.720 --> 36:03.880\nand touch your clothes and all this stuff.\n\n36:03.880 --> 36:06.840\nAnd it, it's the kind of thing that it,\n\n36:06.840 --> 36:12.840\nas a white American, you, you don't want to,\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:14.440\nit feels racist.\n\n36:14.440 --> 36:15.440\nLike, you, it feels.\n\n36:15.440 --> 36:16.440\nIt also feels antiquated.\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:19.320\nI actually didn't expect that that would still be a thing\n\n36:19.320 --> 36:22.480\nnow that like, I don't know, post internet or something.\n\n36:22.480 --> 36:24.160\nAnd the way that you can get anything now\n\n36:24.160 --> 36:26.400\nand most places are becoming more and more Western.\n\n36:26.400 --> 36:29.640\nI really didn't expect to really feel so foreign.\n\n36:29.640 --> 36:30.200\nYeah.\n\n36:30.200 --> 36:31.360\nAnd that was a tech city.\n\n36:31.360 --> 36:32.360\nThese were tech cities.\n\n36:32.360 --> 36:34.840\nThese are sort of not even the places that you see\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:36.120\nin most of the travel photos.\n\n36:36.120 --> 36:38.880\nThese are the progressive kind of areas.\n\n36:38.880 --> 36:41.600\nIt's possible that the reason we think that way,\n\n36:41.600 --> 36:44.000\nand then we think that it's wrong to think that way\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:47.200\nor whatever, is that because we have a perverted relationship\n\n36:47.200 --> 36:51.840\nwith fame and with selfies and, and we,\n\n36:51.840 --> 36:55.720\nhow we conflate it with social status so that we have this,\n\n36:55.720 --> 36:57.960\nlike, oh, if you come up to somebody and say,\n\n36:57.960 --> 37:02.840\ncan I take a picture with you that you're taking something\n\n37:02.840 --> 37:06.440\nfrom them slash giving them something and there's an exchange\n\n37:06.440 --> 37:12.520\nhappening, whereas they, as a more ancient founded culture,\n\n37:12.520 --> 37:16.520\nlike, are just going, you look crazy.\n\n37:16.520 --> 37:19.280\nThey just walk up and say, can I take a selfie with you?\n\n37:19.280 --> 37:19.760\nYeah.\n\n37:19.760 --> 37:20.960\nLike, and there's no shame at all.\n\n37:20.960 --> 37:22.840\nIn fact, I noticed, I don't know if you noticed this,\n\n37:22.840 --> 37:25.200\ndid you see all the billboards advertising phones\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:26.280\nthat take better selfies?\n\n37:26.280 --> 37:27.920\nAnd it's just on billboards everywhere,\n\n37:27.920 --> 37:30.320\nspecifically advertising phones based\n\n37:30.320 --> 37:31.880\non having good selfies?\n\n37:31.880 --> 37:32.760\nYou didn't notice that?\n\n37:32.760 --> 37:33.840\nThey were everywhere.\n\n37:33.840 --> 37:36.520\nJeff was telling me about the headwag thing\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:42.840\nthat I found so fascinating that there's this, I mean,\n\n37:42.840 --> 37:44.160\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n37:44.160 --> 37:46.800\nIt could be like, maybe, or like, oh, I'm thinking, or.\n\n37:46.800 --> 37:48.240\nIt's like saying, um.\n\n37:48.240 --> 37:50.440\nAnd like, while you're like, you're saying, hey,\n\n37:50.440 --> 37:52.080\nso if we're going to leave for the airport,\n\n37:52.080 --> 37:56.920\nand while you're saying, like, the person's trying to go,\n\n37:56.920 --> 37:58.560\nthat's them cogitating.\n\n37:58.560 --> 38:01.240\nIt's an acknowledgement of what you're saying being processed.\n\n38:01.240 --> 38:02.520\nSo I was kind of like reading it.\n\n38:02.520 --> 38:05.520\nAs opposed to just immediately babbling and saying, um, er,\n\n38:05.520 --> 38:07.120\nwell, let me see, I don't know.\n\n38:07.120 --> 38:11.800\nWhich I would imagine during that crucial phase, a lot of us,\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:13.840\nthat's when a lot of us say no to each other.\n\n38:13.840 --> 38:15.320\nBecause we don't know what to do.\n\n38:15.320 --> 38:17.040\nAnd hey, do you know how to?\n\n38:17.040 --> 38:19.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.440\nBut then maybe if we did have a thing in our culture where\n\n38:21.440 --> 38:22.840\nit's like, well, don't do that.\n\n38:22.840 --> 38:25.960\nDon't just diarrhea some nose at each other.\n\n38:25.960 --> 38:29.560\nDon't feel the need to, like, barf up information.\n\n38:29.560 --> 38:32.600\nActually, if you're on pause, it's\n\n38:32.600 --> 38:38.040\nlike a little pinwheel thing in an operating system\n\n38:38.040 --> 38:41.520\nthat someone's going like this while they heard me.\n\n38:41.520 --> 38:43.760\nI think it means lots of different things\n\n38:43.760 --> 38:47.160\nand we weren't there long enough to totally learn.\n\n38:47.160 --> 38:52.720\nBut it's just you don't see that little chin-wag thing.\n\n38:52.720 --> 38:54.880\nIt felt like it made sense after about a day.\n\n38:54.880 --> 38:56.200\nIt was sort of strange at first.\n\n38:56.200 --> 38:58.800\nAnd then I kind of got just, it's\n\n38:58.800 --> 39:01.160\nlike when you're trying to pick up a new language\n\n39:01.160 --> 39:03.800\nand you start to learn things based on just the context\n\n39:03.800 --> 39:05.240\nof what's happening.\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:07.080\nYou know, it's just body language.\n\n39:07.080 --> 39:09.920\nAnd it's like, oh, well, he's saying, yeah.\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:11.040\nBy the way, his eyes look.\n\n39:11.040 --> 39:12.640\nI can tell it's like, yeah, maybe.\n\n39:12.640 --> 39:14.640\nLike this other point is like, oh, yes, absolutely.\n\n39:14.640 --> 39:15.880\nI can do that.\n\n39:15.880 --> 39:16.880\nHere's something I noticed.\n\n39:16.880 --> 39:17.880\nSorry.\n\n39:17.880 --> 39:18.680\nDid I cut you off?\n\n39:18.680 --> 39:21.000\nNo, go ahead.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.480\nThis is fucked up.\n\n39:23.480 --> 39:25.760\nYou know how people think on Twitter\n\n39:25.760 --> 39:28.520\nthat I wrote Teen Wolf on the MTV show.\n\n39:28.520 --> 39:31.000\nIn India, people kept coming up to me.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:34.080\nAnd they go, at the hotel, like, we're these nice hotels.\n\n39:34.080 --> 39:36.120\nAnd it's two waitresses come up to me.\n\n39:36.120 --> 39:37.480\nI'm having breakfast.\n\n39:37.480 --> 39:41.960\nAnd they go, pardon me, Mr. Davis, Jeff Davis?\n\n39:41.960 --> 39:44.120\nYeah, they go, we are such big fans of yours.\n\n39:44.120 --> 39:45.840\nAnd there's a lot of Who's Line fans there.\n\n39:45.840 --> 39:47.840\nLike, it's been syndicated there for ages.\n\n39:47.840 --> 39:50.040\nSo a lot of people really know Who's Line, which\n\n39:50.040 --> 39:52.360\nis why they brought us out there, I suppose.\n\n39:52.360 --> 39:53.960\nThere, everyone thinks I'm Jeff.\n\n39:53.960 --> 39:55.520\nThe same Jeff Davis that wrote Teen Wolf,\n\n39:55.520 --> 39:59.200\nbut for their money, they're giant criminal minds fans.\n\n39:59.200 --> 40:00.960\nAnd everybody thought I was the Jeff Davis\n\n40:00.960 --> 40:02.440\nthat wrote Criminal Minds, because that's\n\n40:02.440 --> 40:04.160\nthe same Jeff Davis that wrote Teen Wolf.\n\n40:04.160 --> 40:06.040\nWe've got to get this guy on the show.\n\n40:06.040 --> 40:07.160\nIt shouldn't be.\n\n40:07.160 --> 40:09.480\nI don't want to insult him by saying it shouldn't be that hard.\n\n40:09.480 --> 40:13.040\nBut I'm just assuming if he works in LA and his name's\n\n40:13.040 --> 40:15.600\nJeff Davis, he must want to talk about this.\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:17.200\nWe did a show in Bangalore.\n\n40:17.200 --> 40:18.200\nGreg and I were doing it.\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:20.080\nThen we're doing it, like, a photo op meet and greet.\n\n40:20.080 --> 40:21.880\nPeople come up and take photos and stuff\n\n40:21.880 --> 40:22.880\nlike that with a backdrop.\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:25.760\nAnd the whole paparazzi kind of flim flam.\n\n40:25.760 --> 40:27.200\nAnd security and stuff.\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:30.840\nThese guys that look like straight up Harmontown age,\n\n40:30.840 --> 40:33.960\nHarmontown nerdy looking fans, they come up and they're like,\n\n40:33.960 --> 40:35.720\noh, we have big fans of yours, big fans of yours.\n\n40:35.720 --> 40:36.800\nLike, oh, thank you.\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:37.560\nYou like the show?\n\n40:37.560 --> 40:39.360\nLike, we love the show, Criminal Minds, the best show\n\n40:39.360 --> 40:39.840\nin the world.\n\n40:39.840 --> 40:41.120\nCriminal Minds.\n\n40:41.120 --> 40:43.680\nBut they just saw me perform improv.\n\n40:43.680 --> 40:45.480\nAnd they still think that I'm the Jeff Davis\n\n40:45.480 --> 40:46.280\nfrom Criminal Minds.\n\n40:46.280 --> 40:48.880\nWell, yeah, I mean, that's to live in their world,\n\n40:48.880 --> 40:52.320\nwhere you're like, yeah, I'm creating Criminal Minds\n\n40:52.320 --> 40:54.240\nand Teen Wolf, and then fuck it, let's play.\n\n40:54.240 --> 40:55.400\nLet's play emotional parties.\n\n40:55.400 --> 40:57.520\nAs a sideline, I tell dick jokes.\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:58.960\nBut I'm not being a show writer.\n\n40:58.960 --> 41:01.120\nBut wait, what's Criminal Minds again?\n\n41:01.120 --> 41:02.000\nI don't know.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:03.800\nI think Padgett Brewster was on it at some point.\n\n41:03.800 --> 41:05.400\nNo, is that?\n\n41:05.400 --> 41:06.280\nReally?\n\n41:06.280 --> 41:07.080\nI think.\n\n41:07.080 --> 41:07.440\nI don't know.\n\n41:07.440 --> 41:08.560\nI've never seen that or Teen Wolf.\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:09.680\nI don't know.\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:11.280\nI just know that.\n\n41:11.280 --> 41:14.160\nI told you about my accountant calling me up and saying that,\n\n41:14.160 --> 41:16.800\ndid you spend $5,000 on limousines last night?\n\n41:16.800 --> 41:17.560\nNo.\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:20.840\nI got billed for the other Jeff Davis's limo rides\n\n41:20.840 --> 41:22.400\nto the Emmys or something like that.\n\n41:22.400 --> 41:23.200\nOh, man.\n\n41:23.200 --> 41:24.520\nIt's like, we were.\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:27.280\nWhen they come up with TV show names, are they trying?\n\n41:27.280 --> 41:29.320\nAre they, is part of it like, well,\n\n41:29.320 --> 41:33.960\nwe want it to sound like other shows\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:37.760\nbecause that's part of the appeal of TV, if it sounds\n\n41:37.760 --> 41:41.720\ntoo much like a bus, people won't know they should watch it.\n\n41:41.720 --> 41:45.120\nSo let's call it TV show.\n\n41:45.120 --> 41:48.480\nBut we'll just technically change the title\n\n41:48.480 --> 41:49.920\nso that you can find it.\n\n41:49.920 --> 41:52.280\nI think especially for procedurals and stuff.\n\n41:52.280 --> 41:53.760\nThat's absolutely a huge.\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:55.880\nLike, there's always NYP, or I don't know.\n\n41:55.880 --> 41:58.600\nIt's like, then there was Chicago and Chicago Fire.\n\n41:58.600 --> 42:01.800\nAnd it's like, they're trying to just cash on the,\n\n42:01.800 --> 42:05.160\nit's just these words that are like things you like, right?\n\n42:05.160 --> 42:06.000\nTelevision.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:07.400\nIt makes sense.\n\n42:07.400 --> 42:11.040\nIn an ideal culture, you could call it anything.\n\n42:11.040 --> 42:16.560\nYou could call it, Gadzooka Muka colon, a crime procedural.\n\n42:16.560 --> 42:19.640\nAnd then people would go, oh, Gadzooka Muka.\n\n42:19.640 --> 42:22.400\nAt least I can remember that.\n\n42:22.400 --> 42:23.240\nWho's forgetting it?\n\n42:23.240 --> 42:23.640\nWhatever.\n\n42:23.640 --> 42:25.240\nIf you're into that, I guess you're remembering them.\n\n42:25.240 --> 42:27.680\nWhat's the elevator pitch for a Gadzooka Muka?\n\n42:27.680 --> 42:33.400\nIt's just seven experts from different fields\n\n42:33.400 --> 42:38.720\nforced to work on a task force in downtown Cincinnati\n\n42:38.720 --> 42:43.680\ndue to the recent string of abductions.\n\n42:43.680 --> 42:45.880\nAnd then at the end of the season, if you watch it,\n\n42:45.880 --> 42:49.560\nthen at the end of it, they're like, well, I guess that's it.\n\n42:49.560 --> 42:51.280\nThey got all the boxes packed up.\n\n42:51.280 --> 42:54.120\nAnd the sets are, the bulletin boards are emptied.\n\n42:54.120 --> 42:56.320\nAnd then the guy comes out from the office\n\n42:56.320 --> 43:00.160\nand goes like, that's so fast, jackasses.\n\n43:00.160 --> 43:04.240\nA homeless guy just got eaten by a Loch Ness Monster in Scotland.\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:06.520\nBut eight Loch Ness Monsters.\n\n43:06.520 --> 43:08.760\nAnd then the quiz that that's like, how many Loch Ness Monsters?\n\n43:08.760 --> 43:09.760\nWe're going to Scotland.\n\n43:09.760 --> 43:12.760\nOh, you're there.\n\n43:12.760 --> 43:15.160\nCincinnati's being overrun by Loch Ness Monsters.\n\n43:18.360 --> 43:21.040\nYeah, I wonder what it would take to write a procedural.\n\n43:21.040 --> 43:25.000\nI guess a healthy dose of watching procedurals.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.160\nThat seems like everybody.\n\n43:26.160 --> 43:28.680\nYeah, I think you have to have someone\n\n43:28.680 --> 43:31.240\nlike a consulting producer that used\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:33.840\nto work on one of those things that knows all the full plans.\n\n43:33.840 --> 43:36.040\nLet's see if we could just improvise a procedural,\n\n43:36.040 --> 43:37.720\njust as a radio play.\n\n43:37.720 --> 43:38.800\nWe don't have to act it out.\n\n43:38.800 --> 43:39.300\nOK.\n\n43:39.300 --> 43:41.200\nI'm not as familiar with them as you are.\n\n43:41.200 --> 43:42.760\nI don't really watch them, but I'll do my best.\n\n43:42.760 --> 43:44.560\nI think you could take my lead.\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:49.840\nI'm like Marty McFly saying to the band,\n\n43:49.840 --> 43:52.560\nwatch me for the changes, try to keep up.\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:57.400\nAll right, so the cold open, I think we could put a pin in.\n\n43:57.400 --> 44:01.600\nBut let's just say it's like a paper plate factory\n\n44:01.600 --> 44:04.520\nand a guy's finishing making the paper plates.\n\n44:04.520 --> 44:06.080\nAnd he goes like, I'm all done here.\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:09.720\nAnd his off-screen voice says, are you?\n\n44:12.640 --> 44:13.240\nYeah.\n\n44:13.240 --> 44:15.480\nThere's more in here, though.\n\n44:15.480 --> 44:18.920\nIn here where it's dark and not surveilled.\n\n44:18.920 --> 44:21.720\nAnd then he walks into the back room.\n\n44:21.720 --> 44:23.300\nAnd you don't even hear what happens.\n\n44:27.800 --> 44:32.200\nI got to admit, I didn't expect this guy to be the victim,\n\n44:32.200 --> 44:33.000\nbut it's OK.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.200\nBut if we don't see what happened, all right,\n\n44:35.200 --> 44:37.120\nwell, do we hear a sound like a silencer?\n\n44:37.120 --> 44:38.920\nNo, it goes to silent.\n\n44:38.920 --> 44:41.320\nLike it kind of sounds faint now.\n\n44:41.320 --> 44:44.280\nThen we cut to a woman in bed, and she's\n\n44:44.280 --> 44:47.280\nlooking like she's nervously sleeping and reaches over,\n\n44:47.280 --> 44:48.440\nand there's nobody there.\n\n44:48.440 --> 44:51.080\nAnd she sees the clock, and it's 2.30 AM.\n\n44:51.080 --> 44:56.240\nAnd she picks up her phone and starts calling somebody.\n\n44:56.240 --> 45:00.920\nBut a cold open, we're going to need to punch this thing.\n\n45:00.920 --> 45:03.360\nLike, we want to blow to our cold open.\n\n45:03.360 --> 45:05.240\nAnd it can't be a guy walking in the darkness.\n\n45:05.240 --> 45:06.960\nIt can't be a lady checking her phone.\n\n45:06.960 --> 45:08.920\nBut she's like, where is it?\n\n45:08.920 --> 45:10.080\nNow he's disappeared.\n\n45:10.080 --> 45:10.800\nNow where is he?\n\n45:10.800 --> 45:12.280\nThat's the assumption we're making, right?\n\n45:12.280 --> 45:15.080\nSo now he's disappeared at the paper plate factory.\n\n45:15.080 --> 45:16.840\nHe was supposed to be home hours ago.\n\n45:16.840 --> 45:19.720\nSo then cut to her, because it's a cold open.\n\n45:19.720 --> 45:20.720\nWe got to keep it short.\n\n45:20.720 --> 45:22.040\nSo now, but now, doesn't the story\n\n45:22.040 --> 45:25.160\nchange into her finding her guy who disappeared?\n\n45:25.160 --> 45:27.600\nSo she cut to her pulling up.\n\n45:27.600 --> 45:28.600\nAnd let's just save money.\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:29.400\nNow she's going to the paper plate factory.\n\n45:29.400 --> 45:32.040\nAnd she cut to her at the same set where he was.\n\n45:32.040 --> 45:33.040\nYeah.\n\n45:33.040 --> 45:36.200\nShe's wearing a fur coat, or whatever she threw on.\n\n45:36.200 --> 45:40.920\nA fur coat, because she's the rich wife of a paper plate\n\n45:40.920 --> 45:42.080\nfactory worker.\n\n45:42.080 --> 45:43.880\nWell, I think that's a clue.\n\n45:43.880 --> 45:44.680\nIt's a gift.\n\n45:44.680 --> 45:46.000\nI don't want to blow the whole plot,\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:47.920\nbut I think that's going to be a thing.\n\n45:47.920 --> 45:52.640\nAnd so she walks into that back room\n\n45:52.640 --> 45:53.920\nthat Spencer described.\n\n45:53.920 --> 45:56.320\nAnd then she turns on a light.\n\n45:56.320 --> 45:58.480\nAnd the camera kind of goes busters on her.\n\n45:58.480 --> 46:00.240\nAnd she goes, oh!\n\n46:00.240 --> 46:02.360\nOK, so then you can go to your title sequence.\n\n46:02.360 --> 46:03.200\nCSI and letters.\n\n46:03.200 --> 46:06.840\nAnd it's like crime, conspiracies, international.\n\n46:06.840 --> 46:07.520\nNo, that's wrong.\n\n46:07.520 --> 46:08.480\nThat's not a good title.\n\n46:08.480 --> 46:09.720\nIt's Gadsukamuka.\n\n46:09.720 --> 46:10.440\nGadsukamuka.\n\n46:10.440 --> 46:11.240\nSorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n46:11.240 --> 46:12.320\nGadsukamuka.\n\n46:12.320 --> 46:14.160\nWhich is the name of the plate company.\n\n46:14.160 --> 46:16.160\nOh.\n\n46:16.160 --> 46:18.960\nIt's centered, it's a serious centered around the intrigue\n\n46:18.960 --> 46:20.080\nof the plate company.\n\n46:20.080 --> 46:21.560\nAll right, Gadsukamuka plates.\n\n46:21.560 --> 46:23.240\nOK, all right.\n\n46:23.240 --> 46:24.680\nGadsukamuka plates.\n\n46:24.680 --> 46:26.280\nYou know what?\n\n46:26.280 --> 46:29.240\nAnd the billboards for the show say, you know what?\n\n46:31.800 --> 46:33.360\nNow serving murder.\n\n46:35.760 --> 46:37.960\nAs murder serves three.\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:39.680\nCome back for seconds.\n\n46:39.680 --> 46:40.760\nDegrees, murders.\n\n46:40.760 --> 46:45.880\nThe plates are disposable, but the crimes last forever.\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:50.560\nKind of thing, like, heartache is forever.\n\n46:50.560 --> 46:53.200\nI don't want to keep developing this show.\n\n46:53.200 --> 46:55.160\nNot because I don't believe in it,\n\n46:55.160 --> 46:57.280\nbecause I'm starting to get greedy.\n\n46:57.280 --> 46:59.600\nRight, yeah, I don't want people to know about this.\n\n46:59.600 --> 47:01.160\nI have a first look with FX.\n\n47:01.160 --> 47:02.400\nI don't want to believe this.\n\n47:02.400 --> 47:04.600\nGadsukamuka plates.\n\n47:04.600 --> 47:07.320\nI mean, I think this is probably like a six episode\n\n47:07.320 --> 47:08.600\nNetflix-y kind of thing, right?\n\n47:08.600 --> 47:10.280\nI mean, you like spotlight.\n\n47:10.280 --> 47:11.840\nYeah, which was a six episode.\n\n47:11.840 --> 47:15.320\nWell, shit, if it's on Netflix, well, it's not develop it.\n\n47:15.320 --> 47:17.240\nLet's just make it a 10 hour story,\n\n47:17.240 --> 47:19.440\nchop it into six parts, and go home.\n\n47:19.440 --> 47:20.960\nUh-oh.\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:24.560\nShots fired on Netflix.\n\n47:24.560 --> 47:28.440\nShots fired most successful TV venue.\n\n47:28.440 --> 47:31.400\nI warmed up to Mindhunter, but it\n\n47:31.400 --> 47:33.280\ncouldn't use more paper plates.\n\n47:33.280 --> 47:36.720\nThere are Mindhunters in criminal minds, I think.\n\n47:36.720 --> 47:40.120\nLike, I think most of the show is a bunch of Mindhunters.\n\n47:40.120 --> 47:44.240\nDid the Golden Globes go off without a hitch?\n\n47:44.240 --> 47:49.760\nOh my god, I am still recovering after that Oprah speech.\n\n47:49.760 --> 47:51.320\nThat's all I'm seeing on Instagram\n\n47:51.320 --> 47:53.200\nis people posting pictures of Oprah.\n\n47:53.200 --> 47:55.760\nJust the most generic things about it, too.\n\n47:55.760 --> 47:59.120\nJust like you had to have been either very impressive\n\n47:59.120 --> 48:00.320\nor very not impressive.\n\n48:00.320 --> 48:02.240\nDid she go there, or did she not go there?\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:04.160\nI think she went there.\n\n48:04.160 --> 48:05.680\nShe gave everyone a car.\n\n48:05.680 --> 48:08.400\nThe disappointing thing would be amazing if she literally\n\n48:08.400 --> 48:11.760\ngave everyone a car, not just the people at the Golden Globes,\n\n48:11.760 --> 48:13.760\njust everyone, all of us.\n\n48:13.760 --> 48:14.800\nWe all get a car.\n\n48:14.800 --> 48:16.280\nAs a measure of her actual wealth.\n\n48:16.280 --> 48:17.720\nThat we're sitting here snarking her,\n\n48:17.720 --> 48:20.640\nand then we go home and we have a car.\n\n48:20.640 --> 48:21.960\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n48:21.960 --> 48:25.760\nIt's in your busted garage right now, next to the Segway.\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:27.160\nI'm the only one that doesn't have a car,\n\n48:27.160 --> 48:31.840\nbecause my garage door is busted, so everyone took my car.\n\n48:31.840 --> 48:33.080\nIs the Segway still down there?\n\n48:33.080 --> 48:34.280\nDid you remove it?\n\n48:34.280 --> 48:34.840\nNo, we didn't.\n\n48:34.840 --> 48:35.680\nThe Segway never existed.\n\n48:35.680 --> 48:37.520\nYeah, it was a trick of the line.\n\n48:37.520 --> 48:39.440\nI was cooler than that.\n\n48:39.440 --> 48:40.280\nThe Segway, I got.\n\n48:40.280 --> 48:41.640\nYou missed an opportunity in that photo\n\n48:41.640 --> 48:45.160\nthat you and Cody both posted photos of it, I think.\n\n48:45.160 --> 48:47.080\nAnd what you do, the way you get away\n\n48:47.080 --> 48:49.640\nwith you having an embarrassing Segway in your garage,\n\n48:49.640 --> 48:52.280\nis you say that that's what the drunk driver was on.\n\n48:52.280 --> 48:53.280\nI know.\n\n48:53.280 --> 48:55.960\nHe drove the Segway through your garage door.\n\n48:55.960 --> 48:57.760\nI kept going until he hit the back wall.\n\n48:57.760 --> 48:59.520\nI figured that out after you said it.\n\n48:59.520 --> 49:01.800\nI mean, bonus points for actually taking the Segway\n\n49:01.800 --> 49:04.760\nand placing it at the point of impact.\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:06.160\nDo you think that would be too much?\n\n49:06.160 --> 49:08.760\nYou just tipped over sideways with a couple of beer cans.\n\n49:08.760 --> 49:12.080\nPut a chalk line that's shaped like a Segway in front\n\n49:12.080 --> 49:13.560\nof the garage.\n\n49:13.560 --> 49:21.040\nSpeaking of Hollywood gossip, I don't want to get you guys\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:22.840\nin trouble because of your personal relationships.\n\n49:22.840 --> 49:26.040\nCan I just say I was at a party?\n\n49:26.040 --> 49:28.560\nThere was a birthday party of a famous musician.\n\n49:28.560 --> 49:31.840\nYeah, can we talk about this, or can we not talk about this?\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:35.040\nAll I want to say is, let me vet this with you\n\n49:35.040 --> 49:36.640\nand you tell me if I can say it.\n\n49:36.640 --> 49:39.200\nI just want to say that Johnny Depp was at the party,\n\n49:39.200 --> 49:42.680\nand I think he was literally wearing a hat on a hat.\n\n49:42.680 --> 49:45.040\nI can confirm this.\n\n49:45.040 --> 49:49.360\nHe was literally, he was like a beanie on a beanie.\n\n49:49.360 --> 49:51.920\nHe was wearing all of the costumes\n\n49:51.920 --> 49:55.040\nfrom the last eight Pirates movies at the same time.\n\n49:55.040 --> 49:57.400\nHe had a lot of shit on him.\n\n49:57.400 --> 49:59.400\nI couldn't believe it.\n\n49:59.400 --> 50:00.880\nYeah, he was wearing layers.\n\n50:00.880 --> 50:02.080\nI'm so celebrity blind.\n\n50:02.080 --> 50:03.760\nI didn't know that I was standing next to Courtney\n\n50:03.760 --> 50:06.440\nleft for 10 minutes until somebody pointed out\n\n50:06.440 --> 50:08.400\nthat I was Courtney left standing.\n\n50:08.400 --> 50:10.520\nShe really gave me the heebie-jeebies.\n\n50:10.520 --> 50:14.800\nJust in the vein of harmless gossip,\n\n50:14.800 --> 50:17.240\nI'm not going to cross a threshold into defamation\n\n50:17.240 --> 50:18.000\nor anything like that.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:22.560\nI think she'd be happy to hear this, me gossiping about this.\n\n50:22.560 --> 50:26.480\nBut at the same time, it's totally shallow crap\n\n50:26.480 --> 50:28.240\nthat's just starfuckery.\n\n50:28.240 --> 50:30.000\nI was at a party and Courtney Love was there.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:33.920\nBut it was noteworthy to me.\n\n50:33.920 --> 50:39.720\nI was like, wow, she looks healthy.\n\n50:39.720 --> 50:40.600\nShe looks great.\n\n50:40.600 --> 50:42.160\nYeah, that's all I wanted to say.\n\n50:42.160 --> 50:44.520\nShe looks better than she did 10 years ago, which is something.\n\n50:44.520 --> 50:46.240\nIt takes on a new tone now because you're\n\n50:46.240 --> 50:48.080\nlike, oh, you're not supposed to judge people,\n\n50:48.080 --> 50:49.080\nobjectify on that stuff.\n\n50:49.080 --> 50:50.680\nBut Courtney Love, I think, is a special case\n\n50:50.680 --> 50:52.000\nbecause it's like, well, she's Courtney Love.\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.600\nShe was sort of like a tarot card for like,\n\n50:54.600 --> 50:58.240\nshe was the American, I don't know.\n\n50:58.240 --> 51:00.160\nWe always have these archetypes that we sell.\n\n51:00.160 --> 51:01.640\nAnd we go like, oh, she's crazy.\n\n51:01.640 --> 51:02.960\nShe's doing, she's drunk.\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:04.880\nYeah, she's had her ups and downs.\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:10.520\nBut for somebody who had that archetype and that power,\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:14.840\nshe was like, yeah, she looked very healthy.\n\n51:14.840 --> 51:17.640\nWho cares about my opinion about who looks healthy?\n\n51:17.640 --> 51:18.920\nI think that gets into character.\n\n51:18.920 --> 51:20.480\nI find that being an accused murderist\n\n51:20.480 --> 51:22.280\ntakes a lot of years off.\n\n51:22.280 --> 51:23.960\nWhat did you say?\n\n51:23.960 --> 51:26.680\nBeing an accused murderist.\n\n51:26.680 --> 51:29.600\nI didn't mean to make you repeat it.\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:30.560\nWhat's the deal with that?\n\n51:30.560 --> 51:31.440\nCan we talk about Charles Fleischer, though?\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:34.000\nYou know, let's talk about Courtney Love's\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.080\ninvolvement in Kurt Cobain's death.\n\n51:36.080 --> 51:37.680\nWell, I think if we talk about that\n\n51:37.680 --> 51:39.360\nand then talk about Charles Fleischer,\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:42.080\nwe'll definitely never be invited to any parties ever again.\n\n51:42.080 --> 51:44.280\nThat'll be the only result.\n\n51:44.280 --> 51:46.480\nCharles Fleischer, the voice of Roger Rabbit.\n\n51:46.480 --> 51:48.840\nBut it is important to say, Charles Fleischer\n\n51:48.840 --> 51:50.240\nhas become physically specific.\n\n51:50.240 --> 51:51.720\nHe's become a mythical creature.\n\n51:51.720 --> 51:54.560\nWhat happened with Charles Fleischer?\n\n51:54.560 --> 51:57.000\nThat is for God to answer.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.120\nDid you guys listen to Skulljuice?\n\n51:59.120 --> 52:00.600\nIs that what you're talking about?\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:01.760\nNo.\n\n52:01.760 --> 52:04.320\nBut if you have not heard the Skulljuice episode\n\n52:04.320 --> 52:06.840\nwith Dino Stamatopoulos and Andy Dick or Charles Fleischer,\n\n52:06.840 --> 52:08.680\nit's momentarily a guest.\n\n52:08.680 --> 52:10.680\nIt's arguably the only listen episode.\n\n52:10.680 --> 52:12.680\nDino throws him off the show kind of.\n\n52:12.680 --> 52:15.080\nNo, he just drives him off the show.\n\n52:15.080 --> 52:16.240\nIt was fucking.\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:17.280\nIt's the best episode.\n\n52:17.280 --> 52:19.160\nIt's the only episode you've got to listen to.\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:21.720\nI think it's the best episode of a podcast I've ever heard.\n\n52:21.720 --> 52:22.520\nIt was amazing.\n\n52:22.520 --> 52:24.520\nIt was certainly like this belongs in a museum.\n\n52:24.520 --> 52:26.400\nYou don't have to love or hate Roger Rabbit\n\n52:26.400 --> 52:30.400\nor no Dino or Andy Dick or give a shit about podcasts\n\n52:30.400 --> 52:31.320\nwho love this episode.\n\n52:31.320 --> 52:34.920\nBecause the amount of conflict that happens in the first four\n\n52:34.920 --> 52:37.520\nminutes is outrageous.\n\n52:37.520 --> 52:38.020\nYeah.\n\n52:38.020 --> 52:40.120\nCharles Fleischer was just kind of haunting the party.\n\n52:40.120 --> 52:41.400\nAnd when the cake came out, he just\n\n52:41.400 --> 52:42.680\nwanted to eat all the cake.\n\n52:42.680 --> 52:44.960\nDo you think it's OK to talk about just the one thing\n\n52:44.960 --> 52:48.680\nthat I think the listeners would be interested in without?\n\n52:48.680 --> 52:50.840\nWe don't have to talk about whose house the party was at,\n\n52:50.840 --> 52:55.160\nbut just the interesting fact about how the party kind of\n\n52:55.160 --> 52:56.320\nwent off the rails.\n\n52:56.320 --> 52:56.880\nIs that?\n\n52:56.880 --> 52:59.000\nDo you think that's too?\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:03.080\nWell, let me tell it then carefully,\n\n53:03.080 --> 53:05.600\nbecause I don't want anybody to get upset,\n\n53:05.600 --> 53:07.560\nbecause I did do some looking.\n\n53:07.560 --> 53:10.640\nAnd thankfully, it didn't seem to explode online or anything.\n\n53:10.640 --> 53:11.840\nAnd there hasn't been any gossip,\n\n53:11.840 --> 53:14.040\nso I don't want it to start here.\n\n53:14.040 --> 53:18.120\nBut someone made the mistake as anyone\n\n53:18.120 --> 53:20.080\nwho's ever been to a Hollywood party, which I'm sure\n\n53:20.080 --> 53:22.840\nis all of these listeners knows.\n\n53:22.840 --> 53:25.160\nYou're not supposed to say where you're at,\n\n53:25.160 --> 53:26.520\nand it's pretty tight.\n\n53:26.520 --> 53:30.200\nAnd you don't want anybody just showing up\n\n53:30.200 --> 53:31.840\nto like a house party or whatever.\n\n53:31.840 --> 53:32.920\nIf you can't believe you're there.\n\n53:32.920 --> 53:35.320\nWhen you have Johnny Dapp there or whatever, like, yeah.\n\n53:35.320 --> 53:36.040\nIf you can't believe it.\n\n53:36.040 --> 53:37.200\nDon't put the address on Facebook.\n\n53:37.200 --> 53:39.120\nI didn't know that you and Cody are going to be there.\n\n53:39.120 --> 53:41.400\nI was blown away that you and Cody and just couldn't believe\n\n53:41.400 --> 53:41.880\nyou were there.\n\n53:41.880 --> 53:42.400\nI know.\n\n53:42.400 --> 53:43.520\nThere were so many people who didn't belong there.\n\n53:43.520 --> 53:47.400\nWho let this rabble in?\n\n53:47.400 --> 53:50.400\nAnd already, it was a little bit too loose of a guest list.\n\n53:50.400 --> 53:52.600\nLike, once we came in, the owner of the house\n\n53:52.600 --> 53:55.400\nwas not too pleased with just how many people were in his house.\n\n53:55.400 --> 53:57.280\nHe wasn't quite prepared for that.\n\n53:57.280 --> 53:59.320\nBut someone had the bright idea to like,\n\n53:59.320 --> 54:02.800\nI don't know if they deliberately posted it on Instagram\n\n54:02.800 --> 54:07.560\nor if they location tagged where they were without thinking\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:08.240\nor something.\n\n54:08.240 --> 54:11.400\nBut somehow, the address got out.\n\n54:11.400 --> 54:15.040\nAnd like, teenagers started showing up.\n\n54:15.040 --> 54:19.960\nLike, young fans of the, it was just like,\n\n54:19.960 --> 54:22.600\nthey were pounding on the gates.\n\n54:22.600 --> 54:25.560\nAnd there had been, like, ballet.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:27.160\nWe can say it was Sting's house.\n\n54:27.160 --> 54:28.160\nIt was Sting's house.\n\n54:28.160 --> 54:29.000\nNo, it was Sting's house.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:30.000\nWe can talk about this now.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.680\nIt was Steve's place.\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:34.200\nNo, Sting's house.\n\n54:34.200 --> 54:38.000\nThe phrase Sting's house is already funny.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.200\nLike, I never imagined him living in a house.\n\n54:40.200 --> 54:46.080\nI would imagine him living in a nest, like under the Aurora\n\n54:46.080 --> 54:46.840\nBorealis.\n\n54:46.840 --> 54:49.640\nLike, it was a nice tree house.\n\n54:49.640 --> 54:52.320\nIt was the biggest tree house party I've ever been to.\n\n54:52.320 --> 54:56.400\nSting lives in an igloo that's.\n\n54:56.400 --> 54:57.800\nInside of a yurt.\n\n54:57.800 --> 55:02.400\nHe has a, yeah, inside his yoga sweat lodge is an igloo.\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:05.280\nHe lives, yeah, he lives in an igloo inside a yurt.\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:07.560\nAnd all of his appliances are powered\n\n55:07.560 --> 55:11.360\nby the temperature differential between the yurt\n\n55:11.360 --> 55:12.560\nand the igloo.\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:17.920\nSo yurt compound connected with hammocks.\n\n55:17.920 --> 55:22.200\nIt has a half-life of 700 years and two orgasms.\n\n55:22.200 --> 55:27.160\nAll of the electricity is powered by his own self-interest.\n\n55:27.160 --> 55:27.640\nOK.\n\n55:27.640 --> 55:28.160\nFuck Sting.\n\n55:28.160 --> 55:30.160\nWe can't punish Sting for our interest in him.\n\n55:30.160 --> 55:31.120\nSting's the worst.\n\n55:31.120 --> 55:31.760\nAll right.\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:33.880\nYou were at his house.\n\n55:33.880 --> 55:35.520\nWe weren't really at Sting's house.\n\n55:35.520 --> 55:37.200\nFor the purposes of this story, we're just\n\n55:37.200 --> 55:39.120\ngoing to keep pretending it's Sting's house.\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:40.320\nSo it's Sting's house.\n\n55:40.320 --> 55:43.040\nI'm sorry if anybody thought that we were at Sting's house.\n\n55:43.040 --> 55:45.000\nWe got derailed just because the phrase Sting's house\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:46.000\nwas really entertaining to me.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.640\nBut basically, the end of the story\n\n55:47.640 --> 55:49.320\nis that there was property damage\n\n55:49.320 --> 55:52.400\nbecause someone leaked a location of this party.\n\n55:52.400 --> 55:54.720\nAnd these kids broke like the front gate and the back gate.\n\n55:54.720 --> 55:56.080\nWe're talking about stealing.\n\n55:56.080 --> 55:59.640\nAnd it ended up in this everybody out scenario\n\n55:59.640 --> 56:02.000\nthat sent the kids who were trying\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:06.760\nto break in with the party guests, including Courtney Love\n\n56:06.760 --> 56:10.400\nand anybody else who was like some hot shot out\n\n56:10.400 --> 56:12.920\non the street at the exact same moment all trying\n\n56:12.920 --> 56:14.560\nto get cars at the same time.\n\n56:14.560 --> 56:15.920\nAnd that's kind of fun for the kids\n\n56:15.920 --> 56:17.520\nto know that if you're at a Hollywood party\n\n56:17.520 --> 56:20.400\nand shit goes sideways enough, you\n\n56:20.400 --> 56:23.280\nwill get shoved into the street with famous people.\n\n56:23.280 --> 56:26.480\nYeah, now it's going to be the goal, right, like after this.\n\n56:26.480 --> 56:29.880\nYou and Cody had left before the fur hit the fire.\n\n56:29.880 --> 56:31.360\nRight before.\n\n56:31.360 --> 56:33.320\nThen things got crazy and everyone's being yelled at.\n\n56:33.320 --> 56:38.600\nAnd the guy who threw the party was mad at the birthday person.\n\n56:38.600 --> 56:40.800\nBut we found out, I thought Johnny Depp got thrown out\n\n56:40.800 --> 56:42.560\nwith us because we all got thrown out.\n\n56:42.560 --> 56:44.840\nWe all made our way out the door at the same time.\n\n56:44.840 --> 56:47.840\nJohnny Depp was apparently there at 3.30.\n\n56:47.840 --> 56:49.000\nNo, he stuck around.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:50.120\nCleaning up.\n\n56:50.120 --> 56:50.600\nWhoa.\n\n56:50.600 --> 56:51.800\nHe apparently went to work.\n\n56:51.800 --> 56:52.560\nThat's all right, man.\n\n56:52.560 --> 56:53.000\nThat's all right.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:54.640\nAnd used one of his 9,000 scarves\n\n56:54.640 --> 56:57.000\nto wipe down the fucking kitchen counter.\n\n56:57.000 --> 57:00.960\nAnd while the birthday boy was being bitched out\n\n57:00.960 --> 57:05.400\nby the host and being surly and, you know,\n\n57:05.400 --> 57:07.800\npetulant on the couch, Johnny Depp was up there cleaning up\n\n57:07.800 --> 57:10.440\ncups and fucking wiping down the fucking shit.\n\n57:10.440 --> 57:12.760\nAnd he was being like the mensch of the party.\n\n57:12.760 --> 57:14.960\nAnd he was the good friend who stuck around\n\n57:14.960 --> 57:16.200\nand tried to make it better.\n\n57:16.200 --> 57:18.120\nJohnny Depp had a hefty bag, like red solo cups.\n\n57:18.120 --> 57:18.120\nOh, no.\n\n57:18.120 --> 57:18.600\nIt's cool.\n\n57:18.600 --> 57:19.760\nNo, no, it's all right.\n\n57:19.760 --> 57:21.360\nNo, no, Johnny, you don't have to do it.\n\n57:21.360 --> 57:22.240\nNo, it's all right, man.\n\n57:22.240 --> 57:23.400\nIt's all right.\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:27.920\nOh, man, anything I can do to help, man.\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:29.560\nBut he and Courtney sang a song together.\n\n57:29.560 --> 57:30.640\nAnd I got to say.\n\n57:30.640 --> 57:32.080\nJohnny never sang, but yeah.\n\n57:32.080 --> 57:32.680\nHe played guitar.\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:33.360\nHe played guitar.\n\n57:33.360 --> 57:34.080\nAnd Courtney sang.\n\n57:34.080 --> 57:35.720\nIt was not that good.\n\n57:35.720 --> 57:36.440\nI was disappointed.\n\n57:36.440 --> 57:37.040\nOh, come on.\n\n57:37.040 --> 57:40.160\nIt was like a little impromptu, like, living room set.\n\n57:40.160 --> 57:40.840\nWhat was bad?\n\n57:40.840 --> 57:41.640\nThe song?\n\n57:41.640 --> 57:43.200\nThe music or the lyrics?\n\n57:43.200 --> 57:43.680\nI don't know.\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:45.680\nI just, at some point, the party.\n\n57:45.680 --> 57:48.840\nI want to know who's worse at singing or guitar.\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:49.840\nI don't know.\n\n57:49.840 --> 57:50.480\nCome on.\n\n57:50.480 --> 57:53.440\nSo anyway, I'm fucking Sting.\n\n57:53.440 --> 57:55.480\nAnd I mean fucking him.\n\n57:55.480 --> 57:59.720\nAnd Sting is still coming.\n\n57:59.720 --> 58:05.080\nI made him come for the first time since Quadrophenia.\n\n58:05.080 --> 58:06.600\nIt's a movie.\n\n58:06.600 --> 58:09.760\nYeah, well, so we'll find out what Oprah did.\n\n58:09.760 --> 58:14.640\nAnd I don't think she did something encouraging.\n\n58:14.640 --> 58:16.800\nJoe Perry from Aerosmith is walking around a bunch.\n\n58:16.800 --> 58:18.040\nAnd I was very excited about that.\n\n58:18.040 --> 58:19.960\nI wanted to meet him, but he was too afraid.\n\n58:19.960 --> 58:21.360\nHow thoroughly effective.\n\n58:21.360 --> 58:23.280\nI didn't quite, Cody sent me a link\n\n58:23.280 --> 58:25.720\nso I could try to understand the context.\n\n58:25.720 --> 58:29.120\nBut I was preoccupied, the all black thing.\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:34.960\nWhat was the, that was an Amber Tamblyn spearheaded thing.\n\n58:34.960 --> 58:37.440\nAnd what was the definition of it?\n\n58:37.440 --> 58:41.080\nIt was, if you're a woman and you're going to the Golden\n\n58:41.080 --> 58:42.600\nGlobes, wear all black.\n\n58:42.600 --> 58:43.440\nIs that it?\n\n58:43.440 --> 58:45.720\nIt was, I saw something about this\n\n58:45.720 --> 58:49.480\nthat was about showing solidarity for women in the workplace\n\n58:49.480 --> 58:51.480\nat the Golden Globes by wearing all black.\n\n58:51.480 --> 58:53.560\nBecause I saw, and I did the article,\n\n58:53.560 --> 58:56.960\nI feel embarrassed saying I skimmed to a bram,\n\n58:56.960 --> 58:58.280\nlike I barely read it.\n\n58:58.280 --> 59:00.720\nBut it was because I was preoccupied.\n\n59:00.720 --> 59:05.800\nBut it was brooded in a narrative\n\n59:05.800 --> 59:10.600\nabout the culture of super slim dresses\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:12.280\nand worrying about your weight and all this stuff.\n\n59:12.280 --> 59:15.360\nBut I didn't quite understand, I didn't\n\n59:15.360 --> 59:18.600\nmake the connection from zooming through the thing.\n\n59:18.600 --> 59:23.000\nWhy, if let's wear all black, really just meant let's just\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:26.280\nwear whatever and not worry about jamming ourselves\n\n59:26.280 --> 59:28.960\ninto a sequined tube.\n\n59:28.960 --> 59:31.080\nI have no idea if it had.\n\n59:31.080 --> 59:33.600\nAmber, all it had to do.\n\n59:33.600 --> 59:35.040\nOh, oh, oh, she didn't spearhead it.\n\n59:35.040 --> 59:37.000\nOK, sorry, that was Cody.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.040\nCody, do you know a lot about this?\n\n59:39.040 --> 59:41.360\nCody's so high, I'm fucking mescaline right now.\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:42.760\nShe can't even understand what's going on.\n\n59:42.760 --> 59:45.880\nCody will come up here, she's tripping balls on fucking peyote.\n\n59:45.880 --> 59:48.080\nWe're going to have to Google Oprah and this all black stuff\n\n59:48.080 --> 59:49.520\nand everything after this.\n\n59:49.520 --> 59:50.600\nI'm so jealous, Cody.\n\n59:50.600 --> 59:51.920\nYou look so comfy over there.\n\n59:51.920 --> 59:55.320\nThis article associates the all black wearing thing\n\n59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.280\nwith the time's up movement, which just went public recently.\n\n01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.200\nYeah, so that's like a coalition of women in the industry\n\n01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.120\nthat are coming together.\n\n01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.840\nTime's up is Shannon Doherty.\n\n01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.560\nMe too is Rose McGowan.\n\n01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.360\nAnd I've had it is Alyssa Milano, right?\n\n01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.160\nWhy am I doing that vein of joke?\n\n01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.560\nThat's really going to help my cause.\n\n01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.040\nWell, yeah, because those are the charmed girls and whatever.\n\n01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.960\nMan, I used to have coasters that had charmed stuff on it.\n\n01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.760\nLike it had all the girls and it had charmed\n\n01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:38.280\nand it had like weeknights at 7 PM on WB.\n\n01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.480\nI had all the Burger King collectible Empire Strikes\n\n01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.920\nback glasses when I was a kid.\n\n01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.320\nAnd we had all these awesome in the wrapper Star Wars toys,\n\n01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.320\nlike memorabilia.\n\n01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.640\nAnd then we just gave them all away to garage sale.\n\n01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.680\nDid you say Star Wars wrapper? Hit it.\n\n01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.480\nOh, hang on.\n\n01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.320\nDon't fucking just spring it on me.\n\n01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.280\nWhat you need?\n\n01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.800\nOh, hit it.\n\n01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.480\nJust hit it.\n\n01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.640\nYo.\n\n01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.720\nYo.\n\n01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.400\nOh, shit.\n\n01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.280\nStar Wars wrapper.\n\n01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.000\nYo, have you seen the recent movie?\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.880\nYeah, so good.\n\n01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:26.880\nStar Wars Force, Waking Up Last Saber Jedi.\n\n01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.840\nIt's the fourth in the prequel series, Star Wars.\n\n01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.320\nThis one was directed by the director of Born Identity\n\n01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:48.840\nand written by seven people, Shane Black,\n\n01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.560\nScarlett Johansson.\n\n01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.080\nDid you see it or?\n\n01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.960\nSure, I saw it.\n\n01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.440\nWell, it opens like, well, don't throw me off.\n\n01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.920\nLet me drop my Star Wars synopsis science.\n\n01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.480\nAnd description of the last Star Wars movie.\n\n01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.920\nHere we go by the Star Wars wrapper.\n\n01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.200\nFull synopsis, full synopsis.\n\n01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.080\nI'm about to describe the Star Wars movie I saw.\n\n01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.520\nAnd I've seen them all, I've seen every Star Wars\n\n01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.080\nthat's ever happened from the beginning in 1977.\n\n01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.160\nTake it to the crawl.\n\n01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.360\nThe crawl starts by saying it's a dark time for outer space.\n\n01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.080\nAnd you better believe they make good on that promise.\n\n01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.080\nBuluulu.\n\n01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.040\nAfter some more words in the crawl,\n\n01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.720\nit pans down to something that you never, ever saw,\n\n01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.720\na big, long spaceship and or planet.\n\n01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.600\nThen you go and something lands on it and a robot probes\n\n01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.680\nsome shit and then some other robots start looking at it.\n\n01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.560\nThen something happens and a laser comes out and, oh my god,\n\n01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.440\nAmerica shouts, this is the best or worst Star Wars movie ever.\n\n01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.560\nIt's not unremarkable garbage at all.\n\n01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.560\nIt's not styrofoam.\n\n01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.080\nIt's important in some way.\n\n01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.880\nIt's either the best or the worst.\n\n01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.200\nIt's got to either deny you or quench your thirst\n\n01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.520\nfor a Star Wars movie because God knows\n\n01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.840\nyou can take a franchise and just franchise it.\n\n01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.280\nIt's never, ever going to lose any momentum.\n\n01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.120\nTake it to the spoilers.\n\n01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.600\nJust ask the Muppets.\n\n01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.560\nWell, I'm a Muppet rapper.\n\n01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.920\nOh, I'm a Star Wars rapper.\n\n01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.360\nI'm a Pokemon rapper.\n\n01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.800\nHey, we all work for Time Warner, Disney, and Marvel.\n\n01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.280\nOh, the Star Wars movie happened.\n\n01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.440\nAnd, man, oh, man, you've never seen so many spaceships.\n\n01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.920\nCould you believe that scene where Yoda did more things\n\n01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.400\nthan Yoda should be able to do?\n\n01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.800\nShit.\n\n01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.320\nMay the force be with you.\n\n01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.280\nFishman was a new classic.\n\n01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.640\nI'm glad they invented him.\n\n01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.720\nI hope he doesn't get blasted in the next thing.\n\n01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.600\nBut that after the title sequence,\n\n01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.440\nteaser made me think that maybe he might be evil\n\n01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.840\nor his father might be his mother's sister.\n\n01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.080\nI'm not being sarcastic.\n\n01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.480\nI love rapping about Star Wars.\n\n01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.960\nI'm a Star Wars rapper.\n\n01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.560\nI love this franchise.\n\n01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.600\nI got a lot of faith in it.\n\n01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.520\nPlease keep making these movies.\n\n01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.680\nMake 100 more.\n\n01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.000\nMake 1,000 more.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.240\nMake a million more.\n\n01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.760\nKeep asking me to come to the theater door.\n\n01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.520\nI'm going to camp outside on the sidewalk all night.\n\n01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.640\nI'm going to get into a horrible night\n\n01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.480\nfight with other nerds about whether we\n\n01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.040\nshould wait longer or who cut in line.\n\n01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.880\nAnd meanwhile, the country is crumbling.\n\n01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.960\nWell, I am mumbling about enamel pins with Princess Leia's\n\n01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.800\ngood CG face out of Star Wars.\n\n01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.200\nWhen they're going to fight those Star Wars.\n\n01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.080\nI'm a Star Wars rapper.\n\n01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.040\nYou won the battle, the Star Battle, but not the Star War.\n\n01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.540\nOh.\n\n01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.960\nThank you.\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.960\nThank you.\n\n01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:34.720\nDarth Ga Ga, the newest Sith Lord with a lightsaber\n\n01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.800\nthat has two blades coming out of the handle\n\n01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.280\nand, of course, little tiny lightsaber hand guards\n\n01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.480\ncoming out of the hilt.\n\n01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.440\nWhat could be cooler and smarter and sexier than that?\n\n01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.680\nA lightsaber with fucking little baby lightsabers\n\n01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.640\nthat come out in case someone tries to do that move where\n\n01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.240\nthey slide their lightsaber down yours\n\n01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.720\nand cut your fingers.\n\n01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.520\nYou'd be like, psych.\n\n01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.320\nNo, it's like, yeah, it makes sense.\n\n01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.920\nYou buy a big book of swords, and you get out your sketchbook\n\n01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.840\nand you design new lightsabers, because that's\n\n01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.320\nwhere we needed to innovate.\n\n01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.760\nNothing was really working about the lightsaber.\n\n01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.320\nReally?\n\n01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.240\nI mean, was it a stick with a laser\n\n01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.200\nthat's still coming out of it?\n\n01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.640\nOh, jeez, let's reboot that.\n\n01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.880\nI mean, people are probably sick of that shit.\n\n01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.000\nAnd after all, really, didn't the person\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.520\nthat designed the original lightsaber,\n\n01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.640\nweren't they really working within limitations?\n\n01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.880\nI mean, and weren't they defined by them?\n\n01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.640\nThere was no imagination happening\n\n01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.040\nin the original Star Wars.\n\n01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.720\nIt's not like now that you have computer technology,\n\n01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.080\nyou should just go, OK, that shit is designed,\n\n01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.760\nhow it's designed.\n\n01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.440\nIt happened a long, long time ago\n\n01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.120\nin the fucking galaxy far, far away.\n\n01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.600\nSo why would you upgrade the goddamn fucking?\n\n01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.120\nWhy would you have a lightsaber with two blades?\n\n01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.360\nI want to fart on your shit and eat it.\n\n01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.480\nHave you considered that it's actually extremely badass?\n\n01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320\nTo be fair, you have to have a high IQ\n\n01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.680\nto like the new Star Wars.\n\n01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.240\nBut the technology improved in prequels.\n\n01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240\nWell, it's hard to argue that.\n\n01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240\nWhich means it kind of went back in time\n\n01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.120\ngetting better lightsabers.\n\n01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.720\nIt's extremely badass.\n\n01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.560\nCan you imagine the ultimate insult of you taking a shit\n\n01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.880\nand somebody walking over and farting on your shit?\n\n01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.280\nAnd then eating it.\n\n01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.120\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.800\nIt's me.\n\n01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.160\nIt's me, the Star Trek rapper.\n\n01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.760\nWe should also revisit that franchise a thousand times.\n\n01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.920\nYou know what we should really, generally do\n\n01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:06.200\nis only make things that have already been made.\n\n01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.000\nIt makes sense.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.440\nEverybody knows that.\n\n01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.600\nIt's this new sustainability.\n\n01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.360\nIt's recycling.\n\n01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.520\nDo you think have the Star Wars and Star Trek\n\n01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.200\nrappers ever collaborated together?\n\n01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.800\nWas there ever a song that you got together?\n\n01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.120\nI'm already exhausting myself.\n\n01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.600\nAnd I can already feel like, why am I\n\n01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.800\ntrying to get people to hate me?\n\n01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.560\nYeah.\n\n01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.560\nHey, don't forget me, the Blade Runner rapper.\n\n01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.520\nYo, Blade Runner.\n\n01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.520\nBlade Runner 2049.\n\n01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.440\nYo, yo, a Blade Runner reboot, reboot, reboot, reboot,\n\n01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.920\nreboot, reboot, reboot, Blade Runner.\n\n01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.840\nYo, you are a robot.\n\n01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.720\nAre you a robot?\n\n01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.480\nOr are you a human?\n\n01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.520\nYo, I'm going to haunt you down,\n\n01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.040\nbut I'm wearing ghastly not Harrison Ford.\n\n01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.760\nBut Harrison Ford's still in the movie\n\n01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.040\nbecause he's still alive.\n\n01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.280\nSo put him in the movie.\n\n01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.080\nBut put him in three quarters of the way through\n\n01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.080\nand then make him co-star and put him on the poster.\n\n01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.480\nYo, it's a brilliant movie.\n\n01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.520\nYou're not allowed to hate it.\n\n01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.160\nBecause they used Vangelis in the soundtrack\n\n01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.040\nand made it totally fucking up.\n\n01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.400\nSo it's Citizen Godney fucking Kane.\n\n01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400\nExcept here's the thing.\n\n01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:28.760\nIt's boring.\n\n01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.640\nB to the O to the I and G. I saw Blade Runner.\n\n01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.800\nIt bored me.\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.040\nI'm 45 years old.\n\n01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.240\nI don't give a fuck.\n\n01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.920\nYou can't convince me that I had a good time.\n\n01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.640\nYou can't convince me I'm sneezing.\n\n01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.960\nYou can't convince me I'm laughing.\n\n01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.440\nYou can't convince me it's pleasing.\n\n01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.960\nI'm not entertained.\n\n01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.200\nI didn't like it.\n\n01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.400\nBlade Runner was dumb.\n\n01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.800\nI won't take it away from you.\n\n01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.800\nI won't try to convince you that you didn't like it.\n\n01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.520\nHowever, if you yell at me for not liking it,\n\n01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.720\nI will make fun of you.\n\n01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.360\nAnd I will know that you're 25.\n\n01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.640\nBlade Runner 2049.\n\n01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.880\nVery boring movie.\n\n01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.600\nShouldn't have waited in line.\n\n01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.560\nYou were stupid.\n\n01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.000\nI got a screener.\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nDon't be mad.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.680\nDon't be meaner.\n\n01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.120\nYou suck my dick.\n\n01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.120\nIt fucking, it was boring.\n\n01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.640\nWhy would I care about your hologram girlfriend?\n\n01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.480\nYou didn't hack the circuitry.\n\n01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.920\nShe's not special.\n\n01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.320\nShe's not Johnny Five.\n\n01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.840\nShe's a fucking hologram.\n\n01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.440\nShe's not alive.\n\n01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.600\nSo she gets stepped on at the end.\n\n01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.280\nI don't fucking care.\n\n01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.920\nIt doesn't send me into fucking any kind of arc.\n\n01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.280\nShe never existed.\n\n01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.160\nShe's a fart.\n\n01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.400\nShe's a cloud.\n\n01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.120\nHe's a fucking robot.\n\n01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.320\nNone of it matters.\n\n01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.000\nNothing matters.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.040\nThe whole movie didn't matter.\n\n01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.480\nNothing happened that mattered.\n\n01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.240\nThe movie didn't matter.\n\n01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.240\nBy the way, the one thing that mattered\n\n01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.000\nis the idea that robots were making babies.\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.040\nAnd it was never explained.\n\n01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.600\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.880\nRobot babies?\n\n01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.160\nThe robots are making babies.\n\n01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.600\nAll right.\n\n01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.640\nSo they're not robots, then?\n\n01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.400\nWho cares?\n\n01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.960\nRobots are made of metal and can run through walls.\n\n01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.480\nAnd if you shoot them, they don't fall down as quickly.\n\n01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.320\nThey're like zombies that way.\n\n01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.200\nThat's what makes them cool.\n\n01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.600\nAnd you can tell convicting stories\n\n01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.400\nabout what it's like to be something that's not human,\n\n01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.640\nlike Frankenstein or the original Blade Runner.\n\n01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.400\nBut then if you make a movie based on a movie that you liked,\n\n01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.800\nyou run the risk of making a Xerox of a Xerox\n\n01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.960\nof a phantom of a thought.\n\n01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.000\nAnd you might be just stupid and pretending to be smart.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.600\nBlade Runner sucked.\n\n01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.200\nBlade Runner sucked.\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.200\nGiven a million awards, I don't care.\n\n01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.520\nKick me out of Hollywood.\n\n01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.880\nPut me in prison.\n\n01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.080\nIt fucking sucked.\n\n01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080\nIf I have to pretend Blade Runner was good,\n\n01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.400\nand we're going to keep working here, I will kill myself.\n\n01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400\nSorry.\n\n01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.600\nBlade Runner sucked.\n\n01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600\nYou know what was pretty good?\n\n01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.920\nWhat was good?\n\n01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.040\nEitania was good.\n\n01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.400\nIt was a movie about a figure skater.\n\n01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.600\nSorry.\n\n01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.760\nEitania was pretty fun.\n\n01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.800\nBut you know, that means I'm getting old.\n\n01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.280\nI'm getting old.\n\n01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.360\nBut I don't think 18-year-olds liked Blade Runner 2092\n\n01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360\nor whatever it is.\n\n01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.600\nI think it's people my age that were like,\n\n01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.120\nwell, Blade Runner was awesome.\n\n01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.240\nAnd I understand the emotional concept\n\n01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.440\nthat you were terrified that they were going to fuck up\n\n01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.920\nBlade Runner when they fucked up Robocop,\n\n01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.160\nthe way they fucked up everything,\n\n01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.080\nthat we've gotten so scared that they're going to fuck\n\n01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.520\neverything up that you were relieved that it wasn't fucked up.\n\n01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.240\nBut not fucked up doesn't mean good.\n\n01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:12.120\nAnd you know, if you don't believe that,\n\n01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.320\ncall a Lyft and have your driver be either fucked up\n\n01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.600\nor not fucked up.\n\n01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.400\nAnd do you want to drive you home?\n\n01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.560\nWe had a Lyft with a dog in it the other day.\n\n01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.120\nA little puppy named Phoenix was in the front seat.\n\n01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.720\nAnd she just jumped in the back seat with us\n\n01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.680\nand laid in our laps and wanted tum-tum rubs.\n\n01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.960\nAnd it was the best thing in the world.\n\n01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.080\nThat was the best Lyft ever.\n\n01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.240\nAlthough I couldn't help but think, you know,\n\n01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.560\nwhat if you were allergic and you'd gotten to that Lyft?\n\n01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.160\nYou just, it would be a nightmare.\n\n01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.280\nI walked in, I was already happy because I looked,\n\n01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.800\nPhoenix's little puppy was in the front seat.\n\n01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.160\nI didn't see the dog.\n\n01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.200\nI saw a nice, brand new lint roller in the little mesh,\n\n01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.520\nyou know, seat pouch, you know, thing, seat back thing.\n\n01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.120\nOh, that's nice.\n\n01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.200\nHe has a lint roller.\n\n01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.160\nAnd then you find out why, because it's a little dummy.\n\n01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.600\nHead pops around the corner.\n\n01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.280\nAnd a little dummy in it.\n\n01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.680\nAnd this one's tum-tum rubs.\n\n01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.760\nAw, Phoenix.\n\n01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.840\nPhoenix seemed to be trained, too.\n\n01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.680\nThis seemed to be a thing.\n\n01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.440\nPhoenix knew to wait for the signal\n\n01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.680\nthat the people in the back seat wanted Phoenix in the back seat\n\n01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.080\nand then jumped back there.\n\n01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.000\nAnd then knew when our ride was over\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.680\nand hopped back into the front seat.\n\n01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.760\nKnew it when the car came to a stop and the thing,\n\n01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.240\nlike, you have arrived at your destination.\n\n01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.360\nAnd Phoenix got out of our way so we could, you know,\n\n01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360\nget out and do our thing.\n\n01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.800\nIt was adorable.\n\n01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.240\nHe's got it.\n\n01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.880\nYeah, baby, he's got it.\n\n01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880\nI'm your Phoenix.\n\n01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.560\nUber Phoenix.\n\n01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.680\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.160\nUber Phoenix.\n\n01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:37.920\nWhat time?\n\n01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.360\nI can't.\n\n01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.680\nLet's get some Levy up here.\n\n01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.400\nSteve Levy?\n\n01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:42.760\nOK.\n\n01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.960\nCome join us, Levy.\n\n01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.040\nBut I'm warning you now.\n\n01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.760\nYeah.\n\n01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.920\nHaircut, Levy.\n\n01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.840\nHe's got a haircut, Levy.\n\n01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.840\nWhat's up, Steve?\n\n01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.600\nWere you in Miami?\n\n01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.640\nI went to school there.\n\n01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.040\nYeah.\n\n01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.560\nHow was your holidays?\n\n01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.160\nDid you travel?\n\n01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:04.880\nI think you did, right?\n\n01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.320\nYeah, I went home.\n\n01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.840\nIt was not good.\n\n01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.560\nYou almost died, you said, outside?\n\n01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.320\nI did, yeah.\n\n01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.240\nIt was hard.\n\n01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.760\nIt was a hard week for me.\n\n01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.440\nJust weather-wise or emotionally?\n\n01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.160\nI was freezing.\n\n01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.640\nI mean, I got sick.\n\n01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.160\nSo I was bedridden for like three or four days.\n\n01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.520\nAnd the first morning, I was sick.\n\n01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.160\nI woke up and I couldn't move my arm.\n\n01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.040\nCouldn't move it more than this.\n\n01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.360\nAnd it was really painful.\n\n01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.680\nFor $5 a month, you can subscribe to Hymontown\n\n01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.840\nand see how much his arm could move.\n\n01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.360\nAnd I couldn't sleep because every little movement\n\n01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.200\nhurt my arm.\n\n01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.800\nIt was just so painful.\n\n01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.880\nWhat happened to your arm?\n\n01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.360\nWell, I thought, like, oh, this will get better.\n\n01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.040\nAnd I was just in bed for a couple of days.\n\n01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.040\nI was getting over this cold, whatever it was.\n\n01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.440\nSo you thought maybe you slept on it?\n\n01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:54.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.320\nI thought, like, yeah, a little circulation or something.\n\n01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.480\nAnd then my mom was like, you have to go to the doctor.\n\n01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.800\nAnd we go to this old Jewish doctor.\n\n01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.320\nAnd he's cracking all these jokes.\n\n01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.880\nAnd I was just in a lot of pain.\n\n01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.040\nHe's like, we got to x-ray this thing.\n\n01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.200\nWell, that's not a joke.\n\n01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.360\nThat's the thing doctors say.\n\n01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.480\nNo, yeah.\n\n01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.440\nDid he say we have bad news and we have worse news?\n\n01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.720\nWell, he took the x-ray chart, put it on the light thing,\n\n01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.880\nand circled this thing in my shoulder.\n\n01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.840\nAnd he was just like, sorry.\n\n01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.120\nYou're way too young to be getting this.\n\n01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.920\nIt's ultra rare for anyone your age to really get this.\n\n01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.640\nI don't know what to tell you, but you\n\n01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:40.280\nhave a calcium deposit in your rotator cuff.\n\n01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:40.760\nOh, no.\n\n01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.280\nFor real?\n\n01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.160\nYeah.\n\n01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.560\nAnd it's.\n\n01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.920\nIs this part of the joke?\n\n01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.400\nNo.\n\n01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.960\nOK.\n\n01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.120\nAnd calcium's good for you.\n\n01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.320\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.120\nBut I don't think it's.\n\n01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:52.960\nNot when it deposits.\n\n01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.960\nI don't think it's.\n\n01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:54.460\nYeah.\n\n01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.360\nI don't think it's related.\n\n01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.360\nBut he was just like, essentially, the tissue cells\n\n01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.840\nand the calcium cells are very, very close.\n\n01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.480\nSo your body, when it was making tissue cell,\n\n01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.240\nit ended up being calcium cell, which is essentially bone.\n\n01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:21.040\nIt's like a physical thing that grew in my shoulder.\n\n01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.520\nI mean, all cells are tissue cells.\n\n01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.760\nThere's no actual thing called tissue in your body.\n\n01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.240\nI mean, everything's tissue.\n\n01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.320\nYou know, he was trying to simplify it, I guess.\n\n01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.280\nBut so when I was moving, there was just like this like.\n\n01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.080\nSo now there's bone there interfering\n\n01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.960\nwith the rotation of your shoulder.\n\n01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.840\nWell, how are you moving your arm now?\n\n01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.400\nWell, so what he did was he was like, OK,\n\n01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.040\nthis is going to really suck for you.\n\n01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:45.800\nOh, no.\n\n01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.840\nSo sorry about that.\n\n01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.520\nOh, my god.\n\n01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.560\nLet's pinpoint where your pain is.\n\n01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:49.840\nOh, no.\n\n01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.240\nAnd he was like pushing on certain areas.\n\n01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.200\nHe was like, ah, OK, here's the area.\n\n01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.920\nAnd he takes out this giant needle.\n\n01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.040\nAnd he goes, OK, on the count of three, I guess,\n\n01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.320\nthis is going to be terrible.\n\n01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.560\nOn the count of three, I guess.\n\n01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.280\nSmash it?\n\n01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.560\nAnd what he did was he went like this.\n\n01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.480\nWhat?\n\n01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.160\nWhat does he do?\n\n01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.120\nIs it an ice pick?\n\n01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:12.720\nWhat is he doing?\n\n01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.440\nIt's a needle.\n\n01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.520\nAnd he finds the calcium deposit,\n\n01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.920\nand he just keeps pushing it in and out like this\n\n01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920\nto break it apart.\n\n01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.000\nLike a fucking, like he's mashing potatoes?\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.080\nYeah, and then he's moving it around like this.\n\n01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.240\nHe's scraping it out of your rotator cuff.\n\n01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.080\nThis happened for like a minute and 30 seconds.\n\n01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080\nHe didn't give you anything before he fucking did that.\n\n01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.440\nIt was the weirdest sensation.\n\n01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.440\nDid he give you a belt to bite or something like a stick?\n\n01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.280\nI was biting my lip.\n\n01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.920\nIt actually really hurt.\n\n01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.840\nAnd you could feel like hitting stuff in there.\n\n01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.480\nNo.\n\n01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.280\nAnd he's like, and then he injects.\n\n01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.760\nAre you sure he was a doctor?\n\n01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.240\nAnd he injected cortisone, which is what they give the athletes\n\n01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.160\nwhen they're injured.\n\n01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.800\nAnd he was like, all right, man.\n\n01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.880\nWhen did he give you the cortisone?\n\n01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.440\nLike intermittently while through the stabbing.\n\n01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.800\nIt was a needle full of cortisone that he squirted out\n\n01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.680\nwhile.\n\n01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.120\nYeah, she's a ling.\n\n01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.840\nBut he used it as an ice pick.\n\n01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.080\nYeah, to break apart a crack.\n\n01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.720\nThis sounds like, did he say, hold on,\n\n01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.400\nI got an idea before he started doing this?\n\n01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.240\nOh, he was like, this is what.\n\n01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.800\nThis doesn't sound like a procedure that's legitimate.\n\n01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.240\nI'd like to see his diploma.\n\n01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:14.840\nYeah.\n\n01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.240\nSo anyway, he was like.\n\n01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.200\nJeff, he was Jewish.\n\n01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.760\nHe was like, you would think the worst part is over, right?\n\n01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.680\nAnd I think it is.\n\n01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.920\nBut it's only going to get worse before it gets better.\n\n01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.640\nOh, no.\n\n01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.000\nSo he's like, the next two days are really going to suck me.\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:27.240\nWhat?\n\n01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.040\nFuck.\n\n01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.520\nAnd he's like, you probably won't\n\n01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.840\nbe able to move it as much.\n\n01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.320\nAnd you'll experience a lot more pain.\n\n01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.520\nAnd then hopefully over the next couple of days,\n\n01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.760\nyou'll get some movement back and it'll be less tight.\n\n01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.280\nAnd it's still tight, but.\n\n01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.240\nAnd it doesn't hurt.\n\n01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.840\nAnd not in a millennial way.\n\n01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.760\nIt's not tight like it's like lit.\n\n01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760\nNot like cool.\n\n01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760\nYeah.\n\n01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.760\nSick.\n\n01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.080\nSo then I was bedridden all that day.\n\n01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.960\nAnd then the next day, my mom was like,\n\n01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.400\nwill you come out to dinner with us?\n\n01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.760\nIt's my boyfriend's 60th birthday.\n\n01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.960\nAnd it's the doctor.\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.460\nNo.\n\n01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:02.960\nYeah.\n\n01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.720\nAnd his daughter's going to come.\n\n01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.960\nAnd I was like, it'll be a nice thing.\n\n01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:08.760\nI was like, OK, fine.\n\n01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.960\nSo we go to dinner.\n\n01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.520\nAnd like halfway through the meal,\n\n01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.440\nwe're eating and took a bite of this piece of steak.\n\n01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.400\nAnd it's Saturday night, we're at this popular restaurant.\n\n01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.920\nAnd it's not going down right.\n\n01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.960\nAnd I was like, this is not feeling good.\n\n01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.400\nIt starts to burn a little bit.\n\n01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.880\nSo I drank a bunch of water.\n\n01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.040\nAnd then I couldn't breathe.\n\n01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040\nI couldn't breathe at all.\n\n01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.240\nIt was really bad.\n\n01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.200\nAnd I was like, in my head, everyone's looking at me like,\n\n01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:38.800\nare you OK?\n\n01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.960\nIs it like struggling and making faces?\n\n01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.000\nWhen you're really choking, you can't even make a sound.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.400\nSo people are just looking at you like, what?\n\n01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.480\nAnd they're looking.\n\n01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.560\nAnd I was just like, in my head, I was like, OK,\n\n01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.640\nthere's a 50% chance I could clear this on my own.\n\n01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.320\nAnd I kind of wanted to.\n\n01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.240\nBut it was like, why are you doing this?\n\n01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.400\nJust take the easy way out.\n\n01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.520\nThey're saying, are you OK?\n\n01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.800\nDo the, you're supposed to do this.\n\n01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.840\nAnd I was like, I have to give the universal symbol\n\n01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.400\nfor choking.\n\n01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.120\nDid you do it?\n\n01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.280\nYeah, so I went like this.\n\n01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.200\nAnd then my mom was like, oh my god.\n\n01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.960\nAnd then her boyfriend was just like,\n\n01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.120\ndo you need the Heimlich maneuver?\n\n01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.760\nAnd I was like, yes.\n\n01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.680\nAnd so I had to stand up in the middle of this restaurant.\n\n01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.040\nAll of the air just got sucked out of the restaurant.\n\n01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.440\nEveryone stopped what they were doing.\n\n01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.640\nAll the tables were looking at me.\n\n01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.080\nI was so fucking embarrassed.\n\n01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.320\nAll the waiter was like, oh my god, oh my god.\n\n01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.000\nAnd then my mom's boyfriend gave me\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.080\nthe Heimlich maneuver, which wasn't painful at all.\n\n01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.840\nI thought it would be, maybe it was the adrenaline,\n\n01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.840\nbut for 15 seconds.\n\n01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.480\nAnd then I just started regurgitating all this water\n\n01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.320\nonto my plate on the table, into the middle of the restaurant.\n\n01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.560\nEveryone's looking at me.\n\n01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.760\nI'm just so fucking embarrassed.\n\n01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.680\nPlease tell me it was like an Olive Garden or something.\n\n01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.680\nNo, no, it was like a really nice.\n\n01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.240\nWhat was it?\n\n01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.280\nWhy did we spend this podcast talking\n\n01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.440\nabout my harassment of employees?\n\n01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.840\nThis is the.\n\n01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.640\nI had a, it was a really bad, it was a really bad vacation.\n\n01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.240\nJesus, is that why it took so long for you\n\n01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.720\nto get on fixing my garage?\n\n01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.440\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.120\nGod damn it.\n\n01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.560\nThe joke is I'm a bad boss.\n\n01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.280\nSo then, so then, so then that happens.\n\n01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.920\nAnd the thing is, you were choking on the steak or no?\n\n01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.000\nYeah, it was a piece of steak.\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:21.960\nIt wasn't going down right.\n\n01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.440\nI was like having a hard time breathing.\n\n01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.480\nSo it's not related to the cortisone and the shoulder\n\n01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:25.720\nstep.\n\n01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.920\nNo, this is a separate thing.\n\n01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.960\nYou're choking.\n\n01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.720\nI got sick for four days.\n\n01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.760\nI, well, I, yeah, my arm broke down and then I almost died.\n\n01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.640\nWell, I guess a cortisone could like maybe constrict\n\n01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.080\nyour throat or something.\n\n01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.160\nIt was, it was, it was so weird to not be able to breathe.\n\n01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.960\nLike it, it was like simulated drowning.\n\n01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.200\nLike it's happened.\n\n01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.120\nIt's happened to probably a lot of people in this room.\n\n01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.440\nThere's like a burning here.\n\n01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.960\nAnd then it was like a cool sensation\n\n01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.360\nbecause there was water on top and just like no, just no.\n\n01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.360\nThat moment where you realize it was,\n\n01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.880\nyou can't do anything about it.\n\n01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.400\nThat it's like actually happening.\n\n01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.160\nAnd then the weirdest thing we've talked about it\n\n01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.880\non this podcast is like the strangest thing happens.\n\n01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.680\nThat you, you get ashamed of it.\n\n01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.080\nYou don't want it to be happening.\n\n01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.280\nSo you want to, you, you kind of have an instinct\n\n01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.520\nto like get out of there and go die in an alley.\n\n01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.840\nMost choking victims die in the bathroom alone.\n\n01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.800\nThey get up and go to the ladies room or the men's room\n\n01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.640\nand die.\n\n01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.400\nThat actually almost, I have the perils of like living alone.\n\n01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.760\nI woke up, I was telling Levi outside\n\n01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.520\nbecause he was telling me that he almost died for choking.\n\n01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.760\nA few years ago, I went to a Chinese restaurant\n\n01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.040\nthat I always go to in Chinatown\n\n01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.120\nand ordered the same thing I always do, the duck.\n\n01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:41.480\nAnd it was bad duck, evidently, because I woke up\n\n01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.160\nat like four in the morning with food poisoning\n\n01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.120\nand couldn't stop vomiting, like projectile vomiting\n\n01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:52.320\nto the point where it blocked my nasal cavities.\n\n01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.680\nSo the nasal cavities get blocked with vomit.\n\n01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.640\nAnd then I'm continuing to vomit without being able to stop.\n\n01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.560\nAnd I couldn't take a breath.\n\n01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.360\nAnd I'm thinking the whole time, I'm like,\n\n01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360\nisn't this what they tell you about how you can choke\n\n01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.520\non your own vomit?\n\n01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.640\nIsn't this, this must be what it's like when people die\n\n01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.520\nand how many days is it gonna be before someone finds me?\n\n01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520\nAnd I'm like thinking all of this before finally,\n\n01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.960\nlike something happens and like one nostril\n\n01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.480\ngets just the tiniest bit of air that I'm able to then go,\n\n01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.080\nlike, and I'm still vomiting, but now I've just got\n\n01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.160\nthat little bit of life-saving air.\n\n01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.240\nAnd I'm like looking at my cat, like how many days\n\n01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.200\nwould it have been before you started eating my face?\n\n01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.720\nLike I just don't, it was like, wow, like this close,\n\n01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.680\nlike who would have found me?\n\n01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.240\nHow long before someone would have like suspected something?\n\n01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.880\nLike do cats eat your face when they get hungry?\n\n01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.680\nThe cats start almost immediately.\n\n01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.800\nYou stop moving and they're like,\n\n01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.640\nso you're never gonna feed me.\n\n01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.360\nYeah, food runs out and then they're like, well,\n\n01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.800\nyeah, you look like a big bowl.\n\n01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.480\nDogs take a couple of days because they're like,\n\n01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.160\nI feel like this is a test.\n\n01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.840\nThis is like him, he fucks with me.\n\n01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.480\nBut cats are like, I've been waiting for this.\n\n01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.840\nThe weird thing though is in public,\n\n01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.000\nnot that they can do anything,\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.560\nbut as soon as it's over with,\n\n01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.480\neveryone goes right back to their conversations\n\n01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.280\nand eating like nothing ever happened.\n\n01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:08.600\nBut you know they're not,\n\n01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.960\nthey can't be talking about Game of Thrones.\n\n01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.840\nThey must all be going like, what's up with that dude?\n\n01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.680\nHe choked.\n\n01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.840\nYeah, I know, I saw him.\n\n01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.240\nIt took me like 10 minutes to recover.\n\n01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.960\nI couldn't, I didn't eat the rest of the night\n\n01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.440\nbecause I was like, this is, I can't, I just, I can't do it.\n\n01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.640\nAnd then the next morning I woke up to text from you\n\n01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.320\ngoing, a guy drunk drove through my garage.\n\n01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.560\nI'm like, hello.\n\n01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.960\nWow, Levy.\n\n01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.840\nThat was my break.\n\n01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.600\nAnd I mean, you didn't text back.\n\n01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.800\nI almost died and a guy stabbed me\n\n01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800\nwith an ice pick covered in cortisone.\n\n01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.160\nCan't you deal with it yourself?\n\n01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.720\nRight, cause you know I would have fired you.\n\n01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.880\nOn it.\n\n01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.800\nAnd then I was stood up on New Year's.\n\n01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.760\nThat was fun.\n\n01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.360\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.520\nStood up.\n\n01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.360\nYeah, like we, you know,\n\n01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.600\nI was supposed to hang out with somebody and then.\n\n01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.320\nLike they flaked or are they,\n\n01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.600\nI mean like, were you standing?\n\n01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.640\nLike a hot date, like a New Year's kiss you at midnight?\n\n01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.240\nYeah, maybe, yeah.\n\n01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.080\nMaybe.\n\n01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.480\nAnd she fucking boned out on you?\n\n01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.400\nShe didn't come.\n\n01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.520\nThere was, I don't know.\n\n01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520\nShe didn't show.\n\n01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.880\nNothing happened, yeah.\n\n01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.160\nNothing happened, meaning she didn't show up\n\n01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.000\nor nothing happened?\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:15.840\nYeah, no, no.\n\n01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.680\nNo plans happened.\n\n01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.040\nYou said stood up.\n\n01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.240\nYeah, I mean, like we were like, yeah,\n\n01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.080\nlet's hang out in New Year's.\n\n01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.200\nAnd then, and then we were like, you know,\n\n01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.720\nthis time and then, nope.\n\n01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.480\nThey just didn't show up.\n\n01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.880\nYeah.\n\n01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.720\nLevy.\n\n01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.720\nYou're breaking my heart over here, Steve.\n\n01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.160\nLevy.\n\n01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.200\nWell, it was a hard, it was a hard week.\n\n01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.360\nIt's only up from there?\n\n01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.800\nYeah, I hope so.\n\n01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.640\nThat was on there.\n\n01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.320\nIt was a tough first day back at work too.\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.760\nYou know, lots of stuff going on.\n\n01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.680\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.520\nYeah.\n\n01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.840\nYeah, there's a lot of upheaval.\n\n01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.120\nWhat are we supposed to do to make this right?\n\n01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:51.960\nThere's not.\n\n01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.360\nPlay a little, play a little D&D, I think.\n\n01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.320\nI think we, we forget our work-a-day cares\n\n01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.040\nand get into a realm of fantasy and adventure.\n\n01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.600\nJust one shout out about this, about the set design\n\n01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.600\nand the ongoing technical efforts of our crew.\n\n01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.840\nI don't know, it's beautiful.\n\n01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.680\nIt looks great.\n\n01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.640\nWe had a great Christmas.\n\n01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.680\nI mean, our Christmas episode was like whatever\n\n01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.760\nin terms of content, but the fucking set was like.\n\n01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.600\nThat was amazing.\n\n01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.440\nIt was great.\n\n01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.000\nI was really envious to not be there for that one\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.200\nbecause it looked so like resplendent.\n\n01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.160\nI loved it.\n\n01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.760\nIs this all Chris and Sarah, like who made all this?\n\n01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.600\nAwesome.\n\n01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.200\nOh,

physical\n\n01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:57.880\nand my doctor told me\n\n01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.360\nthat I had to stop masturbating.\n\n01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.200\nWhat?\n\n01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.020\nI said, why?\n\n01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.440\nAnd he goes, because I'm trying to give you a physical.\n\n01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.280\nOh.\n\n01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.840\nThanks,

to the way the show,\n\n01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.720\nlike our voices, like as we talk-\n\n01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.560\nThey light up when the show's going well.\n\n01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.400\nYeah.\n\n01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.720\nThey twinkle.\n\n01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.600\nEach one of those lights is someone on Reddit\n\n01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.680\nmaking a comment, it's either positive or negative.\n\n01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.240\nIt's based on equalizer, I think,\n\n01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.480\nlike as the levels, it like flickers, I don't know.\n\n01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.800\nI might have made that up.\n\n01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.360\nIs this like bone growth in your shoulder\n\n01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.320\ngoing to keep growing?\n\n01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.800\nHe said, it could come back, it may not, who knows.\n\n01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.280\nAnd then I found out this week, my mom was going,\n\n01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:53.280\nmy mom was complaining about my dad's side,\n\n01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.240\nlike the genetics, the genetics are so bad,\n\n01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.680\nyou're going to end up with all these terrible diseases.\n\n01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.080\nYour grandmother's telling me you need to get a colonoscopy\n\n01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080\nand I was like, all right.\n\n01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.120\nWait, your mom said that?\n\n01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:03.960\nYeah.\n\n01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.960\nI thought you said, this is a roller coaster.\n\n01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.080\nYou said, mom, I'm dying.\n\n01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.160\nShe said, you'll be fine.\n\n01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.000\nI know.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:09.840\nAnd then she walked up the drain and then she came back\n\n01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.640\nand she's like, well, okay, a few things.\n\n01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.960\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.200\nShe blames all the bad genetics on my dad's side.\n\n01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.880\nLike I have the psoriasis and whatever,\n\n01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.560\nmy dad died early.\n\n01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.440\nBut she was in the throes of being hot\n\n01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.160\nfor this dude that saved your life.\n\n01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.080\nHer boyfriend, her date saved her son from dying.\n\n01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.520\nAnd that's when she was like driving home and going like,\n\n01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.520\nplus your dad's full of diseases\n\n01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.760\nand his whole side of the family's awful.\n\n01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.840\nCause she was like pumped about this guy.\n\n01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.960\nThese are different times.\n\n01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.840\nThey're having it different times.\n\n01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.920\nAnd then she calls me and she goes,\n\n01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.680\nyeah, my brother gets those all the time.\n\n01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.800\nIt might be genetic.\n\n01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.880\nYou may get more of them in different places in your body.\n\n01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.440\nYeah, cause now you know that you're prone to this, right?\n\n01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.680\nSo is there something that he,\n\n01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.320\ndid you get any advice on how to prevent these?\n\n01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.040\nNo, he said it's impossible.\n\n01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.760\nIt just like will happen.\n\n01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.080\nYou should stop eating calcium.\n\n01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.080\nNow you just have a new thing to fear.\n\n01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.240\nI don't know that it's related.\n\n01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.960\nIt's like, well, it's a calcium deposit.\n\n01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.000\nSo it's kind of related.\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.320\nThey're just growths.\n\n01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.600\nIt's like some people grow skin tags and stuff.\n\n01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.440\nIt's just like a growth.\n\n01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.200\nRight, I was just gonna say, my Polish genes make it so,\n\n01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.000\nwell, I can't, sometimes they fall off.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.960\nI just have erasers that grow on my body.\n\n01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.080\nYeah, skin tags.\n\n01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.920\nMy 100 year old grandma was covered in them.\n\n01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.240\nBut I did, so this guy that's dating your mom\n\n01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.040\nwho saved your life, literally saved your life.\n\n01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:41.880\nYeah, he did, yeah.\n\n01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.840\nOn his birthday.\n\n01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.920\nOn his birthday.\n\n01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.960\nSo let's say things don't work out\n\n01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.400\nbetween him and your mom.\n\n01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.560\nAnd let's say you're at baseball practice\n\n01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.200\nor at Astronomy Club.\n\n01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.120\nAs I usually am.\n\n01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:58.080\nAnd he pulls up in his car and he's like toot toot.\n\n01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.800\nAnd you're like, oh.\n\n01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.120\nAnd he's like, and you're like,\n\n01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.920\nyou look around for your mom\n\n01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.040\nand because you know they broke up,\n\n01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.000\nthen it cuts to you getting in the car because, yeah.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.920\nAnd then he's like, hey, I just wanted to hang out\n\n01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.320\nand how's your mom doing?\n\n01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.320\nAnd you're like, Michael, I don't know.\n\n01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.120\nWell, you know, I don't know if this is appropriate or,\n\n01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.760\nlook, what do you, and he's like,\n\n01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.680\nlisten, would you just put in a good word for me?\n\n01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.360\nYou know, be a good guy.\n\n01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.200\nRight.\n\n01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.080\nTell her I made some mistakes,\n\n01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:33.080\nbut she can record TLCs trading spaces in a schedule\n\n01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.680\nthat if there's too many coal bears,\n\n01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.040\nyou know, it'll balance out.\n\n01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.560\nLike, I'm sorry, that's the fight we got into\n\n01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.000\nwhen we broke up and just tell her\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.800\nwe can share the DVR space.\n\n01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:51.480\nAnd you're like, Michael, look,\n\n01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.400\nmy mom's her own woman, you

01:32:03.080\nLike, you weren't talking about how it's her own life\n\n01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.040\nwhen you were choking on water and steak.\n\n01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.720\nAnd you're gonna be like, yeah, what are you gonna do?\n\n01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.440\nNo, I'll vouch for him.\n\n01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.280\nOh, okay.\n\n01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.840\nNo, yeah, I think he's a good dude.\n\n01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.800\nBut all you have to do is go to your mom and say,\n\n01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.200\nMichael showed up, it was kind of predatory,\n\n01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.800\nand like, he wants me to put in a good word for him.\n\n01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.840\nHe did save my life, so I have to, I'm passing along.\n\n01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.200\nHe's, yeah.\n\n01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.720\nYeah, he's not the guy that would,\n\n01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.000\na kind of guy that would do that, but yeah.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.040\nWhat if you said no and he like stuffed\n\n01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.640\na chunk of steak down your throat?\n\n01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.800\nI was like, I take this back.\n\n01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.120\nYeah.\n\n01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:39.120\nHe does the ninja thing with the string and the poison,\n\n01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.960\nexcept it's a chunk of steak.\n\n01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.800\nLike a troupe here.\n\n01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.640\nDripping down the string.\n\n01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.640\nI brought you into this world\n\n01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.480\nand I can take you back out.\n\n01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.480\nI didn't bring you into this world,\n\n01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.480\nbut I did keep you from leaving this world,\n\n01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.200\nand so I think I might be able to take you out\n\n01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.880\nif I can convince you to be vulnerable\n\n01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880\nwhile you're eating.\n\n01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.680\nOkay, you guys playing?\n\n01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.520\nYeah, well, personally, indeed.\n\n01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.920\nI'm gonna excuse myself from the stage then.\n\n01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.760\nLet's thank Church for coming out.\n\n01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.600\nThank you, Church.\n\n01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.080\nThank you for taking us to you.\n\n01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.080\nChords, Chords.\n\n01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.120\nI call her Chords.\n\n01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.080\nDid we tell the Chords story in the show before, Church?\n\n01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:16.920\nNo.\n\n01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920\nWhere were you in Columbia?\n\n01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.600\nYeah, I was in Columbia.\n\n01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.560\nYeah, she was in a Starbucks in Columbia,\n\n01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.920\nand they asked her what her name was\n\n01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.440\nto write on her coffee cup, and she said Church,\n\n01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.120\nand her cup came back and it was Chords, C-H-O-R-T-S.\n\n01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.040\nSo guess what she is called\n\n01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.960\naround the house all the time now?\n\n01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.800\nChords.\n\n01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.080\nAll right, Suspenser,\n\n01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.040\nit's been a good long time since I've been here,\n\n01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.680\nand we haven't played D&D in a long time.\n\n01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.200\nSo would you catch me up, and the audience up maybe,\n\n01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.160\nand kind of give us a brief recap\n\n01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.400\nof what the hell's going on?\n\n01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.240\nYeah.\n\n01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.360\nDo you want the music or no music?\n\n01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.320\nWhatever you want.\n\n01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.120\nI'm gonna give you some music, man.\n\n01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.440\nSo while this is happening, think about questions\n\n01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.200\nthat might be relevant to getting you guys\n\n01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.280\npersonally back on track with understanding\n\n01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.480\nwhat's going on, as I say these things.\n\n01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.920\nLast time on Harmon Quest,\n\n01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.000\nour heroes had just gotten to Doornester.\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.120\nThey got past the guards after a scuffle\n\n01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.480\nwith undead outside the city.\n\n01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.440\nThe guards were sleepy, it seemed, and they got inside,\n\n01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.040\nand once they were in Doornester,\n\n01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.800\nthey were like, what are we supposed to do\n\n01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.000\nbecause they were on the quest for Patchen's gem?\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.280\nHe's gonna keep shoving that up her ass.\n\n01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.560\nWell, it's not, it's what's happening.\n\n01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:42.320\nWhile in Doornester, they split up to look for clues\n\n01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.120\nand get a lay of the land in the sense of the city.\n\n01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.920\nJeff or Chad and Diarrhea went to the open air black market\n\n01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.480\nwhere they purchased clothes and did aerobics\n\n01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.840\nwith the church of the body temple.\n\n01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.080\nMeanwhile, Carlos went to the church\n\n01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:03.080\nwhere he saw Geffen was making everyone doin' crazy exercises\n\n01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.880\nbecause he said they were all on weed.\n\n01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.000\nAnd then Carlos talked to one of the people\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.120\nfrom the church and realized that this city employs\n\n01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.080\na very conspicuous theater as one of its industries.\n\n01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.160\nAnd was the theater involved in any of the intrigue?\n\n01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.440\nIt might be the case that it was,\n\n01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.440\nbut we'll find out now on Harmontown Time,\n\n01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.120\nthe quest.\n\n01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.440\nNice, all right, so are we all together?\n\n01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.280\nAre we still separated?\n\n01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.800\nMe and Diarrhea, who were together?\n\n01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.960\nYou had just met back up to kind of discuss\n\n01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.560\nsome of your findings, but yeah, you came to the town,\n\n01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.400\nyou came with Patchen's to help with the quest\n\n01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.760\nfor Patchen's gem because he was going to get the gem back\n\n01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.480\nbecause it was important to him.\n\n01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.040\nSo you snuck into the town,\n\n01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.320\nor you got into the town, it wasn't really sneaking.\n\n01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.040\nAnd Patchen's is not with us, right?\n\n01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.560\nPatchen's is kind of with you.\n\n01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.680\nHe's not like at your beck and call.\n\n01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.120\nLike he kind of shows up and leaves and stuff.\n\n01:35:59.120 --> 01:35:59.960\nBut yeah.\n\n01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.920\nBut he knows that we're a fan.\n\n01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.680\nHe knows that we feel the...\n\n01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.520\nRick Elsatran.\n\n01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.160\nHe's anxious and trying to find the gem.\n\n01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.360\nHe understands that you're trying to find the gem.\n\n01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.480\nTo help him find his gem.\n\n01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.320\nYeah, okay, so...\n\n01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.560\nAnd reluctant about it.\n\n01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:14.360\nYeah.\n\n01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.880\nLet's go to this theater.\n\n01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.720\nLet's go to the theater.\n\n01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.240\nNow, when we get there, let Patchen's do all the talking.\n\n01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.080\nOkay.\n\n01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.480\nCan we just watch Spencer play D&D by himself?\n\n01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.960\nI'll be so good.\n\n01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.160\nHey, what's going on?\n\n01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.600\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.440\nDoes that happen?\n\n01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.280\nThat happens.\n\n01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:37.240\nAll right.\n\n01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.120\nYou make your way to the Dornester Theater Company.\n\n01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.200\nIt's one of the biggest buildings in town.\n\n01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.440\nIt's a modern looking building made out of stained planks.\n\n01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.040\nThey're stained almost like a black color.\n\n01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.600\nAnd then the theater itself has a nice sign\n\n01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:54.200\nthat's immaculately and intricately painted\n\n01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.800\nthat says Dornester Theater, now playing.\n\n01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.160\nWhat's playing?\n\n01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.000\nIt has, it looks like it says the sands,\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.760\nbut it looks like a bunch of letters are missing.\n\n01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.600\nSo it probably said something else at one point.\n\n01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.440\nCan we buy tickets to the show?\n\n01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.280\nThe box office isn't open.\n\n01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:14.880\nWhy did we want it?\n\n01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.400\nWhat was the point of going to the theater?\n\n01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.400\nWhen Dan was at the church, he talked to Peach,\n\n01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.760\nwho was one of the people who had been working\n\n01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.120\nat the church and stuff.\n\n01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.240\nAnd he asked if there was any industries.\n\n01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.280\nAnd Peach said that the only industries were farming,\n\n01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.960\nmilling flour, baking bread, and the theater.\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.680\nAnd so...\n\n01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.520\nI try to open the door.\n\n01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.480\nIt's locked.\n\n01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.080\nIt's a heavy double door like an audience facing door.\n\n01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.360\nI try to open the door.\n\n01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.360\nIt's locked.\n\n01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.560\nIt's locked.\n\n01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.200\nCan you pick the lock?\n\n01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.320\nHe's not...\n\n01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.280\nWhat hour of the day is it?\n\n01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.240\nSorry.\n\n01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:56.600\nLet's say it's 1 p.m.\n\n01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.800\nOkay.\n\n01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.080\nAnd I put my ear to the door.\n\n01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.320\nIs there a production going on within?\n\n01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.640\nThere are, you hear voices and you hear the sounds\n\n01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:09.480\nof movement, like, you know, loud steps and stomps.\n\n01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.200\nI knock on the door.\n\n01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.040\nAll right.\n\n01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:12.880\nYou knock on the door.\n\n01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.680\nLike a polite individual.\n\n01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.400\nI do a comedic wince because I had my ear to the door\n\n01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.280\nwhen he knocked on it.\n\n01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.060\nSo there's like a little, there's room for comedy there,\n\n01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.440\nbut it's execution dependent.\n\n01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.840\nYeah.\n\n01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.000\nYou find room for comedy.\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.720\nIt, the door slowly opens.\n\n01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.240\nWell, it doesn't slowly open.\n\n01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.100\nAfter a time, the door opens and there's a big fat guy.\n\n01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.360\nHe's wearing all black and he's wearing black tights\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.980\nand he's kind of like just poking through the door\n\n01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.240\na little bit and he's like, you guys aren't,\n\n01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.200\nyou guys aren't with us.\n\n01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.400\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.680\nYou're not with the theater.\n\n01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.400\nWell, I came to audition.\n\n01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.240\nNo, you didn't.\n\n01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.560\nBut why not?\n\n01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.840\nWe're not having audition.\n\n01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.440\nWe don't just have auditions.\n\n01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.980\nWell, I think I'd be perfect for the sands.\n\n01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.800\nWhat?\n\n01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.860\nIn the new play that I've written,\n\n01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.000\nwhich is guaranteed to double your audience size\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.720\nand the funding for your theater.\n\n01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.000\nIt's about horses.\n\n01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.040\nWell, that all sounds very great.\n\n01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.400\nYou want to talk to Shrove.\n\n01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.480\nHe's kind of the master of the theater.\n\n01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.800\nYeah, let's talk to that guy.\n\n01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.640\nThank you.\n\n01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.460\nHe's not here.\n\n01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.200\nWhere do we find him?\n\n01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.040\nSmall town.\n\n01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.160\nHe's probably around.\n\n01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.960\nHe's usually out and about.\n\n01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.800\nWho knows?\n\n01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.480\nWhat grabs his attention most?\n\n01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.120\nWhat grabs his attention most?\n\n01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:35.480\nI'd say a snappy loot tune.\n\n01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.320\nOh.\n\n01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.160\nSnappy loot tune.\n\n01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.000\nShould we go to the center of town\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.280\nand start doing our song?\n\n01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.080\nJust a couple more questions for fatty tights.\n\n01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.400\nSure.\n\n01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:52.400\nAre you guys doing a performance soon?\n\n01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.760\nYeah, we're kind of behind schedule right now,\n\n01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.400\nbut we're trying to get some of the understudies\n\n01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.920\nup and going with the saints of virtue.\n\n01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.820\nThat's the one we're putting on.\n\n01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:03.960\nWell, we'd love to come see a performance.\n\n01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.800\nYeah.\n\n01:40:04.800 -->

01:40:11.760\nWhat happened to your main cast\n\n01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.520\nthat you need to get the understudies ready?\n\n01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.360\nWhat?\n\n01:40:15.960 -->

cast\n\n01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.240\nthat had created such a demand for understudies?\n\n01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.960\nThe guy who was playing Saint Aurora\n\n01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.360\nand the guys that were playing the cunning nests\n\n01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.520\nand the dashing Fredo both fell absent.\n\n01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.360\nYeah.\n\n01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.560\nBoth, all three of them.\n\n01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560\nThat's a lot of people falling absent.\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.760\nYeah, people come and go and kind of like,\n\n01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.360\nsometimes they go out on little troops\n\n01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.280\nto do traveling shows and stuff,\n\n01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:45.800\nbut it's not normal that a bunch of people\n\n01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.120\ngo missing as a result.\n\n01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.120\nHow many days have they been missing for?\n\n01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.320\nSeven, six or seven?\n\n01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.120\nThere are a lot of banditos in this show you're putting on.\n\n01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:56.960\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.640\nBandito

01:41:22.400\nWhat's the elevator pitch for that when we had been?\n\n01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.280\nNever mind.\n\n01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.360\nThere's elevators.\n\n01:41:24.360 -->

do?\n\n01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.600\nNo, how did they dress again?\n\n01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.040\nOh, how did the Saints of Virtue dress in the play?\n\n01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.360\nThey dress kind of as like Paladins\n\n01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.200\nor royal, royal, churchly knights, huh?\n\n01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.280\nI thought I could do a thing about it.\n\n01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.160\nI pulled diarrhea and Carlos aside,\n\n01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.040\nand I looked at them and I go, are you guys\n\n01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.480\nthinking what I'm thinking?\n\n01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.680\nPizza.\n\n01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.360\nPizza party.\n\n01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.240\nAll right, well, what was your name again?\n\n01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.120\nGretel.\n\n01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:29.960\nGretel.\n\n01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.520\nGretel.\n\n01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.320\nI thought it was Shrove.\n\n01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.200\nNo, that's the master.\n\n01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.280\nShrove's the theater.\n\n01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.640\nWell, we'll tell Shrove you said hi.\n\n01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:36.600\nThank you, Gretel.\n\n01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.840\nI didn't say hi.\n\n01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.520\nDon't tell him that.\n\n01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.600\nWhat was something going down between you and Shrove?\n\n01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.360\nNo.\n\n01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:43.960\nYou just don't say hi to each other?\n\n01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.720\nI just didn't.\n\n01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.720\nI didn't want to.\n\n01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.120\nI mean, we'll say hi to him.\n\n01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.800\nYeah, no, that makes this a lot simpler\n\n01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.000\nif I just choose to do that.\n\n01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.760\nAnd then you know what I'm not going to say to him?\n\n01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.400\nIs that we had to do this negotiation,\n\n01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.520\nbecause he might take offense.\n\n01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520\nYeah, that would be great for me.\n\n01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:57.800\nRope, Shrove.\n\n01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.800\nBreak a leg out there for a Saints of Virtue.\n\n01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.840\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.080\nIt's an expression.\n\n01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.840\nIt means good luck doing your performance.\n\n01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.040\nRight.\n\n01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.560\nGood luck.\n\n01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.600\nOK.\n\n01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.840\nActors are superstitious.\n\n01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.160\nSo if you say break a leg, although some people think\n\n01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.480\nthe etymology is more about just the traditional breaking\n\n01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.000\nof a leg, meaning you bow.\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.120\nRight.\n\n01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.000\nWhat do you guys think we should do?\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.600\nWell, I pitched a pizza party, but let's go find Shrove.\n\n01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.520\nDo we?\n\n01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.280\nI mean.\n\n01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.000\nYeah, let's head into the center of town\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.040\nwhere the action is.\n\n01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.440\nIs there kind of like a main act,\n\n01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.720\nlike active hub in town, Spencer?\n\n01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.160\nThe center of town is kind of the market that you were at.\n\n01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.040\nYou guys want to get on the same page real quick,\n\n01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.480\njust because I think we're thinking at this point.\n\n01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:50.480\nAnd it's a long shot, but that this mysterious theater\n\n01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.800\ntroop, because this town is so not, it's not New York.\n\n01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.680\nI mean, there's not like fucking thieves' guilds\n\n01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.480\neverywhere, that maybe this theater guild, which\n\n01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.720\nis a little active for this small town.\n\n01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.880\nAnd now we're finding out how these actors that have all\n\n01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.520\ndisappeared in the time frame that we got mugged.\n\n01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.120\nCan I go back in my head and imagine, you know,\n\n01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.120\njust because we were in that combat,\n\n01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.400\nlike how many dudes we killed, and does that correspond\n\n01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.800\nwith the number of actors?\n\n01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.240\nThe Bandidos, yeah.\n\n01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.880\nI want to say you killed more than three people,\n\n01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.080\nlike maybe five, or maybe two more.\n\n01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.600\nYou saying that we might have killed the actors?\n\n01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.720\nThat is what he's saying.\n\n01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.560\nI'm a wall, I don't mean to high road you.\n\n01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.760\nI'm just saying, like, this is the thin fucking line.\n\n01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.240\nHigh road, Martin.\n\n01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.600\nThis is the thing we're following.\n\n01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.760\nIt's the lead that we got.\n\n01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.240\nIt's the idea that in this town, when\n\n01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.760\nyou hire people to do crazy shit,\n\n01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.080\nyou hire these actors, that it's like Patrick Swayze's\n\n01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.640\ntroop in point blank, like they're surfers.\n\n01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.080\nYou don't expect them to be bank robbers.\n\n01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:00.580\nYeah.\n\n01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.180\nJeez, all right, well, let's just go find Shrove.\n\n01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.620\nAnd we can crash the thing into the ground,\n\n01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.900\nyou know, this theory.\n\n01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.300\nYeah, no, I'm just going through my notes.\n\n01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.620\nIt's been so long, I'm a little confused.\n\n01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.500\nWell, I'm not to.\n\n01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.980\nI'm going to make you, you take the lead on this one.\n\n01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.300\nWell, let me just verbally, well, we have this chance,\n\n01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.260\nbecause I don't want to do this in front of non-player\n\n01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.900\ncharacters.\n\n01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:26.140\nThis will help all of us.\n\n01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:27.540\nThis is my working theory.\n\n01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:33.100\nBut it's not, I don't believe in it, really, half a wit.\n\n01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:36.940\nThat we were on the road, we were way-laid by bandits,\n\n01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:39.620\nthey fucked us up, they took Patchen's gem,\n\n01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.180\nthen we came to this town.\n\n01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.100\nWe're looking around for people that you might hire to do\n\n01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.180\nsuch tasks, because the only thing we had to go on\n\n01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.300\nwas a letter that we can't really read, because it's\n\n01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.620\nwritten in this kind of guild script.\n\n01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:53.380\nThe guild script just means that they're professionals\n\n01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.780\nthat were hired.\n\n01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:57.540\nThere is no guild in this town, you can't just go to a place\n\n01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.020\nthat says, like, here's the place where people go,\n\n01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.660\nyou hire people that rob people.\n\n01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:03.900\nThere's just people that churn butter, cut hair,\n\n01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:05.340\nand are in this theater troupe.\n\n01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:10.540\nThe theater troupe is the crazy people.\n\n01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:13.060\nYou would expect a theater troupe to be smaller in a town\n\n01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.500\nthis size, it should be like three people doing improv,\n\n01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:18.020\nlike in Green Bay or something, and it'd just be like,\n\n01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.020\nkind of, the two of them would be bowlers, and one of them\n\n01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.420\nwould be the guy that hangs up the fly, and one of them\n\n01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.020\nwould be the guy that hangs up the flyers,\n\n01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.860\nand the other two are tolerating, because they secretly\n\n01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:28.460\nfantasize about kicking them out of the troupe,\n\n01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:30.380\nbut they don't want to do the heavy work.\n\n01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:34.860\nAnd instead, we got, like, whoa, we got a bunch of people\n\n01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:39.900\nentertaining a small town, and so that's it, that's it.\n\n01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:40.860\nThat's all we got.\n\n01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:43.180\nOK, so let's go back and infiltrate this theater company,\n\n01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:43.820\nI think.\n\n01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:46.060\nWe got to find Rob Schrove.\n\n01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:47.620\nSchrove.\n\n01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:52.220\nI'll be the first to admit, I've been fucking this up forever.\n\n01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:54.860\nI've become a bad leader, this is why they had me locked away.\n\n01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.580\nWell, now you're shot at redemption here, why don't you take?\n\n01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.820\nYeah, but this has been my shot at redemption,\n\n01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:01.300\nI've already fucked it up.\n\n01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.820\nI took the lead on this, I'm the reason we're here,\n\n01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:06.180\nI'm the reason we took Patchen's gem quest instead of the one\n\n01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:07.740\nthat was being dangled in front of us,\n\n01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:09.580\nI feel bad about all of this.\n\n01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.300\nIs Patchen's here?\n\n01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.060\nPatchen shows up.\n\n01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:16.460\nPatchen's, I just want to say to you, I'm sorry, you know?\n\n01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.660\nFor what?\n\n01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:23.260\nFor insisting on helping you, when in fact,\n\n01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:26.820\nwe're the reasons why you needed help.\n\n01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.980\nThe last people, you had it right the whole time, man.\n\n01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:32.540\nThanks, man, that means a lot.\n\n01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:36.540\nBut it happens, though.\n\n01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.980\nSo I just wanted to say that clearly,\n\n01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.980\nI don't feel like I've been doing this right.\n\n01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:41.700\nI think you're beating yourself up for no reason,\n\n01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.660\nI think we've all made mistakes, I think it's, you know,\n\n01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:45.900\nwe're just.\n\n01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:47.940\nI got to tell you something, beating myself up\n\n01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.180\nis all I know how to do.\n\n01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.860\nIt's the only thing I know that I'm going to do\n\n01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.620\nthat I can do and finish doing.\n\n01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:54.860\nEverything else, I stop beating myself up,\n\n01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:58.820\nI try something, and I just fuck it up.\n\n01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:01.660\nAnd I'm sorry.\n\n01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:04.820\nAll right, the table talk here, Dan, you've got the fucking,\n\n01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.500\nI've been away for so long, I don't really\n\n01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.060\nremember what the hell's fucking happening.\n\n01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:11.060\nSo you think that the actors might be related to those bandits\n\n01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.100\nthat we got way later?\n\n01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.500\nYeah, I guess, I mean, it's a working theory, but it's like,\n\n01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:18.900\nI say we just like, let's just dive into it,\n\n01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.980\nlet's go find Shrove, throw him up against a wall,\n\n01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:22.940\nsay, what are you doing?\n\n01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.380\nNot literally, I don't mean it that way.\n\n01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:25.460\nYeah, I got you.\n\n01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:25.980\nOK, so.\n\n01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.260\nIs this, is your theater troupe, did you\n\n01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:31.100\nget a bunch of guys that died because we killed them\n\n01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:33.500\non a road?\n\n01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.220\nWe go back into the marketplace.\n\n01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:35.980\nAll right.\n\n01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:41.100\nAnd we, I asked like a local shopkeeper that looks like some\n\n01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:45.140\nof them, you know, knows his or her way around town.\n\n01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.300\nYou talked to the fabricators Guild Gnome\n\n01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:48.460\nthat gave you those clothes.\n\n01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:50.780\nOh, I got flashy clothes now.\n\n01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.860\nAm I wearing those now?\n\n01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:53.660\nYep, they put a pep in your step.\n\n01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.660\nThey did.\n\n01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:57.020\nI said, hey, do you know a cat named Shrove?\n\n01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:01.020\nYeah, Shrove is like, he's a big, big guy around here,\n\n01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:01.980\nlike everyone knows Shrove.\n\n01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:02.900\nHave you seen him around today?\n\n01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:04.380\nWe're trying to track him down.\n\n01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:08.380\nI don't think I've seen him since last evening or so.\n\n01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.900\nI don't know, I haven't seen him today.\n\n01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.620\nDoes he have a local like haunt that he hangs out at?\n\n01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.060\nSometimes he's at the tavern.\n\n01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.100\nI guess most people are sometimes at the tavern.\n\n01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:18.140\nOK, we go to the tavern.\n\n01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.420\nYeah, I mean.\n\n01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.940\nOh, OK, bye.\n\n01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.300\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:24.540\nAnd nice to see you again.\n\n01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:26.300\nWould you like to come with us to the tavern?\n\n01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:27.700\nNo, no.\n\n01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:28.260\nI'm busy.\n\n01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.700\nI didn't mean to be so preemptory.\n\n01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.260\nTo the tavern.\n\n01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.380\nAll right.\n\n01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:36.100\nWhat a tavern is something.\n\n01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:37.460\nThe leaky grieve.\n\n01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:41.300\nAll right, this tavern is labeled the leaky grieve.\n\n01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:47.340\nAs you enter, you instantly feel kind of at ease.\n\n01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.660\nYou don't even necessarily notice.\n\n01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:53.100\nBut as of getting into this town, maybe even earlier,\n\n01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.300\nyou've just had a sense of dread and foreboding and sadness\n\n01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:59.820\nand angst kind of sitting in and settling over your body.\n\n01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.180\nAnd you barely even noticed it until you set into this tavern.\n\n01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:05.980\nAnd it actually feels quote unquote right.\n\n01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:08.020\nAnd it's great.\n\n01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.580\nThere's yelling and singing, and it's raucous and wild.\n\n01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:12.220\nAnd it really has the vibe of what\n\n01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.140\nyou think Dornester seems like it should be.\n\n01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:17.420\nThis town of ruffians that are going hog wild.\n\n01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:18.740\nIt's a tavern.\n\n01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.220\nThey're yelling and singing, and people are throwing shit.\n\n01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:26.100\nYeah, there's a big, big beardy guy\n\n01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.780\nwho looks like he's over 100, even though he's a human,\n\n01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.020\nwhich is weird.\n\n01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.900\nWell, it usually implies some magic.\n\n01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.260\nThere's an old dude, and he's behind the bar,\n\n01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.540\nand he's wiping down the bar.\n\n01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:44.780\nAnd then there's just a bunch of random brigand types.\n\n01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:47.060\nThey just all kind of look dirty and wild,\n\n01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:48.900\nand they're kind of scattered around the bar.\n\n01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:50.860\nMr. Barkeep.\n\n01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.540\nYeah.\n\n01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:52.500\nHey, how's it going?\n\n01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:53.580\nYou guys are new, huh?\n\n01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.660\nYeah.\n\n01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.420\nThe name's Cool Dennis.\n\n01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:59.220\nOh, thanks, Cool Dennis.\n\n01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:00.660\nCool is your first name?\n\n01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:01.740\nNo.\n\n01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.140\nI'm so new, I hardly know the prices here,\n\n01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:08.060\nbut I'd be happy to give you a whole gold piece for a drink\n\n01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:11.740\nand a little bit of information around town.\n\n01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:14.020\nYeah, man, that's why people come around here.\n\n01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.100\nSure.\n\n01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:18.420\nWell, just looking for a fellow named Shrove.\n\n01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.340\nShrove?\n\n01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.900\nI think he's here.\n\n01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.420\nHe's looking around.\n\n01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.820\nMaybe he left.\n\n01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:26.780\nI think he's here.\n\n01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:27.580\nI don't see him.\n\n01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:29.020\nHe's like, he's looking around.\n\n01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.380\nMaybe he's in the bathroom.\n\n01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:31.660\nHe might be in the bathroom.\n\n01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:33.100\nTrying to read your face, Cool Dennis,\n\n01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:39.900\ncan't tell if you're shaking me down for an extra gold piece.\n\n01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:40.620\nHe's not.\n\n01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:41.820\nOK.\n\n01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:42.380\nNever what?\n\n01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.180\nNever mind.\n\n01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.660\nI was thinking out loud.\n\n01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:45.900\nHere's your gold piece.\n\n01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:46.740\nOh, thanks, man.\n\n01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:47.420\nI appreciate it.\n\n01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:48.340\nHere's your beverage.\n\n01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:50.060\nI'll have a dragon's snout.\n\n01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.780\nHere's that beverage.\n\n01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:55.700\nI checked the bathroom.\n\n01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.860\nIt's locked.\n\n01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:57.700\nWhat?\n\n01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:00.140\nI walk up to the old 100-year-old man.\n\n01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.380\nThat's the bartender.\n\n01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.420\nOh, so I just stay right where I was?\n\n01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.100\nYeah.\n\n01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.380\nOK.\n\n01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:08.580\nWas he in the bathroom?\n\n01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:09.220\nThe bathroom's locked.\n\n01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:10.980\nCool Dennis, why is the bathroom locked?\n\n01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.180\nBecause it's like a one-person bathroom.\n\n01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.060\nSo I don't need a key.\n\n01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.140\nIt's just someone's in there?\n\n01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.380\nYeah.\n\n01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.380\nYou think they're pooping?\n\n01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:20.140\nI hate to speculate.\n\n01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:22.180\nI stake out the bathroom.\n\n01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:23.220\nOK.\n\n01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:24.060\nThat's weird.\n\n01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:25.140\nBut yeah.\n\n01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:28.580\nWell, that's not something Cool Dennis would do, but.\n\n01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.460\nCool Dennis, why do they call you Cool?\n\n01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.860\nThat's a great question.\n\n01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:34.980\nI don't really know.\n\n01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:36.300\nYou seem pretty cool.\n\n01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.860\nI guess that's why, huh?\n\n01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.100\nAll right.\n\n01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.340\nI'd like a drink, too.\n\n01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:42.980\nDo you have a specialty cocktail or a special kind of brew\n\n01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.420\nhere?\n\n01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:44.940\nI have a stout dragon.\n\n01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.180\nI'll take a stout dragon.\n\n01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:48.020\nHey, Cool Dennis, are there any rumors\n\n01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:51.020\nin town about ancillary treasures\n\n01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.540\nthat I could hyper-focus on and turn into our new quest\n\n01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.980\nand totally frustrate everybody?\n\n01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.020\nI hear there's a bag of holding full beef jerky in town.\n\n01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:02.420\nWait, how much beef jerky is in the bag of holding?\n\n01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.100\n10 by 10 by 10 feet of beef jerky.\n\n01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:07.500\nThat's a lot of beef jerky.\n\n01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.100\nSo people just hear a bag like that in town?\n\n01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:13.900\nThey don't.\n\n01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:16.620\nI thought that was exactly what you were asking for.\n\n01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.580\nI mean, I guess.\n\n01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.220\nI'm telling you, it is in this town.\n\n01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.540\nI know for a fact.\n\n01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:23.620\nWhat's happening in the bathroom?\n\n01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.580\nBathroom stuff.\n\n01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.620\nYeah, you hear pooping.\n\n01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:27.780\nI hear pooping?\n\n01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.060\nHow about another random one?\n\n01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:31.580\nCan I just refresh?\n\n01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:34.500\nI've been told there's art objects in a locker somewhere.\n\n01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.420\nI want another one.\n\n01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.500\nGive me another one.\n\n01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.580\nSome say the plants outside of Miss Marple's kitchen\n\n01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.180\naid travelers?\n\n01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.980\nOne more, one more.\n\n01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.940\nI want one more of these.\n\n01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.100\nThe rocks on the left side of the tree line outside of the west\n\n01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.660\nare known for their ability to skip\n\n01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:00.940\nbetter than most others.\n\n01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.900\nI kind of want to see what that planned about.\n\n01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.060\nThe Miss Marple one sounds the promising one.\n\n01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:08.740\nI mean, I'd love a bag of holding empty out the beef jerky.\n\n01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:09.660\nNever will we try to make all that.\n\n01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:11.500\nBut knowing a bag of beef jerky's in town\n\n01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.980\ndoes not help you find it.\n\n01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:13.740\nNo.\n\n01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:17.940\nSo we're for, guys, we're on the quest for patches.\n\n01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:18.980\nHey, listen, man.\n\n01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:23.140\nWe didn't get on the patch of the quest for patches\n\n01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:28.420\nhere. Remember when we tried to make our own quest?\n\n01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.260\nYeah, let's think about the time when you guys tried\n\n01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:31.540\nto make your own beef jerky.\n\n01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.060\nWho's the jerky?\n\n01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.820\nSpeaking of beef jerky, I wonder how long\n\n01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:41.660\nthat guy's going to keep pooping in there.\n\n01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:45.940\nYeah, I use perception on the bathroom.\n\n01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.540\nThat's how you heard the pooping sounds.\n\n01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:48.780\nOh, OK.\n\n01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:51.700\nSteve, you get smashed in the face by a bottle.\n\n01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.020\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.060\nWhat the ow?\n\n01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:54.780\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:00.780\nIt only does one damage.\n\n01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.420\nWho did that?\n\n01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.180\nSteve.\n\n01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.100\nI examine my surroundings.\n\n01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.380\nYou see, there's an old dirty hobo.\n\n01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.900\nHe looks even older than Cool Dennis,\n\n01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.660\nalthough he just looks like shit.\n\n01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:18.580\nAnd he's wrapped in a dirty, filthy robe\n\n01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.540\nthat's covered in dried, crusted blood.\n\n01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:23.460\nAnd it seems like it has a bunch of stab wounds on it.\n\n01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:27.300\nOn closer inspection, it seems like the cloak that\n\n01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:30.420\ngot stolen off of what do you call it?\n\n01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.940\nPatchens when he got robbed.\n\n01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:34.780\nWhoa.\n\n01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:35.380\nWait.\n\n01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.460\nI don't know if you remember, but when Patchens got robbed,\n\n01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.460\nthey took all his clothes and left naked.\n\n01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:40.940\nSo this guy's wearing Patchens' cloak?\n\n01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.420\nYeah.\n\n01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:42.340\nOr it appears to be?\n\n01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:45.620\nHey, why did you fucking, what the hell, man?\n\n01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:47.780\nWhy are you listening to people poop, man?\n\n01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.900\nMy name's diarrhea.\n\n01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:50.860\nThat's a great reason.\n\n01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.780\nI don't know who else is listening to people poop, yeah.\n\n01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.860\nWell, now I feel foolish.\n\n01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:01.380\nWhy are you wearing our friend's cloak?\n\n01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.420\nThis is mine, man.\n\n01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:03.380\nThis was given to me.\n\n01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.340\nBy who?\n\n01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.580\nThe guy that's pooping in that there bathroom.\n\n01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:07.940\nWhoa.\n\n01:56:07.940 -->
