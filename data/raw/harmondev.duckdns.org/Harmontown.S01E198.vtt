{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.000\nHello, ladies and gentlemen of Harbor Town! How are you doing?\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:31.000\nI'm Cameron Esmesino. I'm your Comptroller Assistant.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:40.000\nStepping up to official Comptroller for tonight only. Thank you so much for having me.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:51.000\nWe have a great lineup of your favorites. You know them from this show, which they created, including Spencer!\n\n00:51.000 --> 01:01.000\nI asked him what his title is. He said no title. He also asked that I specifically did not use his last name.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:11.000\nHe's this show's Madonna. You're a good girl. And now please rise.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:21.000\nNo, you can stay seated. For your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:32.000\nThank you. Cameron Esmesino.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:44.000\nYep. I'm in a good mood. I poked your belly backstage. I gave you a little Pillsbury poke. Have I ever done that before?\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:52.000\nOh yeah, all the time. The weird thing is you always ask me if you've done it before.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:03.000\nNo, no. It's never happened before. What did you like about it? We've never done it before. It was a spontaneous, magical moment we shared.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:23.000\nNothing normal people do. And my relationship with you is based on something stronger than normality, which is our undiagnosed spectral disorders, like whatever they may be.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:33.000\nBut sometimes it gets lonely. Sometimes you look around and you wonder, should I just die? Am I going to turn into a skeleton?\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nWe talked on Mother's Day about the family and what are our obligations to family?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:44.000\nBoy, I love getting those tweets when you guys want to flaunt your normality.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:53.000\nIt's always good. Just fire off a tweet to a stranger if you listen to their podcast and just tell them how their family works. That's not a stupid thing to do.\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:02.000\nThat's not going to trigger anyone. Your family is probably identical to anyone in the world, right?\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nEspecially if you heard them on a podcast. That seals the deal.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:15.000\nMy family is identical. Hey, Dan, can I just ask you a point of order? Spencer, belly poke, over shirt or undershirt?\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nI pulled my shirt up.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:25.000\nYeah, I wanted to ask. I mean, because honestly, I feel like as a woman in Hollywood, it's really important to be treated the same way as anybody else.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:37.000\nAnd so just if you wouldn't mind.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:50.000\nBut we're not all created equal. It's a thing. It's a belly thing. My finger is bruised on what I assume is a washboard.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:55.000\nOh, yeah, it's a real washboard under there.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nA flat lesbian superhero like trampoline.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nIs that what it looks like on the outside of my clothes when you look at me?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:11.000\nNo, that's what I felt like. I was like, oh, man, you're like a Barbie doll. It's like solid plastic, but not in an artificial sense.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:21.000\nYou're a woman of substance, but your body is obviously lies and she's gay and I'm not married.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:32.000\nThis is making me feel so good. Please don't feel like you have to stop. If I felt great about my body, it wouldn't be a stand up comic.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nIt's obnoxious. Everything I do.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:45.000\nOkay. Well, I just thought it was super normal. Like I didn't even think, oh, this is a weird thing. So maybe we're like becoming even more normal.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:51.000\nThrough each other. Yeah, like we're leveling up.\n\n04:51.000 --> 05:02.000\nThat'd be nice. I think like, okay, I'm just looking for, I don't know what to talk about first. Just give me a second. Don't act like you're not entitled to anything.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:11.000\nYes, you are. $10 worth of. So sorry, I didn't mean to lash out at you. You also drove through heavy traffic. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:23.000\nI'm going to do better than that. I acknowledge my crime. I express remorse and I'll do something to change it. Okay, that was generic, but you get the idea.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:39.000\nWe were walking here out of... Right, all of us. No. Myself, my lover Cody and my squire, Steve Levy, and we walked past.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:48.000\nThere was a guy standing in the doorway and I don't know what the PC... We used to just, like five years ago, we'd just go homeless.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:56.000\nYou know, you go, it's a homeless guy and we kind of all go, yeah, and then we start to think like, well, wait, what if he has a home, but he's just like...\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:07.000\nWhat do you say, dirty? He was a person of dirt. It was a filth American.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:14.000\nI think you should keep going. Just keep grabbing at stars. Yeah, it feels like you're going in the right direction.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:26.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I will definitely hit a perfect sensitive spot. Yeah, that's how sensitive it works. Just throw shit against the wall. That's not how racism starts.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:35.000\nWhat is he? A peanut? A peanut? I mean, I think we should talk about whether or not this person deserved it. You know what I mean? Just get right to that.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:47.000\nI would definitely say no because, you know, I'm a rebel. I think our economic system is flawed. I think I'm overpaid for what I do. I'm sure he's underpaid for lurking in the doorway.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:57.000\nI would give him at least a dollar more an hour to do that than I'm taking away from the job of complaining about networks.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nI like this. This is kind of nice because you're the Bernie M. Hillary.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:09.000\nAre you stuck? Not about people that live on the street but just about every other issue. I agree with you on that.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:14.000\nCan I be Trump? Okay.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:29.000\nI think Trump's success is due to the idea that we can all be Trump. It has so little to do with acquiring anything and so much to do with letting go of so much that has burdened us.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nYeah. I hate stuff.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's like, what if my brain was a rocket in its final stage and all of the thrusters fell away leaving only the lizard cortex?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nJust like, I'm a winner. You're a loser.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:59.000\nJust hit the moon and blow it up and sell the chunks to yourself and then lie about how much you did. That guy's amazing.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:05.000\nWe were walking and we walked past a lurker in the doorway, a skexie.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:21.000\nAnd dark crystal. Look it up. Just as we got, there's a person in the doorway. There's no threat. Nothing's going to happen.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:32.000\nAnd then right as my ear was in his mouth, he made this sound and I wrote it down. I spelled it P-L-O-U-M-P.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:39.000\nHe went right as I went and he scared the shit out of me.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:46.000\nI jumped like a cat seeing a pickle. Look it up, YouTube.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nCats think, have you seen the cat pickle videos?\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nCucumber.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nI don't know anything about these.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nCucumbers, yeah, but I bet a pickle would work for a smaller cat.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nCats think...\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nWhat do they think it is?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:02.000\nCats, that's the theory. I'd like to think we don't know.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nThere's a couple theories.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:10.000\nCats, like there's just a million YouTube montages of people, if you put a cucumber out of the line of sight of a cat,\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:18.000\nwhen the cat sees the cucumber, it freaks the fuck out. It leaps ten feet in the air.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nI guess it thinks it's a snake.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nYeah, I mean I grew up in Chicago, so I understand that reaction to raw vegetables.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:30.000\nHey, oh, a lot of meat in that area, not for me.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nYou're suspicious. You're suspicious of the...\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nSushi regular, what?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:43.000\nSo the guy went plop, and I freaked out, but when I looked at him, he wasn't looking at me.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nAnd as soon as I was marveling at it, once we were a tasteful block away,\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nI'm not going to talk shit about the...\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:55.000\nAs I walk through King's Landing, I'm not going to talk about the lowborn in front of them.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:00.000\nI wait until we're near the Red Keep or whatever it's called.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd then I said, what was that all about?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nThat guy scared the living piss out of me.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nAnd then he wasn't looking at me, so he wasn't doing it for my benefit.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nIt's just kind of weird.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:16.000\nAnd then Steve Levy said, isn't it possible he had schizophrenia?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, great, what the fuck, fuck you.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:26.000\nOkay, great, yeah, so of course it's possible, yes, very likely.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nBut I remember that umbrella, what was his motivation?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nAnd then Cody said, my girlfriend said,\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nI think he might have been signaling the other guy,\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nbecause there was another guy coming up the sidewalk,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nand they did have some kind of rapport.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nI have nowhere to go with the story, but it's just like two...\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:47.000\nThe opposite of schizophrenia, that's like velociraptor signaling.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nThe idea that that's like high-functioning like shit.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd the other theory is that the guy thought I was a dragon,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:58.000\nor I'm not making fun, I am making fun of mental illness.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nI'm generating fun out of it.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:06.000\nI'm not trivializing the pain one endures when one is mentally ill.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nIt's bizarre to move to Los Angeles and see,\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nyou know, because it's beautiful outside, and so you don't have to seek services.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nAgain, I'm from Chicago, so there's a certain...\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nYou could theoretically live...\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nYou could live...\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nI'm from Milwaukee.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nOutdoor for a very long time, and so people don't seek services.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nAlso, LA is really shitty at providing this stuff.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:28.000\nThis is why at Harmontown, we are working hard to turn that around.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nRight, Dan?\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:30.000\nRight, Dan?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nOne of your major...\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:36.000\nCertainly all proceeds from NerdMelt tonight are probably going to the homeless.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nYeah, I'm sure of it.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nI talked to them about that.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nThey said, yes.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nBut it's intense because it's definitely...\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:48.000\nYeah, it sounds like maybe you figured out what had happened there.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nYou know, like, sometimes you see a person on the street,\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nand you want to say to yourself,\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nwhat happened here?\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nBecause I'm not a super amazing person.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nI'm just a regular guy.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI got cool jackets, but I'm just a regular guy.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nHow did I get so lucky to live this life?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:10.000\nAnd then, my motivation to say nonsense words at a loud volume,\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nI'm able to suppress.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nRight.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nAnd so then it's like, well, congratulations to me.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nRight, and then I look, I imagine me,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nI mean, you seem like a more tactful person in general than me.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nObviously.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI'm one step closer to that guy\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nbecause I actually have a reputation for saying things out loud\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nthat you're not supposed to say at the wrong times.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nBut I'm one step... I definitely always go...\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nCan you get that beard going on?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nThere's a lot of stuff.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nI always go like there, but for the grace of God,\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nlike it's just like, it's a drop of this and a pinch of that.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd it's like, and also within the context of our society.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nSo that's even more tragic because it's like,\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nI think about when people have like oppositional defiant disorder,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nit's like, oh geez, what a prick.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nThat guy doesn't know how to work at a Kinkos.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nBut it's like 500 years ago,\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nwhich is no time at all in terms of humanity.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nLike, I'm sure oppositional defiant disorder was like,\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nmade you like the captain of the Kingsmen.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nWorld's best knight.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nYeah, like you were probably,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:12.000\nit was probably like really paid to have like a hugely like dramatic personality.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd now we're just like, I feel bad for anybody who's like,\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nwho's like, yeah, who has no choice but to be like, bluff.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nRight. Their shit doesn't fit into our shit.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nIt might be our shit's the problem.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nAlso, you know what else for folks that might even be here\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nor folks that are able to deal with their stuff through like,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nyou know, maybe medication, other stuff like that.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nCongratulations.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nI'm so happy for you.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nYeah, we never celebrate it.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nSomething has happened.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nWe don't celebrate that enough.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nWe don't talk about people that are functional.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nNext time you walk past a crazy person on the street,\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:51.000\ntake the time to say, yay, I'm sane.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nAnd then say to them, I'm sorry, you're crazy.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt'll make everything better.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:03.000\nOkay, so were you ever in a bar or a restaurant?\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nAnd you got brought like a drink and it looked kind of tasty\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nand you were like kind of surprised.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nAnd then the waiter was like, oh shit, I'm sorry,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nand like took it to a different table.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nYeah, for sure. What'd you get that happened?\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nI was in New York.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nI was with somebody and that happened.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nAnd then we were joking about the fact that,\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nthat actually, what if that was a cool thing\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nthat if you're super rich, like that was a delicacy,\n\n14:31.000 -->

lime,\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nbriefly brought to the wrong table, then taken away.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nRight away, sir.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd every time that's happening to you,\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nthere's just like some cool ass dude\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\nthat's made it to that level and is paying 580 dollars\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nfor their drink.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's not about like, it's just like,\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nthey're convinced that they can just taste a hint\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nof your disappointment.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nThat's the vermouth.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nIf that's a service that should combine that\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nwith somebody making enough eye contact with you\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nthat you think they're saying hi to you,\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nbut then they're saying hi to somebody behind you,\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nthey brought that shit together.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nIf you could bottle that.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nYou get a drink for a second, they wave to you.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nOh my God, who are you?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nI'm trying to place you.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nThanks for getting me at the airport, stranger.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nOh, them.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nHow many times has that happened to you\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nversus how many times have you\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nperceivably accidentally done that to somebody?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nBecause I feel like I've never done that to anybody,\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nbut I'm constantly getting milked.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nThere is another thing that's happening more and more,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nand I don't know how, I mean obviously you're recognizable\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nfrom this, but I will say my face is something\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nthat I sell for my business.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nYou sell your television show, I sell this face.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nShe makes an organic.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nMass to be worn by Kim Basinger\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nand the original Batman, as you know.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nBut my point is,\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nI never saw it.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nFuck you, fuck you, that's very funny.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nNow that cannot be ignored.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nNo, so something I will do very frequently\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nis like somebody looks at me,\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nI kind of assume something is going on.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nThe best example of this, Dan, if I may,\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nis that when we first moved to Los Angeles,\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nwent to the dog park with my wife, Ria, who you know,\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nand I said to Ria,\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nthat woman over there recognizes me.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd then Ria said,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\nno, that is Sarah Paulson.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nYou recognize her.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:47.000\nThat's fantastic.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:52.000\nThat's right, I'm 50 years too young for her anyway.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nNew topic.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nMoving on.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nI think we're doing great.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nWe're killing it.\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nYou're killing it.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nNo, you are.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nI think it's you.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nOh, Dan, I think this is a nice pairing, I feel honored.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nSpencer, you're doing great.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nNo, I think it's her.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:12.000\nI think it's her.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nAll right, so here's a half-baked thought.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nI don't think I've talked about this up here before,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nbut my brain is Swiss cheese,\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nand every day is an adventure.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nSomeone just stopped me.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nReally stopped me.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nI talked about this three weeks ago.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nShould somebody stop you?\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nI don't want to be that guy.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nReally?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:39.000\nI feel like, okay, so, like, ugly people.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:44.000\nNo, this sounds new.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nThis sounds new.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nOh, I should have.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nI had a chance there.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nI should have.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:53.000\nI feel like race in America.\n\n17:53.000 --> 18:01.000\nI feel like, so, ugly people and attractive people should be better friends.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:05.000\nAnd I don't know if they'd outnumber everyone who's neither ugly nor attractive,\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:10.000\nbut I'm curious about that because I know for sure that the clothing industry,\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:19.000\nthe concept of fashion, was neither developed nor is depended upon by the ugly or the attractive.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nBecause as we all know, attractive people can wear anything,\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nand not to cross any boundaries,\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:30.000\nbut what reminded me of this is your wife walked into the green room\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nwearing like a baseball jersey.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nOh, what's amazing.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nShe's wearing a baseball uniform.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nAnd like the socks pulled up to halfway up the calf,\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nand she had a baseball cap on it and stuff.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:45.000\nShe's Rhea Butcher, so it was like, yeah, well, come out and show them.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nIt's great.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nLook at this.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nRhea, pull your shirt down in the back.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nWhat?\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nPull your shirt down in the back.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nThanks.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nAw.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nOkay.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nYou see this?\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nEspecially came from a baseball game.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:03.000\nWell, so, but I thought because I was like, no, I was like,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\noh, it's like Andrew McCarthy wearing bowling shoes in mannequin.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.000\nLike it's like, that could have easily just been a fashion choice.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nBecause an attractive person can wear anything,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:17.000\nand then everyone would just be like, oh, should I be wearing that?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nSo can an ugly person.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nI wear whatever the fuck I want.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:27.000\nAnd everyone's like, okay, well, I'm assuming he got lost somewhere and confused.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:31.000\nBut I have no beef with attractive people, nor they with me.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:36.000\nWe don't have to fight about fashion and rules of clothing and color coordination\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nor shape or anything like that.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:44.000\nIt's these medium people, these people for whom the slightest variation in a shirt or\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:51.000\npant can make all the difference in this war where the middle god,\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nit's a game of yards and inches.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:57.000\nThey're tyranny, we suffer from it, and I have a feeling there's way more ugly\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:01.000\nand attractive people than there are these, who are these mythical fucking\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nshlub nubs?\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:09.000\nThese mug dwarfs, what do they call them in Harry Potterson?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nDon't you feel like there's also, there's a...\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nThese nickel nicks?\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:16.000\nYeah, that's what it is.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nIt's McNuggets.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nYou're thinking of McNuggets.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nBy the way...\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nOh shit, god damn it, not to get off on a tangent.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:32.000\nNo, but like, two nights ago, I was about to go to sleep,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:36.000\nthen the last thought I had before I went to sleep, and I did tweet this,\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nbut this is the first time I've ever said it out loud, besides Seria.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:44.000\nThe last thought I had for, as my eyes were closing, I sat right up in bed and I said,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:52.000\nOh, chicken nuggets are chicken nugget.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:56.000\nDo you know like, nugget texture? Have you ever seen a nugget get made?\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nA chicken nugget is chicken nugget.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:03.000\nThat is the most, that's amazing, that a human brain can come up with that.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:08.000\nAnyway, I don't mean to like, toot my own horn, but Jesus.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nSidebar, but my point is...\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nDude, but like, chicken nuggets are chicken nugget.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nDo you know what I'm saying, McNuggets?\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:22.000\nI got distracted by something. I remembered something tangentially related.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nWas it chicken nuggets or chicken nugget?\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nNo, I just remembered, because you're talking about talking,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:34.000\nI attacked my girlfriend physically in my sleep.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nI'm sorry that happened to her. How'd that happen?\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:49.000\nI was having a dream that, in the dream, a man who looked like my brother,\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:53.000\nbut who was Jeff Davis,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:57.000\nbecause I had the voice of Jeff Davis, but the face of my brother,\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:01.000\nI remember the dreams that they were just antagonizing me,\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:04.000\nand they just kept antagonizing me, and they were like threatening me,\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:08.000\nand they were doing everything they could.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:13.000\nThe dream culminated in me going, that's it, I'm going to solve this problem,\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:20.000\nthe way my archetype, I guess, in their cortex,\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:24.000\nand I woke up to Cody going, baby, baby, whoa!\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nAnd I was like, hitting her face.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nNow luckily there wasn't a one-to-one analog to what I was doing in the dream,\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nin which I was like, he-man.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nI don't know if they chalked that up to just, I'm just not fit,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:42.000\nor I would hope that it's like, no matter how hard you try to kill someone.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nBut she, I just, you were mentioning the...\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nHow did she respond? Is she okay? Does everything all right?\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nIt doesn't even make any sense how she responded.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nShe was like, baby, baby, you're sleeping, wake up!\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nAnd I was like, oh, and then I was like, oh god, oh god!\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nShe's like, it's fine, it's fine.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:02.000\nThat makes, that makes tons of sense, that makes tons of sense.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nI am terrified of everything, I can't watch scary movies,\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:08.000\nI have a lifelong fear of the dark, I sleep with the lights on,\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:12.000\nand like, a lot, as an adult now.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:15.000\nWhen I'm out of town, Rhea is a sleepwalker,\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nand she will wake up in the middle of the night,\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:20.000\nshe'll sit up in bed and go, no! No!\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:23.000\nAlright, let's bring out Rhea Butcher, everybody.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:29.000\nThat's true, though.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nActually, I should have waited until...\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nWell, when I go there...\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:36.000\nIf you sit, then it means that I get to sit, and I'm so fat.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nBut I want to have, I want to have a theory,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nlet's talk about this for one second,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nbut I do want to address what you said,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nbecause you know what I'll stand?\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nHey, this is my thought on this.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:49.000\nI think really attractive, really unattractive,\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:53.000\nI think that's an overlapper, that's a zipper,\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nthat goes up and down.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nOh, you're back to that, because you're fucking ejector seated from that shit.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nI know, but I didn't think about it.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nI was talking about that, and you're like, big nuggets!\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nI was like, fine.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nI mean, I agree that that's also important,\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:07.000\nwhat I said about chicken nuggets or chicken nugget,\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:13.000\nbut I do think that I think human faces have, like,\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nelicited a reaction from us.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:19.000\nThere's a stupid meme that's been everywhere that's like Angelina Jolie\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nand Steve Buscemi at the same age,\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nand it's like, what in the world?\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nThey look exactly the same.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nHave people seen this?\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nNo.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nThey look exactly the same.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nThey have the same face.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nHi, Rhea.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nHi.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nIs it true you're a psychopath in your sleep?\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nYes, 100% true.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nDo you walk?\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nWell, I get up.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nDoes that talk the talk in my sleep?\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nSure, yeah.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:43.000\nI talk a lot in my sleep, and then I also get up,\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:46.000\nand then I sort of do this.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:55.000\nFor non-subscribers, no matter how attractive the person,\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.000\nnot a position you want to find them in.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nYou cannot make sleepwalking look good.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nI don't care how hot you are.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nYou're always going to be like...\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nLike standing over your wife?\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nI did that once.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:15.000\nI started tucking you into bed.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nThe worst.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nPretty bad.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nAnd you're awake and going like,\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nThank you.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nEverything must be tucked.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:32.000\nUntucked things must be tucked or die.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nI'm tucked.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nThank you.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nYour job is done.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nBack to sleepy time.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:43.000\nBut it is like full on screaming.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nThen right back to bed, then our...\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:50.000\nOh, no.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:54.000\nThen we have an en suite bathroom that had a short.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nYeah, that's right.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nAnd en suite is what you just said.\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:00.000\nYeah, that almost drifted away.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nLike I said, when I went to my lober,\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nI was like a straight guilt.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nLike it's lesbian tuck.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nEn suite means like they respect you as an equal.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nFull of dildos.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nThat's what it means.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:18.000\nDildo deodorant, dildo toothbrush.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nIt's when you walk in there and you are en suite.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nThat's why it's called that.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:29.000\nIt's just a bunch of chapstick and Subaru owner's manuals.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:31.000\nYou got it.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nI'm trying to...\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nThat's what I brushed my teeth for.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nJust a Subaru manual.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:39.000\nI'm right up to date on my lesbian cliches.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nI swear I looked it up just decades ago.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nYeah.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nAnyways.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:47.000\nOh, wait.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:50.000\nThat means a bathroom that's connected to your bedroom.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nSo en suite...\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nYou walk through it to get to another room.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nNo, it just means it's connected to your bedroom.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nSo you can see from your bedroom.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nAll right, property brothers, whatever.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nOh, okay.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nThe only reason I use that word is because you can see it from our bed.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nRight.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nAnd for a while, there was a short in our light switch.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nAnd in the middle of the night, it would turn on.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nThe lights would turn on.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nAnd there was no one in there.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:16.000\nSo imagine, like, you wake up, your wife is like,\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nNo!\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nNo!\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:23.000\nGoes back to bed, lights go on.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nPretty terrifying.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nBut not for me.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\nI was asleep the whole time.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:33.000\nThen our little eight-pound dog gets up, starts like...\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nOh, shit.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nYeah.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nDogs know what's up.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nI know!\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:40.000\nDogs can see ghosts, like, for sure.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nFor sure.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nI was...\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nI was a girlfriend in my 20s.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:47.000\nI was visiting my parents, and I was in bed with her.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:52.000\nAnd I thought I was awake, and I thought I rolled over in my wakefulness\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:58.000\nand thought that I recognized that there was a gray alien in bed with me.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nJust mocking me and going like,\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nOoh!\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nAnd I did what you would do.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.000\nI went like,\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:06.000\nAh!\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nAnd, like, pushed the alien away.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nBecause if a gray alien climbs into bed with you\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:15.000\nand pulls the covers over itself and waits for you to roll over...\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\nWaits it out.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nIt's probably...\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nIf you start to push it away, you'll have the element of surprise.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nOh, my God.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nIt's not going to expect you to do that.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nThat weird gray alien is like,\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nOh, no!\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nMy plan!\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nI had no idea he would react like a monkey would.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nOh, push it!\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:32.000\nNo!\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nRetreat!\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nRetreat!\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nCall off the global strike!\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nThey know not to flail!\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nThey push!\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:44.000\nI covered most of my body with the quilt.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:47.000\nThere will have no success in this invasion.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\nSigned Marco Polonio.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nMeet Mopmoop.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nHe's like the...\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nAnyways.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nYeah, I get it.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nAdvanced guy.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nWell, I guess that's the end of the story.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.000\nI'm just like alarmed that I'm capable of...\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:04.000\nLet's face it, violence in my sleep that will affect my lover.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nI was very, very disconcerting to me.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nI also recently woke up, because I haven't been walking around,\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nbut I have been waking myself up.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nUsually, like, I'll fall asleep at 11,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nand then I wake up an hour later and I go,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nEvery night.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:19.000\nSo, I sleep well, is what I'm saying.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nAnd the other night, I fell asleep,\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nand then an hour later, I had a dream wherein I was being shot.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nLike, point blank, like this close.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nSomebody had a gun.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nShot.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nAnd shot me in the gut, and I went,\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nAnd I can't even make the noise again,\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:37.000\nbecause I actually made the noise that I would make if I was shot.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nAnd it was, because I woke up and was like,\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nOh my God.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nThat's what it'd be like to be shot.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nAnd that's the sound I'm gonna make?\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:49.000\nDammit.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:53.000\nI didn't think I could fear getting shot more than...\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nNow when the bullet's coming, I'm gonna be like,\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:58.000\nThis isn't gonna end well.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nLook at how tough I am.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nI thought maybe I would be one of those people\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nthat just stands there with a blank face\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nwhile their guts, like, spring it on behind them.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.000\nBecause maybe the one thing you can count on me to do\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:13.000\nis just be so lazy and unalert that I get shot\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nand I look like John Wayne.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nBecause I'm like, I didn't know what...\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:21.000\nI talk in my sleep, apparently, like, constantly.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nCody is charmed by it and records it.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nHere's some more things about Cody.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nAgain, apparently, if you hit her in the face\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nwhile she's sleeping,\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nshe will wake up, say,\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nStop hitting me, you're asleep.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nAnd then when you are mortified, she'll go,\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nIt's okay, and go to sleep.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nWhereas I, for instance, I had a girlfriend once\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nwho apparently had a...\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nI awoke to a girlfriend\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nsmashing me in the face with her open palm\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:48.000\nbecause she was dreaming that I had a centipede on my face.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nOh, Chris.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nHow her augmented dream reality\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nincluded the real topography of my real face.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nAnd she was like,\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nI mean, what am I talking about?\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nWho am I to talk?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nWhy was I in bed with an alien\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nat my parents' house in Florida?\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:06.000\nBut I don't remember being magnanimous.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:09.000\nIt's not like I believe I looked at it\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nas an opportunity to be outraged,\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:14.000\nwaking up to being smashed in the face.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nIt never occurred to me that it was an opportunity\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:21.000\nto be forgiving or cool at all.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nI was more like shopping spree.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nI get to be like,\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nWhat the fuck, man?\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nNo, it's just, yeah, fucking, what the fuck, man?\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:33.000\nIt's just like, you go to bed with someone\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:36.000\nand you know, it's like a social contract.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nTake it fucking with you.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.000\nI give you my heart.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nA centipede dream?\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:46.000\nThat's what you think of me?\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nI don't know if I did all of that,\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nbut I feel like that's what I did.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nYou got some of that in?\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nThat's nice.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:55.000\nSo I'm with a girlfriend who...\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:58.000\nIt's like, there's a...\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:01.000\nI'm not going to spiral into self-deprecation,\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nbut she's a better person than me\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nand I don't deserve her.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:08.000\nAnd she has recordings of me.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:11.000\nOh, she's also charmed by my gibberish sleep talk.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nBecause I just say,\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nI don't even use parts of speech,\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nI just say, it's hard to do an impression of it.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nLike speaking in tongues?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nLike octopus rainbow.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nThere's no verbs or nouns.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nI'm going to go, take it to the thing,\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nand then we go, and then we say,\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nwell, that's what I usually say,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:33.000\nwhich is just like music to all of your ears, I'm sure.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:36.000\nYeah, but for real, none of that comes out of your mouth.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nDo you know that?\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nI know, you don't really say that shit.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nThen what do I say?\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nNo!\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nOkay.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nNo, no, no!\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nI used to say more than,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nI used to say more than no because I was a child\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nand I didn't understand the world yet.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nNow I'm an adult and I'm just like, no!\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nThat explains something.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nHalfway to death right now, no!\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nHey, Cody, if you're listening,\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nit won't pay off so you don't have to do this,\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:11.000\nbut if you have the audio file,\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:14.000\nthe video file that you took of me talking to my sleep\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nin Palm Springs and you texted to me,\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nI'll be able to access it fast.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nWow, if you've just tuned in, this is...\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nIt's a great show.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\n...Harmontown, behind the scenes.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nOkay, all right, well, I'll give you guys a choice\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nof what we talk about next.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nYeah.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.000\nOkay, we talked about plump.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nWe talked about the ordering the drink thing.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nI thought, I really shined there.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nThat really landed.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nIt's like, did I make a mistake giving up stand-up?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nThat was great.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:46.000\nWe can talk about Beyoncé, Kanye...\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nOh, oh my, wait, what?\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nBig otters.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nI think we got a full stop on Beyoncé.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nI just mean, you know, we can also...\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nOh, did you say otters?\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nBut we can do both, we can get to it,\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nbut Beyoncé is a bigger otter.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:03.000\nAnd we can talk about Beyoncé and otters so much.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nI got so much to say about those two topics.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:10.000\nBut yo, best way to see Beyoncé,\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:13.000\nsurrounded by otters for real.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nWait, when you watch this, what is this lemonade?\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nIs that her...\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:22.000\nI have a lot of 43-year-old questions about what's happening.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nWhat is this, lemonade?\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:24.000\nDoes she like to drink it?\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.000\nI don't understand.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:34.000\nSo she's struggling with the feelings of the adultery concept.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:37.000\nBut the crazy thing is that it's through his label.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nBut is he producing it?\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nIs he like behind a board when she's like producing those songs\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.000\nand going like, okay, baby, let's take that again.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nWhen you hit the phrase, like,\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nI can smell her perfume on your dick.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:54.000\nLike, just really lean into it.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nLike, remember how much it hurts.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nYeah.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:00.000\nBecause I don't want another shitty album out of you.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:06.000\nWhen you say, boy, bye, I want you to also be dividing our bank accounts.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:07.000\nYou know what?\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nI don't care.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nThat's what I've decided about that question.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nI'm going to tell you why.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI don't actually think he was the producer on those tracks\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nbecause I read all the track listings\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:18.000\nand Carter was not one of the names on it.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nKnowles, however, was a name.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nEvery single song on Lemonade.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:27.000\nBy the way, every single song.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:30.000\nYeah. Well, because what I was going to say is,\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI think, you know what?\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nIt doesn't matter to me whether or not it's real\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nor whether or not it happened\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nor whether or not it's him\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nor whether or not she wrote those songs.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nThere was like a huge, when Lemonade first came out,\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\neverybody was like, yay!\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:48.000\nAnd then there was weird, sad white guy backlash\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nwhere sad white guys go like,\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:54.000\nwell, for a minute we talked about another thing.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nRight.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nYay!\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nAnd then there was a lot of like, she didn't,\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nand what I, it's amazing,\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:04.000\nwe went to see her at the Rose Bowl two weekends ago.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nWait, so there's a sort of,\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nthat seems like just sort of general internet erosion,\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:12.000\nlike yeah, and I'll definitely, as a spokesman\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nfor fat white straight guys that are outside,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:19.000\nI'll speak, I bet we're very represented in that swarm\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:23.000\nof people that are like, oh, this thing that was amazing\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nreally just grabbed us and we all,\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.000\nand then there's a sort of like weird erosion,\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:31.000\nso I'm just, I'm curious about the specifics of that,\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nlike people are going like,\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.000\nshe doesn't really believe in this?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nIs that like just sort of questioning the magic of it?\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nWell, like that, and also like, did it happen?\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nWhen? How much was it?\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nWhere were the hotels?\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nI want to see the semen!\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nYou know, like everybody gets like...\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nBut she's not singing about that,\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:53.000\nnow I'm Beyonce-splaining to...\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nI'm dance-splaining to Beyonce,\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:59.000\nbut I mean, I'm assuming she's not singing about a Colombo plot,\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:02.000\nshe's not going like, here's my evidence...\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nShe's talking about her, that's all she's saying,\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nshe's talking about what's going on for her.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nThat's what I heard, the five minutes I heard of it,\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nwhile my girlfriend was watching on her phone,\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:14.000\nI heard, it was like, oh, she's coping with the feelings,\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nlike which are largely,\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\nand especially doesn't matter whether they're true or not.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:22.000\nYeah, because it's like empowerment songs,\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nand so in order to make empowerment songs,\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:25.000\nyou have to be wronged,\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:28.000\nand so like, she's setting up the idea that she was wronged.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nAlso, she's a black woman, so like,\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nstraight up she's been wronged.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:36.000\nFor real, like there's been some times where she has been wronged.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:39.000\nI don't know if you guys know anything about black people.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nAnd women.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nAnd a black woman.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nJust speaking as a white woman,\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\njust trying to tell you guys what it's like to be a black woman.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:53.000\nBecause I may be a lesbian, but I'm still white.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nRight.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nAnd there's certain duties that are coming upon me.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nJust when you thought I had perspective,\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:05.000\ndamn this lack of love melanin.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:10.000\nYeah, okay, so that was us talking about Beyonce.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nNow I'd like to talk about Kanye.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nOh great, let's hear it.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:17.000\nOkay, so stop booking him on your talk shows\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\njust so he can talk crazy,\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nand then marveling at him talking crazy.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nI've been over this.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nHe has seven number one albums.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nWe've given him permission to be crazy.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.000\nYou know he's crazy.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nIt's like if you invite Gary Busey on your thing.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nExcept it's better,\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nbecause Gary Busey doesn't have seven number one albums.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:36.000\nAnd it's like, I honestly, I can't,\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:41.000\nI don't like, I'm in this guy's corner\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nno matter what he does until he hits somebody.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:47.000\nHe hasn't pooped or peed or hit anybody.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:51.000\nAll he does is, I read the transcripts.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:54.000\nHe was on Ellen, and he kept talking,\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nand boy, he was crazy.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nI was like, well, what did you say?\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nWhat did you tell you?\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nWell, Kanye's going to come out,\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nand so let's put him in our sane segment.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:07.000\nAnd so he'll just give us the weather, right?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.000\nAnd he'll be totally accurate,\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nand we won't have to check that.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nHe's like parading him out,\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nand then asking him anything.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nKanye, toast.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:17.000\nToast makes me think of Picasso.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:18.000\nPicasso makes me think of me.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:19.000\nMe as a genius.\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:20.000\nEinstein as a genius,\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:21.000\nbut nobody can feel this.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:22.000\nI can't feel this.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.000\nWhen I wore a shirt to jacket,\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nI went to school,\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.000\nand I was like,\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:26.000\nthat's all about what you do.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:27.000\nIt's about the rhymes you put on your pants,\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nand then you put on your shoes.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:29.000\nStephen Hawking can do it.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:30.000\nI can do it.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:31.000\nVan Gogh can do it.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:32.000\nWho are these people?\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.000\nThey're dead now.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nThat's why I feel that Black Lives Matter\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nor whatever, he's like,\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nand everyone's like,\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\noh, he ranted, or he's crazy.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nI just wanted to say.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:44.000\nIsn't it also amazing?\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\nHe needs my support,\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nand I'm on his team.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nHey.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nI can't get through\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\na single one of his number one albums,\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:51.000\nbut I love his personality.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nThanks for that.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nIsn't it interesting that he and Beyoncé\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:55.000\nare having this moment at the same time?\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:56.000\nThey're having parallel moments,\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nbut I think she is very indicative\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nof the female experience in 2016.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:01.000\nI think he's a little bit indicative\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:02.000\nof the male experience,\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:05.000\nbecause the most interesting thing\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:06.000\nhe can do right now\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nis completely melt down.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:09.000\nHe's had so much power,\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nand he's like, oh, it's too much.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:12.000\nAnd I am crushed.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.000\nAnd then Beyoncé's like,\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:14.000\nyou want to see crushed?\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:15.000\nLook at these thighs.\n\n40:15.000

happy about it.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nAll right.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nPeak TV, Cookie Tapper 2, Simon\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:04.000\nand Garfunkel, Big Otters.\n\n43:04.000 -->

Cullen.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:16.000\nNo, you sit there.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nThere he is.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:22.000\nOh, bullet.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nYour name stuck in my throat.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nI thought for a second there in\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nmy drunkenness, I was like,\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:29.000\nCullen, there's an S, right?\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nS, yeah.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nBut you didn't call me Keith, so\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nwe're okay.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:34.000\nWho decides that?\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nDo you think last names at a\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\ncertain point were all singular?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nAnd then, and then ours was.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:40.000\nIt was just a couple of generations\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:43.000\nago that we added the S.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nSo your theory is one for one as\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nfar as I've ruined the show.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nSo sorry also about all those\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:50.000\nvampire books.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:51.000\nI'm sure that was rough for a\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:52.000\nwhile.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:53.000\nIt was hard.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nSorry, guys.\n\n43:55.000 --> 44:00.000\nDo not follow vampire books.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:03.000\nThey're vampires?\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nEdward Cullen.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nWell, it's Cullen, singular.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:07.000\nYeah.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:08.000\nBecause he's from a while ago.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:09.000\nHe's a vampire.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:10.000\nHe's been around for like a long\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:11.000\ntime.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:14.000\nThey immigrated a long time ago.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:15.000\nAll right, here's our segment\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nwhere we talk about otters.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nOh, shit.\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nSo there's these otters in

44:26.000\nWell, we got your phone.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nIt's huge.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nJust pass it around.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nJust pass it around.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:33.000\nDon't old shame me.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nThere's these otters, I think,\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nin the Amazon, right?\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nAmazon, yeah.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nAmazonian river otters.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:42.000\nAmazon prime otters.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nNo millennial.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:47.000\nIt's a river.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:53.000\nNot of savings.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.000\nWhen's the last time you've seen\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nthe sun?\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nShe has dirt from a baseball diamond\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\non her.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nThese otters, they're called\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nthem river wolves.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nThat's right.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nTerrifying.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nBut really, that's kind of, I\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nshouldn't have said that because\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nit's more interesting to think\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nthat, okay, there's these otters,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.000\nbut they hunt caiman.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nYou know what caiman are?\n\n45:07.000 -->

don't know.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:16.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:18.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nI just thought you forgot how to\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\ntalk about the guys with the very\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:25.000\nlong brow.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.000\nThey left a while ago.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nNo, those are cavemen.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:28.000\nCavemen.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nCavemen.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nYeah.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nNo.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:32.000\nYeah.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:33.000\nJust like these are,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nlike, like, don't make the\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nmistake of thinking of caiman as\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\na baby tiny alligator.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nThey come as big as alligators.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nYeah, almost.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:40.000\nNo.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:41.000\nBig enough to be scary.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nThey're like five feet, right?\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nThat's what five feet.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:44.000\nAre you?\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nYeah.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nLike, if you see that in front\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:47.000\nof you, you're not going to be\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:48.000\nlike, oh, that's just five feet\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:49.000\nof a gator.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nYeah.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nI'm not gonna attack it.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nNo, I'd probably start biting at it.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nLike an otter.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nRight, yeah.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nThese otters, they travel in packs,\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nand they, uh, cause they're not rodents.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nNo, they're not.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nHow do you know so much about otters?\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nWell, we were talking about them today.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nWearing them physically.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nDid you tell me that locusts are just grasshoppers,\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nor is that someone else?\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nGod, no, I would never make that mistake.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nNo.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nI'm no weak theologist, but everybody else has.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nCome on.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nYou're not a fish scientist?\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nCause I'm not that either.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nSo, but there's a video,\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nyou could just watch like five otters\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\neat a caiman.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nThey hunt alligator.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nAnd there's otters that hunt alligator.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nThat's it, that's all.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nI just imagine them with like headbands on,\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nand like little like archery,\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nlike a bow and arrow,\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nthat they made out of like a pencil or something.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nWell, Brian Jakes has taught us that\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\notters use slings.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nWell, someone will get that.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nI don't know if they're here,\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nbut someone will get that.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nI think Rhea did make a great point of order, though,\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nbefore we move on to the next topic,\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nwhich is that otters have tiny hands.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nWe swam with otters a couple of years ago\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nin San Diego, and it's weird,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\ncause they're little, but they've got full hands.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nImagine a full hand.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nImagine a dog walking up to you,\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nand then that dog goes like,\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nhahahaha.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nYeah.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nFull hand.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nWith little nails,\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nand when they want it, they're like,\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\noh, they're gonna maybe swim inside your bathing suit.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nIt's adorable, but then they have little hands.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nOh my god, otter got hands.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nLike they can go like this,\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nand they can go like that.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nIt's opposable.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nYeah, and I mean, honestly, as a woman,\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nhands in the bathing suit,\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nno problem that, like,\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nI'm sorry, back up and\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nwhat?\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nOnly because\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nI'm getting so much pleasure,\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nbecause usually I am the person who's awkwardly\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nsaying half the thought out things\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nabout lesbians.\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nI was making a hands or dicks joke,\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nbut I didn't get there.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nhahahaha.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nI always thought,\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nif I was gonna be an animal, I'd be an otter.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nLike that would be like,\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nbecause they swim, and when I seen them\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nin Wisconsin, they float\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\non their back, and their bellies stick out\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nof the water, and they eat, like,\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nseafood off of their belly.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nYeah, they just get a nice surf and turf,\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nand they're just like,\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nand it just seems like, it seems like\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nthe life, like when I get in a pool,\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nthat's what I end up doing.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nI'm not one of these people that plays,\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nlet's splash each other,\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nor you get on my shoulders,\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nor let's bash our heads on concrete,\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nor let's bounce up and down\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nin a slippery fucking spring-loaded\n\n48:40.000 -->

accurate landscape\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nI know\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000\n10 minutes worth of information\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nabout every single

that's all we talk\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nabout and all we're fascinated with\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nand then I have these slivers of things\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nthat I kind of just pick up culturally\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nfrom my friends and I don't know\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nplease don't make the mistake of thinking that

no\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nreason for me to lie about it\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nwell I'm going to\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nI think it's going to be a choice between the

01:20:04.000\nI'm not going to enact some weird rebellion\n\n01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nalthough I don't think anyone's a bad person for doing that\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000\njust to weave in our lesson\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000\ncertainty is the enemy\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nI think one of the big problems\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nwith our system\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000\nI think the reason it's become the way it is\n\n01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nwe're so successful\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nas a nation that\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000\nvoting is just sort of like this\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000\ngravy it's not like it doesn't\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nas much as we feel it's important\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nlike it's not the same as in a third world\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000\ncountry where it's like one guy\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nworks for Nike and the other guy\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nwho grew up down the street from me\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nand he got us fascinated\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nNike it is\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nthe election is never\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nthe stakes aren't that high in an empire\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nwhere it's just and so we've\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nsophisticated the process\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nand it's gotten to the point where\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nwe spend two years before the elections\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000\ntreating the elections\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nlike a reality show including\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000\neveryone talking about who you're going to vote for\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nwho you're going to vote for\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nand a lot like praying\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nit kind of removes the\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nimportant part of what voting\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nis when you're kind of doing it\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000\npublicly and thinking about

turn\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000\ninto two giant fucking blobs\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nshouting at each other\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nand the real victims are the people who would\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000\notherwise just go that's cool\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nbut I\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nlike I feel this way\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nand like for those people\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nI feel the political tragedy in the United States\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nis that those people are told

01:22:04.000\nand I also like her\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nbut I also feel that it is very offensive\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nwhen people say that you cannot vote for

01:44:10.000\nthat really need a focused way of spending\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\ntheir energy for me it feels very\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000\ncomfortable to be behind a microphone because it\n\n01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nfeels very controlled I have a problem with\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000\nlack of control and so I've just gone to\n\n01:44:18.000 -->

01:44:36.000\nmuch more complete I mean if you're\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000\nabout to tell us you went from vanilla to\n\n01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nrocky road no we're gonna be like so what\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000\nI went from research scientist at a\n\n01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000\nlaboratory to the public\n\n01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000\nface of a museum\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000\nI'll stop\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nbeating that joke\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000\nlet me elaborate so\n\n01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000\nI went from from like\n\n01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nwe called Ben Tratt I mean someone who\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000\njust literally spent all their time at the\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000\nresearch in research center working on\n\n01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000\nthings I couldn't tell anybody about I did\n\n01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000\nthat for like 16 years to being the\n\n01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nthe research scientist\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000\npresenting the face of\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000\nof a museum I have to\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000\nlecture I have to travel around the country\n\n01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nI have to do all this\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000\ndo blogs I have to do videos\n\n01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nand stuff\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nI'm an introvert I've always thought of myself\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nas an introvert but I've what I've discovered is I\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nalso really like to be a teacher\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nnot because I like being in front of people\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nnot because I really like lecturing\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000\nbut because I like\n\n01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nteaching people I like\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nwatching the lights turn on and people's\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000\neyes when they\n\n01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nthat's my nectar right I mean that's the\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nthing that actually makes it worthwhile\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000\nbut after giving a lecture some place\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nI will go back to my hotel room and I will\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000\ncurl up and I will cry\n\n01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nbecause it was such\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000\na beastly experience for me\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nto do it\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nbut in the end it was so important\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000\nfor the people that I did it for\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000\nbut Spencer talks\n\n01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000\nabout like before\n\n01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nperforming I cry a lot\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000\nand you say you\n\n01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nshut up about it\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000\nbefore you have to perform\n\n01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nI get sick to my stomach\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000\ngreat when you cry though\n\n01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nbut it's worth it\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nbut if you do something and you know you nailed it\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000\nwhy would you curl up and cry\n\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nit's this weird dynamic\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nit permeates a lot of the stuff we were talking about today\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nthis idea of\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nwhat really motivates you\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000\nyou're motivated by the positive\n\n01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000\nthat you're doing something good in the world\n\n01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000\nbut you're also doing something\n\n01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nto cover up some personal pain\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nwhether it's shame\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nor whether it's guilt\n\n01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000\nor whether it's something in your past\n\n01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nthat you're always trying to do\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000\nwhat's motivating you\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000\nat a number of different levels\n\n01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nand for me it's shame\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000\nI remember being a child and never being able\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000\nto perform well enough\n\n01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000\nto make people happy\n\n01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000\nwhat are you expressing when you go home\n\n01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nwhen you go to the hotel\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000\nabsolute fatigue\n\n01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000\nbut also this overwhelming\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nsense of\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000\ndid I actually do well\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\ndid I\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000\neverybody's telling me that\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nthat's a loss of identity\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000\nexactly yeah\n\n01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000\nbecause you don't even know\n\n01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nbecause it's so out of kilter\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nI signed to myself\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000\nand you have no recourse to integrity\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nbecause you're like oh am I just a floating\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000\nlike fucking cloud of\n\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000\nI hope everyone likes

01:49:20.000\nis the short guy who's a good actor\n\n01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000\nis he still\n\n01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nis he a good actor relative to all people\n\n01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000\nhe's a dragon\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000\nare the dragons? I like dragons\n\n01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nhe's a dragon now\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nhe turned into one last episode\n\n01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000\nget it in the recap don't worry about it\n\n01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000\nthere's three dragons one is castrated\n\n01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nand can't be burnt\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nhe's taken over\n\n01:49:40.000

01:49:48.000\ncalled the Unsullied\n\n01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000\nand I think a major point\n\n01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000\njust to remember is if there's a male character\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000\nand this does exist in a very gender\n\n01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000\ndichotomy\n\n01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000\nif there's a male character\n\n01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000\nnot a lot of trans characters which is weird\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nalthough I guess like Bran of Tarth maybe\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000\nmy point is if there's a male character\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000\nshe's definitely gender queer\n\n01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000\nshit going on which I\n\n01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000\nI want to get on her shoulders\n\n01:50:10.000 -->

--> 01:50:28.000\nit is the way you present yourself in the world\n\n01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000\nwe have to decouple those two things\n\n01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nwhich is what I was doing\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000\nbut also I love that that was your limit\n\n01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000\nlike watching what people's limits are\n\n01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000\ntwo hours
