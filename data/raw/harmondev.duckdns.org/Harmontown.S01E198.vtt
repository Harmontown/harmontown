00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen of Harbor Town! How are you doing?

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
I'm Cameron Esmesino. I'm your Comptroller Assistant.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Stepping up to official Comptroller for tonight only. Thank you so much for having me.

00:40.000 --> 00:51.000
We have a great lineup of your favorites. You know them from this show, which they created, including Spencer!

00:51.000 --> 01:01.000
I asked him what his title is. He said no title. He also asked that I specifically did not use his last name.

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
He's this show's Madonna. You're a good girl. And now please rise.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
No, you can stay seated. For your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:21.000 --> 01:32.000
Thank you. Cameron Esmesino.

01:32.000 --> 01:44.000
Yep. I'm in a good mood. I poked your belly backstage. I gave you a little Pillsbury poke. Have I ever done that before?

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
Oh yeah, all the time. The weird thing is you always ask me if you've done it before.

01:52.000 --> 02:03.000
No, no. It's never happened before. What did you like about it? We've never done it before. It was a spontaneous, magical moment we shared.

02:03.000 --> 02:23.000
Nothing normal people do. And my relationship with you is based on something stronger than normality, which is our undiagnosed spectral disorders, like whatever they may be.

02:23.000 --> 02:33.000
But sometimes it gets lonely. Sometimes you look around and you wonder, should I just die? Am I going to turn into a skeleton?

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
We talked on Mother's Day about the family and what are our obligations to family?

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Boy, I love getting those tweets when you guys want to flaunt your normality.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
It's always good. Just fire off a tweet to a stranger if you listen to their podcast and just tell them how their family works. That's not a stupid thing to do.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
That's not going to trigger anyone. Your family is probably identical to anyone in the world, right?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Especially if you heard them on a podcast. That seals the deal.

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
My family is identical. Hey, Dan, can I just ask you a point of order? Spencer, belly poke, over shirt or undershirt?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I pulled my shirt up.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, I wanted to ask. I mean, because honestly, I feel like as a woman in Hollywood, it's really important to be treated the same way as anybody else.

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
And so just if you wouldn't mind.

03:37.000 --> 03:50.000
But we're not all created equal. It's a thing. It's a belly thing. My finger is bruised on what I assume is a washboard.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
Oh, yeah, it's a real washboard under there.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
A flat lesbian superhero like trampoline.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Is that what it looks like on the outside of my clothes when you look at me?

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
No, that's what I felt like. I was like, oh, man, you're like a Barbie doll. It's like solid plastic, but not in an artificial sense.

04:11.000 --> 04:21.000
You're a woman of substance, but your body is obviously lies and she's gay and I'm not married.

04:21.000 --> 04:32.000
This is making me feel so good. Please don't feel like you have to stop. If I felt great about my body, it wouldn't be a stand up comic.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
It's obnoxious. Everything I do.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
Okay. Well, I just thought it was super normal. Like I didn't even think, oh, this is a weird thing. So maybe we're like becoming even more normal.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Through each other. Yeah, like we're leveling up.

04:51.000 --> 05:02.000
That'd be nice. I think like, okay, I'm just looking for, I don't know what to talk about first. Just give me a second. Don't act like you're not entitled to anything.

05:02.000 --> 05:11.000
Yes, you are. $10 worth of. So sorry, I didn't mean to lash out at you. You also drove through heavy traffic. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

05:11.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm going to do better than that. I acknowledge my crime. I express remorse and I'll do something to change it. Okay, that was generic, but you get the idea.

05:23.000 --> 05:39.000
We were walking here out of... Right, all of us. No. Myself, my lover Cody and my squire, Steve Levy, and we walked past.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
There was a guy standing in the doorway and I don't know what the PC... We used to just, like five years ago, we'd just go homeless.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
You know, you go, it's a homeless guy and we kind of all go, yeah, and then we start to think like, well, wait, what if he has a home, but he's just like...

05:56.000 --> 06:07.000
What do you say, dirty? He was a person of dirt. It was a filth American.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
I think you should keep going. Just keep grabbing at stars. Yeah, it feels like you're going in the right direction.

06:14.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will definitely hit a perfect sensitive spot. Yeah, that's how sensitive it works. Just throw shit against the wall. That's not how racism starts.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
What is he? A peanut? A peanut? I mean, I think we should talk about whether or not this person deserved it. You know what I mean? Just get right to that.

06:35.000 --> 06:47.000
I would definitely say no because, you know, I'm a rebel. I think our economic system is flawed. I think I'm overpaid for what I do. I'm sure he's underpaid for lurking in the doorway.

06:47.000 --> 06:57.000
I would give him at least a dollar more an hour to do that than I'm taking away from the job of complaining about networks.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I like this. This is kind of nice because you're the Bernie M. Hillary.

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
Are you stuck? Not about people that live on the street but just about every other issue. I agree with you on that.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Can I be Trump? Okay.

07:14.000 --> 07:29.000
I think Trump's success is due to the idea that we can all be Trump. It has so little to do with acquiring anything and so much to do with letting go of so much that has burdened us.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah. I hate stuff.

07:32.000 --> 07:43.000
It's like, what if my brain was a rocket in its final stage and all of the thrusters fell away leaving only the lizard cortex?

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Just like, I'm a winner. You're a loser.

07:48.000 --> 07:59.000
Just hit the moon and blow it up and sell the chunks to yourself and then lie about how much you did. That guy's amazing.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
We were walking and we walked past a lurker in the doorway, a skexie.

08:05.000 --> 08:21.000
And dark crystal. Look it up. Just as we got, there's a person in the doorway. There's no threat. Nothing's going to happen.

08:21.000 --> 08:32.000
And then right as my ear was in his mouth, he made this sound and I wrote it down. I spelled it P-L-O-U-M-P.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
He went right as I went and he scared the shit out of me.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
I jumped like a cat seeing a pickle. Look it up, YouTube.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Cats think, have you seen the cat pickle videos?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Cucumber.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I don't know anything about these.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Cucumbers, yeah, but I bet a pickle would work for a smaller cat.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Cats think...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
What do they think it is?

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Cats, that's the theory. I'd like to think we don't know.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
There's a couple theories.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
Cats, like there's just a million YouTube montages of people, if you put a cucumber out of the line of sight of a cat,

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
when the cat sees the cucumber, it freaks the fuck out. It leaps ten feet in the air.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I guess it thinks it's a snake.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, I mean I grew up in Chicago, so I understand that reaction to raw vegetables.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
Hey, oh, a lot of meat in that area, not for me.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
You're suspicious. You're suspicious of the...

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Sushi regular, what?

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
So the guy went plop, and I freaked out, but when I looked at him, he wasn't looking at me.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And as soon as I was marveling at it, once we were a tasteful block away,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm not going to talk shit about the...

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
As I walk through King's Landing, I'm not going to talk about the lowborn in front of them.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
I wait until we're near the Red Keep or whatever it's called.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
And then I said, what was that all about?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
That guy scared the living piss out of me.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And then he wasn't looking at me, so he wasn't doing it for my benefit.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It's just kind of weird.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
And then Steve Levy said, isn't it possible he had schizophrenia?

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And I was like, yeah, great, what the fuck, fuck you.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay, great, yeah, so of course it's possible, yes, very likely.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
But I remember that umbrella, what was his motivation?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And then Cody said, my girlfriend said,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I think he might have been signaling the other guy,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
because there was another guy coming up the sidewalk,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
and they did have some kind of rapport.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I have nowhere to go with the story, but it's just like two...

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
The opposite of schizophrenia, that's like velociraptor signaling.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
The idea that that's like high-functioning like shit.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And the other theory is that the guy thought I was a dragon,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
or I'm not making fun, I am making fun of mental illness.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I'm generating fun out of it.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm not trivializing the pain one endures when one is mentally ill.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
It's bizarre to move to Los Angeles and see,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
you know, because it's beautiful outside, and so you don't have to seek services.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Again, I'm from Chicago, so there's a certain...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
You could theoretically live...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
You could live...

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm from Milwaukee.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Outdoor for a very long time, and so people don't seek services.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Also, LA is really shitty at providing this stuff.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
This is why at Harmontown, we are working hard to turn that around.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Right, Dan?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Right, Dan?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
One of your major...

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Certainly all proceeds from NerdMelt tonight are probably going to the homeless.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I talked to them about that.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
They said, yes.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But it's intense because it's definitely...

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, it sounds like maybe you figured out what had happened there.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
You know, like, sometimes you see a person on the street,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
and you want to say to yourself,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
what happened here?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Because I'm not a super amazing person.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm just a regular guy.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I got cool jackets, but I'm just a regular guy.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
How did I get so lucky to live this life?

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
And then, my motivation to say nonsense words at a loud volume,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I'm able to suppress.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Right.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
And so then it's like, well, congratulations to me.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Right, and then I look, I imagine me,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I mean, you seem like a more tactful person in general than me.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Obviously.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm one step closer to that guy

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
because I actually have a reputation for saying things out loud

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
that you're not supposed to say at the wrong times.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
But I'm one step... I definitely always go...

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Can you get that beard going on?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
There's a lot of stuff.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I always go like there, but for the grace of God,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
like it's just like, it's a drop of this and a pinch of that.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And it's like, and also within the context of our society.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So that's even more tragic because it's like,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I think about when people have like oppositional defiant disorder,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
it's like, oh geez, what a prick.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
That guy doesn't know how to work at a Kinkos.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
But it's like 500 years ago,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
which is no time at all in terms of humanity.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Like, I'm sure oppositional defiant disorder was like,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
made you like the captain of the Kingsmen.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
World's best knight.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah, like you were probably,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
it was probably like really paid to have like a hugely like dramatic personality.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
And now we're just like, I feel bad for anybody who's like,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
who's like, yeah, who has no choice but to be like, bluff.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Right. Their shit doesn't fit into our shit.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It might be our shit's the problem.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Also, you know what else for folks that might even be here

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
or folks that are able to deal with their stuff through like,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
you know, maybe medication, other stuff like that.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Congratulations.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I'm so happy for you.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah, we never celebrate it.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Something has happened.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
We don't celebrate that enough.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
We don't talk about people that are functional.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Next time you walk past a crazy person on the street,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
take the time to say, yay, I'm sane.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
And then say to them, I'm sorry, you're crazy.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
It'll make everything better.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Okay, so were you ever in a bar or a restaurant?

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
And you got brought like a drink and it looked kind of tasty

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
and you were like kind of surprised.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And then the waiter was like, oh shit, I'm sorry,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
and like took it to a different table.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah, for sure. What'd you get that happened?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I was in New York.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
I was with somebody and that happened.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
And then we were joking about the fact that,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
that actually, what if that was a cool thing

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
that if you're super rich, like that was a delicacy,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
where you order your drink, you're like,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
I'll have the usual Smithers and anything like that.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Manhattan, straight up, a pinch of lime,

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
briefly brought to the wrong table, then taken away.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Right away, sir.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And every time that's happening to you,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
there's just like some cool ass dude

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
that's made it to that level and is paying 580 dollars

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
for their drink.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
It's not about like, it's just like,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
they're convinced that they can just taste a hint

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
of your disappointment.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
That's the vermouth.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
If that's a service that should combine that

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
with somebody making enough eye contact with you

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
that you think they're saying hi to you,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
but then they're saying hi to somebody behind you,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
they brought that shit together.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
If you could bottle that.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You get a drink for a second, they wave to you.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Oh my God, who are you?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm trying to place you.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Thanks for getting me at the airport, stranger.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, them.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
How many times has that happened to you

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
versus how many times have you

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
perceivably accidentally done that to somebody?

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Because I feel like I've never done that to anybody,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
but I'm constantly getting milked.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
There is another thing that's happening more and more,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
and I don't know how, I mean obviously you're recognizable

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
from this, but I will say my face is something

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
that I sell for my business.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
You sell your television show, I sell this face.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
She makes an organic.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Mass to be worn by Kim Basinger

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and the original Batman, as you know.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But my point is,

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
I never saw it.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Fuck you, fuck you, that's very funny.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Now that cannot be ignored.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
No, so something I will do very frequently

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
is like somebody looks at me,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I kind of assume something is going on.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
The best example of this, Dan, if I may,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
is that when we first moved to Los Angeles,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
went to the dog park with my wife, Ria, who you know,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
and I said to Ria,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
that woman over there recognizes me.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And then Ria said,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
no, that is Sarah Paulson.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You recognize her.

16:37.000 --> 16:47.000
That's fantastic.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
That's right, I'm 50 years too young for her anyway.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Okay, all right.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
New topic.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Moving on.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I think we're doing great.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
We're killing it.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
You're killing it.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
No, you are.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I think it's you.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Oh, Dan, I think this is a nice pairing, I feel honored.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Spencer, you're doing great.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
No, I think it's her.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
I think it's her.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
All right, so here's a half-baked thought.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I don't think I've talked about this up here before,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
but my brain is Swiss cheese,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and every day is an adventure.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Someone just stopped me.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Really stopped me.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I talked about this three weeks ago.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Should somebody stop you?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't want to be that guy.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Really?

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
I feel like, okay, so, like, ugly people.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
No, this sounds new.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
This sounds new.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Oh, I should have.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
I had a chance there.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I should have.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
I feel like race in America.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
I feel like, so, ugly people and attractive people should be better friends.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
And I don't know if they'd outnumber everyone who's neither ugly nor attractive,

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
but I'm curious about that because I know for sure that the clothing industry,

18:10.000 --> 18:19.000
the concept of fashion, was neither developed nor is depended upon by the ugly or the attractive.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Because as we all know, attractive people can wear anything,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
and not to cross any boundaries,

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
but what reminded me of this is your wife walked into the green room

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
wearing like a baseball jersey.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh, what's amazing.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
She's wearing a baseball uniform.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
And like the socks pulled up to halfway up the calf,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and she had a baseball cap on it and stuff.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
She's Rhea Butcher, so it was like, yeah, well, come out and show them.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
It's great.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Look at this.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Rhea, pull your shirt down in the back.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
What?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Pull your shirt down in the back.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Thanks.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
You're welcome.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Aw.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
You see this?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Especially came from a baseball game.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, so, but I thought because I was like, no, I was like,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
oh, it's like Andrew McCarthy wearing bowling shoes in mannequin.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Like it's like, that could have easily just been a fashion choice.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Absolutely.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Because an attractive person can wear anything,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
and then everyone would just be like, oh, should I be wearing that?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
So can an ugly person.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I wear whatever the fuck I want.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
And everyone's like, okay, well, I'm assuming he got lost somewhere and confused.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
But I have no beef with attractive people, nor they with me.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
We don't have to fight about fashion and rules of clothing and color coordination

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
or shape or anything like that.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
It's these medium people, these people for whom the slightest variation in a shirt or

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
pant can make all the difference in this war where the middle god,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
it's a game of yards and inches.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
They're tyranny, we suffer from it, and I have a feeling there's way more ugly

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
and attractive people than there are these, who are these mythical fucking

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
shlub nubs?

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
These mug dwarfs, what do they call them in Harry Potterson?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Don't you feel like there's also, there's a...

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
These nickel nicks?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah, that's what it is.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It's McNuggets.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
You're thinking of McNuggets.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
By the way...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Oh shit, god damn it, not to get off on a tangent.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
No, but like, two nights ago, I was about to go to sleep,

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
then the last thought I had before I went to sleep, and I did tweet this,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
but this is the first time I've ever said it out loud, besides Seria.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
The last thought I had for, as my eyes were closing, I sat right up in bed and I said,

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
Oh, chicken nuggets are chicken nugget.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Do you know like, nugget texture? Have you ever seen a nugget get made?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
A chicken nugget is chicken nugget.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
That is the most, that's amazing, that a human brain can come up with that.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Anyway, I don't mean to like, toot my own horn, but Jesus.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
Sidebar, but my point is...

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Dude, but like, chicken nuggets are chicken nugget.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Do you know what I'm saying, McNuggets?

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
I got distracted by something. I remembered something tangentially related.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Was it chicken nuggets or chicken nugget?

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
No, I just remembered, because you're talking about talking,

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
I attacked my girlfriend physically in my sleep.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm sorry that happened to her. How'd that happen?

21:38.000 --> 21:49.000
I was having a dream that, in the dream, a man who looked like my brother,

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
but who was Jeff Davis,

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
because I had the voice of Jeff Davis, but the face of my brother,

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
I remember the dreams that they were just antagonizing me,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
and they just kept antagonizing me, and they were like threatening me,

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
and they were doing everything they could.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
The dream culminated in me going, that's it, I'm going to solve this problem,

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
the way my archetype, I guess, in their cortex,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
and I woke up to Cody going, baby, baby, whoa!

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And I was like, hitting her face.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Now luckily there wasn't a one-to-one analog to what I was doing in the dream,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
in which I was like, he-man.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't know if they chalked that up to just, I'm just not fit,

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
or I would hope that it's like, no matter how hard you try to kill someone.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
But she, I just, you were mentioning the...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
How did she respond? Is she okay? Does everything all right?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
It doesn't even make any sense how she responded.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
She was like, baby, baby, you're sleeping, wake up!

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
And I was like, oh, and then I was like, oh god, oh god!

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
She's like, it's fine, it's fine.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
That makes, that makes tons of sense, that makes tons of sense.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I am terrified of everything, I can't watch scary movies,

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
I have a lifelong fear of the dark, I sleep with the lights on,

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
and like, a lot, as an adult now.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
When I'm out of town, Rhea is a sleepwalker,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
and she will wake up in the middle of the night,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
she'll sit up in bed and go, no! No!

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Alright, let's bring out Rhea Butcher, everybody.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
That's true, though.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Actually, I should have waited until...

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Well, when I go there...

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
If you sit, then it means that I get to sit, and I'm so fat.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But I want to have, I want to have a theory,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
let's talk about this for one second,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
but I do want to address what you said,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
because you know what I'll stand?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Hey, this is my thought on this.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
I think really attractive, really unattractive,

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
I think that's an overlapper, that's a zipper,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
that goes up and down.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Oh, you're back to that, because you're fucking ejector seated from that shit.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I know, but I didn't think about it.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I was talking about that, and you're like, big nuggets!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm sorry.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I was like, fine.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I mean, I agree that that's also important,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
what I said about chicken nuggets or chicken nugget,

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
but I do think that I think human faces have, like,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
elicited a reaction from us.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
There's a stupid meme that's been everywhere that's like Angelina Jolie

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
and Steve Buscemi at the same age,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
and it's like, what in the world?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
They look exactly the same.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Have people seen this?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
No.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
They look exactly the same.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
They have the same face.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Hi, Rhea.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Hi.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Is it true you're a psychopath in your sleep?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Yes, 100% true.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Do you walk?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Well, I get up.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I don't know.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Does that talk the talk in my sleep?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Sure, yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I talk a lot in my sleep, and then I also get up,

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
and then I sort of do this.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Oh, oh, oh.

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
For non-subscribers, no matter how attractive the person,

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
not a position you want to find them in.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You cannot make sleepwalking look good.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't care how hot you are.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
You're always going to be like...

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Like standing over your wife?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
I did that once.

25:08.000 --> 25:15.000
I started tucking you into bed.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
The worst.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Pretty bad.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
And you're awake and going like,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
Thank you.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Everything must be tucked.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Untucked things must be tucked or die.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm tucked.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Thank you.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Your job is done.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Back to sleepy time.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
But it is like full on screaming.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
No, no, no.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Then right back to bed, then our...

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Oh, no.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
Then we have an en suite bathroom that had a short.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Yeah, that's right.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And en suite is what you just said.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah, that almost drifted away.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Like I said, when I went to my lober,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I was like a straight guilt.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Like it's lesbian tuck.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
En suite means like they respect you as an equal.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Full of dildos.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
That's what it means.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
Dildo deodorant, dildo toothbrush.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
It's when you walk in there and you are en suite.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
That's why it's called that.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
It's just a bunch of chapstick and Subaru owner's manuals.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't know.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
You got it.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I'm trying to...

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
That's what I brushed my teeth for.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Just a Subaru manual.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm right up to date on my lesbian cliches.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I swear I looked it up just decades ago.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Anyways.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Oh, wait.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
That means a bathroom that's connected to your bedroom.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
So en suite...

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
You walk through it to get to another room.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
No, it just means it's connected to your bedroom.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
So you can see from your bedroom.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
All right, property brothers, whatever.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh, okay.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Okay, okay.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
The only reason I use that word is because you can see it from our bed.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Right.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And for a while, there was a short in our light switch.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And in the middle of the night, it would turn on.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
The lights would turn on.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
And there was no one in there.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
So imagine, like, you wake up, your wife is like,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
No!

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
No!

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
Goes back to bed, lights go on.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Pretty terrifying.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
But not for me.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
I was asleep the whole time.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
Then our little eight-pound dog gets up, starts like...

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Oh, shit.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Yeah.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Dogs know what's up.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
I know!

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Dogs can see ghosts, like, for sure.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
For sure.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
I was...

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I was a girlfriend in my 20s.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
I was visiting my parents, and I was in bed with her.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
And I thought I was awake, and I thought I rolled over in my wakefulness

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
and thought that I recognized that there was a gray alien in bed with me.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Just mocking me and going like,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Ooh!

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And I did what you would do.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I went like,

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Ah!

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And, like, pushed the alien away.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Because if a gray alien climbs into bed with you

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
and pulls the covers over itself and waits for you to roll over...

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Waits it out.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
It's probably...

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
If you start to push it away, you'll have the element of surprise.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Absolutely.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Oh, my God.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
It's not going to expect you to do that.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
That weird gray alien is like,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Oh, no!

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
My plan!

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I had no idea he would react like a monkey would.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh, push it!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
No!

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Retreat!

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Retreat!

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Call off the global strike!

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
They know not to flail!

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
They push!

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
I covered most of my body with the quilt.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
There will have no success in this invasion.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Signed Marco Polonio.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Meet Mopmoop.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
He's like the...

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Anyways.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah, I get it.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Advanced guy.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Well, I guess that's the end of the story.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm just like alarmed that I'm capable of...

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
Let's face it, violence in my sleep that will affect my lover.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I was very, very disconcerting to me.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I also recently woke up, because I haven't been walking around,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
but I have been waking myself up.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Usually, like, I'll fall asleep at 11,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and then I wake up an hour later and I go,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Every night.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
So, I sleep well, is what I'm saying.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And the other night, I fell asleep,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
and then an hour later, I had a dream wherein I was being shot.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Like, point blank, like this close.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Somebody had a gun.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Shot.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
And shot me in the gut, and I went,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
And I can't even make the noise again,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
because I actually made the noise that I would make if I was shot.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
And it was, because I woke up and was like,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Oh my God.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
That's what it'd be like to be shot.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And that's the sound I'm gonna make?

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
Dammit.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
I didn't think I could fear getting shot more than...

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Now when the bullet's coming, I'm gonna be like,

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
This isn't gonna end well.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Look at how tough I am.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I thought maybe I would be one of those people

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
that just stands there with a blank face

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
while their guts, like, spring it on behind them.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Because maybe the one thing you can count on me to do

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
is just be so lazy and unalert that I get shot

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
and I look like John Wayne.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Because I'm like, I didn't know what...

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
I talk in my sleep, apparently, like, constantly.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Cody is charmed by it and records it.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Here's some more things about Cody.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Again, apparently, if you hit her in the face

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
while she's sleeping,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
she will wake up, say,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Stop hitting me, you're asleep.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And then when you are mortified, she'll go,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
It's okay, and go to sleep.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Whereas I, for instance, I had a girlfriend once

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
who apparently had a...

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I awoke to a girlfriend

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
smashing me in the face with her open palm

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
because she was dreaming that I had a centipede on my face.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Oh, Chris.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
How her augmented dream reality

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
included the real topography of my real face.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
And she was like,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I mean, what am I talking about?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Who am I to talk?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Why was I in bed with an alien

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
at my parents' house in Florida?

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
But I don't remember being magnanimous.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
It's not like I believe I looked at it

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
as an opportunity to be outraged,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
waking up to being smashed in the face.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
It never occurred to me that it was an opportunity

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
to be forgiving or cool at all.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I was more like shopping spree.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I get to be like,

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
What the fuck, man?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
No, it's just, yeah, fucking, what the fuck, man?

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
It's just like, you go to bed with someone

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
and you know, it's like a social contract.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Take it fucking with you.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
I give you my heart.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
A centipede dream?

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
That's what you think of me?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I don't know if I did all of that,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
but I feel like that's what I did.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
You got some of that in?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
That's nice.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
So I'm with a girlfriend who...

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
It's like, there's a...

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
I'm not going to spiral into self-deprecation,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
but she's a better person than me

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
and I don't deserve her.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
And she has recordings of me.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Oh, she's also charmed by my gibberish sleep talk.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Because I just say,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I don't even use parts of speech,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I just say, it's hard to do an impression of it.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Like speaking in tongues?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Like octopus rainbow.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
There's no verbs or nouns.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I'm going to go, take it to the thing,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and then we go, and then we say,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
well, that's what I usually say,

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
which is just like music to all of your ears, I'm sure.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah, but for real, none of that comes out of your mouth.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Do you know that?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I know, you don't really say that shit.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Then what do I say?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
No!

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Okay.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
No, no, no!

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I used to say more than,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I used to say more than no because I was a child

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
and I didn't understand the world yet.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Now I'm an adult and I'm just like, no!

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
That explains something.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Halfway to death right now, no!

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Hey, Cody, if you're listening,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
it won't pay off so you don't have to do this,

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
but if you have the audio file,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
the video file that you took of me talking to my sleep

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
in Palm Springs and you texted to me,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I'll be able to access it fast.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Wow, if you've just tuned in, this is...

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
It's a great show.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
...Harmontown, behind the scenes.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Okay, all right, well, I'll give you guys a choice

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
of what we talk about next.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Yeah.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Okay, we talked about plump.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
We talked about the ordering the drink thing.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I thought, I really shined there.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
That really landed.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
It's like, did I make a mistake giving up stand-up?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
That was great.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
We can talk about Beyoncé, Kanye...

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh, oh my, wait, what?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Big otters.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I think we got a full stop on Beyoncé.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Oh, sorry.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I just mean, you know, we can also...

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Oh, did you say otters?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
But we can do both, we can get to it,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
but Beyoncé is a bigger otter.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
And we can talk about Beyoncé and otters so much.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
I got so much to say about those two topics.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
But yo, best way to see Beyoncé,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
surrounded by otters for real.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Wait, when you watch this, what is this lemonade?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Is that her...

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
I have a lot of 43-year-old questions about what's happening.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
What is this, lemonade?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Does she like to drink it?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't understand.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
What's going on?

34:26.000 --> 34:34.000
So she's struggling with the feelings of the adultery concept.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
But the crazy thing is that it's through his label.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
But is he producing it?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Is he like behind a board when she's like producing those songs

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
and going like, okay, baby, let's take that again.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
When you hit the phrase, like,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I can smell her perfume on your dick.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Like, just really lean into it.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Like, remember how much it hurts.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Yeah.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Because I don't want another shitty album out of you.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
When you say, boy, bye, I want you to also be dividing our bank accounts.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
You know what?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
I don't care.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
That's what I've decided about that question.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
I'm going to tell you why.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
I don't know.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I don't actually think he was the producer on those tracks

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
because I read all the track listings

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
and Carter was not one of the names on it.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Knowles, however, was a name.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Every single song on Lemonade.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
By the way, every single song.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah. Well, because what I was going to say is,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I think, you know what?

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
It doesn't matter to me whether or not it's real

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
or whether or not it happened

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
or whether or not it's him

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
or whether or not she wrote those songs.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
There was like a huge, when Lemonade first came out,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
everybody was like, yay!

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
And then there was weird, sad white guy backlash

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
where sad white guys go like,

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
well, for a minute we talked about another thing.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Right.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Yay!

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
And then there was a lot of like, she didn't,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
and what I, it's amazing,

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
we went to see her at the Rose Bowl two weekends ago.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
Wait, so there's a sort of,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
that seems like just sort of general internet erosion,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
like yeah, and I'll definitely, as a spokesman

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
for fat white straight guys that are outside,

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
I'll speak, I bet we're very represented in that swarm

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
of people that are like, oh, this thing that was amazing

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
really just grabbed us and we all,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
and then there's a sort of like weird erosion,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
so I'm just, I'm curious about the specifics of that,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
like people are going like,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
she doesn't really believe in this?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Is that like just sort of questioning the magic of it?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Well, like that, and also like, did it happen?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
When? How much was it?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Where were the hotels?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I want to see the semen!

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
You know, like everybody gets like...

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
But she's not singing about that,

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
now I'm Beyonce-splaining to...

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I'm dance-splaining to Beyonce,

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
but I mean, I'm assuming she's not singing about a Colombo plot,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
she's not going like, here's my evidence...

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
She's talking about her, that's all she's saying,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
she's talking about what's going on for her.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
That's what I heard, the five minutes I heard of it,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
while my girlfriend was watching on her phone,

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
I heard, it was like, oh, she's coping with the feelings,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
like which are largely,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
and especially doesn't matter whether they're true or not.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Yeah, because it's like empowerment songs,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
and so in order to make empowerment songs,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
you have to be wronged,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
and so like, she's setting up the idea that she was wronged.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Also, she's a black woman, so like,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
straight up she's been wronged.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
For real, like there's been some times where she has been wronged.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I don't know if you guys know anything about black people.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
And women.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
And a black woman.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Just speaking as a white woman,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
just trying to tell you guys what it's like to be a black woman.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
Because I may be a lesbian, but I'm still white.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Right.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
And there's certain duties that are coming upon me.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Just when you thought I had perspective,

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
damn this lack of love melanin.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah, okay, so that was us talking about Beyonce.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Now I'd like to talk about Kanye.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Oh great, let's hear it.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Okay, so stop booking him on your talk shows

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
just so he can talk crazy,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and then marveling at him talking crazy.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
I've been over this.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
He has seven number one albums.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
We've given him permission to be crazy.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
You know he's crazy.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
It's like if you invite Gary Busey on your thing.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Except it's better,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
because Gary Busey doesn't have seven number one albums.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
And it's like, I honestly, I can't,

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
I don't like, I'm in this guy's corner

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
no matter what he does until he hits somebody.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
He hasn't pooped or peed or hit anybody.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
All he does is, I read the transcripts.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
He was on Ellen, and he kept talking,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
and boy, he was crazy.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I was like, well, what did you say?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
What did you tell you?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Well, Kanye's going to come out,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
and so let's put him in our sane segment.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
And so he'll just give us the weather, right?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
And he'll be totally accurate,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
and we won't have to check that.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
He's like parading him out,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
and then asking him anything.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Kanye, toast.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Toast makes me think of Picasso.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Picasso makes me think of me.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Me as a genius.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Einstein as a genius,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
but nobody can feel this.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
I can't feel this.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
When I wore a shirt to jacket,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
I went to school,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
and I was like,

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
that's all about what you do.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
It's about the rhymes you put on your pants,

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
and then you put on your shoes.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Stephen Hawking can do it.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
I can do it.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Van Gogh can do it.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Who are these people?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
They're dead now.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That's why I feel that Black Lives Matter

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
or whatever, he's like,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
and everyone's like,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
oh, he ranted, or he's crazy.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I just wanted to say.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Isn't it also amazing?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
He needs my support,

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
and I'm on his team.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Hey.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
I can't get through

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
a single one of his number one albums,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
but I love his personality.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Thanks for that.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Isn't it interesting that he and Beyoncé

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
are having this moment at the same time?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
They're having parallel moments,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
but I think she is very indicative

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
of the female experience in 2016.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
I think he's a little bit indicative

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
of the male experience,

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
because the most interesting thing

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
he can do right now

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
is completely melt down.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
He's had so much power,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and he's like, oh, it's too much.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
And I am crushed.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
And then Beyoncé's like,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
you want to see crushed?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Look at these thighs.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I will sit on you.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Women have to be like in charge

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
of their brand.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
And they're like, fuck you boys.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Also, look at all this.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Can't touch it.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Get away.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Come here.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
So serious.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
It's Hillary and Bernie.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I'm fucking telling you.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Dude's hair is crazy.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
We're like accurate.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Ladies are in power suits.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
This is where we are, man.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
2016, man.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
Cameron Esposito's meltdown on Harmontown.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Will leave you speechless.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
You won't believe what she said.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Also, what are those articles?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
It's like, what are you,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
you're typing about a thing

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
that happened on fucking TV?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
TV's already on the internet.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
I fucking hate all of you.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It's like, oh, here's a person

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
that's one of the eight

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
interesting people left in the world

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
because his craziness

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
hasn't fit down the drain yet.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Like, oh, I'm Picasso.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I love, I love, I love, I love

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
aqua, aqua, aqua fresh.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
What Picasso aqua fresh?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Get a room.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Noop, doop, doop.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Click, click, click, click, click.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
You're crazy.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
You're the crazy person.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
You're a drone.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Did he really say he liked aqua fresh?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
No.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Damn.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
I won't, I won't, I don't,

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I don't know.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I was about to be like,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I'm a decanier now.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I like aqua fresh.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
But also like shout out to Ellen

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
for having like multiple video

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
scandals in the last couple months

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
and just like staying relevant.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
What else did she have?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
What was her role?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Well, just like people are yelling

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
about weird, like Hillary was on the

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
show, she was dancing and everybody

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
was like, that's not the right,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
that's cultural appropriation.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Did she like work the day out

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
or something like that?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
And like perhaps, but also like,

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
I love, like, where to stay

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
relevant, Ellen?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Where to, where to fucking get

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
in there and fight, man?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Just keeping your shit going with

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
weird, I mean, weird animated

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
gifts.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Yeah, cause I just think like.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Well, isn't her show on every day

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
it would be weird if she didn't

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
have relevant people on.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Like it's like.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Well, but she's also like old

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
school talk show.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
You know what I mean?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Like James Corden is like, this is

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
a full functioning dance club

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and airplane inside of a taxi

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
cab.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And we are also doing

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
two minutes and everybody that

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
gets in this will be the most

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
famous person you've ever seen.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
We're doing karaoke where they

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
sing each other's songs.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
And that was just like, oh, I'm

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
just going to dance.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Well, she must be doing something

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
right.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
She's been on the air for a

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
million years.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I've never seen it.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
She seems to be having a

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
wonderful time.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Do you know what's weird?

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
I've I've seen the show.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Can you believe that?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Do you know Tignataro?

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Because we were talking about.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
I know Tign.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Hey, you know what, Dan?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Good one.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
All right.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
I've been waiting for like six

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
years to do that.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Very happy about it.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
All right.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Peak TV, Cookie Tapper 2, Simon

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
and Garfunkel, Big Otters.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Oh, let's, I told the director

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
of Great Minds to come on the

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
show tonight.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Let's bring out Heath Cullen.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
No, you sit there.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
There he is.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
Oh, bullet.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Your name stuck in my throat.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
I thought for a second there in

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
my drunkenness, I was like,

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Cullen, there's an S, right?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
S, yeah.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
But you didn't call me Keith, so

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
we're okay.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Who decides that?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Do you think last names at a

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
certain point were all singular?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
And then, and then ours was.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
It was just a couple of generations

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
ago that we added the S.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
So your theory is one for one as

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
far as I've ruined the show.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
So sorry also about all those

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
vampire books.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
I'm sure that was rough for a

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
while.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
It was hard.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Sorry, guys.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
Do not follow vampire books.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
They're vampires?

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Edward Cullen.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Well, it's Cullen, singular.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Because he's from a while ago.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
He's a vampire.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
He's been around for like a long

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
time.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
They immigrated a long time ago.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
All right, here's our segment

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
where we talk about otters.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Oh, shit.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So there's these otters in the

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
show.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Let's just show the audience the

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
video.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
There's no video.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Well, we got your phone.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
It's huge.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Just pass it around.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Just pass it around.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
Don't old shame me.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
There's these otters, I think,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
in the Amazon, right?

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Amazon, yeah.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Amazonian river otters.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Amazon prime otters.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
No millennial.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
It's a river.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
Not of savings.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
When's the last time you've seen

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
the sun?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
She has dirt from a baseball diamond

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
on her.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
These otters, they're called

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
them river wolves.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
That's right.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Terrifying.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
But really, that's kind of, I

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
shouldn't have said that because

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
it's more interesting to think

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
that, okay, there's these otters,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
but they hunt caiman.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
You know what caiman are?

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Fucking alligator n-bomb.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Oh, no.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I just thought you forgot.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
I don't know.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
I don't know.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I don't know.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
I don't know.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
I don't know.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
I don't know.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I don't know.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
I don't know.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
I don't know.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
I don't know.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
I don't know.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I just thought you forgot how to

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
talk about the guys with the very

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
long brow.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
They left a while ago.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
No, those are cavemen.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Cavemen.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Cavemen.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Yeah.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
No.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Just like these are,

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
like, like, don't make the

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
mistake of thinking of caiman as

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
a baby tiny alligator.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
They come as big as alligators.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah, almost.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
No.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Big enough to be scary.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
They're like five feet, right?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
That's what five feet.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Are you?

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Yeah.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Like, if you see that in front

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
of you, you're not going to be

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
like, oh, that's just five feet

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
of a gator.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I'm not gonna attack it.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
No, I'd probably start biting at it.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Like an otter.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Right, yeah.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
These otters, they travel in packs,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and they, uh, cause they're not rodents.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
No, they're not.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
How do you know so much about otters?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Well, we were talking about them today.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Wearing them physically.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Did you tell me that locusts are just grasshoppers,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
or is that someone else?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
God, no, I would never make that mistake.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
No.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm no weak theologist, but everybody else has.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Come on.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
You're not a fish scientist?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Cause I'm not that either.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
So, but there's a video,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
you could just watch like five otters

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
eat a caiman.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
They hunt alligator.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And there's otters that hunt alligator.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
That's it, that's all.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I just imagine them with like headbands on,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and like little like archery,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
like a bow and arrow,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
that they made out of like a pencil or something.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Well, Brian Jakes has taught us that

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
otters use slings.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Well, someone will get that.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I don't know if they're here,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
but someone will get that.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I think Rhea did make a great point of order, though,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
before we move on to the next topic,

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
which is that otters have tiny hands.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
We swam with otters a couple of years ago

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
in San Diego, and it's weird,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
cause they're little, but they've got full hands.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Imagine a full hand.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Imagine a dog walking up to you,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
and then that dog goes like,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
hahahaha.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Yeah.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Full hand.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
With little nails,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
and when they want it, they're like,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
oh, they're gonna maybe swim inside your bathing suit.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
It's adorable, but then they have little hands.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Oh my god, otter got hands.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Like they can go like this,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and they can go like that.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
It's opposable.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Yeah, and I mean, honestly, as a woman,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
hands in the bathing suit,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
no problem that, like,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I'm sorry, back up and

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
what?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Only because

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I'm getting so much pleasure,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
because usually I am the person who's awkwardly

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
saying half the thought out things

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
about lesbians.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I was making a hands or dicks joke,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
but I didn't get there.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
hahahaha.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I always thought,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
if I was gonna be an animal, I'd be an otter.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Like that would be like,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
because they swim, and when I seen them

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
in Wisconsin, they float

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
on their back, and their bellies stick out

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
of the water, and they eat, like,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
seafood off of their belly.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Yeah, they just get a nice surf and turf,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
and they're just like,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
and it just seems like, it seems like

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
the life, like when I get in a pool,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
that's what I end up doing.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I'm not one of these people that plays,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
let's splash each other,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
or you get on my shoulders,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
or let's bash our heads on concrete,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
or let's bounce up and down

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
in a slippery fucking spring-loaded

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
piece of weirdly textured

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
sun-bleached fiberglass

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
that may or may not at any moment

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
have a different relationship with our weight

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
and result in a fucking

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
neck breakage that would be the most

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
ironic way to die after all you've spent

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
writing?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Otherwise known as diving.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Right.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
The people that jump, I can't,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
but you probably do it. No, I don't.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It's terrifying. I jump into a swim.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yeah, Rhea, I can't swim. You can't swim?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
No, no, no. I mean, I can survive in a pool.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Most people don't have to survive

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
in a pool. Most people, when they go on

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
vacation, they're like, this is so great.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
When I'm in a pool, I'm like, this is so great!

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I look like an otter.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty awesome, though.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Yeah, I mean, I thought I could swim,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and then we went on vacation, and I was in the pool,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
and Cameron was not, and then she walked up to the pool,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I got out of the water, and Cameron went,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
oh, honey.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Because she had just, just having observed

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
everything you've done in the pool.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
She was like, oh, I can swim. Totally no problem.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And then was like,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, I just like,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I took a couple solo lap in the pool

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
by myself.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It was a joke, because I took one lap, because I can't swim.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Is it because,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
because I was a late bloomer swimmer,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
and it was because

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I never learned to have my face

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
in the water. Is that what you're doing?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Like dog paddling. Yeah, yeah.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Frantically. And surviving.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Because the reason everyone else can swim

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
is because they learn that it's okay

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
to have your face in the water. Yeah.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I do not, yeah, if I put my face in the water,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
water goes up my nose. Yes.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Which is called dying. Yep.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
It's called, it's called drowning.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It is a goal to avoid that.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
So if I'm, and so you're like,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
you're keeping your head out of the water.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Yeah, and that's called dog paddling.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, yeah, and it's called survival.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
It's like being in outer space. Same thing.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Just like being in outer space

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
without a space suit on.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Yeah, well, it's like, you know,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
there's a lot of ways to exercise,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
but almost all of them you have

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
complete access to air. Yes.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And swimming is the only one where you have to

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
pick when you get air.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
That's why it's so badass.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Yeah, I mean, I,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
that's my, I was a swimmer in high school.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Do you guys want, hey, what was your,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
what was your special,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
what did you specialize in? Oh,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
are you asking what was my specialty?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I'm asking what was your specialty? Breaststroke.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Perfect.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This is from your

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
1970s lesbian sketch show.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
The two woman

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Rowan and Martin's laughing.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
What kind of dog do you have?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Ginger, does ginger break? No, ginger snaps.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
And pussy.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I don't have any.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I'm, I'm proud

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
to say I have no lesbian jokes

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
in my chamber.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I, I, to me

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
they look like jokes about beams of light.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
And I look

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
at them, I go, why is that funny? Why is the,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
why did one beam of light say to the other?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
And I forget them.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Okay, so, okay.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
What about these otters though? They, the thing is

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
when they don't just murder crocodiles,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
when they do it

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
in a process that takes, what did it say,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
an hour? No, no, no, like four to five,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
four to five, it was a long. Multiple hours

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
they wage war. They sit on their stomachs

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
and eat them alive. Yeah. And they make

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
sounds that sound like what is it,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
they squint, they make Justin

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Roiland goat sounds.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Like the whole time they're like,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
it's like really,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
they're making the whole time. This is like,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
this is like bone hours. That is spot on.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It's like bone tomahawk all over again.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Wait, they sit on them.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
They eat them while

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
they're sitting on them. They, there's a group

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
of them, they get together, they distract it,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
they get a hold of its tail. They're big.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
It goes after, and then all of a sudden, like four

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
of them are on its back, spin it over,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
dinosaur belly up. That's disgusting.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Oh, it's bad. It's bad news.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
It's not, it's not a joking

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
matter. If you're a

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
caiman. I mean, I,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I had like eight, 12,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
then they end up to follow

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
up.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Oh, you say a bunch of them get on the other ones belly

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
interesting, and then

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
they just keep eating.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Shut up.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I said to myself,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
my point is,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Dan, that's terrifying.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I'm sorry to know about

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
it.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I thought for a second, you were like, Dan, that's terrifying.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I'm sorry you wake up hitting your girlfriend.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
What is with you?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Are you on a space?

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
There's like a delay. No,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
that would mischaracterize you. You're very on point.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
It's just a callback to the delay from earlier.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Okay.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Much better than Jeff, I think.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I, no, no,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
don't pick sides. Just, just, just stay

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
in your,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
stay in your stalls.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
All right, just, let's

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
have a moment of awkward silence.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
It was my idea.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Let's welcome a guest

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
of mine that's here tonight,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
because they're visiting from out of town,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
and they're staying at my place,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
which was always

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
promised to them, and I want to make sure

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
that they have a key.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Harmontown Jane is here. Jane, come

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
with us.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
You're looking

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
surprised.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Okay. Yeah, well, that's a thing.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I'm not going to be like,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
three days from now, I'm going to make you come

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
to my place.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Hi, Jane.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Fucking keep up, man.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Jane, how are you?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I'm doing good. I flew in, flew in

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
about four hours, six hours ago, six hours ago.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Have you been to my place yet?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I've been to your place. I'm checked in.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
My key was under the mat. Your key was under the mat.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
You dear man, thank you so much. Do you have

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
my key? I have it on my, yeah.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Okay. Do you want it back? No.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I just, ever.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I just, I just want to take a moment

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
just to repeat.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
You have the key to my home and your pocket.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Moving on.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I give

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
and I give.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Hey, Dan, are you guys going to

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
use the same bathroom and it's not a fucking big deal?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I have a bathroom.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
It's all sweet. They're separate bathrooms.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
That's what I'm talking about.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
She has an on sweet bathroom.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I've got an on sweet bathroom.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I think that was important that I did though.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
What are you, your schedule is okay

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
because I've

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
been busy. It was like, you're

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
staying and then you're, you're in LA

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
and then you're going back. So I'm on vacation

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and it's like the first vacation

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I've like taken as an adult

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
like post-divorce on my own

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
without like a child in tow or anything.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
And yeah, so I

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
came out to LA because I was born

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
and raised in LA.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
So I touched stone with that past and then

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I'm going up to San Jose

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
San Francisco area for a few days to hang out

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
in Crescent Moon Bay, I think it is.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
They got a bed and breakfast there

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
meeting with some friends from college.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And then I'll be back down here next week,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
for next week's Hardman Town as well.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
But spending time with friends

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
from high school and friends from college.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
All right, yeah. Well, we'll get to know

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
the human side of you.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
At some other point, can I reduce you for a moment

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
to your role as just a

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
person? As a representative

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
of a group that

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I was so stark-raving drunk

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
last time we spoke

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
which was on stage in Chicago.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
New York, yeah.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
See, there you go.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I've transitioned geographically.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
All I remember is the last time we checked in

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
was that you had said

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
it was like that you had escaped

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
dichotomy altogether.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
You were kind of like, oh, there was a

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
transition, but then it was like

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
there was a third act there.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
It was just Jane, like I'm not

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
right, Pepsi or Coke.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Right, the journey had begun

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
that I thought I was going from

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Glenn to Jane and that it was going to be

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
male to female, and that's where

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I had thought I was going to go if you would have asked

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
me like 30 years ago when I was in college

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
that it was like, yeah, we talked about

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
my ideal then was back to Madonna

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
that, you know, I'm going to,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I want to go all the way.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
But in the

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
year since, it's

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
changed. I'm comfortable, sort of

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
landing, sort of,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
a lot of it has to do, so I have a son

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
who is agendered, who has come

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
out as agendered, he's 19 years old.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
And it's

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
learning about, just

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
with language and with

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
experience and with culture,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
subcultures that are accepting

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
of these in-between states,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I'm finding out that, oh,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
this dichotomy that I was,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I thought that I had to exist on one side

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
or the other of, there are these in-betweens.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
And so I'm sort of learning

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
as I go that I have other

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
options. Like, and

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
among them being like unlabelable

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
options. Well, yeah,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I mean, all the terms

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
that are coming up, you know, the

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
non-binary, NBG,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I mean, all the acronyms and abbreviations

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
and everything that are coming up for them, yeah, that

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
there are things that are just,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
what's gender anyway, type of

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
questions. Who am I doing this for?

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
What, who am I trying to impress?

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Who am I changing for?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And it puts me,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I sort of put myself into

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
this soup of options

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and I don't know, and I'm actually

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
feeling pretty good about not

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
knowing. I think, I think

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
certainty is

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
the enemy. We have found in comedy, politics

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
and now

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
this. But I already knew

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
that.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
What took you so long to catch up?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Opportunity is

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
the thing. I mean, that's

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
the brilliance.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
How do you mean? You had the freedom to explore.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Right.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Yeah, opportunity gets eliminated by

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
certitude. Yes.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Fucking nailed it.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Like,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
we worship certainty in

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
our culture.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I thought it was a weird, I

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
tweeted this thing. It was

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
not an original thought. I was retweeting

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
some dude that was

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
a pundit who said, it's a pretty

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
simple statement, but

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I was amazed at the amount

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
of retweets

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
of my retweet.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
This guy, they had a little

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
thing on CNN where they just talked about

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
the state of the media and, you know,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
is the media responsible for

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
our dichotomous, kind of like

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
weird hyper-partisan

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
psychosis?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Or is

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
the media just faithfully

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
covering what is just a weirdly

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
hyper-partisan

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
psyche? I guess you can hear

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
from my tone what I think is the case.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
But this one guy,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
John Avalon from I think Daily Beast said,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Americans are no longer assuming

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
goodwill on part of the folks

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
they disagree with. And I was

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
kind of blown away with the amount

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
of people that were retweeting that.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I guess tying that into what you're

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
talking about, it's like

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
we are being trained, we're being

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
socialized to be certain of things.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
And part of being certain

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
is you have to defend, you have to

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
compartmentalize. If you're certain

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
that a glass of water

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
is poison and someone walks

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
up to it and starts to drink it,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
it's your duty as a human being

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
actually as a person who values

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
the human race and who hopes that we

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
survive to see a better day and

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
colonize various planets and outlive

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
giraffes, those fucking things.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Oh, I'm a horse.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I should have a longer neck. Don't let

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
them win.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Do you want to live in a world

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
where that's how you win?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
We're getting

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
close, man. As of

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Trump, we're like a close

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
just the dropoff

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
between us and giraffes got a little

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
less steep. Because I bet

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
the smartest giraffe is

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
like if you really

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
had the option of voting for them.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Anyways,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I want to thank you for that. I don't

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
know if you know, my son and I actually put together a compilation

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
of every time that you said

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
giraffe in the first 150 episodes

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
of Harmontown. And it is

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
six minutes long.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And it is on YouTube

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and I encourage you to

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
find it because it's fucking hilarious. Because in biology

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
that's the first thing we learn when they're teaching us

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
about Darwinism. They use the obvious

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
example of the giraffe. I think you've

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
talked about giraffes more than you've talked about race

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
in this show.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I mean, what's the difference?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
We're talking

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
about necks of different lengths.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Why am I looking at this?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
What was your point?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Just hiding.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
You know, I think

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
one thing that I just want to point out is that

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
number one, Dan

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
cheers. Love this

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
advocacy and I think it's awesome.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You patronize me?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
No, go fuck yourself.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You're about to follow that up with a butt.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
You're like, you fucking fat piece of shit.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, I think it exists.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I think what's confusing about

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
right now is that that

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
is a great way to think. It's maybe the best

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
way to think. And then it also exists

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
in the same time when

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
being a minority group means that you have to really

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
fight for space. And so that is what's

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
happening right now that's very confusing

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
because to be in a minority group

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
you have to be very certain about who you are

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
in order to just have some boundaries

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
up around yourself. And that I think is why

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
it's so scary to exist right now

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and be in a minority group is because

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I don't believe that there is

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
certainty in the world.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
This is such a joke about my haircut

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
in this very surface level, but

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
when I got this haircut it was the first time

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
that I felt like I really understood

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
what was going on with me because it really is

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
hapsies and that felt great

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and it continues to feel great

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and whoopsie days and the circus is going to

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
last for like, it's just a real problem

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
at this point. Can't get rid of it.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Going out, it's like asymmetrical

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
haircuts or a thing of the past. Everybody's got

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
a blunt bob. Fucking sorry

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
about it.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
How much of it, just to interject, not to

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
derail, how much of that

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
when you talk about that, like

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
any move you made with your hair, how much of

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
it is inside and how much of it is outside?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Like the, as far as like

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
if I got all short

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
it would cause a shit story about how much of that is in...

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I don't know that we can decide. I guess that's

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
what I'm saying, is that like

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
this still indicates, but not just that

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
it's not the performer thing, it's like this indicates

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
something to the world about who I see

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
myself and then this indicates something to the world

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
and so I think that's the time that we're

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
living and we're living and this time we're like

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
you have to carve out who you are and be really

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
specific about what you're saying, but

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
we also are fluid

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
people and we are complicated

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and our world is complicated and we shouldn't have

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
to defend one thing forever for the rest

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
of our lives, so it's, we're in

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
a weird moment right now. You're in this point

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
where you have this, you have

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
sort of your personal culture, you have your

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
self-identity, but you have to exist

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
within the context of a society

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and society is about

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
boundaries, society is about comfort, it's about

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
opportunities, but it's also about

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
boundary conditions

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and I can't

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
just say to

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
the topic du jour, what bathroom

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm going to use,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I can't go in and just immediately demand

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
that there's either a third option

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
or zero options after

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I've been in there.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I've got mine on sweet, I'm cool.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I have to do a punchline of every

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
30 seconds I have. No, I've got a trans bathroom,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
it's good. Okay, back to what you were saying.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But, to your

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
point Karen, I mean it's really, it is unsafe.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's very scary, it's scary

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
for me, it's scary for me

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
as a parent for my son.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's fair, I mean it's fair for my other son, who is

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
straight and cis, but is a strong

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
advocate for his little brother and for his father.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, I've thought, well

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I would imagine, yeah,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm going to start babbling and hope

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
that somewhere along the line I'll be

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
adding instead of just babbling, but

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
it seems

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
to be that the American dream is moving

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
from, it's like we had a definition

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
for it and we're just slowly moving into this place

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
of genuine like egalitarian

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
kind of like, I don't know, it's like like a sort

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
of pragmatic view of what

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
the original framers of that

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
concept said

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
but weren't actually

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
thinking and it's like we're trying to create

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
a honeycomb where

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
within each perfect hexagonal

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
fucking comb

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
which represents

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
your right to not be mugged,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
beaten, terrorized,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
threatened, shouted

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
down, blah blah blah

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
but within

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
that perfect honeycomb that exists

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
in this ginormous

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
hive that we do rely on

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and fear being excommunicated

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
from foster

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
bricks, that within

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
that we have

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
to start thinking of ourselves

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
as like a gelatinous

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
like organic ooze

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and stop

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
bothering to go, well

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I happen to live in this hexagonal

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
compartment

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
that's actually perfect

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
because as it turns out, I'm hexagonal

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
it's like, no

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
you're as much humanity

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
as can be poured into

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
that little cell

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
and like your liquid

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and if you were to

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
for instance meet a partner that you

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and you wanted to merge with them

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
you could eliminate a wall and that's where the metaphor

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
starts to break down but it's like

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
that we kind of like exist within there

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
we want to desperately kind of

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
we all want to live in this world where it's just like

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
oh shit can we

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
what if the conversations we had

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
had anything to do

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
we're on the next level

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
that weren't about like what does your hair feel like

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and is that weird, how's the weather up there

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I tell you like

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
oh Peter Dinklage are you a great actor

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
or are you just the greatest actor of that height

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
like just fascination

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
just fascination with each other's

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
bodies and their cheek bones

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and pigmentation and private parts

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and behavior in the bedroom

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and when we fart and how we fart

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
and how we describe a fart

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and whether or not a one syllable word

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
for a Japanese person is more

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
or less offensive than a multi-syllabic

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
crazy chain of syllables

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
that ultimately mean I'm just saying

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
this so I don't get in trouble

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
we're just terrified

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
and fascinated with all these surface things

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
but we all want

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
to be liquid

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
we want to be but we don't believe it's possible

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
because we're afraid we'll

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I think we're afraid we'll

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
we'll run together

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and we'll stop being

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
we'll be Skynet

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
and the computer will be like

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
oh I was gonna do that but fuck it

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
like Skynet will be like

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
oh shit I was gearing up to nuke you guys

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
but you just

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
evolved to the point where

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
nobody, nothing was funny

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
because you were all hanging out

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that's where

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I think that's the white

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
straight rage

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
our fear I think

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'll speak for them

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and say I think the fear is

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
our toys are gonna get taken away

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and everything that was special is gonna stop being special

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and everything that was there and I think it would be

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
a mistake to look at that simply

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
as one privileged group

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
happens to have that

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I think anyone would have that

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
in the state of privilege

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
what the fuck is going on

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
it's my show

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
now we're riveted

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
no more lesbians, no more trans people

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
can I ask you a question about the retreats

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I control this show

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I'm trying to talk about how I'm an advocate

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Dan

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
you people are fucking it up

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I think what you're talking about is

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
talking about how I'm a good smart person

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
you're wonderful

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I think what you're talking about

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I think what you're talking about

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
is the very real feeling

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
of when you have 100% of the things

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and then you lose some of that stuff

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and then that becomes a real feeling of loss

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
it feels like an amputation

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
because you used to have 100% of the things

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and I think what I'm talking about is this brand new feeling

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
of liberty that is happening

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
it doesn't exist for everybody yet

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
but it's more now than it used to be

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
my lovely wife we're moving tomorrow

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
to a new apartment and last night she said to me

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
in the second to last night

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
in an apartment that we have lived in

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
our first place in LA

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
she said to me there's a way in which we're

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
first generation Americans

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and that's true because we are the first generation

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
that will have gotten married legally

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
like young

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
you know we got to get married legally young

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
so this is a weird fucking time to live

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and I have nothing

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
to write about in stand up

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
it's so terrible

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I was trying to think

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I go to these stupid like branded entertainment

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
conferences where we talk about

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
oh could jiff peanut butter make breaking bad

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
you know instead of paramount

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and it's like the answer

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
is no because

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
if a peanut butter company

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
makes breaking bad and it fails

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
which it will 90% of the time believe me

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
this is connected give me a chance

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
and let me pronounce chance like a french person

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
someone will get fired at the peanut butter company

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
but on the other side of it

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
writers have to overcome their addiction

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
to just thinking

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that what you couldn't say 10 years ago

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
now automatically qualifies as

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
edgy progressive and stuff

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I am so guilty

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
like all of my friends I like like that's what we do

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
like we push buttons like

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
like in this new world where everybody

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
actually does respect each other

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
part of the I think the fear is

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
among creatives particularly comedic

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
ones I think there's like an unconscious

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
fear of like well what's going to be funny

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
if everybody gets along

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
like if nothing's wrong

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
that's a to say not that not that we're

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
all envisioning a future where no one's ever having

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
conflict but it's like it's more about like

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
oh like you know what you never see

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
in Roddenberry's original Star Trek series

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
they never go to a stand up club like

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
like you see you you

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
you get a hint of how shitty music

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
gets

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
because

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
because Spock is the only musician

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
on the enterprise

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
and he plays a fucking like

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
rush instrument like he's like

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I love rush and

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
3D chess

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
you

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
but they never go to a comedy club

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and like

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
what would Roddenberry

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
and stand up be the answer is

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
it wouldn't

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
obviously it wouldn't have to do with Klingon's drive

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
like this and Romulan's drive like that

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
it would

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
it would be like

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
oh there would be there's like something funny

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
that's the big panic I think that's the big

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
there's a big fundamental question in comedy which is

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
like are we

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
just gonna pat ourselves in the back for

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
not hating each other and

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
take a 10%

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
skim off the top of our pursuit

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
of maximum comedy

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I like

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
are we gonna like step things

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
down one gear for the sake of fashion

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and say

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
oh I'm cool with everybody

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and that's how you don't get booed off stage

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
in exchange

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
for that

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I'm not gonna make you clutch your sides

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I think that's the underlying fear

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
is that we would do that

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
but I think we've already done it

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
so Seinfeld is about

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
how other people are idiots because they serve you bad

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
airplane food or they are like

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
massage therapists but they don't

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
rub your body enough or whatever

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
she's a wrong rubber

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
she rubs you wrong

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and Louie and

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Marin and

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I would say this current

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
experience we're having right here

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
comedy is about how we are idiots

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
no it used to be about how other people are idiots

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
it's about how we are idiots

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
and so that's one direction that it's

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
gonna go in that already has gone in and

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
hey I can think I'm an idiot for a while

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
so I'm trying to crack

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
that safe because my first

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
like 15 years doing this job was

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
just like respect me

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
please

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and then thank god I'm still a woman

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
because yeah I mean

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
we got a fucking minute

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
you got tenure

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
you're gonna die reaching

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
you better believe it

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
if history is any teacher

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I mean we'll have an octopus president

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
before I'll

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
at least that octopus is honest

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
you know

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I just

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I just don't

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
trust her

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
she's a woman

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
what are you even talking about

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I'm a Hillary supporter

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
that's a whole joke

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
just want to make that clear

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
is there a

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
dare I poke into this

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
do you guys share that

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
or are you one of these wives that just votes

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
we're both super into

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
the other night I was walking out

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
and I'm really glad we're like both

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
into Hillary and both the same amount

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
because this would be very difficult

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I find

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
that she's very inspiring because she has

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
been committed to her job for such a long

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
time and committed a politician and I also

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
find that it's like very

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
convenient that she's the only politician that we

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
call a liar all the time wonder

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
what that is because it feels like

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
all politicians are kind of sex

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
ships

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
so why would she

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I wonder if there's anything

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
about her

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
that would make people so mad

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
because it's like she's like

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
has access to money which is so weird

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
for a politician

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
to have like money around them

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
because it's like every other former president

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
is just like living in poverty because they don't

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
take any money for speaking engagements

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
and it's really weird that

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
she does and I just feel like she's kind of like

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
owned by a lot of people

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
in a way that just nobody has ever been

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
owned by anybody certainly

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
not like George Washington

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
certainly not like other presidents who actually

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
owned other people

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
that happened for a fucking while

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
those people are

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
on our money

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I wonder what's different about those dudes

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
with ponytails on our money

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
and this woman who doesn't have a ponytail

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I wonder if there's anything

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
that we can

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
fucking love it

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and I

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
for my own sake set up road flares

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
because I'm not informed at all

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I think it's awesome that you guys are like

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
like I

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
because it seems like a shoe in now

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I think that the media is now engaged

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
in the business of convincing us it's going to be a

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
squeaker but it seems to me

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
that aside from people saying

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
well no one could have predicted

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
everything else that's happened

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
are the only people that are saying like

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
anything other than

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Hillary winning

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I hope I'm not putting my thumb

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
on any political scale by predicting that that's

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
just going to be the thing it just seems like

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
that's going to be the thing and I've been kind of

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
careful for different reasons

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
in the past I've been just

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
a jaded asshole and said politics don't matter

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
because the bipartisan system is full of shit in the past

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
this election

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I'm like specifically keeping my hands

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
up out of social terror

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
in a healthy way

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
because I don't want to

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I sense that

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
to the extent that the office of the president is important

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
it's like I don't

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
want to get in an argument with anybody

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
that would be that stoked about simply

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
for the first time in all this time

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
a woman being behind that desk

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
at any cost or anything

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I also definitely don't want to be a person

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that waves that flag in the face of someone who's

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
stoked that this

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
fucking socialist creep keeper is like

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
fucking like

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
he's amazing too

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
he seems like a stand up guy

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and is saying shit that a politician should stay

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
he seems like a fan of drones

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and so does she

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but there are politicians

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
the one thing

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
that did make me kind of

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I was like oh wait, okay

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I can be into a Hillary

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
thing

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
just watching what's happened over the last five

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
months is like

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
oh shit, all of this goes back to us voting for

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
a black guy eight years ago

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
the bipartisan system is collapsing

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
because we elected a black guy

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
let's elect a woman and see how much further

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
we can take

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
what is getting worse for women

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I don't know if you remember anything called black lives matter

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
that was particularly tipped off by somebody named

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Barack Obama having some power

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
and so then everybody was like we're really

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
out of all these black people

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and the Republicans got so mad that we elected a black guy

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I didn't fucking like

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
what's happening where are we

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I mean even the Democrats are mad

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
because if you think back to the 2008

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
primary in West Virginia

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
West Virginia went for Hillary Clinton

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
in 2008

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and then just in 2016

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Bernie Sanders

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
so what does that mean

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I don't know

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
what does delegate mean

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I don't know

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
let's start with the basics

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
what is a vote

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
is Florida the one shaped like a shoe

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I don't

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
no it's shaped like a dick, you should know it

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
no I don't

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I'm too focused on my own dick shaped dick

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I'm like why aren't you more Florida shaped

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
why do you look

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
like fucking like Rhode Island

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
dumb

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
oh okay

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
oh because it's a small estate

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you fucking asshole

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
damn

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I was actually thinking of my actual

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
dick shape

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
take that home with you

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I wasn't going with size

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I was like why are you like a fucking

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
like

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
just a sliver of

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
territory

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
on a bloated

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
overfunded

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
hairy continent

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
you know

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Dan I just feel like it's important to say

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
because I can tell

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
uncomfortable this audience is

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
that

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
you know I

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
think that

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
alright well how about this

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
fiscal, the stuff you're saying about Bernie Sanders

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
that he would change

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
our financial system in this country

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
wait when did I say that

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
are you saying that he's saying stuff that politicians should say about money

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
no dude

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
okay listen

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I thought like let's

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
really lay out an accurate landscape

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I know

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
10 minutes worth of information

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
about every single candidate

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
in totality

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
and like most of us I know an unfortunate amount

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
about Donald Trump because that's all we talk

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
about and all we're fascinated with

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and then I have these slivers of things

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
that I kind of just pick up culturally

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
from my friends and I don't know

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
please don't make the mistake of thinking that I would

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
my objective this

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
time around I'm going to vote my conscience

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
and there's no

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
reason for me to lie about it

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
well I'm going to

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I think it's going to be a choice between the fucking

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Republican and Democrat

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
if that's the case

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I'll vote for her

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I'm not going to enact some weird rebellion

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
although I don't think anyone's a bad person for doing that

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
just to weave in our lesson

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
certainty is the enemy

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I think one of the big problems

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
with our system

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I think the reason it's become the way it is

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
we're so successful

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
as a nation that

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
voting is just sort of like this

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
gravy it's not like it doesn't

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
as much as we feel it's important

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
like it's not the same as in a third world

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
country where it's like one guy

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
works for Nike and the other guy

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
who grew up down the street from me

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
and he got us fascinated

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Nike it is

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
the election is never

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
the stakes aren't that high in an empire

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
where it's just and so we've

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
sophisticated the process

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and it's gotten to the point where

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
we spend two years before the elections

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
treating the elections

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
like a reality show including

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
everyone talking about who you're going to vote for

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
who you're going to vote for

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
and a lot like praying

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
it kind of removes the

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
important part of what voting

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
is when you're kind of doing it

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
publicly and thinking about it

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
as a team versus a team

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
and what inevitably happens is that

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
oh well it's always going to turn

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
into two giant fucking blobs

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
shouting at each other

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and the real victims are the people who would

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
otherwise just go that's cool

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
but I

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
like I feel this way

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
and like for those people

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I feel the political tragedy in the United States

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
is that those people are told invariably

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
what you're doing right now

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
whether it's not giving a shit

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
or giving a shit about the wrong thing

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
is equal to giving a shit about Donald Trump

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
because

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
because if she was to delegate me

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
he retakes Ontario

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
then Ontario could take that castle bond

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
that would be amazing

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I think you're right about

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
so much of what you're saying

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I just would say that

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
as a woman

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
it would mean so much to me

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
to have a female president

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
and I also like her

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
but I also feel that it is very offensive

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
when people say that you cannot vote for someone

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
because they're a woman

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
because that doesn't make me a single issue voter

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
because I'm a woman on every single issue

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and I really think that right now we're living

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
in a very scary time for women

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
this last week

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Oklahoma possibly making abortion a felony

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
like we will never be equal

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
in a country where abortion rights

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
can possibly be taken away

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and there's so much at stake right now for women

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
in terms of economic justice

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
in terms of reproductive justice

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and we're living it like this real crossroads

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
of the opposite reaction

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
if you're feeling that offense

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
the insinuation that the only reason you're voting

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
is for this or that

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
you can imagine the force you're pushing up against

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
which is somebody who's saying

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Jesus Christ I've never felt more ashamed in my life

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
for being a woman than the day that I decided

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
to vote for somebody based on whether or not

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
they were going to make a good

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
that's another reason why I feel like

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
really really loathe to bring

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
my weird Heisenbergian penis

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
into the whole fucking thing

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
way more than it's like

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
it should matter more to

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I don't even want to fucking get involved

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I feel like a weird Tom Cruise character

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
coming into the fray

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I'm something explaining to someone

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
no matter what I'm saying

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
well you know what, cheers then

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
if that's how you feel then cool

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
then you've achieved

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
because it should be important to you that a woman gets elected

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and I don't want it to like

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
we're living in a time right now

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
and this is a great thing

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
because intelligent women could be standing

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
in a bar

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
and I could like them both equally

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
and they could be fucking

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
really mad at each other right now

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and saying fucked up things

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
insinuating that

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
they don't think

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
about their vote the right way

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and it's like for me to come in

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I'm like I'm not going to make this situation

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
better

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
it's ultimately going to come down to

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Pepsi vs Coke

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
you know

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I can take this one out, it's only four years

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
what I'm trying to say

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
is that I recognize

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I definitely don't

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
don't mistake me for a person that's like

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
don't mistake me for the kind of person

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
you wouldn't like

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I did it

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
there's a trans lady

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
with a key to my house

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I think don't mistake me

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and I respect your right to vote

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
for who you're going to vote for

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I'm Mr. Shmoo

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
don't mistake me

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
for a person you wouldn't like

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
is the rallying cry of comic

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
that's our whole thing

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
are you laughing now

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
at the things I'm saying

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
how about the tweets I'm saying out of my twitter phone

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
that's my honest position

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
that's the most honest I could get

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I honestly just want people to like me

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and I honestly don't care about

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
healthcare right now

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and I don't have a skin

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
in the game of women's

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
reproductive rights

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I can tell you where I stand

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
if somebody asked me to back up a tweet

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I have very little skin in that game too

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I mean

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
like Ria has never mind

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
what?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I was just going to say like never mind

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
the most honest position for me to take right now

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
is to say I'm fucking under informed

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and I just want people to like me

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
and I want my friends to not hate each other

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
especially my chick friends

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
because they're also cool

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
well you know I would say

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
that I can sense the discomfort from the audience

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
and I would just

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
that is the thing that feels weird to me

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
is that people are uncomfortable talking about this stuff

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
because I actually think that's our boundary

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
if we can't talk about how it feels to be on either side

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
then we're lost

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
that's when people solidify their issues

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
is when nobody can talk

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
when people have to resort to name calling

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I love the conversation we're having

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
cheers to whatever's happening for you

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
and whatever emotional journey you're going on

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I know you thought this was a comedy show

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I'm so sorry

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
but I really feel like

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
we should be muddling through this

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
this is stuff we should be talking about

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
we should be talking about the fact that

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
we have had a black president for the first time

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and what did that mean

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and we should be talking about all of these issues

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
like conversation is what

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
is what we need

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
like that's the answer to everything

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
we need to say for the other side

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
of that issue

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
well, yeah, but then there's the whole

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
draw a wall between that

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and the point of view like

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
yeah, but that's boring

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
because what

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I'm going to project on to them

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
a tremendous amount of

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
whether they're Hillary or Bernie supporters

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
and

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
hats off to Kyle

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
our Trump supporter

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
in the back

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
don't be shy

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
you're out there

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I project on to them

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
a Dan Harmonish

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
kind of like overriding

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
thing of like

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
yeah, but if we start

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
if we really, it's like hard

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
to escape that gravity of that

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
thing where I honestly

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
honest to God

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
just in like your passion

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
for Hillary as a candidate

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
there was

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
everyone loves and

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
speak for myself

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I respect and love you

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
we love each other

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
hey

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
fuck

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I respect

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I want you to like me and I like you

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
and I want to reward you

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
for your honesty and encourage

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I'd never want to punish you

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
or anything like that

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
so I'm using that overriding principle

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
in you

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
so I can sense

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
the Hillary thing like

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
there's shit on the line for you

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and I can sense your joy and your glee

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
and part of what comes with that meal

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
is just a little fucking chutney

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
of like fucking

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
spite

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
and if I just focus on that and go

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
what the fuck is this

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
did you just fucking imply

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
that I don't fuck with the boy

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
it's like I don't want

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
what the conversation kind of is

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
we all focus on each other's chutney

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
it's the grey alien in your bed

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
fuck

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
you were going to say that no matter what I said

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
yeah

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
you had that locked and loaded

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
was I then

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
hey Heath do you enjoy directing great minds

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
oh god I enjoy

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
directing great minds

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
more than I love sitting up here

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
is a heteronormative cisgendered

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
male

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
hearing about that

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
no I'll live in it and I'll say

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I would happily vote for Elizabeth Warren

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
oh no like seriously

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
vote for yourself on that

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
we don't even want to open that can of words

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I don't you're exactly right

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
nor can I

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
but I will say it has nothing to do with

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Hillary's gender that I don't want to vote for

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
if it didn't have anything to do with Hillary's gender

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
you wouldn't say Elizabeth Warren

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
no I would I'm normalizing

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
that as the variable

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I have so much to read

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
anyway

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I'm going to vote for

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
you're sweating so hard all over you

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
great minds

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
tell us about this show

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
it's wonderful

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
now you're just where is the way I can

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
sled the knife in like where's the chink in the air

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
no I don't want to murder you

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I would like to educate you

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I'll vote for I'm going to vote for

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I'm going to vote for

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
look what I did I changed you

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
you did

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
with sadness and earnestness

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
look we're all going to vote for her

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
we're going to have to

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
but like just for a minute

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
taking a minute to just acknowledge

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
the fact that I maybe

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
just shamed you into that

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and like how that's beautiful too

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
congratulations

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
as a woman that's so beautiful

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I have that power I feel like

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
yeah

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I got you to

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
second hand I got you to open that button

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
you're welcome

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
yeah as a cisgender

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
straight male

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
how much is that

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
perfect

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I do want to know

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I want to look back at your

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I'll talk about great minds in a second

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
but I do want to look at your retweets

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
because the great irony of this whole thing

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
on the quote

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
of everybody should be nice

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
and just talk about the issue

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
is like you got a retreat by Rush Limbaugh

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
and Donald Trump

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
and like these horrible people they're like

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
yes we should be nice

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
meanwhile they're popping Vicodin and screaming

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
about shouting people down

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
you use the pronoun you and I don't know

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
the retweet

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I just want to look at the list of retweets

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
you got on your retweet

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I was kind of amazed it was like

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
sure some of them are sensitive

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
in the movie

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I was present

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
but I just mean the irony

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
among the

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
apatow or whoever retweeted

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
the progressive minded people

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
you would expect to retweet

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
let's disagree about the thing at hand

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and be nice to each other while we do it

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
also total dick faces

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
like Trump and Rush Limbaugh

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
also retweeted it

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
we should do that

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
that's why I'm losing you

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
the tweet that I retweeted was a guy saying

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
he was

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
it was a correspondent or whatever you call him

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
a pundit just saying like oh we've lost

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
yes I got okay

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
right and then you have an asshole who is

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
we've lost the capacity to entertain the humanity

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
of a person that disagrees with us

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
that's me paraphrasing

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
are you being literal did Rush Limbaugh

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
retweet on that?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I would be interested to look at who retweeted

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
your thing

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I'm all caught up I'm all caught up

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
well yes from the past

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
he has a twitter feed

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
everyone would agree Hitler and Jesus

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
would both agree

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
do one to others

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
some things are so true

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I couldn't agree more

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
but I think we all know what Hitler would do to Jesus

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
too soon

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
too soon

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
too soon

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
listen I'm trying to give you jokes

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
are they

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
extremely

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
contentious jokes

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
yes they are

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
but Jesus was also murdered

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
that's one of the main facts

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
about Jesus

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
if you just figured out now

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
that Jesus might have been murdered you missed

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
the whole point of Jesus

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
spoiler alert

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
he dies

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
that guy did not make it

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
he pulled the rock away and that's what we celebrate

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Easter

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
and it was shaped like an egg

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
it was shaped like an egg shaped

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
oh my god

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
easy to push

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
great minds

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
what do they call that a murder's row

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
of

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
great minds

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
please talk to us about this show

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
you guys have just made it

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
we finished it today

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
congratulations

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
wonderful

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
is that the phrase you say a murder's

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
row and it's like when it's a hit list of

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
awesome people or something

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
it was a murder's row

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I think it originated with a row of people who were

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
good at murdering

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
like not in cells

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
there was just a row

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
just like murderers

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
like to stand next to each other

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I don't know if you know this

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm imagining like a bench at a basketball game

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
but it's just murder

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
do you think murderers like to stand next to each other

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
because they can tell who else is a murderer

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
or do you think there's a crazy thing

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
where murderers have

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
evolved to project a non-murderous

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
pheromone

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
so all murderers chain together

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
they have a hydrophobic head

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and a hydrophilic tail

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
so they naturally chain together

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
it's like an amino acid

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
that's what I'm talking about

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
no science on the weekends

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
the murder is always like

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
just recognizing the murder behind you

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
and you think it's talking to you

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
always the murder behind me

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
so embarrassing

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
where the hell did you pull that out of your

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
hydrophilic hydrophobic

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
that's on the tape of his tongue

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
cell membranes it's not exactly rockets

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
don't take

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
they're impressed with me

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
for one second people are impressed with me

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
she's a science person

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
no I wasn't impressed

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I was surprised

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
fine

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
and you're like that's not a surprise

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
it's like a squirrel trap

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
dual layer phospholipid membrane

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
embedded with proteins

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I love you and that's why I poked your belly

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
yeah I got the key to his house

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
okay small talk

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
small talk

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
go

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
nice weather

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
okay so

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I'm really bad at

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
just interacting with people

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
we mischaracterize it as small talk

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
we have this thing where we go

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
oh there's small talk

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
where you say these

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
no one ever has a small talk conversation where you go

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
oh it's nice weather

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
everyone is always trying as hard as they can

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
to kind of connect

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
sometimes you're just trying to

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
like get away

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
that's true

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
you're biting your time until it's politically

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
possible to get away smoothly

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I'm always trying to do that

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
when I sense that I'm not going to be good in the conversation

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
like

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
do you regularly

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
have conversations with people who you can sense

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
are actually doing everything

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
on paper right

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
like they're being effusive

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
they're being complimentary

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
they're being

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
open

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
they're technically saying things

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
that are like oh I like

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
your jacket

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
not to make it

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
all superficial

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
are you often finding yourself going

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
like yeah but I don't

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
that doesn't set me up to say anything except for yes or no

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
and I feel weird like I have a script

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
and I don't fucking hate this

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
it doesn't happen often but I've

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
built my career around avoiding

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
those sorts of situations

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
you do it

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
you refuse great opportunities sometimes

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
so that

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
you have a career that has some integrity

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
hey Jane

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
what field are you in

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
just vaguely

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I'm a research scientist

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
so I feel like you could avoid social interaction

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
for a while

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I've spent a lot of years

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
avoiding positions of

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
managerial responsibility

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
or if I go to

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
an event

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
big quotes

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
just stand around

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
looking really uncomfortable

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
which is very easy

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
if someone approaches you

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
quickly go into a jargon filled

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
explanation of something

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
so that they then feel uncomfortable and leave you alone

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I have a lot of outlets

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
that's a great way of dealing with that

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I love that

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I should have paid attention

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
don't worry about it I got this side

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
but your side got the great way

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
of dealing with something

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
god damn it

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
are you an introvert

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
or an extrovert

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Dan Harmon

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I don't think

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I don't see the world through that dichotomy

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
we're back to certainty

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
well first of all I love that

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
that got around with applause

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
from like four people just like that

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
they like callbacks

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
they don't like politics

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
they like callbacks

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I also like thinking about a population of people

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
that are like their main oppressive

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
boxes are introvert and extrovert

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
that you just like

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
you like just hit on them

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
they're just like ah we could give a fuck about this Hillary Clinton shit

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
like race, max, transgender shit

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
don't give a fuck about it

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
introvert extrovert

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
yeah Myers-Briggs test

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I fucking hate the Myers-Briggs

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
because because because

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
you would prefer a bathroom that didn't have urinals then

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
yes I would like there to not be

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
that is awesome as a follow-up

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I think that's a weird thing to do to people

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
to make the P next to each other

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
or everything we do should be next to each other

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
we should poop next to each other

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
we should like high five while we're pooping

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
or we should get this P thing

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
separated

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
so growing up in Los Angeles

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
one of the things I remember as a child

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
was my dad dragging me to the bathroom at Dodger Stadium

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
and having to pee in a fucking trough

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
there was a trough in the bathroom today

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I almost washed my hands in it

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
because they also had urinals

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
they had urinals

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and next to it was a different

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I almost washed my hands in it

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I almost washed my hands in it

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I'll have this stainless steel urinal

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
gay people

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
we were at a gay bar

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I'm assuming that's not a gay thing

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
no it's not

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I think it's just a weird toad thing

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
that's how you have sex

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
the P goes down

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
you have sex with each other

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and then you have sex with each other

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
that's the sexiest gesture

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
to describe it ever

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
pee up and down

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
that's it

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
would you google gay people

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
while

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
wait where were we

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
oh pee troughs

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I think that's an important thing to say

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I think

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
my demo

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
my audience

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
it is important to them

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
maybe this makes us children

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
maybe this makes us geniuses

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
maybe it makes us wandering idiots

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
that are satisfied to be idiots

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
maybe that makes us geniuses

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
maybe that makes us the biggest idiots of all

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
but I think we are

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
really really super caught up

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
with the fundamental line

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
between do I

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
need people

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
or do I actually resent them

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
it's something that

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I own that

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I have

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
all of my formative experiences

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
they have to do with

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
this weird relationship between

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
oh god I hope everyone likes me

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
oh I'm meeting this person

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and I don't know what to do when I meet them

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
and I need them so bad

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
and it's so explosively uncomfortable

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
that the wiring

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
goes through me in a different way

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
and I try to calculate

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
my relationship with other people

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
and I'm trying to

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
but at the same time my heart explodes

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
with need from other people

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
and it's like that is like

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
it's not to be taken lightly

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
and I do think that people that feel

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
that kind of intensely kind of assume

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
you know this Hillary versus Bernie thing

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
that is very important

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
but whether this is a selfish

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
or luxurious or privileged

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
like statement it's sort of like

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
with what I'm going through

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
that's the kale salad

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
the height is like who should run the country

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
whoever is fucking running it

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
they're gonna be fucking neurotypical

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
and they're gonna make my life a living hell

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
like they're not gonna get me

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
and no one and neither is

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
90% of everybody and I'm gonna always

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
spend my life pushing up against

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
plexiglass and going like hey can anyone over there

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
hear me and if you can hear me

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
do you think I'm cool and if I say

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
do you think I'm cool a little bit less

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
will you think I'm cool so I'll fake it

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
if you want me to fake it I'm gonna do it

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
because I know that's cool so I will

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
halfway turn I'll give you a full

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Hitchcock profile and say does anyone

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
think I'm cool

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
do you think I'm cool I fucked it up again

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
god damn it I leaked Chevy Chase's voice mail

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I did it but I was like

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
oh who thought I'll turn my full back to you

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I'm a hermit psych

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
do you like the hermit thing

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
like I do wanting and needing

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and not wanting and not needing

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
and like actually and also on the other side of it

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
like people feeling their needs

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
walking into a room and being able

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
to read all of their fucking

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
like deficits and liabilities

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
and assets and like

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
you just can compile them

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
in an instant and you just read their

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
minds and it's like

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
oh how do I react to this piano roll of a

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
conversation it's a struggle

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
how do you alleviate that pain

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
liquor

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
not voting not voting

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
voting

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
it's like Easter it's like

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
oh who hid the eggs

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
okay I like

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
drinking that's the choice that's important

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
like

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
brown liquor white liquor yes

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I didn't so first of all

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
you didn't understand any of that no I

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
get you completely

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I understand where you're going from

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
all I meant by introvert and

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
extrovert and I love that beautiful

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
answer was it's a batteries

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
thing that's actually what I meant by it

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
like the introverts

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
they need to charge their batteries

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
themselves and extroverts charge their batteries

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
with other people I really think of

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
us as machines I mean I'm

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
a very introvert

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
yeah yeah no I'm a very introverted

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
person like I it's really

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
easy for me to talk to people behind a podium

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
or a microphone and

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
if you chatted to me in the green room while I was

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
eating string cheese which you did it would be no

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
problem and you would assume that that was easy but

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I'm very I need to like spend a lot of time on

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
myself same here in order to fill

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
my battery more but

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I don't it's different from the like or the

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Larry Sanders character where it's like oh this is

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
artifice it's like this is where we actually talk to

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
each other not to say that we don't then go talk to

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
each other backstage but then we don't we're

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
workaholics and blah blah blah okay continue

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
no that's all I meant so so I agree

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
with you there's total nuance in terms of social

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
interactions and I was just talking about

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
like hey what fills you up so that

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
you can go do your job is it time by

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
yourself or is it time with other people

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I think it's my cookie clicker game

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
right now yeah so time by yourself

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I'm talking about my friend yeah and I think

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
a lot of performers are actually people

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
that really need a focused way of spending

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
their energy for me it feels very

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
comfortable to be behind a microphone because it

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
feels very controlled I have a problem with

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
lack of control and so I've just gone to

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
we're weird machines we're just

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
we're it's spouse our galactica is real

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
as I've just gone to this weird

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
transition and another transition

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
of my life like I don't have another yeah well

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
this one better be good this one's good

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
this one's this one's I'm sorry

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
but this was much more positive and

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
much more complete I mean if you're

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
about to tell us you went from vanilla to

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
rocky road no we're gonna be like so what

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I went from research scientist at a

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
laboratory to the public

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
face of a museum

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I'll stop

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
beating that joke

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
let me elaborate so

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I went from from like

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
we called Ben Tratt I mean someone who

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
just literally spent all their time at the

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
research in research center working on

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
things I couldn't tell anybody about I did

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
that for like 16 years to being the

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
the research scientist

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
presenting the face of

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
of a museum I have to

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
lecture I have to travel around the country

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I have to do all this

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
do blogs I have to do videos

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
and stuff

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I'm an introvert I've always thought of myself

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
as an introvert but I've what I've discovered is I

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
also really like to be a teacher

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
not because I like being in front of people

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
not because I really like lecturing

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
but because I like

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
teaching people I like

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
watching the lights turn on and people's

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
eyes when they

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
that's my nectar right I mean that's the

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
thing that actually makes it worthwhile

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
but after giving a lecture some place

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I will go back to my hotel room and I will

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
curl up and I will cry

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
because it was such

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
a beastly experience for me

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
to do it

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
but in the end it was so important

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
for the people that I did it for

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
but Spencer talks

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
about like before

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
performing I cry a lot

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
and you say you

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
shut up about it

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
before you have to perform

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I get sick to my stomach

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
great when you cry though

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
but it's worth it

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
but if you do something and you know you nailed it

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
why would you curl up and cry

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
it's this weird dynamic

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
it permeates a lot of the stuff we were talking about today

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
this idea of

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
what really motivates you

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
you're motivated by the positive

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
that you're doing something good in the world

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
but you're also doing something

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
to cover up some personal pain

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
whether it's shame

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
or whether it's guilt

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
or whether it's something in your past

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
that you're always trying to do

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
what's motivating you

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
at a number of different levels

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
and for me it's shame

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I remember being a child and never being able

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
to perform well enough

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
to make people happy

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
what are you expressing when you go home

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
when you go to the hotel

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
absolute fatigue

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
but also this overwhelming

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
sense of

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
did I actually do well

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
did I

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
everybody's telling me that

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
that's a loss of identity

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
exactly yeah

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
because you don't even know

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
because it's so out of kilter

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I signed to myself

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
and you have no recourse to integrity

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
because you're like oh am I just a floating

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
like fucking cloud of

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I hope everyone likes me

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
or learns from me or whatever

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
and if that's the case wouldn't I function

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
just as well in the 3rd Reich

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
as I do here in this environment

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
and therefore what am I

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
that hasn't crossed my mind

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
well it should you fucking Nazi

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
I'm standing by ground

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
and I say I was kidding

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
it's a post-Louis CK world

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
the comedy should be drier

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I'm not gonna crack

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
and say I'm kidding

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
except that you'll now find me curled up

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
in a bedroom in your house

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
oh god it's gonna be my house

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
it's in your house

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I'll be in en suite

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
in your

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
and what if the pillowcases from the guest room

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
get mixed up with the master bedroom pillowcases

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
and your tears

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
of my certainty somehow get into my pores

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
like three weeks from now

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
and I don't even know why

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
but I'm having an extra girlfriend-hitty dream

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
okay not a funny callback

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I didn't know that's where that was going

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
it went all the way

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
you guys are like well there's

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Dot connecting in the 3rd act of a show

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
and then there's The Wire

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
where you just

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
now it all makes sense

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
and yeah Dan

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I thought your show was The Wire

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
we're not

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
just tired and wanting to go home

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and watch Game of Thrones

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
alright well

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
it's getting about that time

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Jane are you gonna watch Game of Thrones

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
with Cody and I

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I've never watched an episode of Game of Thrones

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
perfect time to jump in

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
you'll know who everybody is

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
yeah just get in tonight

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
you won't miss a thing

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
yo straight up there's this chick

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
she's trying to not have a face

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
don't worry about it

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
you'll figure it out

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
it's intuitive

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
is the short guy who's a good actor

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
is he still

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
is he a good actor relative to all people

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
he's a dragon

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
are the dragons? I like dragons

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
he's a dragon now

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
he turned into one last episode

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
get it in the recap don't worry about it

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
there's three dragons one is castrated

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
and can't be burnt

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
he's taken over

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
the wall

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
the wall is south of King's Landing

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
and is covered with an umbrella

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
called the Unsullied

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and I think a major point

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
just to remember is if there's a male character

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
and this does exist in a very gender

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
dichotomy

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
if there's a male character

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
not a lot of trans characters which is weird

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
although I guess like Bran of Tarth maybe

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
my point is if there's a male character

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
she's definitely gender queer

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
shit going on which I

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I want to get on her shoulders

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
and I want to go somewhere

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
she could carry you easily

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
right

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
just because she has a crush on

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
you can be straight

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
gender queer

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
gender queer is not a sexual orientation

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
it is the way you present yourself in the world

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
we have to decouple those two things

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
which is what I was doing

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
but also I love that that was your limit

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
like watching what people's limits are

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
two hours and like

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
go fuck yourself

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
she likes that other guy

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
that is the first time you brought up Game of Thrones

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
she's a lady and I have no idea what was happening

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
there but she obviously was like

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
no wait a minute don't tell me I'm fucking anything

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
other than the most awesome person in the world

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
for consuming this material

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
it's got

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
well I was

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
what's his name

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Baldi von Unich

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
he's a spider

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
didn't he establish

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
at one point that even before

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
they involuntarily

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
uniked him

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
he was kind of asexual

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
hasn't been hinted at that

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
honestly Dan that's a great point

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
it's not a good point and you're being sarcastic

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
you're using lesbian sarcasm

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
that is the face

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
of lesbian sarcasm to be fair

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I've heard about it

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
my mom warned me about it

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I read some backstory

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
stuff on him he was like

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
was he mailed to someone in a box

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
we don't know what's going on

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
remember when you got mailed that guy in the box

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
and they just drove to that

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
this doesn't sound like a positive trans role model

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
well what I was gonna say

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
is also like if you're watching a male character

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
and they're on screen like some shit might happen

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
they might fight

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
you don't know if you're watching a female character

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
some stuff's gonna go down

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
right quick

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
that's really true

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
that's really

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
you're saying that two dudes in Game of Thrones

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
can meet without one of them stabbing the other one in the gut

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
well they can have side conversations

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
we're like what are you getting

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
are you coming to see these whores? I am

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
have you raped lately?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
what are you doing?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
are we up here by this wall?

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
you don't watch Game of Thrones

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
she thinks it takes place in the 20s

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Boardwalk Empire

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I know that accent

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
they're like what now?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
notice from the wall

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
there's giants beyond the wall

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
there's like

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Tamini Hall

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
we haven't had the $5 plug

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
from Jeff because he's not here

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
but that was worth $5

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
for the people who don't have the podcast

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
thank you

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I don't know

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
what you're talking about

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
it was very visual

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I'm gonna assume

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
that

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I find myself

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
when I'm watching Game of Thrones

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
the limited extent to which I'm

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
scanning for

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
like a

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
female abuse

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
in terms of

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
which characters have status

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I kind of feel like

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I'm not gonna throw out

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
a word like equal

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
because I think the world is kind of honestly primitive

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
and

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
intentionally not

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
but within that context

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
it seems like oh jeez

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
for a soap opera set in a world

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
where

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
everyone without a dick is weaker

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
than everyone with a dick

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
within that context

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
there's a heck of a lot of

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
agency

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
of female characters

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
that you're watching them make choices

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and affect their power

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
obviously there are people in this

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
show that have power on all sides

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
I'm loving me that little

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
faceless Arya Stark

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
a girl has no name please

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I know your name but my point is

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
let's agree on one thing that shit got boring

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I had

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
it sacked

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
it sacked for a while

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I will say that the moment where I stopped

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
diligently watching this show was when

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Joffrey like

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
fucked a woman

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
this is seasons ago

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I'm assuming based on the looks

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
of all of you that

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
you're caught up

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
rape spoiler alert

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
he uses a crossbow on a lady

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
and it's like

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
it's like

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
it's as if

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
somebody bought

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
croissant in the morning

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
it's a very side of like

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
there's no plot point to it

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
it's just happening

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
you felt like

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
were you a sopranos fan

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I'm trying to think of other shows

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
do women get killed in shows

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
they do

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
well the decidedly

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
random

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
seemingly totally

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
unattributed acts of totally

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
random violence

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
in my mind

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
because I'm not

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
definitely a different perspective

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
all I ever perceive is I go

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
man part of what makes this show really great

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
is that you never fucking know

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
like literally Peter

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Dinklage could die in the next episode

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
and they'd be like

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
dude we told you don't assume

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
that's like a valuable thing

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
in a show where we're conditioned

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
that's my

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
privileged like consumption

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
of that frosting as I go

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
all I'm perceiving is hey I don't know

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
what's gonna happen next oh she got raped

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
and you're perceiving it from a different perspective

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
or you're like

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
oh yeah that's the eighth rape

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
yeah I kind of feel like women can be

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
powerful without having to have

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
a reason that they became powerful which was their rape

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
and that happens a lot in that show

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
where they're like we're gonna make

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
sure this woman can be powerful somebody

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
attack her

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
and I just think like ladies got that shit

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
already and it statistically

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
happens to a lot of us so it ain't no entertainment

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
the source material

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
at which that series is based

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
that gentleman

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
could have created a world

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
in which by coincidence

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
as well if you can fart smoke

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
that kills a guy

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
he theoretically could have created

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
a world where

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
women and men

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
that power shift

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
does not exist

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
it's just hard to watch it's not even like I have

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
some huge political statement where I'm

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
sitting there going like this doesn't

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
match my Hillary Clinton love

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
there's nothing to it's just

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
hard to watch that stuff I have to

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
fast forward through it's just not fun

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
too it doesn't feel like

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
oh the stakes are really

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
being ramped up now I just don't want to look at

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
and also those actors it's actually also

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
that I feel for those actors who have to go through

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
the gals who are like

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
that's their job on that day and they have to be like

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
like there's a whole crew you know

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
like you do this job enough and you know that

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
there's like a whole crew and that like they got to

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
set that morning it was a five o'clock in the morning

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
they're in like Ukraine or whatever and they were like

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
okay so it's like a closed

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
set because like Sansa's gotta be news

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
and it's like a whole crew

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
yeah it's just it really

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
stresses me out there is a distinct

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
lack of dangling dong

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
in that show right

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I love to look at

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
this on screen because I want to know what's going on

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
how are they attached

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I don't

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
mostly crazy

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
you guys know

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
double-sided tape

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
if this is a spoiler fuck you

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
you're welcome

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
after what's this fuck

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
boring guy

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
kid Harrington comes back to life

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
and beardy pants

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
like

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
the thought balloon over Dan Harmon's head

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
that guy character of the Wildlings

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
big Popeye

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
when he like

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
he goes like they think you're a god

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
they think you came

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
back to life

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
what do you think

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I've seen your dick

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
nobody

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
his magic could have a dick like that

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
that's small

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Cody

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
as fate would have it because of like trying to

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
catch up and falling asleep and stuff

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
we watched that scene twice and the second

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I was like I watched and he said that

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
nobody could have a dick like that

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
and I was like alright come on

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
and Cody was like that's what

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
you said last time I didn't remember

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
because I was drunk

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I was like that's funny

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
that's the extent of where Game of Thrones

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
is abrading my sexuality

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
is that

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
one barbarian said to some emo guy

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I think your dick is

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I saw your dick and it's small

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
and I'm like take it easy

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Game of Thrones

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
not cool

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
we're not dick shaming

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
alright

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I believe dragons are here

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I love those titties

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I got all the swords and the sorcery

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
is there a Rhode Island equivalent

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
in the Game of Thrones

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
but let's not live in a world

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
where a man can just fucking like

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
let's not use this genre as license

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
to abuse

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I think we agree on that

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
if

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I was magic and could come back

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I'd have any kind of dick I wanted though

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
if I couldn't be killed

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
that's not how it works

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
it's not Starman

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
same body

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
that's the thing that offended me

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
if you had bypass surgery

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
and the surgeons were like his dick small

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
it's not cool

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
meanwhile in rape country

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
are you done raping Mike

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
no I'm behind a shift

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
alright I'll help you later

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
and then TV guide complains

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I'm like what's the world coming to

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
is that how popchips are made

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
do you order them

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I'm not stupid

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
wealth hasn't changed me

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I know popchips come from the store

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
