You love him.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:58.000\nHe has his own on the microphone.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nYeah!\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:05.000\nOh, yeah. Good. How are you?\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nI don't know where I'm from.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nThis thing's fucking with me.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nYeah, you're robotic.\n\n01:11.000 -->

31st every day.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nEven though it's after May.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:18.000\nI'm so Irish.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nThis is, uh, right.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:26.000\nIt's on the floor.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nOkay.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nThanks for coming downtown tonight.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:37.000\nYeah!\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\nI'm decked out in...\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nSchrabs activating the Votron.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nI'm decked out in Sponsored Ship.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nWho sent us those, Dan?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nThis is a Mi-1Z.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:53.000\nThis is what I'm wearing.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nMi undies!\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:56.000\nCome on, man.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nI mean, what the...\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nHe's trying again.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nDo you want people to be able to understand me?\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nI can understand you.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nThey can understand me.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nLike, I don't know the...\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nWho can't understand what he's saying?\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nYeah.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nWe don't know what that means.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:16.000\nI just wanted to see it work.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nI've been gone a while.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nDid you notice?\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nYeah.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:28.000\nThe view is amazing.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nYou'll see a four-leaf clover in front of you.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nShould I point at it?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:40.000\nOh, that's not nice.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nIt's 2019.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:42.000\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nWe can't be doing that.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nIt just...\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nThis is awful.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nYou're an awful person.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nPaid for his Uber.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nMaybe that's why that happened.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nYou know, you got to earn it.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nEven though I did, I did tell him to do it as well.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nJust go in.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nBackstage.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nDiscussing Mike Gags.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nI hate him.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nI hate him so much.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:15.000\nI'm wearing a Muwanzi, and I'm...\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nSharp put his mic in a mug.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nAnd I'm drinking out of...\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nWhat is it called?\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nBrumate brand drinkware.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:29.000\nBRU with an Umlaut M-A-T-E.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nHey, Brumate is the drinkware for me.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nGuys, why is that a different type of drinkware?\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nBecause Brumate keeps drinks at the perfect temperature.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:45.000\nWhatever that is, that's the one it does,\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nwhich I suppose is like context aware.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:53.000\nSo the first AI-powered drinkware.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nYeah, I guess...\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nI mean, I guess I put some ice in it backstage,\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nand it's not melted yet.\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nYeah.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nYeah.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nI do like that they disguised it as a piece of wood.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nYeah, it's like a little baby coconut.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nIt does look very nice.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nAll right.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:11.000\nWell, there's not a lot to talk about.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nI did have an epiphany.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nI think if you wanted to run somebody against Trump\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\njust to beat Trump, which I don't think is the right philosophy,\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:22.000\nI think we should vote our conscience and just let him win.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nI just focus on the Senate.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nI mean, I just don't know how you're going to...\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:32.000\nWe, and by we, I mean every non-Nazi,\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nwe're a divided people.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nAnd we should be, you know, who's United Nazis.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt's easy.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nYou just go like, oh, I love that uniform.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nIt's fine.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nYou don't have to...\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nAnd they can be like, well, are you a gay Nazi?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nYou can be like, yeah.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nAnd they're like, come on in.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nJust pretend you're not gay.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nAnd you can be like, OK, yeah, that's fine.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nIt's easy.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nThat's what we're fighting when we fight autocracy.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nWe fight whatever we perceive as the bad guys.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nSo, of course, the toughest times you're going to be divided.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nYou're not going to win the election.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nAnd I'm not going to talk about politics for the next two years\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nbecause it's going to get real ugly with all this primary stuff.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nYou're going to be friends.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nYou're going to be yelling at each other.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nIt's going to break my heart.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.000\nI don't want...\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nIt's the worst thing.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nI kept out of it when we were leading up to the thing\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nwith the Bernie's and the Hillary's and stuff.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:21.000\nI saw it.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nWell, I just said nothing.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nI just said nothing.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nBut one of those sides was wrong.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:33.000\nAlso, there was a little bit of a shell shock the first time.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nYou were like, Jesus, this is crazy.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nSo you had to talk about it worse.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nNow you're like, oh, it's all fucked up still.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nBut even I...\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nLook, I'll talk all day for the last two years.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nI was like, oh, God, this is awful.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nTo me, it's not even politics.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nBut what am I supposed to do in this show?\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nExcept share my life.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd if I happen to be obsessed with fucking, oh, God,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\nwhat's happening?\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nPretend I'm interested in frozen pizza for two years\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nand be like...\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nAnd it's just like...\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nThe only people that want that are...\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nI'm not saying they're bad people,\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nbut I'm not even saying they're wrong\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nbecause I don't want to listen to a year and a half of podcasts\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nwhere I'm so fucking bummed out and freaked out\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nand what are we going to do?\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nI don't want to listen to that.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nBut tough titties.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nIf the world is ending, then I'm like,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\noh, this is what I thought about today.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nI thought about the world ending.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nHowever, because I have a lot of anxieties,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nas I did during the last time,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nwas like, oh, primaries are gearing up.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nI was like, there's no way.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.000\nI'm not touching it.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'm not touching this stuff.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nBecause it's too sad.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nBecause you're talking about people\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nthat shouldn't beef with each other.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:51.000\nIt's like a socialist and watered-down liberals\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nshouldn't...\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:56.000\nThey cannot like each other about where to go for breakfast.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nThey shouldn't be tearing each other's throats out\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nwhile the guys I perceive as the bad guys\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nare laughing all the way to the fucking victory line.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nBut there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nYou can't demand that we unite\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nbecause if you could demand that we unite,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nwhat are you?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nProbably a Nazi.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nNot on it.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nIt's like, who has the power to do that?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nThey'd be like, oh, everybody, no matter what you think,\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nlay your shit aside.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nBut anyway, this is the one thing I'll say.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nThis is an epiphany.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nHere's who you run against, Donald Trump.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nIf you're playing that game where you just want to knock him out,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nlike, oh, who are we going to run?\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nLiam Neeson.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nDid it.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nYeah.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nThink about it.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nYou're going to knock his base in half.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nOld white guy, so then they're confused.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd then he's racist.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nSo they're like, I love it.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nBut we only know he's racist because he was honest about it.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nHe was like, I used to be racist.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nI don't want to be.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd then some people are going to be like,\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\noh, that's kind of cooler than being secretly racist.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:05.000\nAnd then you would shuffle all the groups.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nBut I think you'd come out on the other side.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nAnd he's European.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nSo you'd have to do a reverse birther movement.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nBut that's cool.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nDo that.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nReverse birther.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nHashtag reverse birther.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nYou have to be proven where you weren't born.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nYeah.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nHe could be like, I'm not Irish.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nDo I sound Irish?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nDo I sound like a...\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nAnd then he could go on the view and be like, yeah,\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nit doesn't matter if I'm racist.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nYeah.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nIt doesn't matter if I'm racist.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd people still like him.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nThey would be like, well, what do we like about it?\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nHe could just be like, I don't care if you get an abortion.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nI don't.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nIt doesn't matter if you get an abortion.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nI don't care if you get an abortion.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nYou used to do that.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nYou used to.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nThere was an old episode where you were doing like Liam Neeson.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nAnd you were like, it doesn't matter.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:00.000\nIt's like so minstrel that you're wearing that and doing Liam Neeson.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nI saw Dan Harmon's podcast.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nThat's not cool.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nDan.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nThe green face.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nThe IRA is gonna fuck you.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nOh, come on.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nIRA.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nDon't do that.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nDan, do you...\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nI know you have opinions about things,\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:20.000\nbut do you think Spencer has enough cable for the show?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nI mean, we got like a couple of spools here.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI got 3,000 series.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nThis is 30 meters of XLR cable.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI don't think it's enough, man.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nI think you need at least...\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nWell, what's the run of this place?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nLike 50 feet, 60 feet?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nLet's walk it.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nYou do.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nOkay, you could do that.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nI want to sit.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nSpencer and I accidentally both ordered wolf urine from Amazon.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nYou know, when you show up at work,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nand you're both ordering wolf urine.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nMine came.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nWe should open it up and see if it has documentation.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nYeah, go get the...\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nLet me go meet him back.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nOh, I got a part...\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nAlso, there's a parking ticket in my jeans.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nI don't know who's supposed to take care of that.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nCertainly not me.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nYou're going to fuck up the show.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nI kind of...\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nIt's something like you can look forward to when you...\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nIf you ever...\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nLike a little privileged perk.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nLike, I kind of like...\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nI get a little stoked when I get a parking ticket.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nI'm rich.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nBecause I'm like...\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nWhat's that?\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nWhat are you trying to do to me?\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nScare me?\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nLike, take your fucking valet money.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nIt pays for a kid's textbooks.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nYeah, I bet.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nYeah, I'm sure that money goes right over to someone who needs\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\na fucking fucking fucking machine.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nI try to pay him within like 20 minutes of getting them.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nI'll drive right to the motherfucker.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nHe'll be like, how's it going?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nYeah, here.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nIt does feel like they hate that, right?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nI guess we're the suckers.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nBecause we're like so stoked about paying our parking tickets on time\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nthat we think we're like, in your face.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nAnd they're like, oh, no.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nBut for sure, they want you to not pay it right away.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nIt's like a poor people trap.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nMan, I was poor once, you guys.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd it was fucking incredible how hard...\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nIt was like, holy shit, man.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nThey designed the whole system.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nDon't get so mad that you storm my house.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:21.000\nBut I remember getting parking tickets and being like,\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nokay, well, I have a lot to do today.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd I have no assistant, let alone two.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd if I did, they can't write a check.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nIt'll bounce.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nYou're just stuck at this thing.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nI guess I'll pay this sooner or later.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nYou put it in your apartment somewhere.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nYou know that shit's like fucking gone.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nAnd they expect it to be.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nThat's what they put you on the 21 days.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nDo you guys know about there's this Terry Pratchett quote about this?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nI have it.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:54.000\nThe reason the rich were so rich was because they spent less money.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nTake boots, for example.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nVymes earned $38 a month plus allowances.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nA really good pair of leather boots cost $50.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nBut an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of okay for a season or two,\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nand leaked like hell when the cardboard cave out,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\ncost about $10.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nThose are the boots he bought and wore until the soles were so thin\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nthat he could tell where he was and ink more pork on a fucking night.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nBut the thing is that good boots lasted for years and years.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nA man who could afford $50 had a pair of boots\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nthat'd be keeping his feet dry in 10 years time while the poor man\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nwho could only afford cheap boots would have spent $100 on boots\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nin the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:36.000\nYeah, I mean, I can upgrade that in a much simpler way.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nWe live in Los Angeles where literally everyone over a certain income\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\ngets free shoes.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\nIf you work in the industry, at some point you go over to the Nike place\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nand they give you a duffle bag and you walk around and fill your bag\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nwith Nike shit.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nI've never done it because I fucking care about you.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:59.000\nThey never invited me. They never invited me.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nBut I remember when we first moved here from Milwaukee,\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:05.000\nthey called it the Free Shoes for Rich People Program.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nThat's what they call it, glibly.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nWhat was it called?\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nFree Shoes for Rich People Program.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nWhy am I repeating my show for you?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nLike, I can't expect you to pay attention.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nWhat are you doing back there?\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou're playing Minesweeper?\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nNo.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nDon't touch my ass.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:30.000\nYou know, five years from now, people are going to know that that's not cool.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nLike, it's funny now because we're both dudes or whatever.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nBut five years from now, it's going to be like,\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nwe were going to have fixed everything but that shit.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nAnd you're going to be rounded up, taken into the street and fucking Weinstein.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nBoom.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nAnd I'm going to laugh.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nI'm going to write so many brave blogs about what it was like\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nto fucking stand here and silently shudder.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:03.000\nThat sounded like I was maybe parodying victims.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nThat wasn't my intention.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nI wasn't like, then I'll do that.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nLike, those bullshit people do.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nI'm with you. I'm with you. As an abuser, I got to be with you.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nHow is it?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nYou tell me, baby.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nThat would be abuse.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:27.000\nTell me, tell me, tell me if I'm sexual, Brandon, or you're fired.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:31.000\nOh, what a beautiful man. Listen.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:35.000\nIt's going to be three years before that's not cool.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd if I tell you why two years from now, I'm going to be fired.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nBut is it keeping you warm?\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nIs it 100% cotton?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nNo, I think it might be micromodal.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nIt feels about three times softer than cotton.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nIt's breathing. I have a shirt under it.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nI'm in my unders, my regular meundies.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nI took my pants off, but I'm not getting overheated.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:07.000\nHe dropped a water bottle, sir.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nHe got it.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nDon't harass him. He's done nothing wrong.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nWelcome to the show, sir. I'm very sorry.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nLiam Neeson, do you think it's a good idea?\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nHe's foreign. I know, but just suspend your disbelief.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nDo we just found out Trump's dad's from Germany?\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nThat's got to be unconstitutional.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nThat's not illegal. Yeah, that's illegal.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:36.000\nWhat will you spend your time on instead of how do you get away from the politics?\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:39.000\nFascinating. It is crazy. The amount of shit that you're not aware.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:43.000\nLike, I don't know. Like the weird shit that you hear mentioned and you're like,\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nwhat buddy gig say what like Pete, but a gig.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:51.000\nI heard.

Mayor of the town in Indiana, something like that.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nHe seems like a cool person.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nI don't know. He seems like a centrist. What does that mean?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nCentrist? Yeah, what's that mean? It means equivocating to conservatives.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nEquivocated. Yeah, maybe that's the mall.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nI'm sure that's what that's the heartbreak are going to go through.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nOh, I love this guy and the part of your brain is going to be like, do I love him\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:26.000\nbecause it feels like he's got a shot or do I love him because yeah,\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nmy here's what I'm going to do is not my advice to anybody because I'm just going to\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:35.000\nlike, I'm just going to look quietly and be like, all right, I'm going to vote for\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nI'm going to vote for somebody.

There's a very little signal in here.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:44.000\nWell, this guy, this musician dude, he, remember that song I played?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:48.000\nI think I talked about this. The song that I played, and then at the end of it, I was like,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:54.000\noh, my baby ducks. Yes. There's this guy that he made... He did lyrics to it.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.000\nHe did a whole thing, and he played a little acoustic guitar. And I didn't want to spoil it.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:05.000\nI was going to surprise him by sending him a thing, or like, because I took his lyrics track\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:11.000\ninto the software that I'm using to... And I was just like saying, oh, can I just put his stuff\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:15.000\ninto one of my stuff and add to it and stuff. Actually, a lot more challenging,\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:22.000\nbecause tempos are always different and stuff. It's kind of a big deal. It's challenging.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:28.000\nTrying to do that with the Mike Cravello theme song. I tried to drag the Mike Cravello theme song\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:34.000\ninto an editor. I was like, oh, I'll just figure out what tempo it is, and then I can lay shit on top of it.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nI could do a cool Mike Cravello rap or something, but it's really hard.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nBecause you can't really get rid of his guitar, right? You can't scrub his guitar.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:46.000\nThe baby ducks guy? Yeah. Yeah, that is a challenge. His guitar is in there, and he's like...\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:51.000\nHe's kind of changing tempo and stuff like that, but I did a pretty good job.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:56.000\nI can't play that now, whatever, but... Yeah, anyways, I'm playing... I'm doing music.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nWhat is it? What's wrong? What can we do for you?\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:04.000\nLike, how can the show be made better for the show-ruiner?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:09.000\nIf you're at home right now, Schrab's mouth is wide open.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:14.000\nYou're just talking about the thing, and then you're like, I'm not going to play it now.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:19.000\nYou talk about it, you get us all titillated, and then you're not going to...\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nOh, shit. Oh, shit. Sounds great.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nOh, shit. Hold on, buddy. Hold on. I'm almost there.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:31.000\nWe're coming. His username is longsocksilver.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nApparently, he was going for a reference that a couple people got.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:41.000\nInstead of John's...\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:45.000\nGod damn it. No, I'm not going to do this to you, buddy.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nI'm going to start it on... I'm sorry.\n\n22:48.000 --> 23:02.000\nHe deserves better.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:25.000\nOh, my baby ducks. Oh, my baby ducks are in a fucking row.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:30.000\nOh, my baby ducks. Oh, my baby ducks.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:35.000\nYeah, there he is. Longsocksilver. Longsocksilver.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:41.000\nLongsocksilver is a different guy entirely, but I recommend following him on Instagram as well.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:45.000\nLooks like he's in... Where is he?\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:50.000\nI see a geotag here somewhere. Who cares? You can type him in.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nWho cares?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:56.000\nThere he is in New York. He must be somewhat of a successful musician. He's traveling around.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nTraveling?\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nI wonder what his real name is. There he is in Brooklyn.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nDo you think a New York guy thinks I'm cool enough to do my song?\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nYeah.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nLooks like he's in the Brooklyn area here.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nHe's in all five boroughs.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nMy music is kind of fucking legit.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:16.000\nLike dude, right now there's like 13 old black dudes in Memphis doing my baby duck.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nShut up.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nYeah.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nYou talked to that?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nI was gonna tell you.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nIt's Brandon.

I'll move from\n\n29:10.460 --> 29:15.340\nSanta Monica to Burbank for you. I just want to point out that I think that\n\n29:15.340 --> 29:19.700\nSchrab's that here because that was the special chair. Is that is that the wolf\n\n29:19.700 --> 29:25.460\nyou're in? Oh yeah. This baby's got some amount of ounces. You know I had foresight\n\n29:25.460 --> 29:29.380\nI would have put the wolf you're in in the brew mate and see if it stayed at\n\n29:29.380 --> 29:33.740\nwolf. It warms it up to like piping hot for like a drug test. Do you think it\n\n29:33.740 --> 29:38.500\nneeds to be hot to work? Do you think you think they just to make all that\n\n29:38.500 --> 29:43.420\nthat they so dark they have like a bunch of will we go cross country. It's like\n\n29:43.460 --> 29:49.300\ncoke. This is a car. I think this wolf works in sales. Like they refuse to\n\n29:49.340 --> 29:54.260\na lot of coffee. We're having our own yeah. What's going on over here. Sorry guys\n\n29:54.300 --> 29:57.420\ntalking about wolf pee. It's like like what that's not interesting enough.\n\n29:57.460 --> 30:01.980\nThat's clearly the best substance on stage. We were talking about it, but we\n\n30:02.020 --> 30:05.780\nwere talking about how they get it. Oh yeah. I was wondering that too. That is\n\n30:05.780 --> 30:13.140\nyou must jerk them off in exchange for pee later right. They're like they're\n\n30:13.180 --> 30:18.420\nlike oh and the wolf's like you want to do like they put a cup in the in the\n\n30:18.460 --> 30:22.260\nin the room with the wolf. They come back piss all over the floor. They slowly\n\n30:22.300 --> 30:28.380\nover 20 years. They figured it out like the wolf is training them. They go. They\n\n30:28.420 --> 30:35.380\nleave like a cap fancy magazine. I don't know what wolves jerk off to the\n\n30:35.380 --> 30:38.180\nwolf. The wolf gradually like starts filling the cup in response to\n\n30:38.220 --> 30:44.740\nincreasingly sexual behavior. Then you're home free. I don't know Michael. How\n\n30:44.780 --> 30:49.780\ncome Michael always gets more wolf pee in the cup. Oh he's wearing those short\n\n30:49.820 --> 30:50.260\nshorts.\n\n30:54.180 --> 30:58.540\nSo I know I know you guys are worried you're like is the wolf gay because then\n\n30:58.580 --> 31:03.420\nI can't laugh at it right. No it's a straight wolf. What are you I know that\n\n31:03.420 --> 31:07.940\nit seems like I don't know but why do you have wolf pee. I have wolf because\n\n31:07.980 --> 31:12.540\nI have a coyote problem so it seems like a like a weird joke is going to happen\n\n31:12.580 --> 31:16.940\nhere because it's like is this going to attract wolves and like do you eventually\n\n31:16.980 --> 31:20.620\nneed. I mean I know they sell bear pee. It was weird like they're they every kind\n\n31:20.660 --> 31:25.820\nof animal out there has pee for sale. Obviously humans are selling the pee.\n\n31:25.860 --> 31:29.860\nI don't mean that wolves are getting this is exploitative but yeah. How do we\n\n31:29.860 --> 31:34.900\nknow it's wolf pee. Of course we don't know. Of course but here's what I want\n\n31:34.940 --> 31:40.100\nto know. What is human pee chopped liver like what if in a world where like oh\n\n31:40.140 --> 31:44.380\nthe coyote is going to go like you smell that a wolf took a pee here run for the\n\n31:44.420 --> 31:49.180\nhills. What that you're in my backyard. I invented bulldozers. What the fuck.\n\n31:50.580 --> 31:55.380\nWell fucking like fear my wrath. I'm like destroying the planet with my pee like\n\n31:55.380 --> 32:00.620\nfucking run baby. But you said you should be like smells like an alphabet. It\n\n32:00.660 --> 32:05.940\nmight work. I have I tried it. I well yes I have because I'm an alcoholic.\n\n32:05.980 --> 32:09.660\nThere's a lot of my pee in my backyard. Can we smell that. If anything it's\n\n32:09.700 --> 32:13.180\nattracting that they probably think I'm a coyote. Can we open it and smell it. I\n\n32:13.220 --> 32:18.180\ndon't want we do that. I don't want to and certainly let's not lose any of it.\n\n32:18.220 --> 32:24.020\nOkay. Y'all about to watch a nigga go crazy. Two years you got left to say\n\n32:24.020 --> 32:34.940\nthat word. No I can say it as much as I want longer it's it's it's it's it's\n\n32:34.980 --> 32:38.340\ninteresting. That was a genuine reaction. Yeah, yeah, it really was. It was a very\n\n32:38.380 --> 32:42.340\nstrong or I would say an arch reaction strong reaction. But did you notice it\n\n32:42.380 --> 32:46.700\nwasn't like immediate nausea like I wasn't like it was like it was just\n\n32:46.740 --> 32:51.420\nincredibly strong gerbils. Yeah, okay. It smells a little bit like a hamster\n\n32:51.420 --> 32:55.340\ncage like your shavings or something. I was like gerbils. Oh, is it you can\n\n32:55.380 --> 32:59.980\nsmell it over there. Ah, well don't play that up. You know we're we're you know\n\n33:00.020 --> 33:03.100\npeople will start going. Oh good. We get to complain about something. You know,\n\n33:03.140 --> 33:09.860\nis it they love so many millennial. It's like roofing. I like it. Does it say it\n\n33:09.900 --> 33:14.020\nrepels millennials. I don't we don't need to do that. I got all these empty\n\n33:14.060 --> 33:18.340\nseats. We need. We need what attracts them. We need like Pokemon pee. Oh,\n\n33:18.340 --> 33:24.260\nincense jobs.

Some of you may have taken it\n\n33:34.700 --> 33:38.580\nand the data seems to suggest agree or disagree. Maybe with your applause if you\n\n33:38.620 --> 33:42.820\nfeel moved to do you. But although this is going to be skewed. Exactly. You're\n\n33:42.820 --> 33:49.220\nhere. Yeah, but like I like like what would you prefer if we moved to Sunday\n\n33:49.260 --> 33:54.540\nnight like the the tapings. This right. Well, this is silence because these are\n\n33:54.580 --> 33:58.220\nthe people here. Okay, this is this man. This is two nuns and a priest clapping\n\n33:58.260 --> 34:02.900\nright. Okay, so we found the people that love it that it's on Monday Monday\n\n34:02.940 --> 34:08.340\ncrew. Okay, well you guys seem nice. I don't I don't I don't care. I don't\n\n34:08.340 --> 34:13.780\nneed to sell out a show about me talking about wolf pee. But we were we were we\n\n34:13.820 --> 34:16.860\nwere looking at the data that we took. We took a survey. Maybe it was among just\n\n34:16.900 --> 34:21.380\nfans in general or something because there was there seemed to be kind of a\n\n34:21.420 --> 34:27.380\na a suggestion from the data that that people would be thrilled if we moved to\n\n34:27.420 --> 34:33.820\nSunday nights. But I don't know who who who you guys polled. Was it listeners or\n\n34:33.820 --> 34:39.340\nwas it attendees? I don't know the methodologies in question. The wolf pee\n\n34:39.380 --> 34:47.180\nlabel is very DIY very Etsy. It says impact font going on. It's it's it. Yeah,\n\n34:47.220 --> 34:53.700\nit was almost like a comic sans serif under the logo that said the logo says\n\n34:53.740 --> 34:58.380\nwolf pee in impact font one hundred percent. Wolf you're in impact font beneath\n\n34:58.380 --> 35:04.020\nthat territorial marking sent in like aerial bold in red. And then there's a\n\n35:04.060 --> 35:07.540\nphoto of a wolf. But then there's a pretty impressive logo of a silhouette of\n\n35:07.580 --> 35:12.820\na wolf in mid howl and it says like in really proud confident letters at a\n\n35:12.860 --> 35:22.780\nfucking striking rakish angle original since nineteen eighty six to do my\n\n35:22.780 --> 35:28.340\namy vice theme. Yeah, it's this pee's got cocaine in it man and then it says under\n\n35:28.380 --> 35:33.060\nthat in like a very comic sans serif font creates the illusion that a wolf is\n\n35:33.100 --> 35:39.900\nnearby creates the illusion. Oh yeah predator pee dot com a tradition of\n\n35:39.940 --> 35:48.220\nquality. A tradition of quality. You're in bad bad bad bad title. That's not a\n\n35:48.220 --> 36:01.540\ngood title predator pee honey. You got your package from predator pee. Oh, the\n\n36:01.580 --> 36:06.900\nlabel was very discreet. I was. I was. I was happy to see with a name like\n\n36:06.940 --> 36:11.340\npredator pee. You better be discreet. Yeah, or you're going to get some my ball.\n\n36:11.380 --> 36:15.860\nIt would be really impressive. There's a nice Cuban here. Oh yeah. That's\n\n36:15.860 --> 36:19.820\nimpressive. I thought you meant the house brew brew mate brew mate. How much\n\n36:19.860 --> 36:24.820\npee do you need to convince a coyote more than this. There's a wolf in your\n\n36:24.860 --> 36:28.900\nbackyard. I don't know. We opened the bottle and fifty people almost like\n\n36:28.940 --> 36:32.980\nleft and they're not even coyotes. A tradition of quality. You're in since\n\n36:33.020 --> 36:37.340\nnineteen eighty six. I just wanted to read that. Okay, twenty five directions\n\n36:37.340 --> 36:46.620\nof predator pee liquid to create a pee remiter. No, no, no, really you mother\n\n36:46.660 --> 36:55.740\nfuckers. Yeah, I'm proud of them. Yeah, they're like the Bartles and James of\n\n36:55.780 --> 36:58.380\nof pee like that. I don't know. They're just like they're like look we saw\n\n36:58.420 --> 37:00.860\nwolf pee like we're not going to be refused nicks. You know we're not going\n\n37:00.900 --> 37:06.740\nto like call ourselves like industrial sent harvests. You know like is that\n\n37:06.740 --> 37:11.300\nBartles and James people in the business need pee. We got pee. We're here's a\n\n37:11.340 --> 37:15.060\nset up a pee remiter. Have fun with pee. It's like like make pee part of your\n\n37:15.100 --> 37:19.660\nworld like like pee. He used to be the state of the art, you know, before\n\n37:19.700 --> 37:23.340\nlasers and fucking things and guess what coyotes don't care about your lasers.\n\n37:23.380 --> 37:26.820\nThey probably would if you shot them with one speaking of which. Okay, so I\n\n37:26.860 --> 37:31.620\nbought this and I also bought a slingshot, but I'm not going to aim for\n\n37:31.620 --> 37:39.860\nthe coyotes. I just got but I got like a laser guided slingshot. It's crazy. The\n\n37:39.900 --> 37:43.100\nillustration of the Amazon thing I sent to Camille. He probably was offended,\n\n37:43.140 --> 37:46.540\nbut because the guy kind of looked like Kumail, like, like,\n\n37:46.580 --> 37:51.540\nlike, because he had his head down. It's like the other photos. It's like I\n\n37:51.580 --> 37:55.140\njust like some doofy Italian guy, but he had his head at the right angle. I\n\n37:55.180 --> 37:59.500\njust like really looked like Kumail. This is I think this endorsement. You text\n\n37:59.500 --> 38:05.020\nhim a lot. Just when I just when I want to what are you going to hit with that\n\n38:05.060 --> 38:09.260\nslingshot? I'm just going to I just got I'm just going to I just want to because\n\n38:09.300 --> 38:14.060\nhere's the thing. Okay, the coyote is how you know it's fucked up. You already\n\n38:14.100 --> 38:18.060\ntrying to back away. No, no, no, no. I'm going to it's an alternative to throwing\n\n38:18.100 --> 38:22.020\nrocks. I'm 46. Like I here's what happened to me two nights ago. Okay. This\n\n38:22.060 --> 38:26.380\nis why I ordered the slingshot. These things, you know, I'm just protecting\n\n38:26.380 --> 38:30.220\nmy babies. I'm not going to do anything violent to another animal, but like I\n\n38:30.260 --> 38:35.100\ncan't as a mom's laws, like I can't by inaction allow violence to happen to\n\n38:35.140 --> 38:40.020\nmy my my animals. So like the coyotes started coming around probably refugees\n\n38:40.060 --> 38:43.900\nfrom the fire. Nobody's fault. I got video of one of them because they came\n\n38:43.940 --> 38:47.740\nout in the day. Beautiful creature. I expected them to look more like crazy,\n\n38:47.780 --> 38:53.580\nlike mangy like resident evil zombie dogs the way they sound. But they look\n\n38:53.580 --> 38:57.220\nkind of like, yeah, they're just they have like deer pelt kind of things are\n\n38:57.260 --> 39:00.700\nlike rabbit like they're kind of like beautiful camouflage like with these\n\n39:00.740 --> 39:04.820\nbig pointy ears and a big fox. Yeah. And they're all they're all genetically\n\n39:04.860 --> 39:09.020\ncompatible with wolves and dogs and stuff. The whole genus is like just a big\n\n39:09.060 --> 39:12.140\nfree for all. I guess that I guess probably all genuses are I mean we're in\n\n39:12.180 --> 39:17.020\nthe homo genus. It's just that we fucking genocided all the other. We had coyotes\n\n39:17.060 --> 39:22.300\nand wolves to our sapiens at one point and we just fucking scrubbed them out. We\n\n39:22.300 --> 39:25.020\nwere like you guys want to go to a rave and the Neanderthals were like what's\n\n39:25.060 --> 39:33.740\nthat we're like fuck you idiot fucking no tweeting fucking caveman ass. So glad\n\n39:33.780 --> 39:38.700\nwe stopped doing that to other cultures. Oh yeah. What are you doing Neanderthal\n\n39:38.740 --> 39:44.460\nI'm making a dreamcatcher to bury with my lifelong mate because I love her and\n\n39:44.500 --> 39:46.980\nbelieve in an afterlife. Fuck you. I can't hear you over the sound of me\n\n39:46.980 --> 39:55.140\nkilling you. That's what happened. We were the killing ones. Yeah. Happy. You\n\n39:55.180 --> 40:01.700\nwoke now. You're Hitler babies by proxies going back 5000 millennia. Don't\n\n40:01.740 --> 40:08.420\nlook it up. To create a P-rimiter saturate scent tags. Oh great. So hidden\n\n40:08.460 --> 40:16.100\ncosts. I didn't order any scent tags. Boy or fill a or fill 33 day dispensers.\n\n40:16.100 --> 40:22.460\nThere's these fucking P barons. P baron. Wait a minute and hang and I think I\n\n40:22.500 --> 40:31.460\nknow what the P dispenser is a hard day. Oh I mean come on. It's a break. You\n\n40:31.500 --> 40:37.820\ngot to buy a go get a dispenser order it. It's a yeah. Exactly. It's a bucket\n\n40:37.860 --> 40:42.180\nwith a hole in it. So there you go. Oh you do. It's a dick. It's a dick. Dick.\n\n40:42.180 --> 40:49.060\nIt's a dick. It's a dick. I was right. It's a dick. It's a fucking with a\n\n40:49.100 --> 40:51.900\nhole in it. What is your dick look like? All right. Well this isn't going to\n\n40:51.940 --> 40:56.460\nwork. This isn't going to work. I know why not just add like one of those\n\n40:56.500 --> 41:01.340\nfucking spray bottle tops to it. There is that. Okay. Jesus. Predator P yard\n\n41:01.380 --> 41:05.220\ncover is designed to make it easy to spread Predator P for applications on\n\n41:05.260 --> 41:08.980\nlawns, flower beds, gardens and other areas where creating a P-rimiter would\n\n41:08.980 --> 41:16.740\nbe or impractical. Jar for pet training, saturate a 10 square foot diameter area\n\n41:16.780 --> 41:21.180\nto help you direct pets to the areas of your yard that you designate as pet\n\n41:21.220 --> 41:26.180\nrestrooms. So make those smell like wolf pee. Make the pet restrooms smell like\n\n41:26.220 --> 41:29.140\nwolf pee? That's what it said, right? I don't. It doesn't say. It says your\n\n41:29.180 --> 41:34.940\ndogs love wolf pee. No, it says what it says is saturate a 10 square foot\n\n41:34.940 --> 41:40.820\ndiameter area. Oh, so that's the P-rimiter. Well, I don't know. I don't\n\n41:40.860 --> 41:44.860\nknow. So a square diameter is what they want. Oh, yeah help you direct pets to\n\n41:44.900 --> 41:50.180\nthe areas of your yard. So I think the areas of your yard are are wolf pee\n\n41:50.220 --> 41:54.180\nfree. Right. Yeah, I think the dogs are like shit. There's a wolf shit. There's\n\n41:54.220 --> 41:58.900\na wolf wolves everywhere. Yeah, right. I can pee here. Like I'm not going to do\n\n41:58.940 --> 42:02.460\nthat to my dogs. My dogs know to pee wherever they want. I think we just\n\n42:02.460 --> 42:07.900\nneed to get that that that that wall area kind of peed up. That is real dark\n\n42:07.940 --> 42:13.420\npee. Yeah, got a slingshot. Oh, because here's why. So don't yeah, I'm not a\n\n42:13.460 --> 42:20.500\nmaniac. I these things come around. The dogs freak out. They like want to go\n\n42:20.540 --> 42:24.980\nout there and talk to them and all the stuff. Right. Okay. So used to be like,\n\n42:24.980 --> 42:32.940\nokay, going back like six weeks, three months, maybe like, oh, they make this\n\n42:32.980 --> 42:36.620\nfucking racket. It's been getting more intense, like very aggressive coyote\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:42.420\nbehavior happening. And I go downstairs, turn the kitchen light on. They go\n\n42:42.460 --> 42:51.460\nquiet. So then, you know, a little after that, like two days a week later, turn\n\n42:51.500 --> 42:54.300\nthe kitchen light on. Nope, that's not going to work anymore. Go out the\n\n42:54.300 --> 42:58.140\nback door. Okay, now they shut up and so on and so forth from there, like\n\n42:58.180 --> 43:04.380\nleading to me with a fucking like stick going like shut up. And and then the\n\n43:04.420 --> 43:08.140\nmost humiliating. This is why I bought a weapon now from Amazon is because I'm\n\n43:08.180 --> 43:14.340\nnot I'm like, dude, like, this is really humiliating. Good. Like me standing on\n\n43:14.380 --> 43:21.140\na ladder, like, like shaking a stick at them and going shut up and then going\n\n43:21.140 --> 43:29.420\nlike like I felt like I already have a small penis. It shrank like into my\n\n43:29.460 --> 43:34.260\nabdomen. Like my penis is in one of my nipples now. Like like I got cucked out\n\n43:34.300 --> 43:39.060\nby some fucking monster dogs and you think that this slingshot you will\n\n43:39.100 --> 43:42.740\nlook as I went. So I was like, okay, I'm going to throw rocks. So here's an\n\n43:42.780 --> 43:47.220\nincredible thing. There's no rocks. Like I was. Did they phase those out? Like I\n\n43:47.260 --> 43:49.780\nwas like when I was 10 years old, it seemed like there were rocks everywhere.\n\n43:49.780 --> 43:54.580\nBig rocks are inimical bull. Is that a word? What does that mean? Sure ad for\n\n43:54.620 --> 43:58.820\nsociety? It was I looked all over. I couldn't believe how hard it was to\n\n43:58.860 --> 44:03.140\nfind a rock. I thought is that progress or is that you think they're phasing\n\n44:03.180 --> 44:06.020\nthem out because you could do you get hit someone with them and stuff. They\n\n44:06.060 --> 44:08.940\ndon't want people just like to be able to break into someone's car with just\n\n44:08.980 --> 44:13.140\na piece of the environment. I believe Schrab is proposing to you. You should\n\n44:13.180 --> 44:17.340\nuse. That's what I did. I went to my ice maker. I got a bucket ice. I threw ice\n\n44:17.340 --> 44:21.500\nat him after after about five minutes of throwing ice. They stopped. I'm pretty\n\n44:21.540 --> 44:26.420\nsure because they were like, thank you. That's better. I was dehydrated. So you're\n\n44:26.460 --> 44:29.740\nyou're hitting them with ice. You're not hitting them. You think I'm like man\n\n44:29.780 --> 44:33.220\nenough to hit a coyote in the dark with ice. I don't know where you are or where\n\n44:33.260 --> 44:37.180\nthey are in the situation. Exactly. Well, what I'm doing, I'm in my backyard and\n\n44:37.220 --> 44:41.700\noh, it's like D&D. I'm in my backyard. I'm facing the back wall, the north wall\n\n44:41.740 --> 44:46.820\nin my backyard. I'm standing on a bar stool and so I'm eye level with the\n\n44:46.820 --> 44:52.700\nground thing and I can hear them in the pitch black. But in that yard, right?\n\n44:52.740 --> 44:58.500\nOh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's yeah. And so I'm just whipping handfuls of ice cubes\n\n44:58.540 --> 45:03.260\nin that direction figure, you know, and I just and they just kept kept yipping and\n\n45:03.300 --> 45:07.420\nthen after a while they stopped. I truly believe they're like, this is delicious.\n\n45:07.460 --> 45:12.060\nSo they're turning you basically into a person who is reaching out to a company\n\n45:12.100 --> 45:16.100\nthat makes devices that are rudimentary to attack them. Yeah, it's true. Like I'm\n\n45:16.100 --> 45:22.580\nlike I'm meeting them like Acme. Yeah. I'm not the road runner in this situation\n\n45:22.620 --> 45:27.380\nfor sure. Yeah, that's funny. You have really gone to their level at this point.\n\n45:27.420 --> 45:34.620\nI'm surely acting as a fucking fictional coyote. That's really a really profound\n\n45:34.660 --> 45:39.940\ninsight. I'm like ordering from fucking Amazon. It's the Acme. That's incredible.\n\n45:39.980 --> 45:45.140\nI was like these crazy like three strapped like create like laser guided things.\n\n45:45.140 --> 45:51.060\nIt's insane. It's true. It's 100 percent like parallel. I cannot wait to see the\n\n45:51.100 --> 45:55.660\nrocket that you build with skates. I'm getting like bloodlights. I'm gonna put\n\n45:55.700 --> 46:01.660\ntraps back there and be like they're not working and jumping up and down on it.\n\n46:01.700 --> 46:04.420\nI did think at a certain point I was thinking as I was throwing the ice, I was\n\n46:04.460 --> 46:07.260\nlike, oh, now they're maybe they're eating the ice. Now they like me. And then I\n\n46:07.300 --> 46:11.940\nthought, well, if they could shut the fuck up and never eat my dogs, I will say,\n\n46:11.940 --> 46:19.340\nyou know, maybe they're eating like raccoons, skunks, fruit, people who who's\n\n46:19.380 --> 46:25.380\nkeep outdoor cats. I don't I don't I love the cats. Therefore, I want their owners\n\n46:25.420 --> 46:29.700\nto suffer for making them outdoor cats so that in the long term, people will love\n\n46:29.740 --> 46:33.700\ntheir cats enough to keep them indoors. But so, you know, it's complicated. I'm\n\n46:33.740 --> 46:38.300\nlike that guy in the Watchmen who was like, let's start a nuclear war. We'll have\n\n46:38.300 --> 46:41.900\nworld peace. Osmandias. I'm like, I hope all their cats get eaten, so they learn\n\n46:41.940 --> 46:46.420\nwork. Sharp nice to cats. What's what's what's happening? What are you talking\n\n46:46.460 --> 46:51.180\nabout? I'm just listening to you talk, man. Just listening. I don't like this at\n\n46:51.220 --> 46:56.460\nall. This makes me uncomfortable. Still icing this thing. That's crazy, huh?\n\n46:56.500 --> 47:01.820\nThat's just a drinking out of it a long time. It. Yeah, it's a quality product.\n\n47:01.860 --> 47:08.020\nIt's a doozy because it's a hard one to win, but I don't think I don't think I\n\n47:08.020 --> 47:12.460\ndon't think the slingshot is your boy. If the coyotes come into the yard, maybe\n\n47:12.500 --> 47:16.500\nthe slingshot. But I just I think that they're the coyotes. M. O. Is usually to\n\n47:16.540 --> 47:20.100\nlure. They do the yipping thing to kind of lure dogs out and then they kind of\n\n47:20.140 --> 47:24.380\nlike nip them up or whatever. But I know, but I'm not I'm not judging. Sorry. I\n\n47:24.420 --> 47:30.340\nknow I do think the worst case scenario is the one where it's like it's zero\n\n47:30.380 --> 47:33.380\nsome game and appropriate phrase here. It's like the day that one of those\n\n47:33.380 --> 47:39.980\nfuckers does tumble into the yard. Right. It's like it's going to be an extreme\n\n47:40.020 --> 47:44.820\nsituation. I don't think a slingshot is the tool for that either. Like at that\n\n47:44.860 --> 47:49.620\npoint, I don't know what to do, but slingshots. Fine. But I'm looking at\n\n47:49.660 --> 47:53.020\nthat as the reason why I want them to like scoot back a little bit because I\n\n47:53.060 --> 47:57.500\nfeel like they're it's just like maybe like a pup of theirs that's going to be\n\n47:57.540 --> 48:03.140\nlike hunger days or something's going to like fall into the backyard. It could\n\n48:03.140 --> 48:07.780\nbe a mess. You know, the problem is that that neighbor's yard is just coyote HQ.\n\n48:07.820 --> 48:14.020\nYeah. Why is there any update on that? Like looking into that? We have their\n\n48:14.060 --> 48:17.100\nphone number. We're going to actually just go up, but we don't think they live\n\n48:17.140 --> 48:21.620\nthere necessarily. So it's there. They had their pug or bulldog that would fall\n\n48:21.660 --> 48:27.220\ninto my yard and like he that things got. If that thing's alive, it's Rambo.\n\n48:27.260 --> 48:32.180\nRight. Because it just walks around back there where there's nothing but\n\n48:32.180 --> 48:35.940\ncoyotes. It would be amazing to see it like like to walk back there and find it\n\n48:35.980 --> 48:46.740\nlike hiding like breathing through a bamboo. So you didn't you listen to I\n\n48:46.780 --> 48:50.180\ntold Spencer like I'm really interested in your take on the guy I call Asperger\n\n48:50.220 --> 48:58.660\nDetective. Right. And I call him that as a handle. I felt today inclined to\n\n48:58.660 --> 49:11.140\niterate that like iterate that means say. I felt inclined to just say, you know,\n\n49:11.180 --> 49:14.580\nI said I call him Asperger Detective because I kind of feel I wouldn't do it if I\n\n49:14.620 --> 49:18.100\nthought that that would offend him. Like if somebody if somebody was doing a\n\n49:18.140 --> 49:21.300\npodcast and it sounded like they had a hair lip and they never mentioned their\n\n49:21.340 --> 49:25.220\nhair lip, I wouldn't be like hair lip, hair lip guy. I mean, maybe with Cody or\n\n49:25.220 --> 49:29.380\nsomebody you want to listen to hair lip guy. But like, you know, I think that the\n\n49:29.420 --> 49:33.060\nguys could like based on his comments and stuff, I feel like whether he has\n\n49:33.100 --> 49:37.300\nAspergers or not, he'd be like, that's kind of cool. Like he'd be like punk rock\n\n49:37.340 --> 49:43.660\nabout it. But you know, so I just wanted to say that I don't you know, it's hard\n\n49:43.700 --> 49:47.740\nthese days. I don't want to I don't want to be hurtful to any real people. I just\n\n49:47.780 --> 49:51.780\nwant to I just want people to leave me alone, give me money. I don't even I don't\n\n49:51.820 --> 49:54.820\nneed you to come here. I don't need to keep doing this show. I just it's kind of\n\n49:54.820 --> 49:59.620\na moment. I'm all momentum at this point, just kind of drifting. You know, very\n\n49:59.660 --> 50:04.740\nhappy. Just want to steal take take my money. I didn't mean to say steal. It's\n\n50:04.780 --> 50:09.380\ntotally earned it. I've earned every penny. My job's very hard. I take it by a\n\n50:09.420 --> 50:15.980\nbig house disappear into the West Wing and and you'll you'll hear like just the\n\n50:16.020 --> 50:21.940\nsound of a man eating chocolate Sunday. That'll be my equivalent of a single\n\n50:21.940 --> 50:27.300\ngunshot. Just like it's the same thing. A week of chocolate Sunday eating the same\n\n50:27.340 --> 50:34.900\nthing. Stanley said we did and then he died over a spider man comic. What wait?\n\n50:34.940 --> 50:40.660\nShut up. Wait. He died on top of one. Yeah. What did he say before that? What did\n\n50:40.700 --> 50:46.020\nyou say? I want to do this for like 10 more years. Well, he's like 97. You say\n\n50:46.060 --> 50:49.100\nwhen he was 87. He was like, I just want to do this for 10 more years. And so\n\n50:49.100 --> 50:55.420\nyou're like, Oh, man, that's how you die. No, that's like the curse of the\n\n50:55.460 --> 51:01.500\nGolden Girls like onion headline. What's the curse of the Golden Girls? You\n\n51:01.540 --> 51:06.660\nprobably put it together, right? No, I'm asking a quest. Why would I ask the\n\n51:06.700 --> 51:12.820\nquestion if I didn't know? I could put it together. I there was an onion\n\n51:12.860 --> 51:18.060\nheadline. It was like, I can't remember the content. It was like, you know,\n\n51:18.060 --> 51:23.420\nsomeone dies and continuing a curse of the cast of Golden Girls because the\n\n51:23.460 --> 51:28.260\njoke is they were at an age where it would be fully appropriate statistically\n\n51:28.300 --> 51:31.580\nfor them to be dying at the rate that they were. Ha ha. All right. That's\n\n51:31.620 --> 51:38.620\npretty funny. I like that. Oh, OK. So you were asking you were asking Spencer\n\n51:38.660 --> 51:42.260\nwhat he thought. Yeah, what's your take? You said you listened to 13 episodes\n\n51:42.300 --> 51:46.540\nof this guy. Yeah, I've been listening to him. I don't know if he's he might\n\n51:46.540 --> 51:52.660\nbe he. So, OK, the show is the guy like writes an essay, essentially, and then\n\n51:52.700 --> 51:57.020\nhe just reads the essay on on the podcast because it's like it's not like\n\n51:57.340 --> 52:01.980\nthere's not room for his just personal musings. It's all just straight like a\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:05.580\nscript that he's wrote, but to the extent that it's like an essay, he like\n\n52:05.620 --> 52:09.580\nalways has some sort of thesis statement or theme that he's like weaving\n\n52:09.620 --> 52:13.540\nthrough it, which is it. I don't know. Sometimes it sounds like the most\n\n52:13.540 --> 52:18.060\nstupid pretentious shit like or sometimes he focuses on stuff. Like there\n\n52:18.100 --> 52:21.700\nis the one where he was focusing on like, I don't know. There's the guy whose\n\n52:21.740 --> 52:25.620\nwife fell down the stairs or he killed her or whatever and then like the 911\n\n52:25.660 --> 52:29.300\ncalls like she fell down the stairs and the lady is like how many stairs and\n\n52:29.340 --> 52:34.260\nhe was like what and then and then he was like why did he say what it's\n\n52:34.300 --> 52:37.180\nobvious he was hiding the truth and it's like well that's a stupid quick. It\n\n52:37.220 --> 52:40.420\ndoesn't matter how many fucking stairs someone fell down. I would be like\n\n52:40.420 --> 52:45.780\nwhat the fuck are you talking about? So I don't know a lot. Let me count. Yeah,\n\n52:45.820 --> 52:49.500\nit's like that's not that's not helpful. It is though because you want to know\n\n52:49.540 --> 52:53.580\nshould you send some cops or an ambulance or a ladder both. Why don't you sort\n\n52:53.620 --> 52:58.260\nit out afterwards? I my wife's dead or dying kind of like like he'll do it.\n\n52:58.300 --> 53:01.260\nHe'll do kind of like when he does unsolved stuff and then he proposes a\n\n53:01.300 --> 53:04.820\ntheory because right that stuff's really impressive at his best. I like him\n\n53:04.860 --> 53:08.580\nbecause he reminds me of agent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks because Dale\n\n53:08.580 --> 53:11.660\nCooper rolls into your town and you're like we can't find out who killed Laura\n\n53:11.700 --> 53:15.900\nPalmer right? So and so you call the FBI when it's like the resources are\n\n53:15.940 --> 53:21.700\nexhausted and in David Lynch's universe the FBI is equivalent to like a weird\n\n53:21.740 --> 53:26.380\nlike shamanic tier of civilization. But like Dale Cooper's like he's he's he's\n\n53:26.420 --> 53:31.260\nlearned how to like it's like if only for the sake of being lateral because\n\n53:31.300 --> 53:35.860\nnothing else is working it's like oh you know like he'll throw rocks at a tin\n\n53:35.860 --> 53:41.580\ncan like and if it it's sort of like it's almost like flipping a coin or like\n\n53:41.620 --> 53:48.060\nlike Asperger detective will do something like he's like in 1985 John\n\n53:48.100 --> 53:52.580\nSwanson went into the woods and never came back. People have been talking about\n\n53:52.620 --> 53:56.620\nthis for quite a while but the one thing that they can't figure out is whether\n\n53:56.660 --> 54:02.420\nor not his friend did it or whether or not it was murder. But here's the thing\n\n54:02.420 --> 54:07.100\nI'd like to look at the case through the lens of parabolic Turing's law and\n\n54:07.140 --> 54:13.100\nand you're like what? Or it's not always like nerdy he'll be like the interesting\n\n54:13.140 --> 54:17.180\nthing is that him going off the path reminds me of the breakfast club. It was\n\n54:17.220 --> 54:23.300\na movie by John Hughes. John Hughes made movies in 1982 through 1997 and all of\n\n54:23.340 --> 54:26.980\nhis movies tended to involve disparate groups of people forced to get along\n\n54:27.020 --> 54:30.660\ntogether and learning things like he goes on this it goes on these like tears of\n\n54:30.660 --> 54:35.740\nlike he'll and then he'll like these themes of like aviation or something and\n\n54:35.780 --> 54:39.940\nthen every once in a while he'll just throw a fucking spark plug and and he\n\n54:39.980 --> 54:42.420\nbecause his episodes are three and a half hours long he never listens to him\n\n54:42.460 --> 54:47.860\nagain or edits them so so every earlier episodes are pretty short and I listen\n\n54:47.900 --> 54:54.420\nat two X speed. I would I mean I don't know if I we this is him just like kind\n\n54:54.420 --> 55:01.380\nof throwing a shoe. Cody recorded this because we're like whoa. The lack of\n\n55:01.420 --> 55:06.260\ntechnology will even be symbolized in their deaths by use of phone cord to\n\n55:06.300 --> 55:19.460\ncreate their bindings. So if all of this crazy this dude reached for leftover\n\n55:19.500 --> 55:24.100\nrice. Yeah, I don't know how much the mic picks up but those are there's just\n\n55:24.100 --> 55:29.940\nset up like a peel of half dry lips in there. It's like and I really again this\n\n55:29.980 --> 55:34.380\nis one of the situations where like you know I don't I don't want I'm not I'm\n\n55:34.420 --> 55:37.740\nnot punching down punching sideways punch it up. I don't want to be punching\n\n55:37.780 --> 55:42.700\nlike which is why I then add I feel I just hate this like feeling of like like\n\n55:42.740 --> 55:47.900\nhim getting like you know receiving in the wrong way that we were talking and\n\n55:47.940 --> 55:51.860\ntalking shit and I just want him to know that like I mean obvious like he's a\n\n55:51.860 --> 55:55.940\npart of our life. We love him like he's like we keep listening and listening and\n\n55:55.980 --> 56:01.140\nlistening. I totally like I see his haters and reviews and I can understand what\n\n56:01.180 --> 56:05.780\nthey're saying but I'm like I hate them like their haters and like I like the\n\n56:05.820 --> 56:11.220\nguy he's like so brazenly fucking like lateral. I also like really worry about\n\n56:11.260 --> 56:15.380\nhim sometimes like he did I don't did you hear one where he like started\n\n56:15.420 --> 56:18.540\ntalking about like he went straight into like fucking numerology or something\n\n56:18.540 --> 56:22.220\nwhere he was like I can't wait. I had to pause it with Cody. I'm like wait is\n\n56:22.260 --> 56:26.620\nhe is he rounding a bend because he usually will just go the job and he\n\n56:26.660 --> 56:31.260\nRams he was found in the train room. There have been three main functions of\n\n56:31.300 --> 56:34.620\nlocomotion since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Right. So I want\n\n56:34.660 --> 56:38.220\nto look at this from a perspective of transportation but but he'll bring it\n\n56:38.260 --> 56:42.060\nback around to be like we should look at this murder scene from the perspective\n\n56:42.100 --> 56:47.060\nof how much energy it takes to get from A to B and consistently the human race\n\n56:47.060 --> 56:50.500\nhas a tendency to try to conserve as much energy. Right. This is a genetic\n\n56:50.540 --> 56:53.860\nimperative. If you expend more resources then you acquire by going where you're\n\n56:53.900 --> 56:56.820\ngoing and then he'll work his way around. He's just what he's really saying is\n\n56:56.860 --> 57:01.340\nlike no one that's looked at this crime scene has has necessarily found the\n\n57:01.380 --> 57:05.460\nfingerprint that says exactly what happened so why not just like spin\n\n57:05.500 --> 57:09.580\naround like a pinata game and kind of like stop and look at it from now this\n\n57:09.620 --> 57:13.260\ncrazy perspective and if you look at the JonBenét Ramsey home crime scene\n\n57:13.260 --> 57:17.820\nmaybe from this perspective of like transportation then he'll come up with\n\n57:17.860 --> 57:22.660\nthis theory of like oh well Gordon Ramsey not Gordon Ramsey who was it? Yeah\n\n57:22.700 --> 57:26.780\nGordon Ramsey. It was it was. I think Gordon Ramsey did it. He's the only\n\n57:26.820 --> 57:32.500\nmember of the Ramsey clan that wasn't present in the house. She burnt one of\n\n57:32.540 --> 57:36.580\nthe cakes in an easy bake of it. Every time I've seen Gordon Ramsey he's\n\n57:36.620 --> 57:42.580\nbecoming extremely intolerant when aspects of when aspects of his environment\n\n57:42.580 --> 57:48.940\nare not up to snuff. He's a man who won't tolerate order or chaos chaos. Gordon\n\n57:48.980 --> 57:52.900\nRamsey if he was in that house would have killed JonBenét Ramsey. It's a\n\n57:52.940 --> 57:56.540\ncase that solves itself but no but but my point is that he will he will come\n\n57:56.580 --> 57:59.740\nback and I'll go and I'll go like god damn I think he I think he got it. I\n\n57:59.780 --> 58:04.300\nthink that is like a fucking like really viable different take on the John\n\n58:04.340 --> 58:08.660\nBonae Ramsey thing but then there was this one or it was like this family got\n\n58:08.660 --> 58:12.740\nmurdered in a cabin and it was like I was like maybe I'm not hearing him right\n\n58:12.780 --> 58:17.460\nbut I think he's like he's he's detached and he's like floating off like a\n\n58:17.500 --> 58:24.220\nballoon like because he was like the cabin the cabin number was 486. In 1986\n\n58:24.260 --> 58:29.700\nSteven Spielberg came out with something I it was like it was like he\n\n58:29.740 --> 58:32.260\nstarted talking about the movies I'm trying if I riff then you guys will be\n\n58:32.300 --> 58:36.620\nlike oh that's wrong I'm gonna be riffing like I do. Well one he really does is\n\n58:36.620 --> 58:40.940\nlike there's a guy he's accusing of making up a fake murderer and he's like\n\n58:40.980 --> 58:47.260\nand who is that murderers name Romano Romero it's it's RR which indicates he\n\n58:47.300 --> 58:51.180\nwas trying to complete the cycle and give the person what they wanted right\n\n58:51.220 --> 58:56.460\nand it's like well yeah you just said that right and this this one was like he\n\n58:56.500 --> 59:01.180\nwent from like the date of the murders or the address to like or he went from the\n\n59:01.220 --> 59:05.740\ndate of the murders to like the date of a movie release or like like back then\n\n59:05.740 --> 59:09.380\nhow like taking airplanes somewhere was like a new thing because the murders\n\n59:09.420 --> 59:16.740\nhave okay the murders happened in like a cabin in the like 80s when a domestic\n\n59:16.780 --> 59:20.860\nlike resorts that people would take vacations to so he referenced the movie\n\n59:20.900 --> 59:24.820\nVacation he references the movie Dirty Dancing which did not take place in the\n\n59:24.860 --> 59:29.340\n80s but it was made in the 80s but he references these movies that symbolize\n\n59:29.340 --> 59:35.100\nthe fact that there was a trans a trans a trans trans trans trans what the fuck\n\n59:35.140 --> 59:41.020\nam I what's the word what a tendency a transition in you lost that word yeah\n\n59:41.060 --> 59:46.220\nI'm old and drunk and dying you're gonna your words too and you know what the\n\n59:46.260 --> 59:49.820\nfirst word you're gonna lose is me so fuck you in advance you're gonna forget\n\n59:49.860 --> 59:52.140\nme and you're gonna miss me and you won't know why because you won't remember\n\n59:52.180 --> 59:57.580\nwho I am whoa it's good it's called getting haunted should have finished my\n\n59:57.580 --> 01:00:01.500\nbusiness I don't know what I'm saying no idea one of the guy that's why I like\n\n01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.580\nthis guy the main the main thing is like his angle is about examining like the\n\n01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.020\nhuman human mind human tendencies and he's like so I don't know like he did\n\n01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.580\nserial and he did add non and he like analyzed while like all the the murder\n\n01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.060\nreally closely replicates his his oppressed lifestyle or something and so\n\n01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:24.500\nhis angle is like this all lines up from a human behavioral perspective and a\n\n01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.940\nlot of these cases fall apart because you get hung up on the evidence and\n\n01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.340\nreally it's about matching whether or not like all the emotional mental states\n\n01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.020\nthat people lines up with the crime because usually again people know each\n\n01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.140\nother when they commit crimes of passion and so that usually indicates some\n\n01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:44.140\nsort of pattern of behavior playing out he went from the same but crazy yeah I\n\n01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.820\nmean that's the thing is like that's what's fascinating me is like the very\n\n01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.100\nfine line because like I remember when the internet first like kind of was\n\n01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:56.100\nblossoming and one of my most I was particularly fascinated with like with\n\n01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.620\npeople who were forgive me but clearly schizophrenic like who at the you know\n\n01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.100\nsort of like the people would just have like websites you know there was no\n\n01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.020\ntumbler there was no like you know it's just sort of like some of the first\n\n01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:14.420\npeople into the worldwide web to like look because it was like a place for\n\n01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:20.260\nlike aberrant stuff and like there was a lot of websites you would find there\n\n01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:25.820\nwere just people going like this is this is my story like it was in 1997 when I\n\n01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.380\nrealized that Harrison Ford was like to like trying to read my mind and like\n\n01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.580\ntheir whole like story I was like and they're very like hyper what do you\n\n01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.820\ncall it hyper graphic I don't know if that's the correct term but like like\n\n01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.860\nthey just like at a time when the internet was all just like text and it\n\n01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.220\nwas like like they were like like people with tragic mental illnesses like like\n\n01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.900\nwatching them I'm not you guys are like are you calling this guy mentally ill\n\n01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:52.300\nno but I'm saying like the the crazy the the the interest fascinating thing to\n\n01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.020\nme has always been like what are these lines you know like what drop of\n\n01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.500\nchemical what spark that could jump from one little part of your circuit board\n\n01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.860\nto another makes the big difference between someone who's valued at NASA for\n\n01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:08.300\nfiguring out like how a little rocket should do this and then some poor kid\n\n01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.580\nthat like when they're 20 years old they just realized their shoes are hot dogs\n\n01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.740\nand they just get expunged from society and they're homeless under a bridge\n\n01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.140\nbecause we don't respect like mental illness is as regular illness and like\n\n01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.980\nand like like so when I'm listening to Asperger detective and he like he\n\n01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.780\nevery once in a while I kind of because he went from like a date in this cabin\n\n01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.980\nso he had the like the zeitgeist of air travel within like the cult American\n\n01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:38.660\nculture of like how resorts were closing down because people were now air\n\n01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.540\nairlines were affordable so people were going to Europe more so there were\n\n01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:48.620\nplaces in America where cabins became like cheaper and like the clientele\n\n01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.260\nbecame more impoverished and so they got more rundown and so prices kept going\n\n01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.420\ndown and basically like he was making the case that like he's like there's\n\n01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:01.260\nthese places that used to be fancy that became like like the hotel in the\n\n01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.780\nshining but for regular customers who are just like these fucking thugs or\n\n01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.940\nwhatever I have no idea if he's like if that's based on any accurate data but\n\n01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.380\nhe was like that was his kind of zeitgeist or this is that's one of these\n\n01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.100\nplaces where this murder took place so he's like he's already got like this\n\n01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.900\nairplane thing going on in his head and then it's like so it was like the\n\n01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.380\nmurders happening on this date and then he's like interestingly enough that\n\n01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:26.740\nwas the date of like I don't know back to the future's release or something and\n\n01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.780\nit was like back to the future is about Marty McFly part of a younger\n\n01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:35.740\ngeneration who takes a car that's capable of flying who that's like I\n\n01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.620\ncouldn't fly in the first one but but he and then he but the crazy one about\n\n01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:45.420\nthat one is that he come he instead of coming back down he just floats and\n\n01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:50.780\nthen he goes like and and the sequel to this movie or that movie happened at\n\n01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:56.900\nthis time and the what that got at the box office was 498 million dollars so\n\n01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:03.700\nyou have to ask was there a cabin with the address 498 and if there is would\n\n01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.780\nthere be another person there who's a suspect in the murder and what do you\n\n01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:13.420\nknow and I was like what no that's not that's not what you usually do Dale\n\n01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:19.820\nCooper you just you just got a lead about who to arrest from a fucking Jaws\n\n01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.220\nmovie like that's that and I maybe I heard it wrong but I was like oh is he\n\n01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.460\nevery once in a while just like popping he pop and off the Hot Wheels track a\n\n01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.380\nlittle bit yeah there was another one I think it was that same murder but I\n\n01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:38.460\ncan't remember but he he accuses the guy of realizing he wanted to commit the\n\n01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.060\nmurder after he saw a movie and he was like oh and it was like why did he do\n\n01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.140\nit because the movie was the ghosts of his past it was played out when they\n\n01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.220\nstore the they storm the Nazi castle the Nazi castle castle was storing his\n\n01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.900\npoor memories or something and it was like it may he I don't even know maybe\n\n01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.020\nthe facts of the case was that he watched this movie but the guy was just\n\n01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.780\na certain like this guy did it and it was because he watched this movie and\n\n01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.620\nthis movie is the perfect analog for his life and that's why he murdered and\n\n01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:11.980\nis like it like this is all interactions you know in human perception I think we\n\n01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.100\nall are playing this sort of detective throughout the damn day right because\n\n01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:20.700\nbecause he is able to say I don't get the answer I don't get yeah he knows the\n\n01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.940\nright answer so the way he works backwards is super interesting and that's to\n\n01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.860\nkeep his ass personalized and on air there's some respects it's something\n\n01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:33.100\nthat we all sort of do like that person did not let me in that parking space\n\n01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.300\nbecause they saw what kind of car I drove right they made a judgment about me\n\n01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.900\nbecause it's dirty today and there is a little bit of a Hulk like a porn kind of\n\n01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.460\nlike nerd rage kind of thrill I get to because he's like such yeah he's like\n\n01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:51.460\nyou can tell like he's he's driven by like an like truly like a fetish for\n\n01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:56.860\nexplanation like I feel like that he he actually like more even more than me\n\n01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.940\nwhich is a lot like he just loves the feeling of explaining it's like I love\n\n01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.860\nlike that he becomes like when a dog puts its head up the window it probably\n\n01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.020\njust doesn't even know he's just like I'm gonna explain this and that's like\n\n01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.380\nthat's why his cadence goes like up is it's like because this the thing and\n\n01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.540\nlike that's the sound you make when you're when you're enlightening people and\n\n01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:20.220\nhe's just like it's like it's like go baby go explain everything like like\n\n01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.820\nlike don't even look back what is that going to hate what what is that port\n\n01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.820\ndoing with that adapter always talk he talks about all this weird stuff like\n\n01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.420\nhe's like he's like this is a port and it needs an adapter so who was the\n\n01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:39.260\nadapter add non's religion plug perfectly into the port of oppression or\n\n01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.500\nsomething like that it was really like he goes really hard but he says some\n\n01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:47.220\nstuff that like to me was like really really profound or whatever like he\n\n01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.100\ntalked about like when a healthy person goes on vacation they just realize that\n\n01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.700\nit's a change and they'll return to the normal but when an unhealthy person goes\n\n01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.300\non vacation they're looking for an escape from their reality and when they\n\n01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.420\nrealize the escape isn't from the from the problems they actually brought to\n\n01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:05.740\nit they get upset and then when they return and things haven't changed they\n\n01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.340\nlose their minds or whatever and I was like holy shit like this guy is just\n\n01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.780\nsaying truth and I like never thought about it was like blowing my mind he was\n\n01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.700\nsaying like people say they drink to forget but what they're actually doing\n\n01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:22.740\nis a commuting with the past and I was like oh damn I feel sad now it was\n\n01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:28.300\nbecause I I smoke a lot of pot and I was like oh fuck that's me baby but it was\n\n01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.940\njust like that's the thing but a lot of times they're like you're you're just\n\n01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.140\nbeing an asshole right now and other times it's like oh man my life\n\n01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:39.300\nit's crazy do you think we should he lives in Los Angeles let's go well I\n\n01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:42.940\nmean but I don't know I don't know what they're doing now like I had David\n\n01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:45.980\ncoming down I had the girls from Red Handed and it's like this tradition of\n\n01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:51.220\nlike oh you know Dan Harmon with Willy Wonka reaches out with his golden\n\n01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:55.820\ntickets into the world and like spoils relationships that that should really\n\n01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:01.540\nstay maybe consumer relationships I don't know I'm like I felt I'm like\n\n01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:09.780\nKim Jong whatever in the the fucking Seth Rogen movie that almost caused a\n\n01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.340\nnuclear war we should look to shoot up because I want to know a does he have\n\n01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.740\na criminology is he a background is he a writer all these things that you want\n\n01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.180\nto know because if he's like I gotta fill three hours so of course I'm gonna\n\n01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:27.220\npontificate because I'm a writer right great but if he's like just a lay\n\n01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.340\nperson who is talking about these things that's super fascinating yeah I\n\n01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.780\nwant you know who you know who absolutely I would have on on a heartbeat\n\n01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:38.620\njust because I think there you guys listen to Dan Carlin's hardcore history\n\n01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:43.580\nyeah where did where does he live I don't listen to somewhere I wonder if he\n\n01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.020\nlives like well fucking I mean I flew people out from London I think that's\n\n01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.060\nbasically yeah fucking I don't give a shit you don't give a shit I'll wipe my\n\n01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.060\nass with this money wipe ass wipe ass wherever Carlin is like that would be\n\n01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:03.460\na really interesting I listened to Dan Carlin and I was like this guy sounds\n\n01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:09.660\na lot like both Zach Gallifanakis and Heath Ledger and and then I then and\n\n01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.820\nthen it made me realize like why they cast he's Zach as the Joker and the\n\n01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.460\nLego Batman movie I was like like somebody must have been like oh he sounds\n\n01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.060\na little bit like don't you think yeah all right whatever yeah I think Dan\n\n01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.260\nCarlin sounds like George Carlin yeah and if you just word of advice because\n\n01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.340\nlike I I mean Dan hardcore history it has like I don't know there's been a\n\n01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:37.300\ncouple episodes where like Cody and I were both like I kind of I don't get it\n\n01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.340\nlike and not in a good way and that's like like you don't feel like pressured\n\n01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.540\nto like listen to that one skip around I guarantee you'll find one that for\n\n01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.620\nwhatever reason just gets its hooks in you from the first sentence and there's\n\n01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.740\nno reason for you to not hold out for that and like like it'll but it was like\n\n01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:57.460\na very healthy thing because I was like wait history it's true crime but you're\n\n01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.820\nkind of learning stuff like this and they have a ton of forensic evidence so\n\n01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.420\nyou can get deep deep deep into it it's always good to sort of shout out to\n\n01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.860\nthat's what that's why I asked you what are you going to be involved in if\n\n01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.620\nyou're not going to be you know like we all were sort of glued to the politics\n\n01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.460\nthis is the great answer so I definitely since I left Twitter like there\n\n01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.340\nwas you know I did withdrawals and stuff like that and I recently had like a\n\n01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.540\nfucking like I had to delete the Reddit app again because I was like in there\n\n01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.060\nfor a little bit and then I just found myself for three hours just like I'm\n\n01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:36.220\nlike I deleted it for the good of mankind but I got my Instagram which is\n\n01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:40.060\nthe thing where it's like okay if you make up thing that's a minute long you\n\n01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:45.220\ncan put it up here if somebody underneath it says anything other than I'm\n\n01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.540\nreally happy that you're happy you can be like go fuck yourself and if they say\n\n01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.660\nthat's how you treat your fans you can be like yeah that is go fuck yourself\n\n01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.860\nagain and if they say like that's fucked up and five people come in and say\n\n01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.580\nyou're fucked up I can go like you're all fucked up shut up I don't care like it\n\n01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.300\ndoesn't feel like it's going to end up in TMZ as much I don't mean to flatter\n\n01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.540\nmyself and probably not TMZ material anymore and I say that with like fucking\n\n01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.660\nfingers crossed like I just want to be like like recoiled a little bit like it's\n\n01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:15.940\ncyclical it's a weird thing of the old social media you you you have to take\n\n01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:20.340\nbreaks it's content driven you know you like Instagram like do you find that\n\n01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.860\nInstagram is like I find it content driven oh what do you what do you what's\n\n01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:30.260\ngoing on with you just tell us with what just in general like what the first of\n\n01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.500\nall what the fuck is wrong with you what's

01:11:55.060\nSteve you're not a you remember when it was still like maybe it was never\n\n01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.140\npolitically correct but when it was like within balance like if there was no\n\n01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.940\nlike but like we I think we talked about on this show friend just came up in my\n\n01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.780\nhead again the other day like when we were like we were kids we were like 20\n\n01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.220\nin Milwaukee and like like we were just the improv troop that we were in was all\n\n01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:15.140\ndudes and we were constantly humping each other yeah like as a bit I did probably\n\n01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:20.340\nto millennial ears makes no fucking sense yeah they do it I do you're a\n\n01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:24.340\ncontrarian you just know like millennials hump each other they do it's as old as\n\n01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:29.180\ntime there's problematic millennials I don't think like millennial dudes like\n\n01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:35.020\nthat are like in improv troops like like like like hump each other like like as\n\n01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:39.860\na do you remember do you remember we would we would sing the song get aboard the\n\n01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:44.740\nbut fuck train do you remember that I mean it's just like problematic like that\n\n01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:49.500\nthat trains all in problem a decision train but I was the but fuck train I\n\n01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.740\ndon't remember that but I was and then it was like you know what like Sean was\n\n01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:59.060\nlike combing his hair in the bathroom and I think like you started you started\n\n01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.060\nthe train you started miming like you were humping him and then of course I had\n\n01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.140\nto get back and then and then he would like act like he was like reading the\n\n01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:12.500\npaper walking check in the schedule on there and it was just like another\n\n01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.620\nperson would join and then there would be like it would be you know kind of\n\n01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.100\nlike a can't what do you what do you call conga line of but everybody was\n\n01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:27.220\nhumping each other we would be chanting get aboard the but fuck train I want to\n\n01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:34.900\nsay we did that for maybe hours just that night because it never stopped being\n\n01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.620\nfunny and hilarious because like Sean would be in the front and just like\n\n01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:46.020\nacting like oh yeah he's just doing taxes do this you know it's just it's a\n\n01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:52.420\nright of passage mill mill of the 20 something that's why it's problematic\n\n01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.420\nis because is very fratty and like like yeah so correct whatever I don't have to\n\n01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:00.060\nproblematize it there's a there's an industry that can do that but when we\n\n01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.740\nwere 13 we were like that and then there was another wave of it like when I was\n\n01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:08.940\n18 with the pack of dudes that I ran with and they called it fixing and yeah yeah\n\n01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.820\nhow fucked up is that fixing like I think you need to get fixed yeah we're\n\n01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.100\nabout to come over here and fix you broke shit and then literally would scoop your\n\n01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.020\nlegs out from underneath you and pin you I mean we were like it was like because\n\n01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:24.500\nthe joke becomes like well it's a joke and then it was like we were like yeah I\n\n01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:30.020\nwas like the more like like committed and the more like abusive like it was\n\n01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:34.340\njust like what like who and it's like oh that is like I look back at that and I\n\n01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.300\ngo like wow that's not you're kind of like actually weeding out maybe a bunch\n\n01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.900\nof funny people who would like go like be like well I'm not gonna hang out with\n\n01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.620\nthose people yeah like and they might be really smart and funny and like but\n\n01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.260\nanyways but I was I only brought it up because I just remember like being the\n\n01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:54.940\nkitchen at my house and my dad like sitting at the counter and like I\n\n01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:00.020\nhad a story I know it's just but it's just amazing that you grabbed me from behind\n\n01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:05.380\nand we're like pantomimeing like thrusting into me and you and you and you\n\n01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.500\nand you and you help me by the shoulders and and through clenched teeth said look\n\n01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:15.260\nat your father while I do this to you and my dad was like\n\n01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.700\nit is like I don't expect you to understand but at the time it was like\n\n01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.620\nlike this is pretty cool I mean like because it's like it was I get I mean\n\n01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:31.460\nyou kept committing I was I was like oh and like and he's like look at your\n\n01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.740\nfather look at your father and my dad was just like bright red and like just\n\n01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.700\nhad this big grin on his face which you know it was like it was like it's like\n\n01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:48.260\nmy what is wrong with me what is wrong we were 20 and it was 1950 I mean it\n\n01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:53.300\nwas like I I don't I don't I don't mean to like I look I feel like I like my\n\n01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.820\npersonal feeling it's easier because we're older like of course we want to\n\n01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:01.260\nfeel this way is that look I it's not an excuse but I do think that there\n\n01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:05.380\nshould be a little bit of awareness of like well you know and look I gotta\n\n01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.780\nactually say like you know how many times have I like kind of lambasted my\n\n01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.620\nparents for their kind of like you know behavior that became unfashionable as\n\n01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:18.460\nof the 80s and then I was you know even on this stage in my late 30s like kind\n\n01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.220\nof like oh really lay you know like I kind of like fucking play that card like\n\n01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.660\noh they did this they did that and like my mom's excuse was always like it was\n\n01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:32.220\nthe 70s everybody did it like you know like oh like you can't like now that's\n\n01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.660\nwhat comics are saying like about like we found this thing from 1989 when you\n\n01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.940\nwere at this club doing this thing and we found this sitcom or whatever and\n\n01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:44.420\nit was like well it was on NBC I don't know what to tell you and it's like kind\n\n01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.140\nof like neither it's that doesn't make it good but at the same time it's isn't\n\n01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:53.060\nit sort of like I guess we're sort of having that debate now but it's a\n\n01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.860\nshitty thing to go to and shit on the past when you could be fixing things in\n\n01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.500\nthe present yeah takes time it's a shitty thing but at the time I will say it\n\n01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.340\njust fine I mean what is that if not like the same thing is like playing heavy\n\n01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.300\nmetal music really loud like we so okay so we weren't like you know that we were\n\n01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.100\n20 and it was like that was the thing that made my dad read and it wasn't\n\n01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.780\nbecause he was like angry he didn't feel his thresholds being pushed it wasn't\n\n01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.220\nlike it wasn't like well the joke wasn't it wasn't like we were like what you\n\n01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:25.860\nweren't emasculating my dad no I was embarrassed but it was it was about\n\n01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.740\nembarrassed making somebody feel uncomfortable that was the bit you know\n\n01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.300\nbut my dad's expression was very much like I don't know how to react to you\n\n01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.140\nguys like I don't understand your humor you know which I think is a good thing\n\n01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:43.860\nculturally for the between generations it was like you guys are like I think\n\n01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:48.580\nthat people 20 years younger than me should like do comedy that makes me go\n\n01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:57.740\nlike what the fuck like which I do see all the time and I enjoy Rob what do you\n\n01:17:57.780 -->

like is like I don't know it to me it seems more impressive yeah but\n\n01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:08.100\nbecause maybe it's because I'm a big guy that would probably be between the two\n\n01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.660\nof them cast as the other guy so I feel and I feel like I'd go well what are you\n\n01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:19.860\ndoing oh a bowl of cereal you know and that's probably easier to do than the\n\n01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.580\nother guy I thought Cougan Cougan I couldn't help but think as I was\n\n01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:29.060\nwatching it I was like I if I was either these guys watching this movie at the\n\n01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:33.140\npremiere I'd be like like in my seat like kind of just cringing because I would\n\n01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:38.500\nknow that the composer was sitting somewhere in the theater and as an actor\n\n01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.300\nthat wasn't in the edit bay I'd be like I didn't know they were gonna play this\n\n01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:47.540\nmusic from front to back of the entire fucking movie I feel like you watch I\n\n01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:51.700\nmean you imagine the music stripped out this is all this music that's like hope\n\n01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:59.340\nthese guys are doing something funny now and which is just fucking death I'm\n\n01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:03.300\ngonna be brutally brutally honest just because I like I don't please don't I\n\n01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:09.540\nlike I when I was in the same rock block as 30 rock I always thought like 30 rock\n\n01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.220\nwould be that could be like the new Mary Tyler Moore it was whatever it was a\n\n01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:19.260\ngreat show Emmy winning very best comedy writers in the in sit-comery like\n\n01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:24.100\nthe it's just there was the funniest show and I just always felt like it's like\n\n01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.540\njust kitty can the tuba just like it's just just pull it out you know I spent so\n\n01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.380\nmuch time on community going like like like thank you wonderful job like that's\n\n01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.860\nvery clearly that that song makes it very clear that she's walking down the\n\n01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.380\nhallway and that she has a secret wish but like I can also see it on her face\n\n01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.620\nand I just think that if we just like get that out of there yeah that this\n\n01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.060\nspeeder bike scene in this redwood forest can do the job for itself\n\n01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:57.300\nI it's nothing worse to me then like yeah like somebody doing something quirky in\n\n01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:02.340\na movie and quirky music playing it's like like what is the what is the music\n\n01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:07.500\nthink worse think we don't understand like that's crazy yeah I think that\n\n01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.340\nmusic should be like a different channel you know it should be like it should be\n\n01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:16.660\nironic yeah well I mean it just by nature channel for technically ironic\n\n01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:25.740\nbecause because the music is there to I just heard you I gotta work I did I did\n\n01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:29.940\nI tell you like when when the Sarah Silverman program sorry got like\n\n01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:36.540\ncancelled

they just that you make the same amount of money and get the same amount\n\n01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:30.260\nof respect as a parking enforcement officer if you come back to the office\n\n01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.500\nand like everybody parked great today like they're gonna be like I don't believe\n\n01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:37.980\nyou fuck you like so there's now it's it's one of those unfortunate things so I\n\n01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.700\nwent like people have stories about like I could see the fucker waiting for me\n\n01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.020\nlike we wait for the car like well they kind of it's like yeah it's like it's\n\n01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.460\njust sad like I mean what but then I heard somebody told me like it's beyond\n\n01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:55.860\nwhat I even think it's not even a quota it's like like they work on commission\n\n01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.540\nwhich to me crosses a line where it's like well of course that's gonna that\n\n01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.620\nmeans that to me when I hear that that means that they're getting paid less\n\n01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:09.140\nthan minimum wage a quota it's like well okay probably a maybe a necessary evil\n\n01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:16.140\nI'd be able to argue cuz like what are you supposed to do but like that commission\n\n01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:21.500\nthing it's like it's like like this behavior is just like a it's a door and\n\n01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:26.260\nthen you get these like but anyways I was like wait aren't those people all cops\n\n01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.940\nsomebody was telling me this story sort of about they were watching a guy they\n\n01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.500\nwere having coffee they watch a guy classic story some of you have been in\n\n01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:40.060\nit or at least seen it the the meter the meters five seconds from running out\n\n01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:45.340\nthe parking enforcement person standing there waiting the they take their pin\n\n01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.220\nout they start writing the thing they probably use emojis now I don't know\n\n01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:56.340\nbut the person runs out I've been this guy runs out like come on I'm out here\n\n01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.740\nwith the change in my hand to do anything we used to have this thing called\n\n01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:07.620\nchange and the and by the way miss nomer changed nothing that laugh made me\n\n01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:11.340\nwant to kill myself the would have preferred silence than that pity so it\n\n01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:15.780\nchanged your life if by the way that's that was a facetious statement if you're\n\n01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:21.340\nhaving thoughts of self-harm you should talk to somebody the the the and then\n\n01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.660\nthe print you know they have the big argument cuz it's like oh when the pin\n\n01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:28.020\nhits the paper and all this stuff and and my friend said that he was there for\n\n01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.780\nthis he was watching he's having coffee is watching this thing transfixed and\n\n01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.740\nthe guy is so frustrated so outraged and he shoves the parking lot if a\n\n01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.220\nparking enforcement person and the parking enforcement person did not react\n\n01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:45.620\nlike like they're it's almost like maybe not it happens all the time but\n\n01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:51.900\nthey're just like they didn't react like they just like cool as a cucumber like\n\n01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:58.780\nlike like and they walked over to their thing and got on a cb and first I was\n\n01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.180\njust sitting there having coffee so they're there ten minutes later we're\n\n01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:09.220\nlike he just like swarms of parking enforcement people not cops just all of\n\n01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:13.580\nthe all of the parking enforcement people yeah like they all got the call you\n\n01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.580\nknow there must be like a code red like kind of thing or like someone's fucking\n\n01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:24.980\nwith the someone crossed the thin baby blue line so they all just start\n\n01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.220\nwriting tickets I don't know yeah well they apparently they didn't do anything\n\n01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:32.100\nbut it was just a show of force which you know that's it was it was a solidarity\n\n01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:36.260\nthey're like sitting there like leaning against cars like looking at the guy and\n\n01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.820\nit was like well wait aren't they cops can't isn't that assault and like no\n\n01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.140\nthey're not quite cops their officers so we started like we got online we're\n\n01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:46.380\nlike what how does this work if you're a parking enforcement if you've ever\n\n01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.500\nworked a parking for us but please like you're listening to this like I don't\n\n01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:54.420\nknow fuck right off no no I we'd love to I love to talk to you as a guest I\n\n01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.340\nthink that would be an amazing guest I think we'd love to hear your stories\n\n01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:01.740\nand they're like how that works I'm not kidding I mean don't you think that\n\n01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:05.180\nwould be like if you met a parking enforcement officer at a party wouldn't\n\n01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:10.220\nyou wouldn't you have like several questions why are you not so did you go\n\n01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:14.540\nto college that's that they're not here who invited you they're doing they're\n\n01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:17.660\ndoing a job no one no one wants to do I'm not I'm not saying like they're all\n\n01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.380\nheroes but I'm just saying like they're not come on I mean that's but but but\n\n01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:27.220\nbut we were I was like wait how come I grew up thinking that the only way to\n\n01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:31.660\nbecome one was to have the the chief tell you that your hijinks had gone on\n\n01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.940\nlong enough and that the mayor's calling from downtown like I always thought\n\n01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.860\nthat that's why I never fucked a little I always thought that like oh man these\n\n01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.260\nguys are like the worst of the worst cops like they're ready to snap like like\n\n01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:46.300\nthis guy could be it could have been mark firman yesterday like he's like\n\n01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:50.700\nwaiting for me to give him an excuse to put his like hold out twenty two on my\n\n01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:55.660\nbody and sprinkle cocaine on my face and just leave me in an alley wash off\n\n01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:59.940\nkid the murder was parked in front of your house and they're like no let him\n\n01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:05.580\ngo and now you're gonna be a parking attendant and now that would be a funny\n\n01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:09.140\nbit was like because I was I was like he's like I'm going to the website like\n\n01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.660\nhow do you become a parking enforcement officer and it was like you couldn't\n\n01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.860\nfigure it out and I was like see I told you because the list is like hidden from\n\n01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.940\nthe public and then we started riffing the list it was like well if the mayor is\n\n01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:24.060\nsick of your shit like you know like just the kind of like the the prerequisites\n\n01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.540\nof becoming a thing in web form would have been funny like the bullet points\n\n01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:35.140\nfirst you need a writ from the chief that he's been torn a new asshole yeah and\n\n01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.980\nit goes on and on from there and I'm a what am I J Leno it's not gonna it's not\n\n01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:43.580\ngonna fly I didn't really write any of them I don't care what you think I'm\n\n01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.620\ngetting over an approval addiction it's important for me to tell you to go fuck\n\n01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:52.060\nyourself it's not it's a but I I want you to not have to pay for therapy to know\n\n01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.740\nthat that shouldn't matter to you I didn't mean it I'm thinking about myself\n\n01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:01.700\nfinally\n\n01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.180\nhere's that thing about the stand in Ali movie can I warn you about something\n\n01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:12.140\nthat is going to like really bum you out as long as you don't ruin it for me\n\n01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:17.060\nbecause I wanted to try to watch it and maybe stand in Ali movie makes the\n\n01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:22.940\nincredibly curious decision to fade in on the two of them at the peak of their\n\n01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:30.180\ncareer just before it's over is a cold open and you see one scene from that so\n\n01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:35.340\nit's sort of like this is where things ended and then it goes to black and it\n\n01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:47.220\nsays 16 years later and the entire movie is them old and failed and failing and\n\n01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:57.340\ndying and that's the whole movie oh oh okay that's kind of what the synopsis of\n\n01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:05.780\nit is when you when you say when you read about it I knew that okay so you're\n\n01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:12.100\ngoing to love it I don't know yet did you not like that about it I thought it\n\n01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:17.340\nwas a strange choice just because and then you're going to say oh what do you\n\n01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:21.660\nwant well I don't want to see the day they meet you want to make I'm kind of\n\n01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:26.660\nthinking of I'm like yeah like like I'm not what am I a fucking like Phil is\n\n01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:31.620\ndying for a bit thinking like well okay can I make some assumptions here 90\n\n01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:38.100\nminutes 100 minutes give me 20 of the two of them as individuals 10 pages each\n\n01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:42.860\nlike oh like show me meeting so I'm meeting across the threshold of them\n\n01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:47.220\nworking together show them rising to prominence meet with the goddess and\n\n01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:51.420\npage 60 and fucking like and then have difficulty start to have and terrible\n\n01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:55.300\nSunder but then they choose each other over the system I mean I like we're the\n\n01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.900\nstory go I'm not saying like tell me which story happens but I'm just saying\n\n01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.940\nlike that rhythm like but I think the problem probably was that they were sort\n\n01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.460\nof like the monkeys I mean they were assembled right I got that implication\n\n01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.540\nfrom this from the movie maybe that they were placed together that was like oh\n\n01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:15.540\nyou're funny and you're funny you guys should do like a fat guy skinny guy act\n\n01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:19.220\nstill even as I say that out loud I'm like I'd love to be a fly on the wall of\n\n01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:25.100\nthat scene yeah okay because oh god this guy he's like I don't know what you\n\n01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:31.860\nwant me to say I was I I purposely didn't watch it because you and Cody said\n\n01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.460\nwe should watch it I come back from Atlanta you watch it and the last three\n\n01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:41.700\ntimes we've hung out you're telling me how shitty it is I don't even get a\n\n01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:51.500\nchance to watch it untainted you tainted it you always tainted my stuff why you\n\n01:34:51.540 --> 01:35:00.780\ngot a taint so much one more one more please tainter all right I'm sorry\n\n01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:05.900\nabout that no you're not no I didn't really like I'll tell you the truth I\n\n01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:11.900\ndidn't I had a chance to watch it and I said no we all said we were gonna watch\n\n01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:16.340\nit together and that would have been a nice moment and now we don't have that\n\n01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:22.060\nmoment because this motherfucker out he outside throwing rocks and I said wolves\n\n01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:28.980\nyeah maybe that's what's going on pencil that into your schedule yeah you're so\n\n01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:35.540\nbusy fucking with these coyotes you can't be a real friend the more you\n\n01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:42.940\nknow I like the Blues Brothers movie I think it's great I know I know it's\n\n01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:47.060\nreally I know you and you know I was really really inspired Chicago I watched\n\n01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:50.380\nit with you and you explained the whole time this is great look at this this is\n\n01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:55.940\ngreat I'm like it seems like a long time to get out of prison I love it yeah I\n\n01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:04.420\nmean what's not to love I don't watch it there you go you got one ally Blues\n\n01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:09.140\nBrothers 2000 I'd be interested for people to like watch that without having\n\n01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:14.460\nseen the Blues Brothers and like watch their face it is be like like I don't\n\n01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.460\nknow what they would be like though it was it's not it's like how did this get\n\n01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.660\nmade did I think oh did that yeah with so a lot of the audience I assume was in\n\n01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:28.340\nthat position yeah I mean it's so like it's so fucking odd so odd but to me it\n\n01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.260\nkind of here's the thing about Blues Brothers 2000 which is directed by the\n\n01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:37.660\nsame director it to me part of what Blues Brothers 2000 does is it is it shines\n\n01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:43.420\na spotlight here's the thing the spotlight on Blues Brothers is indicative\n\n01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:47.940\nof a time in our country's history when people were in love with the Blues but\n\n01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.300\nwhat are the Blues blue is a color so I intend to look at the John Bonny Ramsey\n\n01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:57.220\ncase through the lens of the chromatic spectrum there are three kinds of colors\n\n01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:01.860\nthat complement each other pink is opposite of blue blue is opposite of orange\n\n01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:08.660\nif you add the three together you get orange blue the I think Burke Ramsey\n\n01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:15.300\nand Gordon Ramsey had an orange orchard the it just because it's like the\n\n01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:20.500\nsecond one is like it's shot in HD and it's sort of like it's definitely very\n\n01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:27.420\nmuch the most incentivized to recapture the magic of the first one and it's\n\n01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:32.460\nkind of interesting to me that like when you try to recapture the magic of the\n\n01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:37.420\nfirst one you you end up with something incredibly confusing is it one of those\n\n01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.780\nmovies were just sort of like well look at them they were having a good time\n\n01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.980\nlike it's like easy writer you watch you were you're like look I'll take a flyer\n\n01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.780\non this being historical but to me it looks like guys dicking around like but\n\n01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:51.780\nmaybe let me find out it was important that they were dicking around they\n\n01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:55.820\nneeded to dick around right so important I was like okay so good movie becomes\n\n01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:00.260\nlike a little bit you got one foot out like oh it's a good movie because it\n\n01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:04.860\nsaid fuck you to Paramount or something like why did it did can I see that scene\n\n01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:09.180\nin the movie no you got to watch Dennis Hopper do acid in a cemetery okay but\n\n01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:15.100\nso Paramount hated it okay well then it's a good movie I mean at the time it\n\n01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:18.180\ndoesn't really hold up but at the time it was like different than your average\n\n01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.660\ncomedy that was on because they were a little darker and more alternative the\n\n01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:25.620\noutfits weren't like you know you had Robin Williams so there is that where\n\n01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:29.460\nthere's like three there Robin yeah yeah now I can see that and then there\n\n01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:33.380\nwasn't a lot of shit coming out of Chicago film wise so there was like a\n\n01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.820\nhome base win for all the all the comedians in the scene that was in the\n\n01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:42.740\nMidwest it'd be like if Dana Gould got famous doing a show in San Francisco\n\n01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:46.300\neverybody'd be like that fucking show was amazing in San Francisco so you got\n\n01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:51.820\ndiehard Chicagoans spread out in LA and in New York that rep that movie because\n\n01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:56.380\nfor them it's their like first like fucking those are our guys that's our\n\n01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.660\nhome team that's our movie so they quote it like Star Wars fans do I mean this\n\n01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:04.940\nis yeah this is all stuff that's not in the movie it's all stuff that's out\n\n01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:09.900\nsmeared outside the movie that it's like oh if you understood how important this\n\n01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:14.860\nmovie was to Chicago and to improv and to comedy and to a generation and to\n\n01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:19.900\nthings I read the Saturday and live like

I can't look I but I\n\n01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.660\nremember going with my friends I was I was we were still not 17 I don't know\n\n01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:43.460\nwhat we were but we wanted to see Beverly Hills cop to and we went to the\n\n01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:47.140\ntheater we bought the tickets to Project X with Matthew Broderick it's about\n\n01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:54.580\nmonkeys getting irradiated and and Matthew Broderick dealing with it and we\n\n01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:59.460\nwent into the Beverly Hills cop to theater there was it was like the it was\n\n01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:05.060\nsold out so we were like three 12 year olds sitting in the aisle in a rated our\n\n01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:12.340\nmovie so it wasn't long before we got ushered and we got ushered into the\n\n01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.620\ntheater that we bought tickets for we started watching Project X which I had\n\n01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:19.780\nnow missed the first 10 minutes of but I was immediately fucking enthralled by\n\n01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.540\nbecause it's Matthew Broderick dealing with the slow realization that he's in\n\n01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:27.060\ncharge of these monkeys and they're they're they're the experiments that\n\n01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.620\nthey're doing on them and he's supposed to take care of them in the cages he's\n\n01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.780\nlike basically a janitor in charge of these monkey cages he's like these\n\n01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:35.020\nmonkeys are super smart and he's like falling in love with them and there's\n\n01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.420\nlike a monkey trainer there and then he like he's like the threshold is him\n\n01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:41.860\nfinding out he like hangs out long enough to realize and watch what they're\n\n01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:45.700\ndoing they're putting these chimpanzees in these these little like model planes\n\n01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.700\nand then like they're basically like using them to test how far you can be\n\n01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.660\naway from an atomic bomb after it drops before it without getting cancer so\n\n01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:57.420\nthey're just irradiating the monkeys like zapping them with radioactivity and\n\n01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:00.740\nlike like Matthew Broderick has to deal with finding out that that's his job that\n\n01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:04.340\nhis friends that he's making these monkeys are like I know they're apes I\n\n01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:10.020\ndon't want to get letters from apes the the the they don't have tails or\n\n01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:17.060\nwhatever the but but and I was like and then my friends were like god damn it\n\n01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:22.220\nlike they're like in detention watching these monkeys and I'm just like god damn\n\n01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.620\nthis soundtrack oh Matthew Broderick this is like I haven't seen a performance\n\n01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:28.980\nlike this since Ferris Bueller like this guy like the Ferris Bueller like\n\n01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:34.740\nthere's a heart these are the monkeys to die and it was like the soundtrack was\n\n01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:40.740\nlike and I was like like like holding back tears and like and they're like\n\n01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:44.740\ncoast is clear let's go back and watch Eddie Murphy
