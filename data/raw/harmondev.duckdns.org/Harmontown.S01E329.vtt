00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello Town Town Dynasty, how do you feel tonight?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Oh, what's this?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Here I am in my voice.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Gotta make that lady joy.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Here I am in my voice.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Uh, I didn't expect that.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
We'll fucking roll with it though.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Welcome to Highland Town.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Oh, really?

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
If you were high and this happened to you, you'd be like, what?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's get started.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We should make everybody speak through this.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
But it's never going to everybody speak through this.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Let's make Spencer Crittenden speak through that microphone.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Spencer Crittenden.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
You know him. You love him.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
He has his own on the microphone.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, yeah. Good. How are you?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't know where I'm from.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
This thing's fucking with me.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, you're robotic.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Let's try this one.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah!

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Mix of noise for rock, rock!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, yeah.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
We love him so much.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, shit.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And just to make sure everyone's working.

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
Please give a huge round of applause for the man, the mayor, Dan Harbaugh!

01:42.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, rock guitar!

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
MC St. Patrick's Day.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
MC St. Patrick's Day.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
March 31st every day.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Even though it's after May.

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm so Irish.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh, yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
This is, uh, right.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
It's on the floor.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Thanks for coming downtown tonight.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah!

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm decked out in...

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Schrabs activating the Votron.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm decked out in Sponsored Ship.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Who sent us those, Dan?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
This is a Mi-1Z.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
This is what I'm wearing.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Mi undies!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Come on, man.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I mean, what the...

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
He's trying again.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Do you want people to be able to understand me?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I can understand you.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
They can understand me.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Like, I don't know the...

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Who can't understand what he's saying?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
We don't know what that means.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I just wanted to see it work.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I've been gone a while.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Did you notice?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
The view is amazing.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
You'll see a four-leaf clover in front of you.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Should I point at it?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Oh, that's not nice.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It's 2019.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
What's wrong with you?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
We can't be doing that.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
It just...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
This is awful.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
You're an awful person.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Paid for his Uber.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Maybe that's why that happened.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
You know, you got to earn it.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Even though I did, I did tell him to do it as well.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Just go in.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Backstage.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Discussing Mike Gags.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I hate him.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I hate him so much.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
I'm wearing a Muwanzi, and I'm...

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Sharp put his mic in a mug.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And I'm drinking out of...

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
What is it called?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Brumate brand drinkware.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
BRU with an Umlaut M-A-T-E.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Hey, Brumate is the drinkware for me.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Guys, why is that a different type of drinkware?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Because Brumate keeps drinks at the perfect temperature.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Whatever that is, that's the one it does,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
which I suppose is like context aware.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
So the first AI-powered drinkware.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, I guess...

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I mean, I guess I put some ice in it backstage,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and it's not melted yet.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I do like that they disguised it as a piece of wood.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, it's like a little baby coconut.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
It does look very nice.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
All right.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, there's not a lot to talk about.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I did have an epiphany.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I think if you wanted to run somebody against Trump

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
just to beat Trump, which I don't think is the right philosophy,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I think we should vote our conscience and just let him win.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I just focus on the Senate.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I mean, I just don't know how you're going to...

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
We, and by we, I mean every non-Nazi,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
we're a divided people.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And we should be, you know, who's United Nazis.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
It's easy.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
You just go like, oh, I love that uniform.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It's fine.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
You don't have to...

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
And they can be like, well, are you a gay Nazi?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
You can be like, yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
And they're like, come on in.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Just pretend you're not gay.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
And you can be like, OK, yeah, that's fine.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
It's easy.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
That's what we're fighting when we fight autocracy.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
We fight whatever we perceive as the bad guys.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So, of course, the toughest times you're going to be divided.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You're not going to win the election.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And I'm not going to talk about politics for the next two years

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
because it's going to get real ugly with all this primary stuff.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
You're going to be friends.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
You're going to be yelling at each other.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
It's going to break my heart.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I don't want...

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It's the worst thing.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I kept out of it when we were leading up to the thing

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
with the Bernie's and the Hillary's and stuff.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I saw it.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Well, I just said nothing.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I just said nothing.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
But one of those sides was wrong.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Also, there was a little bit of a shell shock the first time.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You were like, Jesus, this is crazy.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So you had to talk about it worse.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Now you're like, oh, it's all fucked up still.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
But even I...

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Look, I'll talk all day for the last two years.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I was like, oh, God, this is awful.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
To me, it's not even politics.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
But what am I supposed to do in this show?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Except share my life.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And if I happen to be obsessed with fucking, oh, God,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
what's happening?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
What do you want me to do?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Pretend I'm interested in frozen pizza for two years

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
and be like...

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And it's just like...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The only people that want that are...

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm not saying they're bad people,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
but I'm not even saying they're wrong

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
because I don't want to listen to a year and a half of podcasts

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
where I'm so fucking bummed out and freaked out

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
and what are we going to do?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I don't want to listen to that.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
But tough titties.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
If the world is ending, then I'm like,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
oh, this is what I thought about today.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I thought about the world ending.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
However, because I have a lot of anxieties,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
as I did during the last time,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
was like, oh, primaries are gearing up.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I was like, there's no way.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm not touching it.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm not touching this stuff.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Because it's too sad.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Because you're talking about people

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
that shouldn't beef with each other.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
It's like a socialist and watered-down liberals

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
shouldn't...

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
They cannot like each other about where to go for breakfast.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
They shouldn't be tearing each other's throats out

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
while the guys I perceive as the bad guys

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
are laughing all the way to the fucking victory line.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
But there's nothing we can do about it.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You can't demand that we unite

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
because if you could demand that we unite,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
what are you?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Probably a Nazi.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Not on it.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
It's like, who has the power to do that?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
They'd be like, oh, everybody, no matter what you think,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
lay your shit aside.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
But anyway, this is the one thing I'll say.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
This is an epiphany.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Here's who you run against, Donald Trump.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
If you're playing that game where you just want to knock him out,

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
like, oh, who are we going to run?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Liam Neeson.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Did it.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Think about it.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
You're going to knock his base in half.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Old white guy, so then they're confused.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And then he's racist.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So they're like, I love it.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
But we only know he's racist because he was honest about it.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
He was like, I used to be racist.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't want to be.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And then some people are going to be like,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
oh, that's kind of cooler than being secretly racist.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And then you would shuffle all the groups.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But I think you'd come out on the other side.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And he's European.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
So you'd have to do a reverse birther movement.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
But that's cool.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Do that.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Reverse birther.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Hashtag reverse birther.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
You have to be proven where you weren't born.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
He could be like, I'm not Irish.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Do I sound Irish?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Do I sound like a...

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And then he could go on the view and be like, yeah,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
it doesn't matter if I'm racist.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It doesn't matter if I'm racist.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
And people still like him.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
They would be like, well, what do we like about it?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
He could just be like, I don't care if you get an abortion.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It doesn't matter if you get an abortion.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't care if you get an abortion.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
You used to do that.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
You used to.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
There was an old episode where you were doing like Liam Neeson.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And you were like, it doesn't matter.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
It's like so minstrel that you're wearing that and doing Liam Neeson.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I saw Dan Harmon's podcast.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
That's not cool.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Dan.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
The green face.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
The IRA is gonna fuck you.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, come on.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
IRA.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Don't do that.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Dan, do you...

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I know you have opinions about things,

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
but do you think Spencer has enough cable for the show?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I mean, we got like a couple of spools here.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I got 3,000 series.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
This is 30 meters of XLR cable.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I don't think it's enough, man.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I think you need at least...

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, what's the run of this place?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Like 50 feet, 60 feet?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Let's walk it.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
You do.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay, you could do that.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I want to sit.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Spencer and I accidentally both ordered wolf urine from Amazon.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You know, when you show up at work,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
and you're both ordering wolf urine.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh, yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Mine came.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
We should open it up and see if it has documentation.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, go get the...

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Let me go meet him back.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, I got a part...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Also, there's a parking ticket in my jeans.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't know who's supposed to take care of that.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Certainly not me.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
You're going to fuck up the show.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I kind of...

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
It's something like you can look forward to when you...

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
If you ever...

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Like a little privileged perk.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Like, I kind of like...

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I get a little stoked when I get a parking ticket.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm rich.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Because I'm like...

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
What's that?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
What are you trying to do to me?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Scare me?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Like, take your fucking valet money.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
It pays for a kid's textbooks.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah, I bet.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah, I'm sure that money goes right over to someone who needs

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
a fucking fucking fucking machine.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
I try to pay him within like 20 minutes of getting them.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I'll drive right to the motherfucker.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
He'll be like, how's it going?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, here.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It does feel like they hate that, right?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I guess we're the suckers.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Because we're like so stoked about paying our parking tickets on time

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
that we think we're like, in your face.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And they're like, oh, no.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
But for sure, they want you to not pay it right away.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It's like a poor people trap.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Man, I was poor once, you guys.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
And it was fucking incredible how hard...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It was like, holy shit, man.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
They designed the whole system.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Don't get so mad that you storm my house.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
But I remember getting parking tickets and being like,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
okay, well, I have a lot to do today.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
And I have no assistant, let alone two.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
And if I did, they can't write a check.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It'll bounce.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You're just stuck at this thing.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I guess I'll pay this sooner or later.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You put it in your apartment somewhere.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You know that shit's like fucking gone.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And they expect it to be.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
That's what they put you on the 21 days.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Do you guys know about there's this Terry Pratchett quote about this?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I have it.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
The reason the rich were so rich was because they spent less money.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Take boots, for example.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Vymes earned $38 a month plus allowances.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
A really good pair of leather boots cost $50.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of okay for a season or two,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
and leaked like hell when the cardboard cave out,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
cost about $10.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Those are the boots he bought and wore until the soles were so thin

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
that he could tell where he was and ink more pork on a fucking night.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
But the thing is that good boots lasted for years and years.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
A man who could afford $50 had a pair of boots

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
that'd be keeping his feet dry in 10 years time while the poor man

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
who could only afford cheap boots would have spent $100 on boots

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
in the same time and would still have wet feet.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, I mean, I can upgrade that in a much simpler way.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
We live in Los Angeles where literally everyone over a certain income

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
gets free shoes.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
If you work in the industry, at some point you go over to the Nike place

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
and they give you a duffle bag and you walk around and fill your bag

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
with Nike shit.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
I've never done it because I fucking care about you.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
They never invited me. They never invited me.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
But I remember when we first moved here from Milwaukee,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
they called it the Free Shoes for Rich People Program.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
That's what they call it, glibly.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
What was it called?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Free Shoes for Rich People Program.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Why am I repeating my show for you?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Like, I can't expect you to pay attention.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
What are you doing back there?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You're playing Minesweeper?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
No.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Don't touch my ass.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
You know, five years from now, people are going to know that that's not cool.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Like, it's funny now because we're both dudes or whatever.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But five years from now, it's going to be like,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
we were going to have fixed everything but that shit.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
And you're going to be rounded up, taken into the street and fucking Weinstein.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Boom.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
And I'm going to laugh.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I'm going to write so many brave blogs about what it was like

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
to fucking stand here and silently shudder.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
That sounded like I was maybe parodying victims.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
That wasn't my intention.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I wasn't like, then I'll do that.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Like, those bullshit people do.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm with you. I'm with you. As an abuser, I got to be with you.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
How is it?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
You tell me, baby.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
That would be abuse.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
Tell me, tell me, tell me if I'm sexual, Brandon, or you're fired.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, what a beautiful man. Listen.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
It's going to be three years before that's not cool.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
And if I tell you why two years from now, I'm going to be fired.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
But is it keeping you warm?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Is it 100% cotton?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
No, I think it might be micromodal.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
It feels about three times softer than cotton.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
It's breathing. I have a shirt under it.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm in my unders, my regular meundies.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
I took my pants off, but I'm not getting overheated.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
He dropped a water bottle, sir.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
He got it.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Don't harass him. He's done nothing wrong.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Welcome to the show, sir. I'm very sorry.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Liam Neeson, do you think it's a good idea?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
He's foreign. I know, but just suspend your disbelief.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Do we just found out Trump's dad's from Germany?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
That's got to be unconstitutional.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
That's not illegal. Yeah, that's illegal.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
What will you spend your time on instead of how do you get away from the politics?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Fascinating. It is crazy. The amount of shit that you're not aware.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Like, I don't know. Like the weird shit that you hear mentioned and you're like,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
what buddy gig say what like Pete, but a gig.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I heard. I got I heard him mentioned by Dave Kline said, like, have you heard

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
about Pete, but a gig? I don't know if I'm saying it, right?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
He's like he's a gay veteran, right? But a judge.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
But it's yeah, I put it. Mayor of the town in Indiana, something like that.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
He seems like a cool person.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
I don't know. He seems like a centrist. What does that mean?

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Centrist? Yeah, what's that mean? It means equivocating to conservatives.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Equivocated. Yeah, maybe that's the mall.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm sure that's what that's the heartbreak are going to go through.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh, I love this guy and the part of your brain is going to be like, do I love him

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
because it feels like he's got a shot or do I love him because yeah,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
my here's what I'm going to do is not my advice to anybody because I'm just going to

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
like, I'm just going to look quietly and be like, all right, I'm going to vote for

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I'm going to vote for somebody. As far as the presidential race,

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm just going to pick somebody. I'm even if like, even if I think they're going to

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
get like 5,000 votes, like I'm just going to be I'm voting my conscience.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I guess I have to qualify that though, because even that's an inflammatory statement

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
right now because you guys are like, how do you know two years from now you're not

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
look, I guess, okay, well, I'll lick my finger, put it in the air if it feels like it's a fucking

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
intense if there's somebody that's been picked, I'll do what I always do.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
I'll go up to that one big boulder, you know, I, you know, full disclosure,

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
I was I was doing the Bernie thing until the very moment that the system that

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
were supposed to work, you know, said no, he's done now and then I pulled the lever

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
for Hillary and it was like, this is all part of honestly, it was just me voting

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
for like, I don't think this guy's a good idea. I could see that going bad.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
I don't want to have to like serve hemlock tea to ice agents and stuff, but

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
you know, because you know, I'm going to be first, like, you know, they round up and

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I know you're going like, oh, Dan, what are you saying? You're an intellectual.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Is that what you're saying? Like, like, yeah, compared to, you know, there's a

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
curve here. It's like, if the emperor can't read, then like, I qualify as like an

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
academic. I'm going to be shot before they pick a group to sneak out.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Like, they grab the guys like me first, they grab the hippies and teachers and the

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
scientists. They grab the hippies first, then you.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
So I'm already done, so I'm not trying to do nothing but just like preserve my life.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
The question is, what else are you doing? Like, do you have a...

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
I bought a gun. No, no, no, no. I mean, I mean, other than...

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Oh, oh, oh, I'm composing a lot of music. There you go. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah, it makes me very happy. Yeah. Will you take lessons? Do you think? Or do you need to?

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
I don't, I don't know. I'm not going to rule anything out. Do you teach lessons?

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
Because I've got some spare time coming up. Do you want to learn to play an instrument?

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
Or do you just want lessons? I just want, I just want lessons.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I definitely would say that my eyes would be melted by now if I wasn't drinking out of a

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
bloom house. What's it called? Broomate. Broomate. B-R-U-M-A-T-E. B-R-U with

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Unlots. Use the promo code Harmontown. Brewhouse. Broomate. Broomate.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
It's like your buddy. Yeah. It sounds like the name of a product that has to do

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
with brooms. Oh, it was your broom hungry? No, my broomate. Keep your broomate.

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
For all you dads. Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I didn't want to do spoilers, but like, I am working on this thing on the side.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
I'm not going to have it on my phone. It would be on my iPad, but...

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
The community movie. But there's this kid. Did I play this last time?

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Maybe I didn't. I can't remember. No.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, there you go. Oh, I forgot. There's no... There's a very little signal in here.

20:34.000 --> 20:44.000
Well, this guy, this musician dude, he, remember that song I played?

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
I think I talked about this. The song that I played, and then at the end of it, I was like,

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
oh, my baby ducks. Yes. There's this guy that he made... He did lyrics to it.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
He did a whole thing, and he played a little acoustic guitar. And I didn't want to spoil it.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
I was going to surprise him by sending him a thing, or like, because I took his lyrics track

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
into the software that I'm using to... And I was just like saying, oh, can I just put his stuff

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
into one of my stuff and add to it and stuff. Actually, a lot more challenging,

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
because tempos are always different and stuff. It's kind of a big deal. It's challenging.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
Trying to do that with the Mike Cravello theme song. I tried to drag the Mike Cravello theme song

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
into an editor. I was like, oh, I'll just figure out what tempo it is, and then I can lay shit on top of it.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
I could do a cool Mike Cravello rap or something, but it's really hard.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Because you can't really get rid of his guitar, right? You can't scrub his guitar.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
The baby ducks guy? Yeah. Yeah, that is a challenge. His guitar is in there, and he's like...

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
He's kind of changing tempo and stuff like that, but I did a pretty good job.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
I can't play that now, whatever, but... Yeah, anyways, I'm playing... I'm doing music.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
What is it? What's wrong? What can we do for you?

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Like, how can the show be made better for the show-ruiner?

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
If you're at home right now, Schrab's mouth is wide open.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
You're just talking about the thing, and then you're like, I'm not going to play it now.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
You talk about it, you get us all titillated, and then you're not going to...

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Sounds great.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
Oh, shit. Hold on, buddy. Hold on. I'm almost there.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
We're coming. His username is longsocksilver.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Apparently, he was going for a reference that a couple people got.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't know what it is.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Instead of John's...

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
God damn it. No, I'm not going to do this to you, buddy.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
I'm going to start it on... I'm sorry.

22:48.000 --> 23:02.000
He deserves better.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
Oh, my baby ducks. Oh, my baby ducks are in a fucking row.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
Oh, my baby ducks. Oh, my baby ducks.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah, there he is. Longsocksilver. Longsocksilver.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
Longsocksilver is a different guy entirely, but I recommend following him on Instagram as well.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Looks like he's in... Where is he?

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
I see a geotag here somewhere. Who cares? You can type him in.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Who cares?

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
There he is in New York. He must be somewhat of a successful musician. He's traveling around.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Traveling?

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
I wonder what his real name is. There he is in Brooklyn.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Do you think a New York guy thinks I'm cool enough to do my song?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Looks like he's in the Brooklyn area here.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
He's in all five boroughs.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
My music is kind of fucking legit.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Like dude, right now there's like 13 old black dudes in Memphis doing my baby duck.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Shut up.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You talked to that?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I was gonna tell you.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It's Brandon. Don't keep this from me.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
There's like a harmonica version.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Ah!

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah, and then Silo gets on one. It's really weird.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Seam note?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Silo.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Silo.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, fucking Silo. God, I love him.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Oh, yeah.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
You and get him go way back.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You love the Dungeon family.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Love the Dungeon family.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
You love outcast.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I love outcast.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Yeah.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
He loves it.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Hey, yeah.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Remember that fucking?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Hey, yeah.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
See, we danced that entire summer to that song wherever it.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Jeff hates that song, man.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah, because we played.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
He hates a million times.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
We ran in this pack.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
And I have about 14 people at its largest.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
And that summer we would dance to that song until like eight in the morning almost.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
We would go back to either our friend Jerry Miner's house or your house.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
And we'd fucking, you've never seen so many old people in their own private bar.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
It was like, it was like parrot heads, but for that goddamn song.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Parrot head.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Good times, man.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Jimmy Buffett fans.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Those are good times.

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
I had a pitch at Netflix today and I was so grateful that they moved their place.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Amazon still hanging out in Santa Monica.

25:48.000 --> 25:57.000
Amazon, the people that invented everyone staying in their house forever are the remaining

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
production office that you have to drive eight hours to get to.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
They are Los Angeles's practice pitch.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
Now, eight is an exaggeration, but six is absolutely not.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Depending on what time of day you're leaving.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
I mean, and usually your pitch at Amazon is either at 9.30 a.m., which means you have

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
to leave at four or it's at 4.30, which means you're getting home at 9 p.m.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Right on a Friday.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
These guys, I mean, they're, they're just like, look, we're selling.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
We're selling spatulas.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
We're making TV.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
We do whatever we want.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Like, like they come to us baby and like, all right.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
So I had this idea, this robot, made me meat to the fire hydrant.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
And they're just like it's there.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
They're God love them, but they're just like it's a practice pitch.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Man.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
It's like, there's nothing.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
I don't know.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
There's people that sell shows to Amazon, I guess.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
I don't know what they do.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Maybe the noon spot.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.660
So you leave at 10 a.m. You get there at noon and then they're like they pop an

27:03.660 --> 27:07.340
Adderall like like like halfway through the drive. Yeah, and then they just fucking

27:07.340 --> 27:11.820
peek in there and they're like robot fire hydrant buy it!

27:13.100 --> 27:19.260
Wow that sounds like it sucks. Wow that sounds really bad. That sounds like a

27:19.260 --> 27:24.700
really bad situation that you're going through. That's awful. That's so that's

27:24.700 --> 27:30.180
so that's so bad. That's terrible. Just move your offices to Amazon like or

27:30.180 --> 27:34.900
send one of your drones over. Yeah. To hear my pitch. Yeah. Like I'm never gonna

27:34.900 --> 27:38.620
have a show on Amazon. Come on. Never. We don't know that you look like an Amazon

27:38.620 --> 27:43.460
guy. Come on we all know the Amazon brand. They have a completely different

27:43.460 --> 27:50.540
onesie. Thanks those very kind of you audience. Do you think you'll ever sit

27:50.540 --> 27:55.780
down tonight? I don't know man. I honestly I'm not usually this kind of guy

27:55.780 --> 28:01.740
but whatever upsets you. Oh shit. Like honestly I could kind of tell like I was

28:01.740 --> 28:04.380
sort of thinking in my head I'm laying my cards on the table because I'm an

28:04.380 --> 28:10.540
honest person like I was like oh Schrab fucking he's sat behind me because he

28:10.540 --> 28:14.260
thought that would be annoying and I'm like what I'm just gonna stand here all

28:14.260 --> 28:18.780
night so that he's fucking upstaged and it's gonna drive him nuts because he

28:18.780 --> 28:23.140
if he switches chairs he's admitting he wants to be looked at which will be the

28:23.140 --> 28:28.060
biggest fucking weakness. That's his kryptonite is admitting he wants people

28:28.060 --> 28:37.660
to like him. Wow. Yeah Schrab. Yeah that is a weakness. Yeah well just say it I

28:37.660 --> 28:41.740
want people to like me. I'd like people to like me. Do you want me to like you?

28:41.740 --> 28:48.820
Sure. Yeah. Fucking around. You fucking around all the time for my good here. I'm

28:48.820 --> 28:51.980
sitting here. You're playing on your phone the whole drive over. You're

28:51.980 --> 28:58.140
complaining. Oh I'm sorry. The boober two miles away. I'm waiting outside catching

28:58.140 --> 29:05.940
a death. So basically what we have is you are the Amazon offices and you are

29:05.940 --> 29:10.460
Dan Harmon at three o'clock on a Friday. Yeah. Alright I'll move. I'll move from

29:10.460 --> 29:15.340
Santa Monica to Burbank for you. I just want to point out that I think that

29:15.340 --> 29:19.700
Schrab's that here because that was the special chair. Is that is that the wolf

29:19.700 --> 29:25.460
you're in? Oh yeah. This baby's got some amount of ounces. You know I had foresight

29:25.460 --> 29:29.380
I would have put the wolf you're in in the brew mate and see if it stayed at

29:29.380 --> 29:33.740
wolf. It warms it up to like piping hot for like a drug test. Do you think it

29:33.740 --> 29:38.500
needs to be hot to work? Do you think you think they just to make all that

29:38.500 --> 29:43.420
that they so dark they have like a bunch of will we go cross country. It's like

29:43.460 --> 29:49.300
coke. This is a car. I think this wolf works in sales. Like they refuse to

29:49.340 --> 29:54.260
a lot of coffee. We're having our own yeah. What's going on over here. Sorry guys

29:54.300 --> 29:57.420
talking about wolf pee. It's like like what that's not interesting enough.

29:57.460 --> 30:01.980
That's clearly the best substance on stage. We were talking about it, but we

30:02.020 --> 30:05.780
were talking about how they get it. Oh yeah. I was wondering that too. That is

30:05.780 --> 30:13.140
you must jerk them off in exchange for pee later right. They're like they're

30:13.180 --> 30:18.420
like oh and the wolf's like you want to do like they put a cup in the in the

30:18.460 --> 30:22.260
in the room with the wolf. They come back piss all over the floor. They slowly

30:22.300 --> 30:28.380
over 20 years. They figured it out like the wolf is training them. They go. They

30:28.420 --> 30:35.380
leave like a cap fancy magazine. I don't know what wolves jerk off to the

30:35.380 --> 30:38.180
wolf. The wolf gradually like starts filling the cup in response to

30:38.220 --> 30:44.740
increasingly sexual behavior. Then you're home free. I don't know Michael. How

30:44.780 --> 30:49.780
come Michael always gets more wolf pee in the cup. Oh he's wearing those short

30:49.820 --> 30:50.260
shorts.

30:54.180 --> 30:58.540
So I know I know you guys are worried you're like is the wolf gay because then

30:58.580 --> 31:03.420
I can't laugh at it right. No it's a straight wolf. What are you I know that

31:03.420 --> 31:07.940
it seems like I don't know but why do you have wolf pee. I have wolf because

31:07.980 --> 31:12.540
I have a coyote problem so it seems like a like a weird joke is going to happen

31:12.580 --> 31:16.940
here because it's like is this going to attract wolves and like do you eventually

31:16.980 --> 31:20.620
need. I mean I know they sell bear pee. It was weird like they're they every kind

31:20.660 --> 31:25.820
of animal out there has pee for sale. Obviously humans are selling the pee.

31:25.860 --> 31:29.860
I don't mean that wolves are getting this is exploitative but yeah. How do we

31:29.860 --> 31:34.900
know it's wolf pee. Of course we don't know. Of course but here's what I want

31:34.940 --> 31:40.100
to know. What is human pee chopped liver like what if in a world where like oh

31:40.140 --> 31:44.380
the coyote is going to go like you smell that a wolf took a pee here run for the

31:44.420 --> 31:49.180
hills. What that you're in my backyard. I invented bulldozers. What the fuck.

31:50.580 --> 31:55.380
Well fucking like fear my wrath. I'm like destroying the planet with my pee like

31:55.380 --> 32:00.620
fucking run baby. But you said you should be like smells like an alphabet. It

32:00.660 --> 32:05.940
might work. I have I tried it. I well yes I have because I'm an alcoholic.

32:05.980 --> 32:09.660
There's a lot of my pee in my backyard. Can we smell that. If anything it's

32:09.700 --> 32:13.180
attracting that they probably think I'm a coyote. Can we open it and smell it. I

32:13.220 --> 32:18.180
don't want we do that. I don't want to and certainly let's not lose any of it.

32:18.220 --> 32:24.020
Okay. Y'all about to watch a nigga go crazy. Two years you got left to say

32:24.020 --> 32:34.940
that word. No I can say it as much as I want longer it's it's it's it's it's

32:34.980 --> 32:38.340
interesting. That was a genuine reaction. Yeah, yeah, it really was. It was a very

32:38.380 --> 32:42.340
strong or I would say an arch reaction strong reaction. But did you notice it

32:42.380 --> 32:46.700
wasn't like immediate nausea like I wasn't like it was like it was just

32:46.740 --> 32:51.420
incredibly strong gerbils. Yeah, okay. It smells a little bit like a hamster

32:51.420 --> 32:55.340
cage like your shavings or something. I was like gerbils. Oh, is it you can

32:55.380 --> 32:59.980
smell it over there. Ah, well don't play that up. You know we're we're you know

33:00.020 --> 33:03.100
people will start going. Oh good. We get to complain about something. You know,

33:03.140 --> 33:09.860
is it they love so many millennial. It's like roofing. I like it. Does it say it

33:09.900 --> 33:14.020
repels millennials. I don't we don't need to do that. I got all these empty

33:14.060 --> 33:18.340
seats. We need. We need what attracts them. We need like Pokemon pee. Oh,

33:18.340 --> 33:24.260
incense jobs. We need to move the show to Sunday jobs jobs jobs. The smell job

33:24.300 --> 33:24.820
pee

33:26.740 --> 33:29.460
property is bar availability pee.

33:31.220 --> 33:34.660
Oh, it's called a you guys. We took a survey. Some of you may have taken it

33:34.700 --> 33:38.580
and the data seems to suggest agree or disagree. Maybe with your applause if you

33:38.620 --> 33:42.820
feel moved to do you. But although this is going to be skewed. Exactly. You're

33:42.820 --> 33:49.220
here. Yeah, but like I like like what would you prefer if we moved to Sunday

33:49.260 --> 33:54.540
night like the the tapings. This right. Well, this is silence because these are

33:54.580 --> 33:58.220
the people here. Okay, this is this man. This is two nuns and a priest clapping

33:58.260 --> 34:02.900
right. Okay, so we found the people that love it that it's on Monday Monday

34:02.940 --> 34:08.340
crew. Okay, well you guys seem nice. I don't I don't I don't care. I don't

34:08.340 --> 34:13.780
need to sell out a show about me talking about wolf pee. But we were we were we

34:13.820 --> 34:16.860
were looking at the data that we took. We took a survey. Maybe it was among just

34:16.900 --> 34:21.380
fans in general or something because there was there seemed to be kind of a

34:21.420 --> 34:27.380
a a suggestion from the data that that people would be thrilled if we moved to

34:27.420 --> 34:33.820
Sunday nights. But I don't know who who who you guys polled. Was it listeners or

34:33.820 --> 34:39.340
was it attendees? I don't know the methodologies in question. The wolf pee

34:39.380 --> 34:47.180
label is very DIY very Etsy. It says impact font going on. It's it's it. Yeah,

34:47.220 --> 34:53.700
it was almost like a comic sans serif under the logo that said the logo says

34:53.740 --> 34:58.380
wolf pee in impact font one hundred percent. Wolf you're in impact font beneath

34:58.380 --> 35:04.020
that territorial marking sent in like aerial bold in red. And then there's a

35:04.060 --> 35:07.540
photo of a wolf. But then there's a pretty impressive logo of a silhouette of

35:07.580 --> 35:12.820
a wolf in mid howl and it says like in really proud confident letters at a

35:12.860 --> 35:22.780
fucking striking rakish angle original since nineteen eighty six to do my

35:22.780 --> 35:28.340
amy vice theme. Yeah, it's this pee's got cocaine in it man and then it says under

35:28.380 --> 35:33.060
that in like a very comic sans serif font creates the illusion that a wolf is

35:33.100 --> 35:39.900
nearby creates the illusion. Oh yeah predator pee dot com a tradition of

35:39.940 --> 35:48.220
quality. A tradition of quality. You're in bad bad bad bad title. That's not a

35:48.220 --> 36:01.540
good title predator pee honey. You got your package from predator pee. Oh, the

36:01.580 --> 36:06.900
label was very discreet. I was. I was. I was happy to see with a name like

36:06.940 --> 36:11.340
predator pee. You better be discreet. Yeah, or you're going to get some my ball.

36:11.380 --> 36:15.860
It would be really impressive. There's a nice Cuban here. Oh yeah. That's

36:15.860 --> 36:19.820
impressive. I thought you meant the house brew brew mate brew mate. How much

36:19.860 --> 36:24.820
pee do you need to convince a coyote more than this. There's a wolf in your

36:24.860 --> 36:28.900
backyard. I don't know. We opened the bottle and fifty people almost like

36:28.940 --> 36:32.980
left and they're not even coyotes. A tradition of quality. You're in since

36:33.020 --> 36:37.340
nineteen eighty six. I just wanted to read that. Okay, twenty five directions

36:37.340 --> 36:46.620
of predator pee liquid to create a pee remiter. No, no, no, really you mother

36:46.660 --> 36:55.740
fuckers. Yeah, I'm proud of them. Yeah, they're like the Bartles and James of

36:55.780 --> 36:58.380
of pee like that. I don't know. They're just like they're like look we saw

36:58.420 --> 37:00.860
wolf pee like we're not going to be refused nicks. You know we're not going

37:00.900 --> 37:06.740
to like call ourselves like industrial sent harvests. You know like is that

37:06.740 --> 37:11.300
Bartles and James people in the business need pee. We got pee. We're here's a

37:11.340 --> 37:15.060
set up a pee remiter. Have fun with pee. It's like like make pee part of your

37:15.100 --> 37:19.660
world like like pee. He used to be the state of the art, you know, before

37:19.700 --> 37:23.340
lasers and fucking things and guess what coyotes don't care about your lasers.

37:23.380 --> 37:26.820
They probably would if you shot them with one speaking of which. Okay, so I

37:26.860 --> 37:31.620
bought this and I also bought a slingshot, but I'm not going to aim for

37:31.620 --> 37:39.860
the coyotes. I just got but I got like a laser guided slingshot. It's crazy. The

37:39.900 --> 37:43.100
illustration of the Amazon thing I sent to Camille. He probably was offended,

37:43.140 --> 37:46.540
but because the guy kind of looked like Kumail, like, like,

37:46.580 --> 37:51.540
like, because he had his head down. It's like the other photos. It's like I

37:51.580 --> 37:55.140
just like some doofy Italian guy, but he had his head at the right angle. I

37:55.180 --> 37:59.500
just like really looked like Kumail. This is I think this endorsement. You text

37:59.500 --> 38:05.020
him a lot. Just when I just when I want to what are you going to hit with that

38:05.060 --> 38:09.260
slingshot? I'm just going to I just got I'm just going to I just want to because

38:09.300 --> 38:14.060
here's the thing. Okay, the coyote is how you know it's fucked up. You already

38:14.100 --> 38:18.060
trying to back away. No, no, no, no. I'm going to it's an alternative to throwing

38:18.100 --> 38:22.020
rocks. I'm 46. Like I here's what happened to me two nights ago. Okay. This

38:22.060 --> 38:26.380
is why I ordered the slingshot. These things, you know, I'm just protecting

38:26.380 --> 38:30.220
my babies. I'm not going to do anything violent to another animal, but like I

38:30.260 --> 38:35.100
can't as a mom's laws, like I can't by inaction allow violence to happen to

38:35.140 --> 38:40.020
my my my animals. So like the coyotes started coming around probably refugees

38:40.060 --> 38:43.900
from the fire. Nobody's fault. I got video of one of them because they came

38:43.940 --> 38:47.740
out in the day. Beautiful creature. I expected them to look more like crazy,

38:47.780 --> 38:53.580
like mangy like resident evil zombie dogs the way they sound. But they look

38:53.580 --> 38:57.220
kind of like, yeah, they're just they have like deer pelt kind of things are

38:57.260 --> 39:00.700
like rabbit like they're kind of like beautiful camouflage like with these

39:00.740 --> 39:04.820
big pointy ears and a big fox. Yeah. And they're all they're all genetically

39:04.860 --> 39:09.020
compatible with wolves and dogs and stuff. The whole genus is like just a big

39:09.060 --> 39:12.140
free for all. I guess that I guess probably all genuses are I mean we're in

39:12.180 --> 39:17.020
the homo genus. It's just that we fucking genocided all the other. We had coyotes

39:17.060 --> 39:22.300
and wolves to our sapiens at one point and we just fucking scrubbed them out. We

39:22.300 --> 39:25.020
were like you guys want to go to a rave and the Neanderthals were like what's

39:25.060 --> 39:33.740
that we're like fuck you idiot fucking no tweeting fucking caveman ass. So glad

39:33.780 --> 39:38.700
we stopped doing that to other cultures. Oh yeah. What are you doing Neanderthal

39:38.740 --> 39:44.460
I'm making a dreamcatcher to bury with my lifelong mate because I love her and

39:44.500 --> 39:46.980
believe in an afterlife. Fuck you. I can't hear you over the sound of me

39:46.980 --> 39:55.140
killing you. That's what happened. We were the killing ones. Yeah. Happy. You

39:55.180 --> 40:01.700
woke now. You're Hitler babies by proxies going back 5000 millennia. Don't

40:01.740 --> 40:08.420
look it up. To create a P-rimiter saturate scent tags. Oh great. So hidden

40:08.460 --> 40:16.100
costs. I didn't order any scent tags. Boy or fill a or fill 33 day dispensers.

40:16.100 --> 40:22.460
There's these fucking P barons. P baron. Wait a minute and hang and I think I

40:22.500 --> 40:31.460
know what the P dispenser is a hard day. Oh I mean come on. It's a break. You

40:31.500 --> 40:37.820
got to buy a go get a dispenser order it. It's a yeah. Exactly. It's a bucket

40:37.860 --> 40:42.180
with a hole in it. So there you go. Oh you do. It's a dick. It's a dick. Dick.

40:42.180 --> 40:49.060
It's a dick. It's a dick. I was right. It's a dick. It's a fucking with a

40:49.100 --> 40:51.900
hole in it. What is your dick look like? All right. Well this isn't going to

40:51.940 --> 40:56.460
work. This isn't going to work. I know why not just add like one of those

40:56.500 --> 41:01.340
fucking spray bottle tops to it. There is that. Okay. Jesus. Predator P yard

41:01.380 --> 41:05.220
cover is designed to make it easy to spread Predator P for applications on

41:05.260 --> 41:08.980
lawns, flower beds, gardens and other areas where creating a P-rimiter would

41:08.980 --> 41:16.740
be or impractical. Jar for pet training, saturate a 10 square foot diameter area

41:16.780 --> 41:21.180
to help you direct pets to the areas of your yard that you designate as pet

41:21.220 --> 41:26.180
restrooms. So make those smell like wolf pee. Make the pet restrooms smell like

41:26.220 --> 41:29.140
wolf pee? That's what it said, right? I don't. It doesn't say. It says your

41:29.180 --> 41:34.940
dogs love wolf pee. No, it says what it says is saturate a 10 square foot

41:34.940 --> 41:40.820
diameter area. Oh, so that's the P-rimiter. Well, I don't know. I don't

41:40.860 --> 41:44.860
know. So a square diameter is what they want. Oh, yeah help you direct pets to

41:44.900 --> 41:50.180
the areas of your yard. So I think the areas of your yard are are wolf pee

41:50.220 --> 41:54.180
free. Right. Yeah, I think the dogs are like shit. There's a wolf shit. There's

41:54.220 --> 41:58.900
a wolf wolves everywhere. Yeah, right. I can pee here. Like I'm not going to do

41:58.940 --> 42:02.460
that to my dogs. My dogs know to pee wherever they want. I think we just

42:02.460 --> 42:07.900
need to get that that that that wall area kind of peed up. That is real dark

42:07.940 --> 42:13.420
pee. Yeah, got a slingshot. Oh, because here's why. So don't yeah, I'm not a

42:13.460 --> 42:20.500
maniac. I these things come around. The dogs freak out. They like want to go

42:20.540 --> 42:24.980
out there and talk to them and all the stuff. Right. Okay. So used to be like,

42:24.980 --> 42:32.940
okay, going back like six weeks, three months, maybe like, oh, they make this

42:32.980 --> 42:36.620
fucking racket. It's been getting more intense, like very aggressive coyote

42:36.660 --> 42:42.420
behavior happening. And I go downstairs, turn the kitchen light on. They go

42:42.460 --> 42:51.460
quiet. So then, you know, a little after that, like two days a week later, turn

42:51.500 --> 42:54.300
the kitchen light on. Nope, that's not going to work anymore. Go out the

42:54.300 --> 42:58.140
back door. Okay, now they shut up and so on and so forth from there, like

42:58.180 --> 43:04.380
leading to me with a fucking like stick going like shut up. And and then the

43:04.420 --> 43:08.140
most humiliating. This is why I bought a weapon now from Amazon is because I'm

43:08.180 --> 43:14.340
not I'm like, dude, like, this is really humiliating. Good. Like me standing on

43:14.380 --> 43:21.140
a ladder, like, like shaking a stick at them and going shut up and then going

43:21.140 --> 43:29.420
like like I felt like I already have a small penis. It shrank like into my

43:29.460 --> 43:34.260
abdomen. Like my penis is in one of my nipples now. Like like I got cucked out

43:34.300 --> 43:39.060
by some fucking monster dogs and you think that this slingshot you will

43:39.100 --> 43:42.740
look as I went. So I was like, okay, I'm going to throw rocks. So here's an

43:42.780 --> 43:47.220
incredible thing. There's no rocks. Like I was. Did they phase those out? Like I

43:47.260 --> 43:49.780
was like when I was 10 years old, it seemed like there were rocks everywhere.

43:49.780 --> 43:54.580
Big rocks are inimical bull. Is that a word? What does that mean? Sure ad for

43:54.620 --> 43:58.820
society? It was I looked all over. I couldn't believe how hard it was to

43:58.860 --> 44:03.140
find a rock. I thought is that progress or is that you think they're phasing

44:03.180 --> 44:06.020
them out because you could do you get hit someone with them and stuff. They

44:06.060 --> 44:08.940
don't want people just like to be able to break into someone's car with just

44:08.980 --> 44:13.140
a piece of the environment. I believe Schrab is proposing to you. You should

44:13.180 --> 44:17.340
use. That's what I did. I went to my ice maker. I got a bucket ice. I threw ice

44:17.340 --> 44:21.500
at him after after about five minutes of throwing ice. They stopped. I'm pretty

44:21.540 --> 44:26.420
sure because they were like, thank you. That's better. I was dehydrated. So you're

44:26.460 --> 44:29.740
you're hitting them with ice. You're not hitting them. You think I'm like man

44:29.780 --> 44:33.220
enough to hit a coyote in the dark with ice. I don't know where you are or where

44:33.260 --> 44:37.180
they are in the situation. Exactly. Well, what I'm doing, I'm in my backyard and

44:37.220 --> 44:41.700
oh, it's like D&D. I'm in my backyard. I'm facing the back wall, the north wall

44:41.740 --> 44:46.820
in my backyard. I'm standing on a bar stool and so I'm eye level with the

44:46.820 --> 44:52.700
ground thing and I can hear them in the pitch black. But in that yard, right?

44:52.740 --> 44:58.500
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's yeah. And so I'm just whipping handfuls of ice cubes

44:58.540 --> 45:03.260
in that direction figure, you know, and I just and they just kept kept yipping and

45:03.300 --> 45:07.420
then after a while they stopped. I truly believe they're like, this is delicious.

45:07.460 --> 45:12.060
So they're turning you basically into a person who is reaching out to a company

45:12.100 --> 45:16.100
that makes devices that are rudimentary to attack them. Yeah, it's true. Like I'm

45:16.100 --> 45:22.580
like I'm meeting them like Acme. Yeah. I'm not the road runner in this situation

45:22.620 --> 45:27.380
for sure. Yeah, that's funny. You have really gone to their level at this point.

45:27.420 --> 45:34.620
I'm surely acting as a fucking fictional coyote. That's really a really profound

45:34.660 --> 45:39.940
insight. I'm like ordering from fucking Amazon. It's the Acme. That's incredible.

45:39.980 --> 45:45.140
I was like these crazy like three strapped like create like laser guided things.

45:45.140 --> 45:51.060
It's insane. It's true. It's 100 percent like parallel. I cannot wait to see the

45:51.100 --> 45:55.660
rocket that you build with skates. I'm getting like bloodlights. I'm gonna put

45:55.700 --> 46:01.660
traps back there and be like they're not working and jumping up and down on it.

46:01.700 --> 46:04.420
I did think at a certain point I was thinking as I was throwing the ice, I was

46:04.460 --> 46:07.260
like, oh, now they're maybe they're eating the ice. Now they like me. And then I

46:07.300 --> 46:11.940
thought, well, if they could shut the fuck up and never eat my dogs, I will say,

46:11.940 --> 46:19.340
you know, maybe they're eating like raccoons, skunks, fruit, people who who's

46:19.380 --> 46:25.380
keep outdoor cats. I don't I don't I love the cats. Therefore, I want their owners

46:25.420 --> 46:29.700
to suffer for making them outdoor cats so that in the long term, people will love

46:29.740 --> 46:33.700
their cats enough to keep them indoors. But so, you know, it's complicated. I'm

46:33.740 --> 46:38.300
like that guy in the Watchmen who was like, let's start a nuclear war. We'll have

46:38.300 --> 46:41.900
world peace. Osmandias. I'm like, I hope all their cats get eaten, so they learn

46:41.940 --> 46:46.420
work. Sharp nice to cats. What's what's what's happening? What are you talking

46:46.460 --> 46:51.180
about? I'm just listening to you talk, man. Just listening. I don't like this at

46:51.220 --> 46:56.460
all. This makes me uncomfortable. Still icing this thing. That's crazy, huh?

46:56.500 --> 47:01.820
That's just a drinking out of it a long time. It. Yeah, it's a quality product.

47:01.860 --> 47:08.020
It's a doozy because it's a hard one to win, but I don't think I don't think I

47:08.020 --> 47:12.460
don't think the slingshot is your boy. If the coyotes come into the yard, maybe

47:12.500 --> 47:16.500
the slingshot. But I just I think that they're the coyotes. M. O. Is usually to

47:16.540 --> 47:20.100
lure. They do the yipping thing to kind of lure dogs out and then they kind of

47:20.140 --> 47:24.380
like nip them up or whatever. But I know, but I'm not I'm not judging. Sorry. I

47:24.420 --> 47:30.340
know I do think the worst case scenario is the one where it's like it's zero

47:30.380 --> 47:33.380
some game and appropriate phrase here. It's like the day that one of those

47:33.380 --> 47:39.980
fuckers does tumble into the yard. Right. It's like it's going to be an extreme

47:40.020 --> 47:44.820
situation. I don't think a slingshot is the tool for that either. Like at that

47:44.860 --> 47:49.620
point, I don't know what to do, but slingshots. Fine. But I'm looking at

47:49.660 --> 47:53.020
that as the reason why I want them to like scoot back a little bit because I

47:53.060 --> 47:57.500
feel like they're it's just like maybe like a pup of theirs that's going to be

47:57.540 --> 48:03.140
like hunger days or something's going to like fall into the backyard. It could

48:03.140 --> 48:07.780
be a mess. You know, the problem is that that neighbor's yard is just coyote HQ.

48:07.820 --> 48:14.020
Yeah. Why is there any update on that? Like looking into that? We have their

48:14.060 --> 48:17.100
phone number. We're going to actually just go up, but we don't think they live

48:17.140 --> 48:21.620
there necessarily. So it's there. They had their pug or bulldog that would fall

48:21.660 --> 48:27.220
into my yard and like he that things got. If that thing's alive, it's Rambo.

48:27.260 --> 48:32.180
Right. Because it just walks around back there where there's nothing but

48:32.180 --> 48:35.940
coyotes. It would be amazing to see it like like to walk back there and find it

48:35.980 --> 48:46.740
like hiding like breathing through a bamboo. So you didn't you listen to I

48:46.780 --> 48:50.180
told Spencer like I'm really interested in your take on the guy I call Asperger

48:50.220 --> 48:58.660
Detective. Right. And I call him that as a handle. I felt today inclined to

48:58.660 --> 49:11.140
iterate that like iterate that means say. I felt inclined to just say, you know,

49:11.180 --> 49:14.580
I said I call him Asperger Detective because I kind of feel I wouldn't do it if I

49:14.620 --> 49:18.100
thought that that would offend him. Like if somebody if somebody was doing a

49:18.140 --> 49:21.300
podcast and it sounded like they had a hair lip and they never mentioned their

49:21.340 --> 49:25.220
hair lip, I wouldn't be like hair lip, hair lip guy. I mean, maybe with Cody or

49:25.220 --> 49:29.380
somebody you want to listen to hair lip guy. But like, you know, I think that the

49:29.420 --> 49:33.060
guys could like based on his comments and stuff, I feel like whether he has

49:33.100 --> 49:37.300
Aspergers or not, he'd be like, that's kind of cool. Like he'd be like punk rock

49:37.340 --> 49:43.660
about it. But you know, so I just wanted to say that I don't you know, it's hard

49:43.700 --> 49:47.740
these days. I don't want to I don't want to be hurtful to any real people. I just

49:47.780 --> 49:51.780
want to I just want people to leave me alone, give me money. I don't even I don't

49:51.820 --> 49:54.820
need you to come here. I don't need to keep doing this show. I just it's kind of

49:54.820 --> 49:59.620
a moment. I'm all momentum at this point, just kind of drifting. You know, very

49:59.660 --> 50:04.740
happy. Just want to steal take take my money. I didn't mean to say steal. It's

50:04.780 --> 50:09.380
totally earned it. I've earned every penny. My job's very hard. I take it by a

50:09.420 --> 50:15.980
big house disappear into the West Wing and and you'll you'll hear like just the

50:16.020 --> 50:21.940
sound of a man eating chocolate Sunday. That'll be my equivalent of a single

50:21.940 --> 50:27.300
gunshot. Just like it's the same thing. A week of chocolate Sunday eating the same

50:27.340 --> 50:34.900
thing. Stanley said we did and then he died over a spider man comic. What wait?

50:34.940 --> 50:40.660
Shut up. Wait. He died on top of one. Yeah. What did he say before that? What did

50:40.700 --> 50:46.020
you say? I want to do this for like 10 more years. Well, he's like 97. You say

50:46.060 --> 50:49.100
when he was 87. He was like, I just want to do this for 10 more years. And so

50:49.100 --> 50:55.420
you're like, Oh, man, that's how you die. No, that's like the curse of the

50:55.460 --> 51:01.500
Golden Girls like onion headline. What's the curse of the Golden Girls? You

51:01.540 --> 51:06.660
probably put it together, right? No, I'm asking a quest. Why would I ask the

51:06.700 --> 51:12.820
question if I didn't know? I could put it together. I there was an onion

51:12.860 --> 51:18.060
headline. It was like, I can't remember the content. It was like, you know,

51:18.060 --> 51:23.420
someone dies and continuing a curse of the cast of Golden Girls because the

51:23.460 --> 51:28.260
joke is they were at an age where it would be fully appropriate statistically

51:28.300 --> 51:31.580
for them to be dying at the rate that they were. Ha ha. All right. That's

51:31.620 --> 51:38.620
pretty funny. I like that. Oh, OK. So you were asking you were asking Spencer

51:38.660 --> 51:42.260
what he thought. Yeah, what's your take? You said you listened to 13 episodes

51:42.300 --> 51:46.540
of this guy. Yeah, I've been listening to him. I don't know if he's he might

51:46.540 --> 51:52.660
be he. So, OK, the show is the guy like writes an essay, essentially, and then

51:52.700 --> 51:57.020
he just reads the essay on on the podcast because it's like it's not like

51:57.340 --> 52:01.980
there's not room for his just personal musings. It's all just straight like a

52:02.020 --> 52:05.580
script that he's wrote, but to the extent that it's like an essay, he like

52:05.620 --> 52:09.580
always has some sort of thesis statement or theme that he's like weaving

52:09.620 --> 52:13.540
through it, which is it. I don't know. Sometimes it sounds like the most

52:13.540 --> 52:18.060
stupid pretentious shit like or sometimes he focuses on stuff. Like there

52:18.100 --> 52:21.700
is the one where he was focusing on like, I don't know. There's the guy whose

52:21.740 --> 52:25.620
wife fell down the stairs or he killed her or whatever and then like the 911

52:25.660 --> 52:29.300
calls like she fell down the stairs and the lady is like how many stairs and

52:29.340 --> 52:34.260
he was like what and then and then he was like why did he say what it's

52:34.300 --> 52:37.180
obvious he was hiding the truth and it's like well that's a stupid quick. It

52:37.220 --> 52:40.420
doesn't matter how many fucking stairs someone fell down. I would be like

52:40.420 --> 52:45.780
what the fuck are you talking about? So I don't know a lot. Let me count. Yeah,

52:45.820 --> 52:49.500
it's like that's not that's not helpful. It is though because you want to know

52:49.540 --> 52:53.580
should you send some cops or an ambulance or a ladder both. Why don't you sort

52:53.620 --> 52:58.260
it out afterwards? I my wife's dead or dying kind of like like he'll do it.

52:58.300 --> 53:01.260
He'll do kind of like when he does unsolved stuff and then he proposes a

53:01.300 --> 53:04.820
theory because right that stuff's really impressive at his best. I like him

53:04.860 --> 53:08.580
because he reminds me of agent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks because Dale

53:08.580 --> 53:11.660
Cooper rolls into your town and you're like we can't find out who killed Laura

53:11.700 --> 53:15.900
Palmer right? So and so you call the FBI when it's like the resources are

53:15.940 --> 53:21.700
exhausted and in David Lynch's universe the FBI is equivalent to like a weird

53:21.740 --> 53:26.380
like shamanic tier of civilization. But like Dale Cooper's like he's he's he's

53:26.420 --> 53:31.260
learned how to like it's like if only for the sake of being lateral because

53:31.300 --> 53:35.860
nothing else is working it's like oh you know like he'll throw rocks at a tin

53:35.860 --> 53:41.580
can like and if it it's sort of like it's almost like flipping a coin or like

53:41.620 --> 53:48.060
like Asperger detective will do something like he's like in 1985 John

53:48.100 --> 53:52.580
Swanson went into the woods and never came back. People have been talking about

53:52.620 --> 53:56.620
this for quite a while but the one thing that they can't figure out is whether

53:56.660 --> 54:02.420
or not his friend did it or whether or not it was murder. But here's the thing

54:02.420 --> 54:07.100
I'd like to look at the case through the lens of parabolic Turing's law and

54:07.140 --> 54:13.100
and you're like what? Or it's not always like nerdy he'll be like the interesting

54:13.140 --> 54:17.180
thing is that him going off the path reminds me of the breakfast club. It was

54:17.220 --> 54:23.300
a movie by John Hughes. John Hughes made movies in 1982 through 1997 and all of

54:23.340 --> 54:26.980
his movies tended to involve disparate groups of people forced to get along

54:27.020 --> 54:30.660
together and learning things like he goes on this it goes on these like tears of

54:30.660 --> 54:35.740
like he'll and then he'll like these themes of like aviation or something and

54:35.780 --> 54:39.940
then every once in a while he'll just throw a fucking spark plug and and he

54:39.980 --> 54:42.420
because his episodes are three and a half hours long he never listens to him

54:42.460 --> 54:47.860
again or edits them so so every earlier episodes are pretty short and I listen

54:47.900 --> 54:54.420
at two X speed. I would I mean I don't know if I we this is him just like kind

54:54.420 --> 55:01.380
of throwing a shoe. Cody recorded this because we're like whoa. The lack of

55:01.420 --> 55:06.260
technology will even be symbolized in their deaths by use of phone cord to

55:06.300 --> 55:19.460
create their bindings. So if all of this crazy this dude reached for leftover

55:19.500 --> 55:24.100
rice. Yeah, I don't know how much the mic picks up but those are there's just

55:24.100 --> 55:29.940
set up like a peel of half dry lips in there. It's like and I really again this

55:29.980 --> 55:34.380
is one of the situations where like you know I don't I don't want I'm not I'm

55:34.420 --> 55:37.740
not punching down punching sideways punch it up. I don't want to be punching

55:37.780 --> 55:42.700
like which is why I then add I feel I just hate this like feeling of like like

55:42.740 --> 55:47.900
him getting like you know receiving in the wrong way that we were talking and

55:47.940 --> 55:51.860
talking shit and I just want him to know that like I mean obvious like he's a

55:51.860 --> 55:55.940
part of our life. We love him like he's like we keep listening and listening and

55:55.980 --> 56:01.140
listening. I totally like I see his haters and reviews and I can understand what

56:01.180 --> 56:05.780
they're saying but I'm like I hate them like their haters and like I like the

56:05.820 --> 56:11.220
guy he's like so brazenly fucking like lateral. I also like really worry about

56:11.260 --> 56:15.380
him sometimes like he did I don't did you hear one where he like started

56:15.420 --> 56:18.540
talking about like he went straight into like fucking numerology or something

56:18.540 --> 56:22.220
where he was like I can't wait. I had to pause it with Cody. I'm like wait is

56:22.260 --> 56:26.620
he is he rounding a bend because he usually will just go the job and he

56:26.660 --> 56:31.260
Rams he was found in the train room. There have been three main functions of

56:31.300 --> 56:34.620
locomotion since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Right. So I want

56:34.660 --> 56:38.220
to look at this from a perspective of transportation but but he'll bring it

56:38.260 --> 56:42.060
back around to be like we should look at this murder scene from the perspective

56:42.100 --> 56:47.060
of how much energy it takes to get from A to B and consistently the human race

56:47.060 --> 56:50.500
has a tendency to try to conserve as much energy. Right. This is a genetic

56:50.540 --> 56:53.860
imperative. If you expend more resources then you acquire by going where you're

56:53.900 --> 56:56.820
going and then he'll work his way around. He's just what he's really saying is

56:56.860 --> 57:01.340
like no one that's looked at this crime scene has has necessarily found the

57:01.380 --> 57:05.460
fingerprint that says exactly what happened so why not just like spin

57:05.500 --> 57:09.580
around like a pinata game and kind of like stop and look at it from now this

57:09.620 --> 57:13.260
crazy perspective and if you look at the JonBenét Ramsey home crime scene

57:13.260 --> 57:17.820
maybe from this perspective of like transportation then he'll come up with

57:17.860 --> 57:22.660
this theory of like oh well Gordon Ramsey not Gordon Ramsey who was it? Yeah

57:22.700 --> 57:26.780
Gordon Ramsey. It was it was. I think Gordon Ramsey did it. He's the only

57:26.820 --> 57:32.500
member of the Ramsey clan that wasn't present in the house. She burnt one of

57:32.540 --> 57:36.580
the cakes in an easy bake of it. Every time I've seen Gordon Ramsey he's

57:36.620 --> 57:42.580
becoming extremely intolerant when aspects of when aspects of his environment

57:42.580 --> 57:48.940
are not up to snuff. He's a man who won't tolerate order or chaos chaos. Gordon

57:48.980 --> 57:52.900
Ramsey if he was in that house would have killed JonBenét Ramsey. It's a

57:52.940 --> 57:56.540
case that solves itself but no but but my point is that he will he will come

57:56.580 --> 57:59.740
back and I'll go and I'll go like god damn I think he I think he got it. I

57:59.780 --> 58:04.300
think that is like a fucking like really viable different take on the John

58:04.340 --> 58:08.660
Bonae Ramsey thing but then there was this one or it was like this family got

58:08.660 --> 58:12.740
murdered in a cabin and it was like I was like maybe I'm not hearing him right

58:12.780 --> 58:17.460
but I think he's like he's he's detached and he's like floating off like a

58:17.500 --> 58:24.220
balloon like because he was like the cabin the cabin number was 486. In 1986

58:24.260 --> 58:29.700
Steven Spielberg came out with something I it was like it was like he

58:29.740 --> 58:32.260
started talking about the movies I'm trying if I riff then you guys will be

58:32.300 --> 58:36.620
like oh that's wrong I'm gonna be riffing like I do. Well one he really does is

58:36.620 --> 58:40.940
like there's a guy he's accusing of making up a fake murderer and he's like

58:40.980 --> 58:47.260
and who is that murderers name Romano Romero it's it's RR which indicates he

58:47.300 --> 58:51.180
was trying to complete the cycle and give the person what they wanted right

58:51.220 --> 58:56.460
and it's like well yeah you just said that right and this this one was like he

58:56.500 --> 59:01.180
went from like the date of the murders or the address to like or he went from the

59:01.220 --> 59:05.740
date of the murders to like the date of a movie release or like like back then

59:05.740 --> 59:09.380
how like taking airplanes somewhere was like a new thing because the murders

59:09.420 --> 59:16.740
have okay the murders happened in like a cabin in the like 80s when a domestic

59:16.780 --> 59:20.860
like resorts that people would take vacations to so he referenced the movie

59:20.900 --> 59:24.820
Vacation he references the movie Dirty Dancing which did not take place in the

59:24.860 --> 59:29.340
80s but it was made in the 80s but he references these movies that symbolize

59:29.340 --> 59:35.100
the fact that there was a trans a trans a trans trans trans trans what the fuck

59:35.140 --> 59:41.020
am I what's the word what a tendency a transition in you lost that word yeah

59:41.060 --> 59:46.220
I'm old and drunk and dying you're gonna your words too and you know what the

59:46.260 --> 59:49.820
first word you're gonna lose is me so fuck you in advance you're gonna forget

59:49.860 --> 59:52.140
me and you're gonna miss me and you won't know why because you won't remember

59:52.180 --> 59:57.580
who I am whoa it's good it's called getting haunted should have finished my

59:57.580 --> 01:00:01.500
business I don't know what I'm saying no idea one of the guy that's why I like

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.580
this guy the main the main thing is like his angle is about examining like the

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.020
human human mind human tendencies and he's like so I don't know like he did

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.580
serial and he did add non and he like analyzed while like all the the murder

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.060
really closely replicates his his oppressed lifestyle or something and so

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:24.500
his angle is like this all lines up from a human behavioral perspective and a

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.940
lot of these cases fall apart because you get hung up on the evidence and

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.340
really it's about matching whether or not like all the emotional mental states

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.020
that people lines up with the crime because usually again people know each

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.140
other when they commit crimes of passion and so that usually indicates some

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:44.140
sort of pattern of behavior playing out he went from the same but crazy yeah I

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.820
mean that's the thing is like that's what's fascinating me is like the very

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.100
fine line because like I remember when the internet first like kind of was

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:56.100
blossoming and one of my most I was particularly fascinated with like with

01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.620
people who were forgive me but clearly schizophrenic like who at the you know

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.100
sort of like the people would just have like websites you know there was no

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.020
tumbler there was no like you know it's just sort of like some of the first

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:14.420
people into the worldwide web to like look because it was like a place for

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:20.260
like aberrant stuff and like there was a lot of websites you would find there

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:25.820
were just people going like this is this is my story like it was in 1997 when I

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.380
realized that Harrison Ford was like to like trying to read my mind and like

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.580
their whole like story I was like and they're very like hyper what do you

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.820
call it hyper graphic I don't know if that's the correct term but like like

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.860
they just like at a time when the internet was all just like text and it

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.220
was like like they were like like people with tragic mental illnesses like like

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.900
watching them I'm not you guys are like are you calling this guy mentally ill

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:52.300
no but I'm saying like the the crazy the the the interest fascinating thing to

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.020
me has always been like what are these lines you know like what drop of

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.500
chemical what spark that could jump from one little part of your circuit board

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.860
to another makes the big difference between someone who's valued at NASA for

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:08.300
figuring out like how a little rocket should do this and then some poor kid

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.580
that like when they're 20 years old they just realized their shoes are hot dogs

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.740
and they just get expunged from society and they're homeless under a bridge

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.140
because we don't respect like mental illness is as regular illness and like

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.980
and like like so when I'm listening to Asperger detective and he like he

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.780
every once in a while I kind of because he went from like a date in this cabin

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.980
so he had the like the zeitgeist of air travel within like the cult American

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:38.660
culture of like how resorts were closing down because people were now air

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.540
airlines were affordable so people were going to Europe more so there were

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:48.620
places in America where cabins became like cheaper and like the clientele

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.260
became more impoverished and so they got more rundown and so prices kept going

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.420
down and basically like he was making the case that like he's like there's

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:01.260
these places that used to be fancy that became like like the hotel in the

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.780
shining but for regular customers who are just like these fucking thugs or

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.940
whatever I have no idea if he's like if that's based on any accurate data but

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.380
he was like that was his kind of zeitgeist or this is that's one of these

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.100
places where this murder took place so he's like he's already got like this

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.900
airplane thing going on in his head and then it's like so it was like the

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.380
murders happening on this date and then he's like interestingly enough that

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:26.740
was the date of like I don't know back to the future's release or something and

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.780
it was like back to the future is about Marty McFly part of a younger

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:35.740
generation who takes a car that's capable of flying who that's like I

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.620
couldn't fly in the first one but but he and then he but the crazy one about

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:45.420
that one is that he come he instead of coming back down he just floats and

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:50.780
then he goes like and and the sequel to this movie or that movie happened at

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:56.900
this time and the what that got at the box office was 498 million dollars so

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:03.700
you have to ask was there a cabin with the address 498 and if there is would

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.780
there be another person there who's a suspect in the murder and what do you

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:13.420
know and I was like what no that's not that's not what you usually do Dale

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:19.820
Cooper you just you just got a lead about who to arrest from a fucking Jaws

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.220
movie like that's that and I maybe I heard it wrong but I was like oh is he

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.460
every once in a while just like popping he pop and off the Hot Wheels track a

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.380
little bit yeah there was another one I think it was that same murder but I

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:38.460
can't remember but he he accuses the guy of realizing he wanted to commit the

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.060
murder after he saw a movie and he was like oh and it was like why did he do

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.140
it because the movie was the ghosts of his past it was played out when they

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.220
store the they storm the Nazi castle the Nazi castle castle was storing his

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.900
poor memories or something and it was like it may he I don't even know maybe

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.020
the facts of the case was that he watched this movie but the guy was just

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.780
a certain like this guy did it and it was because he watched this movie and

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.620
this movie is the perfect analog for his life and that's why he murdered and

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:11.980
is like it like this is all interactions you know in human perception I think we

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.100
all are playing this sort of detective throughout the damn day right because

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:20.700
because he is able to say I don't get the answer I don't get yeah he knows the

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.940
right answer so the way he works backwards is super interesting and that's to

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.860
keep his ass personalized and on air there's some respects it's something

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:33.100
that we all sort of do like that person did not let me in that parking space

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.300
because they saw what kind of car I drove right they made a judgment about me

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.900
because it's dirty today and there is a little bit of a Hulk like a porn kind of

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.460
like nerd rage kind of thrill I get to because he's like such yeah he's like

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:51.460
you can tell like he's he's driven by like an like truly like a fetish for

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:56.860
explanation like I feel like that he he actually like more even more than me

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.940
which is a lot like he just loves the feeling of explaining it's like I love

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.860
like that he becomes like when a dog puts its head up the window it probably

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.020
just doesn't even know he's just like I'm gonna explain this and that's like

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.380
that's why his cadence goes like up is it's like because this the thing and

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.540
like that's the sound you make when you're when you're enlightening people and

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:20.220
he's just like it's like it's like go baby go explain everything like like

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.820
like don't even look back what is that going to hate what what is that port

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.820
doing with that adapter always talk he talks about all this weird stuff like

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.420
he's like he's like this is a port and it needs an adapter so who was the

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:39.260
adapter add non's religion plug perfectly into the port of oppression or

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.500
something like that it was really like he goes really hard but he says some

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:47.220
stuff that like to me was like really really profound or whatever like he

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:51.100
talked about like when a healthy person goes on vacation they just realize that

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.700
it's a change and they'll return to the normal but when an unhealthy person goes

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.300
on vacation they're looking for an escape from their reality and when they

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.420
realize the escape isn't from the from the problems they actually brought to

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:05.740
it they get upset and then when they return and things haven't changed they

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.340
lose their minds or whatever and I was like holy shit like this guy is just

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.780
saying truth and I like never thought about it was like blowing my mind he was

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.700
saying like people say they drink to forget but what they're actually doing

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:22.740
is a commuting with the past and I was like oh damn I feel sad now it was

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:28.300
because I I smoke a lot of pot and I was like oh fuck that's me baby but it was

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.940
just like that's the thing but a lot of times they're like you're you're just

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.140
being an asshole right now and other times it's like oh man my life

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:39.300
it's crazy do you think we should he lives in Los Angeles let's go well I

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:42.940
mean but I don't know I don't know what they're doing now like I had David

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:45.980
coming down I had the girls from Red Handed and it's like this tradition of

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:51.220
like oh you know Dan Harmon with Willy Wonka reaches out with his golden

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:55.820
tickets into the world and like spoils relationships that that should really

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:01.540
stay maybe consumer relationships I don't know I'm like I felt I'm like

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:09.780
Kim Jong whatever in the the fucking Seth Rogen movie that almost caused a

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.340
nuclear war we should look to shoot up because I want to know a does he have

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.740
a criminology is he a background is he a writer all these things that you want

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.180
to know because if he's like I gotta fill three hours so of course I'm gonna

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:27.220
pontificate because I'm a writer right great but if he's like just a lay

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.340
person who is talking about these things that's super fascinating yeah I

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.780
want you know who you know who absolutely I would have on on a heartbeat

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:38.620
just because I think there you guys listen to Dan Carlin's hardcore history

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:43.580
yeah where did where does he live I don't listen to somewhere I wonder if he

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.020
lives like well fucking I mean I flew people out from London I think that's

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.060
basically yeah fucking I don't give a shit you don't give a shit I'll wipe my

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.060
ass with this money wipe ass wipe ass wherever Carlin is like that would be

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:03.460
a really interesting I listened to Dan Carlin and I was like this guy sounds

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:09.660
a lot like both Zach Gallifanakis and Heath Ledger and and then I then and

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.820
then it made me realize like why they cast he's Zach as the Joker and the

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.460
Lego Batman movie I was like like somebody must have been like oh he sounds

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.060
a little bit like don't you think yeah all right whatever yeah I think Dan

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.260
Carlin sounds like George Carlin yeah and if you just word of advice because

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.340
like I I mean Dan hardcore history it has like I don't know there's been a

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:37.300
couple episodes where like Cody and I were both like I kind of I don't get it

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.340
like and not in a good way and that's like like you don't feel like pressured

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.540
to like listen to that one skip around I guarantee you'll find one that for

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.620
whatever reason just gets its hooks in you from the first sentence and there's

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.740
no reason for you to not hold out for that and like like it'll but it was like

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:57.460
a very healthy thing because I was like wait history it's true crime but you're

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.820
kind of learning stuff like this and they have a ton of forensic evidence so

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.420
you can get deep deep deep into it it's always good to sort of shout out to

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.860
that's what that's why I asked you what are you going to be involved in if

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.620
you're not going to be you know like we all were sort of glued to the politics

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.460
this is the great answer so I definitely since I left Twitter like there

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.340
was you know I did withdrawals and stuff like that and I recently had like a

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.540
fucking like I had to delete the Reddit app again because I was like in there

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.060
for a little bit and then I just found myself for three hours just like I'm

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:36.220
like I deleted it for the good of mankind but I got my Instagram which is

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:40.060
the thing where it's like okay if you make up thing that's a minute long you

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:45.220
can put it up here if somebody underneath it says anything other than I'm

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.540
really happy that you're happy you can be like go fuck yourself and if they say

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.660
that's how you treat your fans you can be like yeah that is go fuck yourself

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.860
again and if they say like that's fucked up and five people come in and say

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.580
you're fucked up I can go like you're all fucked up shut up I don't care like it

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.300
doesn't feel like it's going to end up in TMZ as much I don't mean to flatter

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.540
myself and probably not TMZ material anymore and I say that with like fucking

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.660
fingers crossed like I just want to be like like recoiled a little bit like it's

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:15.940
cyclical it's a weird thing of the old social media you you you have to take

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:20.340
breaks it's content driven you know you like Instagram like do you find that

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.860
Instagram is like I find it content driven oh what do you what do you what's

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:30.260
going on with you just tell us with what just in general like what the first of

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.500
all what the fuck is wrong with you what's wrong with yeah what's wrong with

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:39.220
you what did your parents do wrong well you why don't you tell me what's wrong

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:45.540
with me oh it's okay all right here we go finally finally get to find out

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:51.180
you love that one you get the peanut gallery laughing in the background sorry

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.060
Steve you're not a you remember when it was still like maybe it was never

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.140
politically correct but when it was like within balance like if there was no

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.940
like but like we I think we talked about on this show friend just came up in my

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.780
head again the other day like when we were like we were kids we were like 20

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.220
in Milwaukee and like like we were just the improv troop that we were in was all

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:15.140
dudes and we were constantly humping each other yeah like as a bit I did probably

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:20.340
to millennial ears makes no fucking sense yeah they do it I do you're a

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:24.340
contrarian you just know like millennials hump each other they do it's as old as

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:29.180
time there's problematic millennials I don't think like millennial dudes like

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:35.020
that are like in improv troops like like like like hump each other like like as

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:39.860
a do you remember do you remember we would we would sing the song get aboard the

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:44.740
but fuck train do you remember that I mean it's just like problematic like that

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:49.500
that trains all in problem a decision train but I was the but fuck train I

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.740
don't remember that but I was and then it was like you know what like Sean was

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:59.060
like combing his hair in the bathroom and I think like you started you started

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.060
the train you started miming like you were humping him and then of course I had

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.140
to get back and then and then he would like act like he was like reading the

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:12.500
paper walking check in the schedule on there and it was just like another

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.620
person would join and then there would be like it would be you know kind of

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.100
like a can't what do you what do you call conga line of but everybody was

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:27.220
humping each other we would be chanting get aboard the but fuck train I want to

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:34.900
say we did that for maybe hours just that night because it never stopped being

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.620
funny and hilarious because like Sean would be in the front and just like

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:46.020
acting like oh yeah he's just doing taxes do this you know it's just it's a

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:52.420
right of passage mill mill of the 20 something that's why it's problematic

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.420
is because is very fratty and like like yeah so correct whatever I don't have to

01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:00.060
problematize it there's a there's an industry that can do that but when we

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.740
were 13 we were like that and then there was another wave of it like when I was

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:08.940
18 with the pack of dudes that I ran with and they called it fixing and yeah yeah

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.820
how fucked up is that fixing like I think you need to get fixed yeah we're

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.100
about to come over here and fix you broke shit and then literally would scoop your

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.020
legs out from underneath you and pin you I mean we were like it was like because

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:24.500
the joke becomes like well it's a joke and then it was like we were like yeah I

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:30.020
was like the more like like committed and the more like abusive like it was

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:34.340
just like what like who and it's like oh that is like I look back at that and I

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.300
go like wow that's not you're kind of like actually weeding out maybe a bunch

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.900
of funny people who would like go like be like well I'm not gonna hang out with

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.620
those people yeah like and they might be really smart and funny and like but

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.260
anyways but I was I only brought it up because I just remember like being the

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:54.940
kitchen at my house and my dad like sitting at the counter and like I

01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:00.020
had a story I know it's just but it's just amazing that you grabbed me from behind

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:05.380
and we're like pantomimeing like thrusting into me and you and you and you

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.500
and you and you help me by the shoulders and and through clenched teeth said look

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:15.260
at your father while I do this to you and my dad was like

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.700
it is like I don't expect you to understand but at the time it was like

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.620
like this is pretty cool I mean like because it's like it was I get I mean

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:31.460
you kept committing I was I was like oh and like and he's like look at your

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.740
father look at your father and my dad was just like bright red and like just

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.700
had this big grin on his face which you know it was like it was like it's like

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:48.260
my what is wrong with me what is wrong we were 20 and it was 1950 I mean it

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:53.300
was like I I don't I don't I don't mean to like I look I feel like I like my

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.820
personal feeling it's easier because we're older like of course we want to

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:01.260
feel this way is that look I it's not an excuse but I do think that there

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:05.380
should be a little bit of awareness of like well you know and look I gotta

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.780
actually say like you know how many times have I like kind of lambasted my

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.620
parents for their kind of like you know behavior that became unfashionable as

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:18.460
of the 80s and then I was you know even on this stage in my late 30s like kind

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.220
of like oh really lay you know like I kind of like fucking play that card like

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.660
oh they did this they did that and like my mom's excuse was always like it was

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:32.220
the 70s everybody did it like you know like oh like you can't like now that's

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.660
what comics are saying like about like we found this thing from 1989 when you

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.940
were at this club doing this thing and we found this sitcom or whatever and

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:44.420
it was like well it was on NBC I don't know what to tell you and it's like kind

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.140
of like neither it's that doesn't make it good but at the same time it's isn't

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:53.060
it sort of like I guess we're sort of having that debate now but it's a

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.860
shitty thing to go to and shit on the past when you could be fixing things in

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.500
the present yeah takes time it's a shitty thing but at the time I will say it

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.340
just fine I mean what is that if not like the same thing is like playing heavy

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.300
metal music really loud like we so okay so we weren't like you know that we were

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.100
20 and it was like that was the thing that made my dad read and it wasn't

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.780
because he was like angry he didn't feel his thresholds being pushed it wasn't

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.220
like it wasn't like well the joke wasn't it wasn't like we were like what you

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:25.860
weren't emasculating my dad no I was embarrassed but it was it was about

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.740
embarrassed making somebody feel uncomfortable that was the bit you know

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.300
but my dad's expression was very much like I don't know how to react to you

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.140
guys like I don't understand your humor you know which I think is a good thing

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:43.860
culturally for the between generations it was like you guys are like I think

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:48.580
that people 20 years younger than me should like do comedy that makes me go

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:57.740
like what the fuck like which I do see all the time and I enjoy Rob what do you

01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.820

from the yeah that's your Jeff Jam set because you felt like you did good

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:52.780
that night I felt like I did good that night listen to the cheering I did do

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:57.500
well it was Jeff Jam and I think you were getting a little bit of a like you

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:03.860
know crazy white guy comes out you kind of did the you know I you know I think

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:08.660
you got a boost they were being supportive by laughing and applauding

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:14.620
yeah yeah and like I don't know if that means that you did Netflix respond

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:20.620
positively to your special is it getting good net flixes yeah they have ratings

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:28.540
yeah okay all right well I don't want to be a negative Gus okay good we got

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:39.540
another clip I was how come Irish people always got to be running around

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:51.420
with rainbows it sounds like some Jeff Jam people came to the Netflix

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:55.220
yeah Toria because they remembered you yeah it makes sense that you would play

01:19:55.260 --> 01:20:04.060
to that crowd I get that so is it 45 minutes or what was it 46 oh did you

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:09.540
do a little sketch in the beginning yeah to open our title sequence like you get

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:14.660
in a cab and like I come out of the cab the cabs on stage that's cool that's

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:19.180
pretty cool I got like the cabs in the video and then you open the cab door

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:24.780
and you're on stage I think that's cool were you were you in Memphis was I a

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.980
Memphis were you a Memphis were you in Memphis I was in Memphis what did you

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:34.580

Atlanta okay so that's near Memphis yeah okay how long were you how long were

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.180
you going to lie to me well I didn't know if we were doing a bit or not so

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:55.620
my voice forever probably I am getting a little you get this ones he is that

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:59.540
ones he plus the lights I am getting just reporting as a consumer thing like

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.780
it's maybe not designed for sitting under hot lights but I still I think I

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:08.620
think they're very comfortable pajamas how was Atlanta it was not I didn't

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:12.660
see much of it I was working a lot but in Memphis I need to like the traffic

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:17.140
lights what's that traffic lights aren't they different than us no wasn't

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:22.740
Europe you know they are I've been there I didn't notice anything well then

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:28.740
they're weird Spencer how was Atlanta oh it was great oh man I had a great

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:34.580
time they had traffic lights on strings I tell you oh is that what you meant

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:39.940
yeah way different than here I've seen it before but yeah it's right because

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:45.300
you live somewhere else before here huh how many years out are we before I

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:50.060
well I see the day before I die where I can safely say I don't enjoy the blues

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:56.940
brother's movie or still a couple years it sounds like okay yeah I didn't know

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.860
your generation of you know I like okay all right still well do you want to

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:05.420
talk do you want to talk about that no no I'd rather keep my fucking friends and

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:10.100
career I don't think anyone just as with apocalypse now I'll go on right on

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:15.180
pretending that oh wow well wait has a cool choice has anyone seen blues

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:23.780
brothers here fair amount what do you think what do you guys think right okay I

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:28.500
think they're trying to trick me it I think they all didn't watch it in our

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:34.100
line did we talk about the stand-in ollie movie up here I don't think so no I

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:40.620
haven't watched it yet so don't ruin that too it's pre ruined all right okay

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:46.500
so all right so go ahead that is a piece of shit wow but I don't know you do

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:50.780
love the performances the part yeah actually yeah Cougar like is is a

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:57.660
me yeah the both of them but like yeah I kind of feel like Cougans doing what's

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:03.740
his face like is like I don't know it to me it seems more impressive yeah but

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:08.100
because maybe it's because I'm a big guy that would probably be between the two

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.660
of them cast as the other guy so I feel and I feel like I'd go well what are you

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:19.860
doing oh a bowl of cereal you know and that's probably easier to do than the

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.580
other guy I thought Cougan Cougan I couldn't help but think as I was

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:29.060
watching it I was like I if I was either these guys watching this movie at the

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:33.140
premiere I'd be like like in my seat like kind of just cringing because I would

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:38.500
know that the composer was sitting somewhere in the theater and as an actor

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.300
that wasn't in the edit bay I'd be like I didn't know they were gonna play this

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:47.540
music from front to back of the entire fucking movie I feel like you watch I

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:51.700
mean you imagine the music stripped out this is all this music that's like hope

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:59.340
these guys are doing something funny now and which is just fucking death I'm

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:03.300
gonna be brutally brutally honest just because I like I don't please don't I

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:09.540
like I when I was in the same rock block as 30 rock I always thought like 30 rock

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.220
would be that could be like the new Mary Tyler Moore it was whatever it was a

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:19.260
great show Emmy winning very best comedy writers in the in sit-comery like

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:24.100
the it's just there was the funniest show and I just always felt like it's like

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.540
just kitty can the tuba just like it's just just pull it out you know I spent so

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.380
much time on community going like like like thank you wonderful job like that's

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.860
very clearly that that song makes it very clear that she's walking down the

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.380
hallway and that she has a secret wish but like I can also see it on her face

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.620
and I just think that if we just like get that out of there yeah that this

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.060
speeder bike scene in this redwood forest can do the job for itself

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:57.300
I it's nothing worse to me then like yeah like somebody doing something quirky in

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:02.340
a movie and quirky music playing it's like like what is the what is the music

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:07.500
think worse think we don't understand like that's crazy yeah I think that

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.340
music should be like a different channel you know it should be like it should be

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:16.660
ironic yeah well I mean it just by nature channel for technically ironic

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:25.740
because because the music is there to I just heard you I gotta work I did I did

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:29.940
I tell you like when when the Sarah Silverman program sorry got like

01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:36.540
cancelled Justin's dad like we were hanging out with Justin and Justin's

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:42.420
dad goes oh that's too bad a show got got cancelled that you should you should

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:46.860
you should pitch it to channel for they do a lot of really crazy stuff on channel

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:52.500
for you should you should really you should you should pitch it to channel

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:57.660
for they should they would put it on channel for that's us now by Justin

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:06.420
Reilly channel for I was curious like I went to a website because we were

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:12.780
curious I was like we were talking about parking enforcement and how you know

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:18.860
like you've you've you've seen them like perched and like waiting and of course

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.380
you then you realize oh they they must work on a quota like there's no way

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:26.700
that they just that you make the same amount of money and get the same amount

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:30.260
of respect as a parking enforcement officer if you come back to the office

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.500
and like everybody parked great today like they're gonna be like I don't believe

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:37.980
you fuck you like so there's now it's it's one of those unfortunate things so I

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.700
went like people have stories about like I could see the fucker waiting for me

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.020
like we wait for the car like well they kind of it's like yeah it's like it's

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.460
just sad like I mean what but then I heard somebody told me like it's beyond

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:55.860
what I even think it's not even a quota it's like like they work on commission

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.540
which to me crosses a line where it's like well of course that's gonna that

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.620
means that to me when I hear that that means that they're getting paid less

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:09.140
than minimum wage a quota it's like well okay probably a maybe a necessary evil

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:16.140
I'd be able to argue cuz like what are you supposed to do but like that commission

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:21.500
thing it's like it's like like this behavior is just like a it's a door and

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:26.260
then you get these like but anyways I was like wait aren't those people all cops

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.940
somebody was telling me this story sort of about they were watching a guy they

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.500
were having coffee they watch a guy classic story some of you have been in

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:40.060
it or at least seen it the the meter the meters five seconds from running out

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:45.340
the parking enforcement person standing there waiting the they take their pin

01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.220
out they start writing the thing they probably use emojis now I don't know

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:56.340
but the person runs out I've been this guy runs out like come on I'm out here

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.740
with the change in my hand to do anything we used to have this thing called

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:07.620
change and the and by the way miss nomer changed nothing that laugh made me

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:11.340
want to kill myself the would have preferred silence than that pity so it

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:15.780
changed your life if by the way that's that was a facetious statement if you're

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:21.340
having thoughts of self-harm you should talk to somebody the the the and then

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.660
the print you know they have the big argument cuz it's like oh when the pin

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:28.020
hits the paper and all this stuff and and my friend said that he was there for

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.780
this he was watching he's having coffee is watching this thing transfixed and

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.740
the guy is so frustrated so outraged and he shoves the parking lot if a

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.220
parking enforcement person and the parking enforcement person did not react

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:45.620
like like they're it's almost like maybe not it happens all the time but

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:51.900
they're just like they didn't react like they just like cool as a cucumber like

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:58.780
like like and they walked over to their thing and got on a cb and first I was

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.180
just sitting there having coffee so they're there ten minutes later we're

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:09.220
like he just like swarms of parking enforcement people not cops just all of

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:13.580
the all of the parking enforcement people yeah like they all got the call you

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.580
know there must be like a code red like kind of thing or like someone's fucking

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:24.980
with the someone crossed the thin baby blue line so they all just start

01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.220
writing tickets I don't know yeah well they apparently they didn't do anything

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:32.100
but it was just a show of force which you know that's it was it was a solidarity

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:36.260
they're like sitting there like leaning against cars like looking at the guy and

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.820
it was like well wait aren't they cops can't isn't that assault and like no

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.140
they're not quite cops their officers so we started like we got online we're

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:46.380
like what how does this work if you're a parking enforcement if you've ever

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.500
worked a parking for us but please like you're listening to this like I don't

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:54.420
know fuck right off no no I we'd love to I love to talk to you as a guest I

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.340
think that would be an amazing guest I think we'd love to hear your stories

01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:01.740
and they're like how that works I'm not kidding I mean don't you think that

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:05.180
would be like if you met a parking enforcement officer at a party wouldn't

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:10.220
you wouldn't you have like several questions why are you not so did you go

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:14.540
to college that's that they're not here who invited you they're doing they're

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:17.660
doing a job no one no one wants to do I'm not I'm not saying like they're all

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.380
heroes but I'm just saying like they're not come on I mean that's but but but

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:27.220
but we were I was like wait how come I grew up thinking that the only way to

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:31.660
become one was to have the the chief tell you that your hijinks had gone on

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.940
long enough and that the mayor's calling from downtown like I always thought

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.860
that that's why I never fucked a little I always thought that like oh man these

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.260
guys are like the worst of the worst cops like they're ready to snap like like

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:46.300
this guy could be it could have been mark firman yesterday like he's like

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:50.700
waiting for me to give him an excuse to put his like hold out twenty two on my

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:55.660
body and sprinkle cocaine on my face and just leave me in an alley wash off

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:59.940
kid the murder was parked in front of your house and they're like no let him

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:05.580
go and now you're gonna be a parking attendant and now that would be a funny

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:09.140
bit was like because I was I was like he's like I'm going to the website like

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.660
how do you become a parking enforcement officer and it was like you couldn't

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.860
figure it out and I was like see I told you because the list is like hidden from

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.940
the public and then we started riffing the list it was like well if the mayor is

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:24.060
sick of your shit like you know like just the kind of like the the prerequisites

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.540
of becoming a thing in web form would have been funny like the bullet points

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:35.140
first you need a writ from the chief that he's been torn a new asshole yeah and

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.980
it goes on and on from there and I'm a what am I J Leno it's not gonna it's not

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:43.580
gonna fly I didn't really write any of them I don't care what you think I'm

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.620
getting over an approval addiction it's important for me to tell you to go fuck

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:52.060
yourself it's not it's a but I I want you to not have to pay for therapy to know

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.740
that that shouldn't matter to you I didn't mean it I'm thinking about myself

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:01.700
finally

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.180
here's that thing about the stand in Ali movie can I warn you about something

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:12.140
that is going to like really bum you out as long as you don't ruin it for me

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:17.060
because I wanted to try to watch it and maybe stand in Ali movie makes the

01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:22.940
incredibly curious decision to fade in on the two of them at the peak of their

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:30.180
career just before it's over is a cold open and you see one scene from that so

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:35.340
it's sort of like this is where things ended and then it goes to black and it

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:47.220
says 16 years later and the entire movie is them old and failed and failing and

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:57.340
dying and that's the whole movie oh oh okay that's kind of what the synopsis of

01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:05.780
it is when you when you say when you read about it I knew that okay so you're

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:12.100
going to love it I don't know yet did you not like that about it I thought it

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:17.340
was a strange choice just because and then you're going to say oh what do you

01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:21.660
want well I don't want to see the day they meet you want to make I'm kind of

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:26.660
thinking of I'm like yeah like like I'm not what am I a fucking like Phil is

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:31.620
dying for a bit thinking like well okay can I make some assumptions here 90

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:38.100
minutes 100 minutes give me 20 of the two of them as individuals 10 pages each

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:42.860
like oh like show me meeting so I'm meeting across the threshold of them

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:47.220
working together show them rising to prominence meet with the goddess and

01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:51.420
page 60 and fucking like and then have difficulty start to have and terrible

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:55.300
Sunder but then they choose each other over the system I mean I like we're the

01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.900
story go I'm not saying like tell me which story happens but I'm just saying

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.940
like that rhythm like but I think the problem probably was that they were sort

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.460
of like the monkeys I mean they were assembled right I got that implication

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.540
from this from the movie maybe that they were placed together that was like oh

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:15.540
you're funny and you're funny you guys should do like a fat guy skinny guy act

01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:19.220
still even as I say that out loud I'm like I'd love to be a fly on the wall of

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:25.100
that scene yeah okay because oh god this guy he's like I don't know what you

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:31.860
want me to say I was I I purposely didn't watch it because you and Cody said

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.460
we should watch it I come back from Atlanta you watch it and the last three

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:41.700
times we've hung out you're telling me how shitty it is I don't even get a

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:51.500
chance to watch it untainted you tainted it you always tainted my stuff why you

01:34:51.540 --> 01:35:00.780
got a taint so much one more one more please tainter all right I'm sorry

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:05.900
about that no you're not no I didn't really like I'll tell you the truth I

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:11.900
didn't I had a chance to watch it and I said no we all said we were gonna watch

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:16.340
it together and that would have been a nice moment and now we don't have that

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:22.060
moment because this motherfucker out he outside throwing rocks and I said wolves

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:28.980
yeah maybe that's what's going on pencil that into your schedule yeah you're so

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:35.540
busy fucking with these coyotes you can't be a real friend the more you

01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:42.940
know I like the Blues Brothers movie I think it's great I know I know it's

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:47.060
really I know you and you know I was really really inspired Chicago I watched

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:50.380
it with you and you explained the whole time this is great look at this this is

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:55.940
great I'm like it seems like a long time to get out of prison I love it yeah I

01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:04.420
mean what's not to love I don't watch it there you go you got one ally Blues

01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:09.140
Brothers 2000 I'd be interested for people to like watch that without having

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:14.460
seen the Blues Brothers and like watch their face it is be like like I don't

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.460
know what they would be like though it was it's not it's like how did this get

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.660
made did I think oh did that yeah with so a lot of the audience I assume was in

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:28.340
that position yeah I mean it's so like it's so fucking odd so odd but to me it

01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.260
kind of here's the thing about Blues Brothers 2000 which is directed by the

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:37.660
same director it to me part of what Blues Brothers 2000 does is it is it shines

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:43.420
a spotlight here's the thing the spotlight on Blues Brothers is indicative

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:47.940
of a time in our country's history when people were in love with the Blues but

01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.300
what are the Blues blue is a color so I intend to look at the John Bonny Ramsey

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:57.220
case through the lens of the chromatic spectrum there are three kinds of colors

01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:01.860
that complement each other pink is opposite of blue blue is opposite of orange

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:08.660
if you add the three together you get orange blue the I think Burke Ramsey

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:15.300
and Gordon Ramsey had an orange orchard the it just because it's like the

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:20.500
second one is like it's shot in HD and it's sort of like it's definitely very

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:27.420
much the most incentivized to recapture the magic of the first one and it's

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:32.460
kind of interesting to me that like when you try to recapture the magic of the

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:37.420
first one you you end up with something incredibly confusing is it one of those

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.780
movies were just sort of like well look at them they were having a good time

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.980
like it's like easy writer you watch you were you're like look I'll take a flyer

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.780
on this being historical but to me it looks like guys dicking around like but

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:51.780
maybe let me find out it was important that they were dicking around they

01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:55.820
needed to dick around right so important I was like okay so good movie becomes

01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:00.260
like a little bit you got one foot out like oh it's a good movie because it

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:04.860
said fuck you to Paramount or something like why did it did can I see that scene

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:09.180
in the movie no you got to watch Dennis Hopper do acid in a cemetery okay but

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:15.100
so Paramount hated it okay well then it's a good movie I mean at the time it

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:18.180
doesn't really hold up but at the time it was like different than your average

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.660
comedy that was on because they were a little darker and more alternative the

01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:25.620
outfits weren't like you know you had Robin Williams so there is that where

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:29.460
there's like three there Robin yeah yeah now I can see that and then there

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:33.380
wasn't a lot of shit coming out of Chicago film wise so there was like a

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.820
home base win for all the all the comedians in the scene that was in the

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:42.740
Midwest it'd be like if Dana Gould got famous doing a show in San Francisco

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:46.300
everybody'd be like that fucking show was amazing in San Francisco so you got

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:51.820
diehard Chicagoans spread out in LA and in New York that rep that movie because

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:56.380
for them it's their like first like fucking those are our guys that's our

01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.660
home team that's our movie so they quote it like Star Wars fans do I mean this

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:04.940
is yeah this is all stuff that's not in the movie it's all stuff that's out

01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:09.900
smeared outside the movie that it's like oh if you understood how important this

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:14.860
movie was to Chicago and to improv and to comedy and to a generation and to

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:19.900
things I read the Saturday and live like book whichever the one was like well I

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.900
don't know live from New York like the oral history one that kind of walked you

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:26.540
through it it was sort of semi authorized and that it was like interviews

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:31.100
with everybody and and and that was the part that kind of fascinated me because

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.580
that was before my time I mean I was a little kid I remember the Blues Brothers

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.980
being a thing but I was like always sort of like what's going on with this grown

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:41.420
up shit like why are these why are they I'd be like mommy why do they care that

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:45.580
that fat man is like doing a somersault and should be like my mom didn't have my

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:49.260
mom didn't go like you gotta understand Chicago's finally getting its props in

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.220
the comedy scene and and the alternative is Robin Williams I get my mom was just

01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:57.220
like my my you know I think my mom was enjoying the Blues Brothers and she was

01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:01.460
probably like it's just fun for him to dance or something and I was like okay

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:09.540
I get all that I just sort of like when do we when do you allowed to be like

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:15.700
this movie I mean it's just rotten tomatoes you can you can you can you can

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:22.900
say you don't like the movie any time yeah you could say any time I don't like

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:28.900
this movie closer to release better it's okay it's all right go ahead you know

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:35.740
it's growing on me oh shit I like the nun scene I like how hard she hits him and

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:41.660
there's a wreath of Franklin yeah that's hilarious who could forget she really

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:52.220
sang that song yeah should we have John Landis as a guest we could we could get

01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:57.220
him for sure he's a big community fan he gave me he was the he was the most

01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:02.140
flattering community compliment you watch cannibal run yeah I liked cannibal run

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.900
as a kid I don't know if I've never ever when's the last time we watched cannibal run

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:09.340
we watched it but I definitely wouldn't yeah I think we watch it as adults we're

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:13.060
just like you guys are so fucking yeah here's a thing here's a thing that's what

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:20.260
it reminds me of here's a thing so summer that cannibal run comes out is also

01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:27.180
the same summer as Raiders of Lost Art comes out and I'm about to go to the

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:34.500
movies and my and of my next-door neighbor Shelly Lipke says don't go see Raiders

down and I watch it and I go well that I don't know if it was the best movie of

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:04.660
the year but I thought it was okay I thought it was all right so I never saw

01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:09.780
Raiders in the theater what until I never saw it in the theater I had to wait till

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:14.500
it and I didn't see it in Cape because we didn't have cable I had to wait till it

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:20.780
came out on VHS that was the first time that's the only time I saw it and here's

01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:29.060
the other one and this one I can't blame on anybody same year same summer back to

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:34.700
the future came out was also the same summer that Transylvania six five

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:41.780
thousand came out and I went Jeff Goldblum's funny yeah I'm gonna go see it

01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:49.820
and enjoy myself watched it and loved it smiled from ear to ear thought every

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:54.860
joke landed perfectly I thought it was hilarious I walked out I was quoting it

01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:59.700
for weeks and people kept saying you didn't see back to the future only what I

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:04.980
can watch Michael J Fox on television I'm seeing Jeff Goldblum and Ed Bakley

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:13.340
junior goofing off in Transylvania this is gold I'm telling you I was I haven't

01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:18.380
seen and I didn't I missed out on seeing back to the future in the theater yeah I

01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:22.740
dragged my friends to see spaceballs I was like you don't get it like this guy's

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:26.540
the master of comedy he made young Frankenstein fucking he's been I mean

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.260
like he's doing a Star Wars movie this is gonna be amazing and my friends

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:34.140
walked out there like what the fuck is wrong with you I can't look I but I

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.660
remember going with my friends I was I was we were still not 17 I don't know

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:43.460
what we were but we wanted to see Beverly Hills cop to and we went to the

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:47.140
theater we bought the tickets to Project X with Matthew Broderick it's about

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:54.580
monkeys getting irradiated and and Matthew Broderick dealing with it and we

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:59.460
went into the Beverly Hills cop to theater there was it was like the it was

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:05.060
sold out so we were like three 12 year olds sitting in the aisle in a rated our

01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:12.340
movie so it wasn't long before we got ushered and we got ushered into the

01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.620
theater that we bought tickets for we started watching Project X which I had

01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:19.780
now missed the first 10 minutes of but I was immediately fucking enthralled by

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.540
because it's Matthew Broderick dealing with the slow realization that he's in

01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:27.060
charge of these monkeys and they're they're they're the experiments that

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.620
they're doing on them and he's supposed to take care of them in the cages he's

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.780
like basically a janitor in charge of these monkey cages he's like these

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:35.020
monkeys are super smart and he's like falling in love with them and there's

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.420
like a monkey trainer there and then he like he's like the threshold is him

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:41.860
finding out he like hangs out long enough to realize and watch what they're

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:45.700
doing they're putting these chimpanzees in these these little like model planes

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.700
and then like they're basically like using them to test how far you can be

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.660
away from an atomic bomb after it drops before it without getting cancer so

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:57.420
they're just irradiating the monkeys like zapping them with radioactivity and

01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:00.740
like like Matthew Broderick has to deal with finding out that that's his job that

01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:04.340
his friends that he's making these monkeys are like I know they're apes I

01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:10.020
don't want to get letters from apes the the the they don't have tails or

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:17.060
whatever the but but and I was like and then my friends were like god damn it

autobiographical you can is this dummy yeah congrats and they got they got it

01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:24.500
looks like they may have finally found Dan Harmon but I'm not allowed to say

01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:33.060
until until he's cast Ben Affleck as he do not hold my past he passed but hey my

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:38.780
name's Dan Harmon hey what are you talking about for those of you you know

01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:42.340
following this drama I think I may have said Nick Offerman passed I mean in the

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:47.060
in the in the in the biopic of like trying to cast Dan Harmon it's like Nick

01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:51.340
Offerman passing that should be like that was our closest shot like I mean

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:57.300
that's the guy that should play me in the biopic right oh I'm flattering myself

01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:06.260
is that it what about John C Riley that could be funny I think I think we you

01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:10.540
know I think we either went when I say we I thought my thing I feel like it's my

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:13.820
thing this is why I make my fiance is like producing it in bed next to me but

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:19.740
it's not I'm just I just listen to these conversations about Eric Riley what

01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:29.060
Eric Warheim I like Luca Luca there's a thing I don't think there's a

01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:33.020
directive I think I talked about this it's like oh they want the A-list like

01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:38.380
Anna Kendrick is the lead so they like the it's like the intersection between

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:43.260
like what why would it's like it's my part is not a it's like a it's like a

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:47.500
gender inversion so like my part is about as interesting in the script as
