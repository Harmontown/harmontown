00:00.000 --> 00:26.720
Hello everyone and welcome once again to those of you, the lucky few digging it live here at Meltdown

00:26.720 --> 00:34.720
Comics in Hollywood, to those listening around the world, the beautiful planet Earth, Harmontown is now in session.

00:34.720 --> 01:04.440
Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, the Dan Harmon.wn, thank you, thank you, this is buttoning my sweatshirt in front of my gut, it's pretty, it's fooling

01:04.440 --> 01:13.440
everybody, right? It's slimming. If you cover something, you don't know it's there. Are you saying you've put on a couple?

01:13.440 --> 01:32.440
Yeah, definitely, definitely. A lot of stress at work and a lot of seeking comfort. You're on a diet and it's just like, that's its own thing, it's discipline and then any excuse at work, you just go, well, if I'm staying here all night, then I'm going to eat chicken and waffles because I deserve that and all that stuff.

01:32.440 --> 01:40.440
I talked to Dino and he said that, you know, Dino Stamatopoulos friend and writer on your show, he said that you guys are ordering lots of gourmet food like every day.

01:40.440 --> 01:49.440
We try, you know, Sony doesn't pay for coffee, they still pay for meals, so we really try to shiv them.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.440
What's the average?

01:51.440 --> 02:08.440
Puffer fish again or whatever. You having fugu? Yeah. Anyways, and every Friday is wings Friday, I get hot wings for everybody. That's actually out of pocket. I don't know why.

02:08.440 --> 02:28.440
What a great opening to the show. We're just talking about being fat and eating. There's some corrections in order, somebody tweeted me to let us know that the internet was developed for scientific purposes, not military, so I guess that's the one thing we got wrong last week.

02:28.440 --> 02:43.440
The only thing we've ever gotten wrong. Yeah. For all of you, history buffs using our show as some kind of archive or you aliens digging this up and putting it into your factoids about Earth, yeah, we don't know what we're doing here.

02:43.440 --> 02:55.440
We just drop into a pool and we reach for a laugh. What's the difference between scientific pursuits and military? Don't military people constantly think that they're being scientific?

02:55.440 --> 03:02.440
I feel like anytime anything beautiful is developed or invented, the military finds an awesome way to turn that into a way to kill people.

03:02.440 --> 03:10.440
And yet not the internet. They couldn't figure it out. Isn't that great? They can kill you with the internet.

03:10.440 --> 03:28.440
Well, now they can use it to enslave you. But it's kind of beautiful that they didn't see it coming and figure out a way to roll it out in a way that we enslaved ourselves with the internet. Nobody pulled a sheet off of it and said, here's how it works and this is the only way you can use it.

03:28.440 --> 03:40.440
You have to have a six on your forehead in order to log into this level and you have orange clearance here. It just kind of evolved organically and we found out something from the internet which is that we all want to be idiots.

03:40.440 --> 03:49.440
We don't want to topple the power structures. We like Twinkies. We like YouTube.

03:49.440 --> 03:58.440
It's willful surrender to control. The book We by Zamiat and I was the first, people have read that before?

03:58.440 --> 04:07.440
Yeah. It's like proto sci-fi. It's the only book written in the future and people very willfully submit to control.

04:07.440 --> 04:20.440
Well, when you have a society that's high on the hog, it's that whole bread and circuses thing. That's where the Coliseum comes from. Just give us entertainment in exchange for all this power and wealth that we all have.

04:20.440 --> 04:35.440
Like America, we're very self-loathing lately about our economy but we still are not eating our own feet. There's still more food in the garbage than there is available and we need a lot of entertainment and stuff, a lot of distraction.

04:35.440 --> 04:41.440
This show's kicked off in a very cheery note. I think it bodes well.

04:41.440 --> 04:51.440
Well, further from the corrections department, when we brought up Glenn who brought the earth shine, he wrote us a very nice letter, gave us some more earth shine. I'm going to stay off of it.

04:51.440 --> 04:59.440
And my earth shine, for those of you who don't know, it's high quality moonshine. I'm certain that we're all going to jail for some sort of federal crime.

04:59.440 --> 05:07.440
He typically uses it for his absinthe, but it's an ingredient of his absinthe. Her absinthe, that's what the correction is.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.440
Wait, what?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.440
We have a lot of transgender Harmontown fans.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.440
How many?

05:14.440 --> 05:20.440
Three is a lot. It's a very peculiar state to be in transgender. Three is a crowd.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.440
Is Glenn here?

05:22.440 --> 05:30.440
Glenn is not here, Glenn slash Jane, who he wanted to, he said, she said that when she came up,

05:30.440 --> 05:38.440
I know what it's like to be dead.

05:38.440 --> 05:47.440
I asked, what's your name? And she blurted out Glenn, force of habit, wanted to send a letter of, among other things, saying like, by the way,

05:47.440 --> 05:58.440
so that people don't get confused on the internet where he is very much out of the transgen closet and things, as Jane spelled G-A-N-N-E rhymes with plain.

05:58.440 --> 06:06.440
That's the thing that kills me, Jane. You're transgender, but not enough complexity for you.

06:06.440 --> 06:17.440
Your name is Jane, spelled G-A-N-N-E, just in case anybody got through the transgender gauntlet without being alarmed or confused.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.440
Did she or he, how do I address he or her? He or she?

06:21.440 --> 06:27.440
I think the whole idea is that they identify as a female, and so the pronoun you use is she.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.440
Because Glenn could be a female name as well.

06:30.440 --> 06:38.440
I suppose anything could be, but she has assumed a new angle of identity? I don't know.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.440
It's a new emergent thing. It's exciting. I'm actually very excited.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.440
Why do our transgender fans come here and male attire?

06:46.440 --> 06:52.440
Because they're not transvestites. They are not necessarily...

06:52.440 --> 06:54.440
I don't know anything about this.

06:54.440 --> 07:00.440
What's funny is that half of the people you brought Levi up and he started talking about his thing.

07:00.440 --> 07:05.440
You could hear people in our L.A. audience going...

07:05.440 --> 07:11.440
He's being closed-minded about describing himself as transgender because he said he wanted to...

07:11.440 --> 07:15.440
He's okay having a mustache because he doesn't have a uterus and you could hear people going...

07:15.440 --> 07:18.440
Glass ceiling.

07:18.440 --> 07:24.440
Whatever. He said something that wasn't the exact way that other people understand transgender to be.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.440
Transgenderism, I don't even know what to call it, but I am very flattered that...

07:28.440 --> 07:34.440
Because I don't think you could get more fringe psychologically. Is that politically incorrect to say?

07:34.440 --> 07:42.440
I don't think you could be more complex on the inside of a human head compared to what's going on outside your body, in other words.

07:42.440 --> 07:52.440
As far as somebody that you would look at in line at the bank and not be immediately presented with something that registered with you...

07:52.440 --> 07:58.440
You couldn't have more noodles going on up there. More twists and turns.

07:58.440 --> 08:03.440
More reasons to be distrustful of the people around you.

08:03.440 --> 08:11.440
More suspicion, more fear that somebody might bully you for answering questions about yourself or expressing yourself.

08:11.440 --> 08:21.440
So I'm very, very flattered. I take that as a barometer of our good work here and my good philosophy and religion.

08:21.440 --> 08:33.440
Any person in that situation would listen to our podcast and feel comfortable expressing that.

08:33.440 --> 08:40.440
Is anybody else here a transgender that we don't know about? Have we met all of them or are there more lurking about?

08:40.440 --> 08:45.440
I think they all are. They're just more afraid to say it.

08:45.440 --> 08:54.440
There's a couple of trans-scientologists. People who identify as a Scientologist but they're not Scientologists.

08:54.440 --> 09:03.440
They want to be called Scientologists because they feel like a Scientologist but they're not going to pay for that class.

09:03.440 --> 09:12.440
I'm not being like flippant. You can identify as a woman, look like a man, not want to dress like a woman.

09:12.440 --> 09:17.440
Just inside you're a woman but dress like a guy.

09:17.440 --> 09:30.440
Is that someone not following through with it or is that somebody saying, I just am a woman and I'll still dress like a guy named Tony?

09:30.440 --> 09:35.440
I think it's just breaking it up into different strata. You can stop there if you want.

09:35.440 --> 09:43.440
That's a thing and then there's people that are in that situation that therefore want to...

09:43.440 --> 09:47.440
I don't know if there's a different language for it. They take steps medically, hormones and stuff.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.440
Transition.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
They transition. Our friend...

09:51.440 --> 09:59.440
I heard it said a long time ago that very few people would be completely heterosexual if it was a sliding scale from 0 to 100

09:59.440 --> 10:06.440
or from left to right that people's sexuality tends to be somewhere along a sliding scale

10:06.440 --> 10:09.440
that nobody is completely masculine or completely feminine.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.440
Where do you feel you fall on the scale, Dan?

10:12.440 --> 10:20.440
How close to totally masculine or toward the middle to the nether regions?

10:20.440 --> 10:25.440
I think Mark Rufalo is a real charming piece of...

10:25.440 --> 10:35.440
I wouldn't mind if he pulled up on his motorbike and showed me at a garden.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.440
I could surrender to...

10:39.440 --> 10:50.440
Sexually speaking, sexually, I've never even had the time or energy to examine where in the spectrum between hetero and homo I would fall

10:50.440 --> 10:58.440
because there's too much going on in the hetero side with me and my various kinks and things.

10:58.440 --> 11:05.440
I'm sort of caught between hetero and asexual.

11:05.440 --> 11:11.440
I feel like some weird shit happened to me when I was a kid involving maybe hanging out under the table

11:11.440 --> 11:15.440
while 70s pantyhose clad women hung out.

11:15.440 --> 11:21.440
There's some kind of leg fetish thing that I almost feel is like I really fully clothed women.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.440
It's very strange.

11:25.440 --> 11:31.440
There are things that I consume as pornography that you would not consider pornography.

11:31.440 --> 11:40.440
Let's just say for Thanksgiving, I invited Mark Rufalo over and he was wearing nice trousers.

11:40.440 --> 11:48.440
Let's say that you dropped your napkin under the table and you saw that Mark Rufalo was wearing kind of a high heel.

11:48.440 --> 11:53.440
No, I like the feminine leg.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.440
Have you seen Mark Rufalo's leg?

11:56.440 --> 12:01.440
Well, if he could pass, there's guys on YouTube that do that.

12:01.440 --> 12:11.440
You're clicking around, you're like, here's what peels my banana, legs and tights.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.440
You find something and it's like, oh, wow, that's pretty good.

12:14.440 --> 12:18.440
And then the conversation was like, dude, guy, guy, dude.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.440
And you're like, oh, god damn it.

12:22.440 --> 12:27.440
You got me, Michael.

12:27.440 --> 12:35.440
You know, you have to look closely for that Adam's apple right on the back of the calf.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.440
I didn't know that.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.440
What is shoe play?

12:37.440 --> 12:43.440
Shoe play is dangling, dipping, heel popping.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.440
Those are the three subtypes of shoe play.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.440
I'm glad you asked.

12:48.440 --> 12:53.440
Dan, would you please elicit the difference between dangling and dipping?

12:53.440 --> 13:00.440
Dangling and dipping, dangling is a leg crossed shoe hanging off the tail, you know.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.440
Sexy secretary librarian or something like, you know.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.440
And is the whole woman in frame or just a leg?

13:05.440 --> 13:11.440
Just a leg is fine with this old timer.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.440
We have a colloquy here.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.440
How many other people are into dangling and dipping?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.440
I dated a shoe fetishist.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
You dated a shoe fetishist?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.440
Yeah.

13:22.440 --> 13:27.440
And so did you dangling, dipping, popping, the whole speed squad and the flip flap?

13:27.440 --> 13:31.440
I know the vernacular with it.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.440
Dangling, dipping, heel popping.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.440
Okay, so what's dipping?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.440
What is dipping?

13:35.440 --> 13:40.440
Dipping is like a shoe on the floor as far as I understand it.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.440
Do you have my heels on right now?

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
Yeah.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
Can you dangling and dip for us up there?

13:43.440 --> 13:46.440
They're like, let's walk around to the stage.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.440
Well, it's an audio podcast.

13:48.440 --> 13:53.440
Yeah, but I don't think she's going to be able to dip with those shoes.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.440
Yeah, yeah.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.440
If you're dipping into the shoe.

13:57.440 --> 14:04.440
Just imagine like a loose or like a high heel shoe or like a flat or something that had

14:04.440 --> 14:06.440
like easy, like you can get your foot in and out of it.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.440
So dipping is like the woman is like in and out, you know, like kind of.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.440
Do you want the shoe?

14:12.440 --> 14:13.440
I don't.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.440
It's an audio podcast and also I'm getting weirdly like.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.440
Yeah.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.440
This is making me nervous.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.440
Lauren, right?

14:21.440 --> 14:22.440
Yeah.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.440
Lauren from the front row came up and offered to dip and dangle and dingle and screebscrab.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.440
I went for the second row.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.440
I just offered up a shoe.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.440
I just produced a high heel.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.440
Yeah, we're getting to the city limits of where Eric's not going to be very happy.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.440
Get the shoe up here.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.440
Fuck it.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.440
Let's do this.

14:37.440 --> 14:44.440
I want to know about dangles and dips and scoops and screebs and the whole flim flim.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.440
What's your name, madam?

14:45.440 --> 14:46.440
Annie.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.440
This is a weird choice for a podcast to make.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.440
I'm just, I'm worried as a producer, like what are we, what are people listening to?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
We're bringing women up on stage.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.440
And also just so Aaron knows, I'm not like Howard Sterninger or anything.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.440
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not even going to look or anything.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.440
Like Aaron, if you're listening, like I'm not, this is not like, I'm not, I'm not being like

15:04.440 --> 15:06.440
any Kaufman wrestling with women or anything.

15:06.440 --> 15:11.440
Aaron, if you're listening, Dan has his pants down already.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.440
This is very, that's very important to me.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.440
I wouldn't, I wouldn't tolerate the equivalent with Aaron, you know?

15:16.440 --> 15:17.440
Yeah, yeah.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.440
I was, I was a little upset when she was fucking around with that cat shirt guy.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
Wait a minute, the cat shirt guy.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.440
Okay, fuck it.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.440
No, no, no.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.440
Anyways, okay.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.440
Okay.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.440
What's your name, ma'am?

15:29.440 --> 15:30.440
Annie, Annie.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.440
Annie's dangling right now.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.440
Okay, so I, I, I, I, I, I, she was dangling from her toe.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.440
That's a dangle.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.440
That's very difficult to do, actually.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.440
All right.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.440
Yeah.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.440
Okay, now, now give us some dipping, Annie.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.440
Okay, so what's, what's dipping?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.440
Dipping is, you'd have to stand up and then, then you're.

15:42.440 --> 15:46.440
Say you're, pretend you're checking somebody into a hotel and you're working with a computer

15:46.440 --> 15:51.440
and you're kind of absent-mindedly like, yeah.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.440
That's dipping.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.440
All right.

15:54.440 --> 15:58.440
Although, although now I'm wondering what, what heel popping actually is because that,

15:58.440 --> 15:59.440
that involves a.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.440
I thought this was heel popping where it's like where you've got the, like.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.440
No, that's, that's Nancy Drew.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.440
Where the heel pops out of it.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.440
I can't do it in these shoes.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.440
Then how is that different?

16:09.440 --> 16:10.440
I'm so confused.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.440
But it's where your heel sort of pops out.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.440
Okay.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
Somehow, somehow I'm still not turned on.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.440
I don't understand.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.440
Not because you're not beautiful in that, in sexy, in sexy way.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.440
I don't know why this isn't doing anything for you.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.440
I've never got the feet thing.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.440
I mean, I, I like feet.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.440
I'm not, I'm not averse to feet.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.440
I've never, I've never seen the allure of.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.440
Oh, I know what heel popping is.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.440
I just realized.

16:33.440 --> 16:39.440
It's, heel popping is the precursor to a dangle because you can't, you can't dangle unless

16:39.440 --> 16:40.440
you, unless you pop the heel.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.440
But the heel popping enthusiasts just want to see that popping of the heel over and over

16:44.440 --> 16:45.440
again.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
I just want to see this moment.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.440
Yeah.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.440
That moment there.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.440
Back on and off and on.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.440
But as far as I've been told, once you pop, you can't stop.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.440
All right.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.440
Come on.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.440
Let's, let's thank these ladies.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.440
All right.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.440
Sit the fuck down.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.440
Thank you very much.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.440
Thank you.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.440
Thank you.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.440
Thank you.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.440
Thank you.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
Thank you.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
Thank you.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.440
Thank you.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.440
Thank you.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.440
Thank you.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.440
Thank you.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.440
Thank you.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.440
Thank you.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.440
You want to, you want to welcome us into this world?

17:11.440 --> 17:12.440
What are you doing?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.880
You got, you've got people up on stage showing us shoe things.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.380
Our job is not to care about the listeners.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.020
It's our job to reward the live audience, then.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.080
All right.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.080
Start the laser show.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
Whoa.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
Too soon.

17:23.080 --> 17:29.360
Oh, interesting tag on the Jimmy Kimmel situation visually.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.360
Huh.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.840
I never thought about that laid out in that diagram.

17:33.840 --> 17:38.080
Oh, that brings it all together again.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.080
Good night, folks.

17:40.080 --> 17:45.080
Dan, for the listener, describe the Jimmy Kimmel situation for us.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.080
Well, you're asking as a joke because you think I improvised

17:48.080 --> 17:50.080
the words Jimmy Kimmel situation, but there is one.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.080
There was one, I don't know.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.080
I feel like I'm part of the problem saying there was one.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.080
There was just the tabloid streak.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.080
Jimmy Kimmel did a segment that was sort of like kids say the darndest things.

18:01.080 --> 18:06.080
He was having kids talk about how to handle the various world crises,

18:06.080 --> 18:11.080
one of them being America's trillion-dollar debt to Japan, or to China.

18:11.080 --> 18:18.080
And one of the kids kind of half through a chuckle and little kid flustery thing said,

18:18.080 --> 18:21.080
like, I don't know, maybe we should kill all the people in China.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.080
And Jimmy was like, ah, that's an interesting answer.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.080
I don't know, moving on.

18:26.080 --> 18:31.080
Flash cut two headlines saying, like, you know,

18:31.080 --> 18:38.080
White House apologizes to China for the, you know, genocide jokes on the thing.

18:38.080 --> 18:42.080
Asian Americans in comment section saying, ah, that's a funny joke.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.080
How about this one? Let's kill all the Jews.

18:44.080 --> 18:49.080
No comment on any of this. I'm out.

18:49.080 --> 18:54.080
All I can say is I don't care what you find funny.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.080
I don't care what any of us think are funny.

18:56.080 --> 19:00.080
I don't care about the empirical definitions of humor, but I just got one question.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.080
Are we going to be fucking cone heads?

19:02.080 --> 19:04.080
What are we going to do?

19:04.080 --> 19:07.080
What is this world going to look like in 2070?

19:07.080 --> 19:13.080
Do we really think we're going to achieve some world where everyone just kind of quietly glides around

19:13.080 --> 19:17.080
and someone, like, emits a proton and it's the equivalent of a fart?

19:17.080 --> 19:19.080
And everyone, like, titters?

19:19.080 --> 19:24.080
Do you really think that once a noose starts tightening, it ever gets loose?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.080
Linguistically, verbally, socially?

19:26.080 --> 19:33.080
Do you really have you ever experienced anything that indicated to you that once people started introducing the concept of limitation,

19:33.080 --> 19:35.080
anything ever got more liberated?

19:35.080 --> 19:41.080
I know we all think that we are advanced because they didn't have the Seinfeld masturbation episode in Victorian England,

19:41.080 --> 19:45.080
but there's another way of looking at this.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.080
We are becoming insects.

19:48.080 --> 19:53.080
We are envying everything that ants have and not embracing anything that primates have.

19:53.080 --> 20:00.080
And we are just looking so forward to the day when we have a hive mind and we just barf trophallaxis into each other's mouths

20:00.080 --> 20:03.080
and that you can tell from the chemical where you've been and where you're going.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.080
And we just love it. We can't wait.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.080
We're just sanding down the little bumps and edges.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.080
We're just taking so much glee in it, too. That's the weird thing.

20:11.080 --> 20:17.080
There's a primatological glee taking a gazelle femur and smashing a racist joke's head.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.080
That's a racist joke. A racist.

20:19.080 --> 20:24.080
And it's like you're emitting a pheromone.

20:24.080 --> 20:31.080
You're getting flushed and excited by bashing the world around you,

20:31.080 --> 20:38.080
trying to round up all the little anomalies and get all the air bubbles out of the waterbed mattress.

20:38.080 --> 20:44.080
This finish line that you think you're headed towards, I feel like I can see it at 40.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.080
I feel like I know it's not going to be that fun.

20:47.080 --> 20:53.080
Yeah, we're very willfully and kind of gleefully sacrificing liberty for security.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.080
We're not getting any smarter. That's the thing.

20:55.080 --> 21:00.080
None of these people that are learning how to be offended know where Guatemala is on a map.

21:00.080 --> 21:05.080
But the thing is, someone's going to go online after the show when they hear this

21:05.080 --> 21:08.080
and go on a forum and say, we are getting smarter, man.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.080
Life is evolution, Jack. Everything is getting better.

21:12.080 --> 21:18.080
I was saying that the English language, and I would say all languages are probably degrading

21:18.080 --> 21:21.080
because we're all truncating language, and people say, no, it's not.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.080
Language is always evolving. I fucking disagree with that.

21:24.080 --> 21:29.080
I think that language, the English language is a huge language, and we don't use any of the words.

21:29.080 --> 21:36.080
Instead of having five words that mean one thing, we now use one word to mean 11 things.

21:36.080 --> 21:40.080
That's not the growth of the language. That is the shrinking of the language.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.080
And if anyone wants to go online with me and have a conversation about that, I'd love to.

21:43.080 --> 21:48.080
I don't think that we're evolving at all with technology.

21:48.080 --> 21:54.080
It's not just me being grumpy, old man. I really do think that the language dies every time.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.080
People say, oh, what's the fucking word that people use?

21:58.080 --> 21:59.080
Awesome sauce.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.080
Awesome sauce. Amazeballs.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.080
Amazeballs?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.080
No, I will stand by amazeballs because that's...

22:04.080 --> 22:07.080
Amazeballs is a new way to save it.

22:07.080 --> 22:13.080
There's something like 180 synonyms for the word nice, and we use nice for 180 of them,

22:13.080 --> 22:16.080
because we don't know all the fucking words anymore.

22:16.080 --> 22:20.080
Oh, what's that? He was...

22:20.080 --> 22:22.080
What's that? Not chastity. What's the fucking word?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.080
Redicent.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.080
Redicent. I was redicent to do that.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.080
No, you were reluctant to do that. Redicent doesn't mean reluctant.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.080
Now it does. We've made redicent mean reluctant because we've misused it for so long,

22:34.080 --> 22:38.080
that the dictionaries have just said, fuck it. Now it means reluctant.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.080
And that's not the growth of a language. That's a language dying a little bit

22:42.080 --> 22:46.080
because redicent is a better word than...

22:46.080 --> 22:48.080
We don't need two words to say reluctant.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.080
I love this great show. We went from Uncle Creepy's foot fetish corner

22:51.080 --> 22:56.080
to grandpa Grumpy's vocabulary police.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.080
Fucking...

22:58.080 --> 23:01.080
Also, the dictionary in your iPhone sucks.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.080
Don't use that dictionary.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.080
Have a fucking real Miriam Webster, giant OED.

23:05.080 --> 23:09.080
Have a big motherfucking dictionary with you at all times and use it.

23:09.080 --> 23:14.080
The iPhone dictionary is as good as fucking Google Weather.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.080
Google Weather says it's 73. It's fucking 45 now.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.080
They don't know. Don't trust your iPhone for fuck...

23:20.080 --> 23:22.080
Although today I was experimenting with Siri,

23:22.080 --> 23:25.080
and she's quite funny if you say dirty things to her.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.080
Oh yeah, you can have a good time in bed just hanging out.

23:28.080 --> 23:35.080
Aaron and I, we talked to Siri and get Siri to talk to the other Siri.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.080
I'll say to Siri, why don't you go fuck yourself,

23:38.080 --> 23:41.080
and then she'll turn on her Siri and then Siri's response,

23:41.080 --> 23:44.080
which will be something like, oh, I think you should watch your language,

23:44.080 --> 23:46.080
and then Siri will say to Siri,

23:46.080 --> 23:49.080
I'm sorry, would you like me to look that up on the internet?

23:49.080 --> 23:53.080
How do you like it, bitch?

23:53.080 --> 23:56.080
I blush if I could.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.080
I turned mine on in Italian. Have you tried the Italian lady?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.080
No.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.080
Talk to her.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.080
There's my fetish.

24:05.080 --> 24:09.080
Siri, dove il ristorante.

24:09.080 --> 24:14.080
It's fucking good.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.080
It's very sexy.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.080
All right, we have a guest here.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.080
Did you know that Feral Audio is a whole network, Jeff?

24:21.080 --> 24:23.080
You gotta be shitting me.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.080
I thought we were the only thing on Feral Audio.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.080
No, no.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.080
We're part of a fucking union of brothers and sisters.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.080
Well, that sounds like bullshit.

24:31.080 --> 24:37.080
Who represent the cutting edge of unpaid comedy types.

24:37.080 --> 24:42.080
And here's another member of our family, Mr. Brody Stevens.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.080
Yeah!

24:44.080 --> 25:06.080
You know, thank you for having me here, Dan and Jeffrey.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.080
I am wearing a hat.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.080
I just flew in from Toronto,

25:11.080 --> 25:14.080
and I was able to wear kind of a knit cap thing.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.080
It was cold there.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.080
Yeah.

25:16.080 --> 25:21.080
So I was bringing the energy of Toronto with me here to Meltdown.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.080
What's the Toronto scene like?

25:23.080 --> 25:25.080
Is it like a Seattle in the north?

25:25.080 --> 25:28.080
You know, you would think so.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.080
From the hat.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.080
I mean, well, there you go.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.080
Well, it was cold.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.080
I mean, I would say it's like more...

25:34.080 --> 25:35.080
I mean, it's like Buffalo.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.080
Obviously, it's near.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.080
It's near.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.080
They share the Niagara Falls.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.080
I learned about that.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.080
I've been to Vancouver, but I've been to Toronto a couple of times.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.080
It's like America, you know?

25:45.080 --> 25:50.080
I was doing shows last night, and I think they are...

25:50.080 --> 25:52.080
It's just a little...

25:52.080 --> 25:54.080
It's a little different up there.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.080
You know, it's like, it is America,

25:57.080 --> 26:01.080
but it's not right there.

26:01.080 --> 26:04.080
I like Canadian comedy audiences.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.080
I think Canadians have an awesome sense of humor.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.080
I think they're quite game, especially...

26:09.080 --> 26:11.080
I'm not ripping Canada.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.080
Brody, you were fucking shitting all over Canada.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.080
Let's be honest about...

26:15.080 --> 26:20.080
Last night, I was doing a show in an underground pot club.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.080
What?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.080
It's a comedy club.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.080
There's like six clubs up there where they smoke pot.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.080
They do shows.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.080
Underground meaning not legitimate?

26:29.080 --> 26:30.080
Like secret?

26:30.080 --> 26:33.080
Kind of, yeah, but the cops let it go,

26:33.080 --> 26:36.080
but they have a big comedy scene up there for that in Toronto.

26:36.080 --> 26:40.080
So I was doing a show last night, and they're smoking pot in there,

26:40.080 --> 26:42.080
and I've done shows where they smoke pot at the ice house.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.080
I've been there.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.080
I know we're a podcast live audience.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.080
I'm going to focus more on the podcast.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.080
Oh, good.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
That's my thing.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.080
Well, I think they were left out of their foot fetish stuff.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.080
Oh, okay.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.080
I don't really have a foot fetish.

26:55.080 --> 27:01.080
I mean, I have one time I did something with a sock, I think, one time,

27:01.080 --> 27:02.080
a girl's sock.

27:02.080 --> 27:07.080
I don't know, the foot, and the tree, and the tree of foot fetishes,

27:07.080 --> 27:12.080
like, because I'm a heavy duty leg man, and kind of, and like a nylon guy,

27:12.080 --> 27:16.080
and because the leg terminates at this beautiful part of the,

27:16.080 --> 27:18.080
the equally feminine part of the feminine leg.

27:18.080 --> 27:22.080
You love legs, and you love terminus.

27:22.080 --> 27:26.080
But there's a, then there's a branch of the whole,

27:26.080 --> 27:29.080
like the foot, when you say foot fetish, it gets into like,

27:29.080 --> 27:33.080
I want someone to walk in chocolate, and then walk on my face,

27:33.080 --> 27:38.080
and masturbate me with their toes, and I'm going to eat the toes,

27:38.080 --> 27:40.080
and you put the other toe in the butt and stuff.

27:40.080 --> 27:44.080
And I'm not that focused on the foot.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.080
It's just like the foot is a beautiful little period on the sentence

27:47.080 --> 27:49.080
that is a woman's leg.

27:49.080 --> 27:53.080
I got called out for looking at a girl's foot in ninth grade.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.080
I remember it vividly.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.080
I grew up here in the valley, San Fernando Valley,

27:56.080 --> 27:59.080
and she was like, you know, in 80s.

27:59.080 --> 28:02.080
I'm not going to say like a stoner's chick, but she smoked cigarettes,

28:02.080 --> 28:04.080
and I remember I was like looking at her feet.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.080
She was like, why are you looking at my feet?

28:06.080 --> 28:08.080
And I was just like, just into it.

28:08.080 --> 28:12.080
I was really, I don't think I need the dipped in chocolate.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.080
I like looking at them.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.080
I would do what you said with the feet on the penis.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.080
I'm okay with that.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.080
When I was in high school, like late high school and early college,

28:21.080 --> 28:23.080
my friend Chris, he would have these parties,

28:23.080 --> 28:26.080
and his father was a sheriff.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
And they were awesome because they were,

28:28.080 --> 28:31.080
we went into the parents' room one time,

28:31.080 --> 28:33.080
and there was tons of bondage gear,

28:33.080 --> 28:37.080
like lots of fucking chains and whips and strap-ons

28:37.080 --> 28:40.080
and all kinds of good, like get it on kind of shit.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.080
Between, you know, like late 40s husband and wife,

28:43.080 --> 28:46.080
they didn't care that we would have these parties

28:46.080 --> 28:48.080
and everybody would get naked in their jacuzzi

28:48.080 --> 28:50.080
and everybody would suck each other's toes.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.080
Shrimp jobs, shrimpin'?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.080
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp jobs.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.080
We called it shrimp jobs.

28:57.080 --> 29:01.080
Which made the unsexy even less sexy.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.080
But we would all suck each other's toes,

29:03.080 --> 29:04.080
and it was good fun.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.080
Because in the jacuzzi,

29:06.080 --> 29:09.080
you're all boiled up, you know.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.080
All the pathogens have been sucked up.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.080
If you're gonna suck a toe, you should,

29:14.080 --> 29:16.080
that would be the spot to do it.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.080
A pool of hot water would be a good place to get started,

29:19.080 --> 29:20.080
I think.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.080
When you're looking at feats on the internet,

29:23.080 --> 29:25.080
like what is the...

29:25.080 --> 29:27.080
What's going on through your mind?

29:27.080 --> 29:29.080
What's the fantasy that's happening?

29:29.080 --> 29:33.080
You know, I'm looking and I just like,

29:33.080 --> 29:34.080
it doesn't go beyond that.

29:34.080 --> 29:37.080
A fetish is like, it's like the object itself

29:37.080 --> 29:39.080
is like this thing that's more important than anything

29:39.080 --> 29:41.080
and it's a really interesting question

29:41.080 --> 29:44.080
because I think that's part of what makes me,

29:44.080 --> 29:47.080
you know, potentially asexual sometimes.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.080
My behavior.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.080
Like if I'm working and I'm too busy

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
and then I'm so, I'm like,

29:53.080 --> 29:55.080
okay, I'm gonna gratify myself

29:55.080 --> 29:57.080
because, you know,

29:57.080 --> 29:59.080
well, a nice excuse is,

29:59.080 --> 30:02.080
hey, who wants to get prostate cancer?

30:02.080 --> 30:04.080
You gotta come constantly, right?

30:04.080 --> 30:06.080
That's true.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.080
Is that true?

30:08.080 --> 30:10.080
Yeah, they got Ernest Borgnine.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
I think he recently passed maybe,

30:12.080 --> 30:14.080
but he was like 95, he was on Kona

30:14.080 --> 30:18.080
and he said he masturbated like all the time every day

30:18.080 --> 30:21.080
and that's what led him to be happy and live that long.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.080
You guys remember that a couple years ago?

30:23.080 --> 30:24.080
Thank you. Thank you.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.080
You guys?

30:25.080 --> 30:26.080
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.080
We're all gonna live forever then.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.080
Last night in Toronto, they wouldn't have agreed,

30:29.080 --> 30:31.080
they would have just left me out there hanging.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.080
Canadian audiences are a little more laid back.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.080
Yeah.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.080
They're not responsive.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.080
Well, they were also super high.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.080
It was an apartment.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.080
Also, in Toronto, they have the street meat.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.080
They have those fucking carts with the hot dogs and stuff

30:44.080 --> 30:45.080
and it's quite good.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.080
Oh yeah, I had Schwarma last night

30:47.080 --> 30:49.080
and I love Zanku.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.080
It's right up the street.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.080
I go there all the time.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.080
I'm a proud member of the Zanku Army.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.080
But I went to a place,

30:55.080 --> 30:59.080
I mean, it said it was a falafel king.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.080
It looked like a chain thing, but it wasn't

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
and I went in there and they were just very nice

31:04.080 --> 31:09.080
and I had a chicken tiki marsala or something like that.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.080
It was good.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.080
I said it was better than Zanku

31:15.080 --> 31:17.080
and I hate to say that.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.080
So Toronto is multicultural.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.080
It's great.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.080
People get along.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.080
I grew up here in Los Angeles.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.080
People don't get along.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.080
I lived in New York.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.080
People actually get along in New York.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.080
You have to.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.080
You're together.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.080
I grew up here.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.080
Valley, busing.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.080
I've been all around.

31:34.080 --> 31:39.080
And you were talking about, you know, asexuality

31:39.080 --> 31:40.080
and things of that.

31:40.080 --> 31:45.080
If you do listen to my podcast, maybe nine months ago,

31:45.080 --> 31:49.080
I did come out on my podcast.

31:49.080 --> 31:53.080
I am 10% gay.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.080
And 52%.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.080
Thank you.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.080
I mean, I went to Bangkok and I pushed it to the limit.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.080
You were talking about strap-ons and Adam's apples.

32:03.080 --> 32:08.080
I got pulled into the night of Bangkok and I went there.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.080
Well, let's be more specific, Brody.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.080
I can't be too.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.080
Well, you know what?

32:12.080 --> 32:16.080
I think the more I talk about it, the more comfortable I'll get with it

32:16.080 --> 32:20.080
and I can really chisel down that story for my one lady boy.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.080
I mean, my one-man show.

32:22.080 --> 32:26.080
Wait, you had a lady boy encounter in Bangkok?

32:26.080 --> 32:27.080
You know what?

32:27.080 --> 32:28.080
Yeah.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.080
I'm going to own up to it.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.080
Yes.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.080
Good for you.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.080
Three people applauding me.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.080
Everyone else, gay bad.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.080
10% gay bashing.

32:36.080 --> 32:41.080
But I only call the Bangkok experience because we all go there.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.080
If you ask, that is almost accepted over there.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.080
So I count that.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.080
It's like a 4%.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.080
Now, did you go out in search of a lady boy experience

32:51.080 --> 32:54.080
or did the lady boy find you by accident?

32:54.080 --> 32:56.080
Well, you go, you hang out.

32:56.080 --> 33:01.080
I was over there working on a project and you hang out and you go.

33:01.080 --> 33:05.080
It's a very, you know, it's just, it's a nice culture.

33:05.080 --> 33:11.080
They're very outgoing, massage and haircut late at night, all that stuff.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.080
Like, it's a good vibe.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
So you go to these clubs.

33:15.080 --> 33:19.080
I could go for a late night haircut.

33:19.080 --> 33:23.080
And then a hand job from a guy named Kim.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.080
No.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.080
Oh, it's funny.

33:25.080 --> 33:29.080
You know, funny you should, I'll tell you about that off camera.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.080
I should say Kim, but I'll get back to that.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.080
Why is that?

33:32.080 --> 33:37.080
Well, I, it's a code word for something that I know.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.080
I'll tell you off camera.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.080
Off mic.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.080
Look, if you're coming onto me, just fucking get it out.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.080
No, I'm not, I know I'm not gay like that.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.080
See, see, it's not that way.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.080
They're talking about, do I see a guy like whoever you're talking about,

33:50.080 --> 33:53.080
like, oh, he's got great legs and great chest.

33:53.080 --> 33:58.080
And I want to, I want to kiss his, his thick, his beard.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.080
No, I'm not into that.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.080
All right.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.080
So that's not what a lady boy is.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.080
Thank you.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.080
Because they take hormones.

34:06.080 --> 34:11.080
Now, so I went over there to see.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.080
All right.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.080
And I, and I, I walk around, I see my mannerisms.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.080
You know, I got picked on a lot because I was a nice guy,

34:17.080 --> 34:20.080
like I'm a happy guy and kids are cruel.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.080
And I grew up here in the valley, a Jewish kid.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.080
I should have been sheltered by the Hebrew school.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.080
You sound like you're from Chicago.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.080
How'd you get that?

34:27.080 --> 34:29.080
Well, I was in Toronto over the weekend.

34:29.080 --> 34:32.080
I think that Chicago, I think the Chicago jet stream.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.080
You don't, you don't sound like you were raised in California.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.080
I know.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.080
I've heard that a lot.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.080
I grew up in the valley.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.080
I think as I'm kind of nasally, I always would get New York.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.080
New York City.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.080
I lived in Brooklyn for three years.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.080
Williamsburg, L train before it got hip.

34:45.080 --> 34:49.080
I was there three years in Seattle.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
Okay.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.080
Sorry, Jeff.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.080
So you're fucking this lady boy.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.080
I'm the one, you know what?

34:55.080 --> 34:59.080
I'll tell you what, if I did that, that ain't so bad.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
That ain't so bad.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.080
I watched locked up raw.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.080
It ain't that bad.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.080
Nobody in Harmontown is going to judge you.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.080
Yeah.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.080
Well, I feel like first three.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.080
Those are what?

35:09.080 --> 35:10.080
No, no, no.

35:10.080 --> 35:14.080
But you know hard that it, I mean, it, it's, I'm okay with it.

35:14.080 --> 35:18.080
And then I'll tell you what, I came back to the mainland.

35:18.080 --> 35:24.080
And I went a little further just to see, just to see that line

35:24.080 --> 35:26.080
and maybe go over it.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.080
What, what, what did that entail?

35:28.080 --> 35:32.080
Uh, there was a hotel in Hollywood and, um, free shout.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.080
Doesn't it people?

35:33.080 --> 35:34.080
No.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.080
Free shout.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.080
Brody, nobody.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.080
This is why people stay in the closet.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.080
Brody.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.080
I'm only, I'm 10% gay.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.080
Brody.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.080
It's scary.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.080
Brody, you're, you're, you're 50% gay.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.080
No, I'm not, Jeff.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
How dare you?

35:46.080 --> 35:47.080
Brody.

35:47.080 --> 35:52.080
These, this audience is so, it's so, it's so accustomed to hearing so much worse and

35:52.080 --> 35:53.080
so much more bizarre.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.080
Well, thank you.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.080
Well, you know, I'm, I played baseball.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.080
I just feel like it's going to come back.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.080
It's okay to be gay.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
It's okay to be gay, Brody.

35:59.080 --> 36:03.080
I'm, I'm saying it's okay, but I'm, I told you, I'm not into hand holding.

36:03.080 --> 36:11.080
I, uh, I am into, I'm into human love.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.080
That's good.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.080
So what happened to the hotel?

36:14.080 --> 36:22.080
You know, well, Kim, excuse me, um, Kim, AK, I can't give the name away, but you know

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
what?

36:23.080 --> 36:27.080
I'll tell you what, the TS community, I'm, I'm very active in the TS community.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
What's TS?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
Transsexual.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.080
Oh.

36:30.080 --> 36:34.080
And, um, when you say act, when you say active in the community, what do you mean?

36:34.080 --> 36:39.880
I just like, I just like saying that, um, because you know what, it's very popular.

36:39.880 --> 36:45.520
If you were to go, uh, back in the day, my friends ran, uh, taboo video up in Seattle,

36:45.520 --> 36:49.760
which was the number one, uh, grossing adult video store in Seattle.

36:49.760 --> 36:55.440
Just right before DVDs started coming out and the number one, and probably to this day,

36:55.440 --> 36:59.920
if you ask the guys, you still make it the number one, it's, it's, it's TS stuff.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.280
That's the number one thing for whatever reason.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.480
Does that mean like chicks with dicks?

37:04.480 --> 37:05.480
Is that?

37:05.480 --> 37:06.480
Yeah.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.760
That's what it is because you see a, you see a breast and you're into that and you're

37:09.760 --> 37:12.520
into this face and the hair, they look good.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.800
They're, they're like, there's no problems.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.040
And then you go, isn't it girl?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.040
I don't know.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.040
I'm in Bangkok.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.280
It's something got shaved down.

37:21.280 --> 37:27.840
Uh, is this, you got to like, it's the sixties all over again, just, and you got, it's rock

37:27.840 --> 37:28.840
and roll.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
I'm a comedian.

37:29.840 --> 37:35.280
I felt like I had to kind of do that to share that story with you as a, as a guy who wants

37:35.280 --> 37:37.040
to move on and don't.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.040
Don't bring us into it.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.040
It was.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.040
Oh yeah.

37:40.040 --> 37:46.040
I mean, I, no, it's like, you, you're, you're following some sort of, uh, like trail.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.840
Like you're, you're certainly going down some sort of road.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.720
I think that as you age and as you, like, as you progress, like your fetishes do kind

37:51.720 --> 37:56.200
of start meandering towards like, like more specific things, like, wouldn't you say?

37:56.200 --> 37:57.200
Yeah.

37:57.200 --> 38:02.600
I mean, but today I was in Starbucks and I was sitting there and I, I mean, I saw a girl

38:02.600 --> 38:08.400
like with a nice, uh, butt and I just wanted to put my face in it and I confirmed to me

38:08.400 --> 38:09.400
right there.

38:09.400 --> 38:13.480
I'm not who, what gay guy wants to put his face in a girl's butt.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.480
I did.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
That just confirmed him.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.480
There's my 90%.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.400
We didn't say that you were gay.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.400
I am 10%.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
I will stick with that.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
I'm going to put it at 48.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.400
Are you?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
I mean, 48.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.400
48.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.400
Is this a new segment?

38:25.400 --> 38:29.360
It's like, like, like guessing someone's weight, like you're going to, are you going

38:29.360 --> 38:34.600
to work in a carnival and just dance with dance only at 22?

38:34.600 --> 38:35.600
Okay.

38:35.600 --> 38:41.040
I mean, the percentage thing is, is it raises interesting questions because how do you go

38:41.040 --> 38:45.800
because like it all has to do with the amount of repression in the, in the society that

38:45.800 --> 38:47.200
you're in the context of?

38:47.200 --> 38:55.320
Because if you're in a society that for instance views sexual preference as a binary dichotomy,

38:55.320 --> 39:01.120
then that puts a lot of significance on whether, and the difference between 49 and 50%.

39:01.120 --> 39:05.240
Because that, I, I, I'm assuming just being sort of a computer programmer of old.

39:05.240 --> 39:09.240
Like, like, like, like there's a, but, but if you're living in a genuinely, if you're

39:09.240 --> 39:12.560
living in an open field after some kind of nuclear holocaust and everyone's just running

39:12.560 --> 39:18.200
around in deerskin togas and, and using bottle caps for money and, and there's no more, like,

39:18.200 --> 39:22.280
like, you know, there's no more magazine covers or search billboards to, to kind of drive

39:22.280 --> 39:26.480
home anything, then, then the difference between 20% and 30% is what?

39:26.480 --> 39:27.960
I mean, we don't even, yeah.

39:27.960 --> 39:28.960
I will definitely agree.

39:28.960 --> 39:33.200
Like what in the world would be, what would be the meaning of 100% heterosexual?

39:33.200 --> 39:37.800
I think so, whatever that would manifest itself as would certainly appear, I would, I would

39:37.800 --> 39:41.000
imagine to be less straight than what we consider straight.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.600
I mean, we don't, we don't want, nobody likes anybody that's, that's overtly masculine

39:45.600 --> 39:47.880
or we don't like people that are overtly feminine.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.800
We don't like a, she's like, she's being such a, like a girl right now or a guy who's

39:51.800 --> 39:52.800
being such a guy.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.800
I'm a damn fucking dude, chicken wings, fuck, yeah, like, we don't like that and we don't

39:57.800 --> 40:01.320
like, oh my God, go to the mall, shopping, we don't, we don't like that either.

40:01.320 --> 40:06.880
And so we also, we don't like, I mean, I won't say we, I'll say I, like, when you meet a

40:06.880 --> 40:12.200
gay, when you meet a gay guy, let's say, and he's really queenie, that wears you out pretty

40:12.200 --> 40:13.200
quickly.

40:13.200 --> 40:17.800
It's like, enough with the femininity thing, like, like, temper that a little bit, like,

40:17.800 --> 40:22.320
the more towards the middle you get, the more complete of a person you become, we, we don't

40:22.320 --> 40:30.320
want to see a really butch lesbian, like, how about be a woman too, while you're being

40:30.320 --> 40:35.000
a man, like, like, a little bit, like, lean towards the middle, and I would say towards

40:35.000 --> 40:39.240
all things, like, like, see both sides of everything and, like, and, and, and, and, like,

40:39.240 --> 40:43.680
kind of combine the beauty that is masculinity and the beauty that is femininity.

40:43.680 --> 40:47.680
Well, that's what I'm saying, look at the, if you, so, I, I think nature goes in bell

40:47.680 --> 40:48.680
curves.

40:48.680 --> 40:52.440
Like, I, I, I think that's a, I mean, that's probably pinning things in too much too, but

40:52.440 --> 40:57.960
that's an easier way to understand things, that, that, uh, if you, if a frog lays a thousand

40:57.960 --> 41:03.080
eggs, then you're gonna look at, like, there's a, there's a, there's a bulge in the center

41:03.080 --> 41:08.800
of the survival eggs, you know, and then there's fringe eggs that don't survive for one reason

41:08.800 --> 41:11.160
and fringe eggs that don't survive for another reason.

41:11.160 --> 41:16.160
They're every, everything goes in a bell, a bell curve, so, so, I, I, I accuse, there's

41:16.160 --> 41:21.520
a bunch, there's not a lot of incredibly stupid people, there's a bunch of people in the middle

41:21.520 --> 41:25.680
that are running everything, and, uh, and then there's not a lot of incredibly smart

41:25.680 --> 41:32.880
people who are, you know, all here tonight, uh, uh, but sexually, so sexually, give yourself

41:32.880 --> 41:33.880
a round of applause for being very smart.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.880
If you think of sexuality as a bell curve, then I would assume, like, I think what you're

41:37.880 --> 41:43.040
saying to, that, that, that a hundred percent straight means actually some kind of weird

41:43.040 --> 41:47.280
inside-out, weird thing where you're so straight, you're not even human, because, because the

41:47.280 --> 41:51.840
bell curve would probably be, well, if I put my penis through a hole and I don't know what's

41:51.840 --> 41:57.560
sucking it, and then later I find out it was my friend Kevin, uh, uh, in other words,

41:57.560 --> 41:58.560
two percent.

41:58.560 --> 42:04.120
I mean, I, I, I, I imagine that those of us in the middle are people whose sexuality

42:04.120 --> 42:09.400
doesn't define us so much that it prevents us from doing other things, the same way that

42:09.400 --> 42:15.360
a, uh, incredibly sober person whose sobriety defines every conversation they have is just

42:15.360 --> 42:18.840
as annoying as a fall-down drunk, who you can't, you can't trust to.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.480
Yeah, and, and there's nothing more, uh, fascist than a hippie, like, like, like a really hardcore

42:22.480 --> 42:26.720
hippie can be the most fascistic, most dogmatic asshole that you'll ever talk to.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
Yeah.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.560
Like, temper it a little bit, like, like, see both sides of it.

42:30.560 --> 42:34.320
It's hilarious, like, in NASCAR, uh, once in a while for breast cancer awareness, they'll

42:34.320 --> 42:37.680
paint one car pink, and there's people that are really bummed out about it.

42:37.680 --> 42:43.320
That's like, oh, pink car, God, dude, like, like, I'm not a man anymore, I'm like, I can't

42:43.320 --> 42:49.400
look at a pink car going a circle, like, I'm like, hey, hey, um, if, if you could like

42:49.400 --> 42:52.600
the color pink a little more, you'd fuck your wife a little better and fucking take it

42:52.600 --> 42:53.600
easy.

42:53.600 --> 42:58.600
Yeah, I were polarized gray bands.

42:58.600 --> 43:04.120
Every white car is pink.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.600
You're back down to 10% again.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.360
There you go, back down.

43:07.360 --> 43:11.360
Are you sure you didn't wash your white car with a pink bicycle?

43:11.360 --> 43:13.520
A red, oh, she had a red bicycle.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.560
God damn it, I fucked up.

43:15.560 --> 43:26.160
You guys are talking about, uh, feet, no, the language, I'm with you on that, on language,

43:26.160 --> 43:28.280
I want to go on a whole thing on that.

43:28.280 --> 43:33.360
I mean, Jeff goes on these tears, like, uh, he's a real HL Mankin, like, like, really

43:33.360 --> 43:37.280
thinks that everyone should be, you know, going about talking like a steampunk person,

43:37.280 --> 43:39.800
otherwise that means that we're regressing.

43:39.800 --> 43:43.800
We should use our, the English language is one of the most expansive vocabularies of

43:43.800 --> 43:44.800
all time.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.360
One of the biggest vocabularies I've ever made, and we don't fucking use it.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.280
I'd like to use it more, huh?

43:50.280 --> 43:57.440
I'd like to use it more, yeah, absolutely, but, but, but I will, I, so, so I think where

43:57.440 --> 44:03.560
I agree with Jeff is that, is that there's a danger in, uh, in, in getting trained by

44:03.560 --> 44:10.840
media and, uh, in each other that everything is either awesome or lame, because if there's

44:10.840 --> 44:15.120
no more words for different kinds of awesome, like, like, yeah, you're getting trained to

44:15.120 --> 44:18.880
choose between Pepsi and Coke, you know, they're fooling you into not realizing that there's

44:18.880 --> 44:20.960
a difference between corn syrup and water.

44:20.960 --> 44:27.440
So linguistically, we need to think outside the box, but that is exactly why I bristle

44:27.440 --> 44:33.240
and freak out, get very uncomfortable when people campaign and parade and things in celebration

44:33.240 --> 44:36.600
of just scrubbing out those couple little words.

44:36.600 --> 44:41.320
Yeah, because it's like, it doesn't, it's, you don't even see where that stops.

44:41.320 --> 44:46.280
You just, you think that you, you, when you, when you don't make up words for a living,

44:46.280 --> 44:51.280
like, maybe it's harder to see how you can't just point at something across on the other

44:51.280 --> 44:53.560
side of the room and go, I want that potted plant out of here.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.280
Now the apartment's going to be perfect.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.480
It, it, you know, it's, it, that's not how it works.

44:58.480 --> 45:03.880
Like you're, you're free or you're not, you, you, you come out of the womb with the freedom

45:03.880 --> 45:04.880
of speech.

45:04.880 --> 45:10.240
The constitution gets drafted up by some lawyers and says, you have freedom of speech.

45:10.240 --> 45:14.160
Next thing that happens is, unless you say fire in a crowded theater, next thing that

45:14.160 --> 45:18.160
happens is unless you say this thing and that thing, we can all agree that this would be

45:18.160 --> 45:19.160
a terrible thing to say.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.160
Yes.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.160
Okay.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.160
All in favor of eliminating it.

45:22.160 --> 45:25.640
I, I, I, this, this, this, we, we, whatever, man.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.320
This is why, what a boring conversation.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.320
It's not boring.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.320
I'm right there with you.

45:29.320 --> 45:30.480
But it's, it's, it's the same thing.

45:30.480 --> 45:33.720
We're talking about the, a binary idea that there's, that there's goodness bad, there's

45:33.720 --> 45:35.600
Pepsi, there's coke, there's straight or there's gay.

45:35.600 --> 45:38.600
I don't like non-lateral thinking, but, but here's the thing.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.600
Yeah.

45:39.600 --> 45:43.440
I don't, I also don't like people that aren't verbal thinkers necessarily who think that

45:43.440 --> 45:48.840
they shouldn't speak because they don't have the same kind of word power.

45:48.840 --> 45:52.040
You know, I don't like those people feeling censored by smart people.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.080
I don't, I don't, I don't like people being bullied because they don't know how to use

45:55.080 --> 45:56.080
an apostrophe.

45:56.080 --> 46:01.880
I don't like, I don't, I don't, I don't think that someone who speaks great truths is necessarily

46:01.880 --> 46:03.920
going to be the most articulate person in the world.

46:03.920 --> 46:10.240
I think that the use of seven words, if there's only seven, can, there's, we can still create

46:10.240 --> 46:13.920
a revolution and, and, and, you know, like you, we could, someone can use those seven

46:13.920 --> 46:17.040
words in an order that's going to make everybody flip over.

46:17.040 --> 46:20.640
There's a way to speak wrong so well that you're, that you're amazing.

46:20.640 --> 46:25.680
Like Yogi Berra, like, like if you go online and look, look, look, look up Yogi Berra quotes.

46:25.680 --> 46:30.120
He malaproped all the time and malapropism is a Shakespeare character, malaprop.

46:30.120 --> 46:35.440
And he constantly said things wrong and it was using the language perfectly and you can't

46:35.440 --> 46:36.440
tell at some point.

46:36.440 --> 46:39.400
Did he, did he say it wrong on purpose or by accident?

46:39.400 --> 46:43.160
But because he said something really, really funny, really, really, really good.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.920
I was going to tie this in.

46:44.920 --> 46:49.760
I, I played baseball at Arizona State, number one, played there, starred at.

46:49.760 --> 46:50.760
What position?

46:50.760 --> 46:51.760
I was a pitcher.

46:51.760 --> 46:52.760
I, I, I could see you as a pitcher.

46:52.760 --> 46:53.760
Thank you.

46:53.760 --> 46:54.760
Thank you.

46:54.760 --> 46:55.760
Nine girls.

46:55.760 --> 46:56.760
I think you're 10% catcher.

46:56.760 --> 46:57.760
Okay.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.760
All right.

46:58.760 --> 46:59.760
All right.

46:59.760 --> 47:00.760
Come on.

47:00.760 --> 47:01.760
Come on.

47:01.760 --> 47:09.040
We, we, we might have the name of our episode.

47:09.040 --> 47:13.680
Are we all 10% catcher at some point?

47:13.680 --> 47:17.360
So I play.

47:17.360 --> 47:23.840
So I think some of that comes from being in that jock world, not being in that, uh, the

47:23.840 --> 47:25.040
artist world.

47:25.040 --> 47:34.960
I, I definitely have those jock energy and experiences and also my pre comedy experiences

47:34.960 --> 47:40.560
to, you know, that really kind of like, I carry with me and not necessarily in a good

47:40.560 --> 47:41.560
way.

47:41.560 --> 47:46.160
And then sometimes I'll see myself on, like I'm working on a project also and I can go

47:46.160 --> 47:50.560
into like how we argue over words and argue over comedy.

47:50.560 --> 47:54.080
And then I think like, who are you, where's your, where's your, you know, I don't want

47:54.080 --> 47:59.760
to go into like specifics here, but yeah, there's kind of debates and I feel like I don't, I

47:59.760 --> 48:00.760
don't get that freedom.

48:00.760 --> 48:06.200
That's one reason why I do podcasts because I get that freedom to talk and maybe it's

48:06.200 --> 48:09.640
because I'm Jewish or I'm neurotic or there's heart disease in my family.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.240
I got to get it out.

48:11.240 --> 48:16.680
And when I don't, and it really is hard when it's your living or your own production and

48:16.680 --> 48:25.120
it's your own, you know, introduction to America and it's truly not you getting to do that.

48:25.120 --> 48:29.960
So I'm dealing with that and I think it's all a combination and a hybrid of everything.

48:29.960 --> 48:33.840
You know, hopefully when I come out on the other side, I'll grow from it, but

48:33.840 --> 48:36.800
Yeah, I don't know you very well, but like from what little I know, like, and just from

48:36.800 --> 48:40.920
hearing it tonight, like you are, you're revealing stuff about yourself, but also you're hard

48:40.920 --> 48:41.920
on yourself about it.

48:41.920 --> 48:42.920
Yeah, a little bit.

48:42.920 --> 48:46.080
So like it's almost like you're like, and not to overstate it, like it's almost like

48:46.080 --> 48:48.920
you're kind of gay bashing yourself about a gay experience.

48:48.920 --> 48:52.760
Like you're, you're, you're, you're saying, Hey, I did this thing and I'm not proud of

48:52.760 --> 48:53.760
it.

48:53.760 --> 48:54.760
I don't know.

48:54.760 --> 48:57.840
But you're, you're well, I mean, growing up, I was called a gay boy.

48:57.840 --> 48:58.840
You're Siri.

48:58.840 --> 49:04.160
I was a nice guy, a nice kid, you know, now being nice, I think in Hollywood or whatever

49:04.160 --> 49:09.280
we call this has helped me because people want nice people around, you know, and hustling

49:09.280 --> 49:12.400
and hard work, which I got, you know, helped me in baseball.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.520
But I think growing up, maybe in the valley at the time, going to public, going to public

49:16.520 --> 49:20.520
schools, getting bused out to South Central, maybe it made me tougher.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.520
I don't know.

49:21.520 --> 49:26.320
And then playing baseball with like the necessarily a little bit of hazing and bullying.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.960
It was kind of, yeah, like stuck with me.

49:28.960 --> 49:32.920
And then when I started doing comedy, like, uh, opened up a lot, but now when I see myself

49:32.920 --> 49:37.520
on TV, sometimes I can, I kind of see like, I would pick on myself.

49:37.520 --> 49:38.520
Yeah.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.520
And I don't know what that is.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.520
I don't know where that comes from.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.560
You know, you're on, you're on self loathing.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.560
Yeah.

49:43.560 --> 49:46.360
Well, it's probably something that, that we, we don't all see that it's something that

49:46.360 --> 49:52.200
you train yourself to, but I've learned as I've learned, you know, especially lately,

49:52.200 --> 49:56.680
like turn it into comedy, turn it into something uses a positive and I get a lot of support

49:56.680 --> 49:57.680
from people.

49:57.680 --> 50:01.160
Again, I'm older and, you know, Twitter and the internet and all that stuff.

50:01.160 --> 50:05.440
Like it has helped me and doing the podcast is just like, there's a things like you seem

50:05.440 --> 50:10.080
like, you seem like a very soft, like emotionally very soft guy, but you exude a very like

50:10.080 --> 50:15.440
your voice, your posture is very like loud and like, like you seem very sportsy and

50:15.440 --> 50:19.840
very like, like macho and gruff, but like you, you can still like, you can't totally

50:19.840 --> 50:24.440
hide the fact that there's a softness to you, which is not gay.

50:24.440 --> 50:28.880
It's just, it's just being soft and all, you know, but that's a negative, that's kind

50:28.880 --> 50:30.440
of a negative term in sports.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.600
If you're labeled as soft, you know what I mean?

50:32.600 --> 50:33.600
We're not playing sports.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.600
We're not playing sports.

50:34.600 --> 50:35.600
So I'm okay with that.

50:35.600 --> 50:40.600
I am getting, I am getting used to that.

50:40.600 --> 50:44.160
It's just some, maybe it's some of those jock sensibilities in me and the fact that I'm

50:44.160 --> 50:46.160
still around that world a little bit.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.360
I'm around Major League Baseball.

50:48.360 --> 50:51.520
You certainly take taking a major step by talking about your lady boy experience.

50:51.520 --> 50:52.520
Silence.

50:52.520 --> 50:55.640
Well, you know, it is, I'm getting it out there and it's also just other things talking

50:55.640 --> 51:01.040
about it, owning it and, you know, again, not being hard on myself and then, you know,

51:01.040 --> 51:03.520
be, I don't want to, you just keep doing it.

51:03.520 --> 51:07.960
And I think you just work through it and the fans and it's like, I don't need therapy

51:07.960 --> 51:10.600
to be honest with you for me.

51:10.600 --> 51:11.600
And I do speak loud.

51:11.600 --> 51:15.840
I mean, I am, and that's one thing I do kind of like, I do the sensitivity because I am

51:15.840 --> 51:19.240
a nice guy and I'll put it out and it's like, well, you're being loud.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.240
You're this.

51:20.240 --> 51:25.240
And it's like, professionally, I have learned like how to do warmup and I start off nice.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.840
Okay, we're going to do this.

51:28.840 --> 51:29.840
And then I crank it.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.840
You know, I work at the midnight show with Chris Hardwick kind of thing and go in nice

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
and nice.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.840
We don't want you to be quiet.

51:34.840 --> 51:35.840
We want, we want you to be loud.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.840
You want it?

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
Yeah.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.840
Because there's a little audience and that's the, that's the, what I think about is like,

51:39.840 --> 51:41.280
all right, I'm doing a podcast.

51:41.280 --> 51:45.640
I've had some experiences when I've done video podcasts and like, I've played completely

51:45.640 --> 51:50.480
to the camera and then people in the podcast feel like, oh, it's too much and I'm doing

51:50.480 --> 51:51.480
a live show.

51:51.480 --> 51:54.760
I can play to the audience and I feel like maybe the podcast, a lot of things going on.

51:54.760 --> 51:55.760
But you know what?

51:55.760 --> 52:01.840
I'm comfortable here with Dan, Jeff, Dustin and the, what's the fear, what's the fear,

52:01.840 --> 52:09.400
I'm sorry to cut you off, like, what would be the big, we're talking about this, I think

52:09.400 --> 52:14.560
last time about the way we're perceived or a couple of shows ago about, we all exude

52:14.560 --> 52:20.840
something that we're not in control of, like Dan wants to be perceived as smart and also

52:20.840 --> 52:26.200
people come to him and want, they want Dan to say that he's smart, like what do you want

52:26.200 --> 52:29.720
people to see you as, or what are you afraid that people see in you that you wish they

52:29.720 --> 52:34.600
didn't see?

52:34.600 --> 52:36.600
Weird?

52:36.600 --> 52:37.600
Weird how?

52:37.600 --> 52:41.640
Just weird thinking about stuff that doesn't matter, you know, like, I mean, that's a whole

52:41.640 --> 52:42.640
another thing.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.640
I was asking.

52:43.640 --> 52:44.640
What's the fear of being perceived as weird?

52:44.640 --> 52:49.600
I don't want to be, it's like a Pandora's box, it's like you talk about it, you bring

52:49.600 --> 52:53.560
attention to it, it's like, you know, things that we notice, I'm sure, you know, you're

52:53.560 --> 52:57.680
an actor, you see yourself on TV, like some people can't watch themselves, Johnny Depp

52:57.680 --> 53:03.320
doesn't watch his movies, Jared Leto freaked out, you know, I know that's there, you know,

53:03.320 --> 53:06.960
that's normal, but it feels like it affects me a little bit more.

53:06.960 --> 53:10.120
But you're doing a Comedy Central show now, right?

53:10.120 --> 53:11.120
Are you?

53:11.120 --> 53:13.640
Yeah, I'm doing that and some of that has seen myself on that.

53:13.640 --> 53:20.560
My fear, like that's all I was thinking about, like my fear regarding that would be one weird,

53:20.560 --> 53:21.560
so that's kind of.

53:21.560 --> 53:22.640
You don't want people to think you're weird.

53:22.640 --> 53:26.960
I don't mind it, but I don't want it to be a Pandora's box of weirdness, if we could

53:26.960 --> 53:27.960
turn into a joke.

53:27.960 --> 53:31.080
You mean they're going to find out you're weird in what way, like what's the, what's

53:31.080 --> 53:32.080
the.

53:32.080 --> 53:36.760
Ah, like obsessive about my eyebrows, weird about my hairline, my mannerisms, do I think

53:36.760 --> 53:40.480
I'm gay, why do you even think you're, you know, that kind of stuff, okay.

53:40.480 --> 53:43.400
And if you revealed all that, if you took off your hat and showed us your hair on your

53:43.400 --> 53:44.400
eyebrows.

53:44.400 --> 53:48.200
I'll do that, I'm in bold, I'm bold, it doesn't bother me, but I just felt cooler doing this

53:48.200 --> 53:49.200
today.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.200
Yeah.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.200
And I was in Toronto.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.200
But it's off?

53:52.200 --> 53:53.200
It's off?

53:53.200 --> 53:58.040
I'm hiding behind some stuff, the glasses kind of.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.760
Oh, believe me, I hide behind a suit, I hide behind a weird hairdo all the time, like I

54:01.760 --> 54:02.760
braid hair.

54:02.760 --> 54:03.760
Well, thank you.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.760
But like, it's all, it's all an act.

54:04.760 --> 54:05.760
It's all affectation.

54:05.760 --> 54:10.560
I hide behind my Aunt Rachel's beautiful pantyhose clad legs.

54:10.560 --> 54:18.480
I just play with my matchbox cars, rolling them gently up and down our calves.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.640
Is that where it comes from?

54:20.640 --> 54:23.920
I feel like, I feel like researching that stuff that, did she have red hair?

54:23.920 --> 54:25.360
I said, Oh, I don't know.

54:25.360 --> 54:28.960
I had an aunt that had red hair that married into the family, but I know I was in the red

54:28.960 --> 54:31.280
head since Nicole McHugh and kindergarten.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.800
Who's Nicole McHugh?

54:33.800 --> 54:35.800
Who wasn't she?

54:35.800 --> 54:42.960
Nicole McHugh was the first girl that I ever felt hormones generated in my body about like,

54:42.960 --> 54:49.200
I was kindergarten and the teachers would call your name and then she, every time the teacher

54:49.200 --> 54:56.400
would call my name, she'd say Daniel Harmon, Nicole McHugh would go, and then every time

54:56.400 --> 55:05.280
she'd say Nicole McHugh, I'd go, and we never spoke to each other, but she was my first

55:05.280 --> 55:06.280
lover.

55:06.280 --> 55:09.840
Well, that's one of the most beautiful relationships I've ever heard of.

55:09.840 --> 55:15.920
And she had copper red curly hair and, yeah, but so did Batgirl, so I don't know where it

55:15.920 --> 55:22.080
came from, you know, because Batgirl was like a huge, like a cork got popped there sexually.

55:22.080 --> 55:27.760
I would get so excited, the opening credits of Batman, my brother would be like, you know,

55:27.760 --> 55:31.680
my brother loved Batman and we would play Batman together, like, you know, we'd put

55:31.680 --> 55:36.800
ski caps and stuff on the, on the banister to the basement and pretend it was the Bat

55:36.800 --> 55:40.440
pole and like get dressed up as Bat, you know, like, like get to the bottom of the stairs

55:40.440 --> 55:43.880
and go, I heard the Joker's broken out, let's go get him.

55:43.880 --> 55:48.080
And then we'd watch Batman together and then like, there was a title card in the Batman

55:48.080 --> 55:53.200
title sequence, because I now, now being a producer, I guess I know that like, it must

55:53.200 --> 55:57.560
have meant that Von Craig was probably six of 13 or something like, like she was recurring

55:57.560 --> 55:58.880
but not regular.

55:58.880 --> 56:03.920
And so there was an opening title card that was either there or not there.

56:03.920 --> 56:07.160
And it wasn't a picture of Batgirl, but it was always there when she was going to be

56:07.160 --> 56:08.640
in the episode, I would say.

56:08.640 --> 56:14.520
And so it's always Batgirl and I would, I would, my body would just twitch, even though

56:14.520 --> 56:18.520
I was absolutely years and years away from generating any kind of fluid that would have

56:18.520 --> 56:20.400
anything to do with that.

56:20.400 --> 56:26.000
I was just like transfixed and I was so excited that Batgirl was going to be involved and that

56:26.000 --> 56:31.720
she would be flying around, whipping her red wig around and kicking people and very often

56:31.720 --> 56:37.280
getting like Batman, there was a lot of like, a lot of nylon or spandex or whatever and a

56:37.280 --> 56:42.040
lot of like, bondage, a lot of like, which I'm not, I'm not a bondage guy, like, but

56:42.040 --> 56:47.600
a lot of like, when I was a kid, like, it was a lot of like, like, I remember being

56:47.600 --> 56:54.160
a kid of like, squeezing myself in between like, couch cushions and getting really excited

56:54.160 --> 56:58.040
and thinking about Batgirl.

56:58.040 --> 57:02.000
And then I saw Temple Grandin and she had the squeeze machine and I was wondering, was

57:02.000 --> 57:07.640
it a sexual thing or was it like, I don't know, like, like, I used to like, get rolled

57:07.640 --> 57:10.640
up like a sausage in a blanket and I couldn't move.

57:10.640 --> 57:14.400
Do you think your sexuality is a moving target or do you think that you're slowly honing

57:14.400 --> 57:16.840
in on a fixed target that's always been there?

57:16.840 --> 57:21.440
Do you think it changes as you grow or do you think it's something that you've, it's

57:21.440 --> 57:24.440
always been there, that you're just now getting better at finding?

57:24.440 --> 57:26.880
No, I don't think I'm good at finding it.

57:26.880 --> 57:31.680
I have fetishes and I think it are almost, as the name would suggest, they're almost

57:31.680 --> 57:34.240
removed from proper sexuality.

57:34.240 --> 57:42.080
I think that, I think that I fetishize things and then it's like, it removes me from sex.

57:42.080 --> 57:50.800
Like my fetish for women's legs clad in a material that essentially removes the chaos

57:50.800 --> 57:51.800
from them.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.280
It turns them more into cartoons.

57:54.280 --> 57:59.000
You know, it's all about removal and like, like fully clothed women just hanging out

57:59.000 --> 58:05.280
and like, I'm just sitting there going, and I gratify myself and then I'm done.

58:05.280 --> 58:12.440
You know, I did my little penis sneeze and I go, it's not, it's not romantic, it's not

58:12.440 --> 58:13.440
sexual.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.440
Stop having penis sneezes.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.440
And then when you fall, you fall in love with a woman, you know, and then you welcome her

58:17.440 --> 58:21.600
into your life and you like, like, like then the, during the courtship phase, like, there's

58:21.600 --> 58:26.960
none of that going on because you love this person other than your sex life is involved

58:26.960 --> 58:30.960
with theirs and the courting of them and stuff.

58:30.960 --> 58:35.280
And then I go back to work and then all of a sudden I'm like, gollum again, like, regarding

58:35.280 --> 58:43.120
this, you know, I'm just using like this fetish object to like, get through the day.

58:43.120 --> 58:47.120
So to answer your question, I don't, I don't, I don't, I haven't been honing in on anything.

58:47.120 --> 58:53.440
I think there's always been like this sort of childish asexual impulse that's like unhealthy.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.800
It's like an outcropping of sexuality.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.560
Maybe you just masturbate on your lunch break.

58:58.560 --> 59:00.800
That would, uh, I often do, my friend.

59:00.800 --> 59:01.800
There you go.

59:01.800 --> 59:04.840
I mean, I've done, I've done in some strange places.

59:04.840 --> 59:08.040
I do want to go back to this because you can see my little OCD working.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.760
I just want to have closure on this one thing, talking about the show.

59:10.760 --> 59:14.760
I don't want to think too weird, okay, too weird.

59:14.760 --> 59:19.280
That's the jock guy in me, but weird is okay.

59:19.280 --> 59:24.560
The gay stuff where it goes, I can't be involved in baseball, it's a very jock world.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.560
It's conservative.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.280
I've done a lot of stuff for baseball.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.280
It's in my heart.

59:28.280 --> 59:31.720
I would hate to be there and go, Oh, there's the guy who goes to Bangkok.

59:31.720 --> 59:32.720
We can't have, I don't know.

59:32.720 --> 59:35.120
I have some like nightmare, not a nightmare.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.480
It's just a weird thought.

59:36.480 --> 59:42.080
And the other thing is just like unfunny and not reflective of me.

59:42.080 --> 59:43.400
Those are my fears.

59:43.400 --> 59:44.400
Everything else I let go.

59:44.400 --> 59:50.880
Like I'll go on, I'll be on a necrol show or I'll do Chelsea lately or I'll do, uh,

59:50.880 --> 59:51.880
you know, a sky.

59:51.880 --> 59:52.880
It's like go ahead and do it.

59:52.880 --> 59:59.880
It's because my show is so, it's so personal and we talk about lady boy stuff.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.240
We talk about 10% gay stuff and it's kind of not in my hands.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.200
When I do it here or I do it on stage or at the comedy store or on a podcast, it's kind

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200
of funny.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.440
And I know I've gotten traction on it based on Twitter emails, but when you hand it over

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:21.400
to somebody else to do it and then you see what they do, it's like, uh, not your vision.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.720
And then you have to kind of give notes based on their vision.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.600
And then it's like, uh, not, it's like, it's like a C plus.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.600
You know what I mean?

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600
That's how I feel.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.280
Now I could be, you know, being too hard on myself again, thinking worst case scenario,

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
but that's how I am.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.680
And that's why I'm carrying this stress and I would probably guess that like what's funny

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:46.400
about you, what's like enjoyable, marketable, successful about you is the fact that we want

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.640
to watch you go through that struggle.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.440
We want to watch a guy that throws like a, like a wicked slider or a fucking curve ball

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.080
and a fast ball and a breaking ball and all this stuff and also goes to Bangkok and might

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.120
have an encounter with a lady boy.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.200
And also we don't want you to be like totally okay with that.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.200
We want you, we want to watch you have to come home to your kitchenette and say, okay,

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.480
look, here's what happened in Thailand.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480
All right.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.080
Now don't interrupt me.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.280
Some stuff went down and I don't want you to judge me before I finish.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.280
Okay.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280
Here's what happened.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280
Yeah.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280
It's almost like that.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.400
Like a rebuttal.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400
That's what I would say.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.360
Like just like a walking Brody or whatever they do after the shows.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360
I don't know.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.000
Like just give me 30 minutes.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.160
It'll be closure.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160
It's the little OCD.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:43.040
The protagonist that you are is the struggle, like not to be like a pedant, but like brothers

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.760
Karamazov, there's two brothers, one's really idealistic, one's really realistic.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.240
The middle brother, fuck, Dimitri, he is torn between those two things.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.120
It's the struggle between, here's what I think I am.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.120
Here's what I wish I were.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.320
Here's what I know I am.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Here's how I'm perceived.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320
Here's how I don't want to be perceived.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:06.960
We want to watch you fucking flip and flop like a fish out of water about being you,

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.680
being, what are you like, six, four?

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680
How tall are you?

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.680
Six, two.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680
Two hundred and eleven pounds.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.160
It doesn't take silly of Husky.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160
Exactly.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.160
Exactly.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.160
Look at that.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.360
There's that part of you that is so macho and then the other part, like keep struggling

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.560
for our benefit.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.720
I'm okay with that.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.160
It's talks like this, Jeff.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.880
It's like when I get that reassurance, like Brody, it's okay.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880
It's all right.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.360
Because sometimes production wise, I don't want to complain, I was, you know, I just need

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.000
a little bit of hand holding sometimes, especially with the subject matter, you're dealing with

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.320
the guy who is a little on the edge.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.080
So I went out on this tour, I was on this comedy tour, and it's like, sometimes I just

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:50.560
felt like it's hard to communicate on your own personal project via Vimeo and email.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.640
And I mean, at least I felt like, let's verbalize something.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640
So it's tough.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640
It's a struggle.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.320
I know that's how shows are done.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.880
Hopefully, I'll get another chance.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.240
I just don't want to have a heart attack.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.560
I don't want to have our heart attack, and I don't want my, you know, Molotov cocktails

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.200
to my, to my one.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.600
And one thing that we don't want out of you, we don't, we don't ever want you Brody Stevens

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.680
or anybody here in Harmontown, the one, the one thing that we all like agree on is we

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.520
don't, anyone to have to change themselves for anybody else.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.920
But we also want everybody to like become the best version of themselves.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.960
Just keep, keep being conflicted.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.960
Like that's, that's really beautiful.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
Really?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.960
Yeah.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.960
That's how you grow, right?

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960
Yeah.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960
All right.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.960
Good.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.960
I'll take that.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.840
Keep your fists in the air and keep being soft and hard at the same time.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.480
It's, you're, you're a coin spinning on its edge.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480
It's great.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480
Okay.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480
I like, I could take that.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.760
It's a good, it's a good metaphor.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760
I'll keep doing it.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.680
I'm learning to deal with that exercise, meditation, podcasting.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680
I'm going to get through that.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.680
Thank you.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.680
Brody Stevens, everybody.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680
All right.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.800
Listen to the Festival of Friends on Feral Friendship.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800
You got it.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800
Brody Stevens.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
Thanks, Steve.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800
Thanks, Jeff.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
Yeah.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:14.840
That's how good you, you dismissed Brody right at 9-Eleven.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:21.800
There's no such thing as accidents, man.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.680
Well, it's the, it's the, it's the second worst thing that ever happened to this country.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.080
Brody, Brody leaving the stage at 9-Eleven.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.960
Wait, should we, should we have kept them up?

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.200
Should we just stay here?

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.680
Should we, should we keep them out here?

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.640
No, no, I wanted to, because I offered him in the green room, it was like, well, your

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.000
options are you could come up later and then you can play D&D with us because Aaron's not

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
here tonight.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.760
But no, he wanted to actually, I think I brought him up too late and kept him here too long.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:58.800
But let's get Kumail out here because he has, Jesus, hello, stranger, yes, Kumail, Nanjiani.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.800
It's been a while, then it feels like it's been a long time.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.040
I miss you so much.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.320
I miss coming here a lot.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.720
I really get bummed out every Sunday.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.320
You're on stage every goddamn night of the week.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.840
Every time I look, I open up the Instagrams or the Facebooks, so you're doing something.

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.720
No, actually, I haven't been performing on stage that much.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.200
I really haven't.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.560
I was, last night I was in New York and I performed there, but I really haven't been.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.840
I haven't really been doing anything.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.200
So you have other friends you like better than us in New York, is that what's going

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200
on?

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200
Oh, no, I just had a show.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.000
No, I started shooting the HBO show, so I've had like 6 a.m. calls and stuff in one day,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.400
so I go to bed at 8 p.m.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.880
I'm like, my schedule's all fucked.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.680
But you've been working like a dog.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680
Yeah.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.600
You're all over the televisions.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.080
Trying to be, yeah.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080
I love it.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.080
I think the world needs a little more Kumail Nanjiani.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.080
Oh, thank you.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.080
Thank you.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.880
Thank you.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.120
What percent am I gay?

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.920
I'm 10% gay for you, I'll tell you that.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.400
I'm 100% gay for you.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.080
That makes you a regular person.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:17.920
All right, wait, before we focus on Kumail, I want to get Kumail's, I just, response

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.360
to this.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.800
I got this email, not because it involves you, but I just, I wanted you to be here for

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
this.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
Great.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.720
And Jeff in Harmontown.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:38.200
This is, you know, I'm 40 years old and I came out to Los Angeles and I wanted to maybe

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.880
write some TV and some movies and things.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.920
Maybe meet a nice girl, maybe get married, move into a big house, have a little golden

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920
doodle.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.480
I'm achieving a lot of my dreams, step by step, but there's one dream I didn't even

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480
know.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480
I don't know what this is about.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:07:00.680
I really had, until this email came in, God, I can't, I just, this is from Carl Nolay,

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:06.640
Jr., 11th generation distiller from the Nolay distillery.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:17.840
On behalf of Kettle One, this is already, already the best email you've ever gotten.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:28.680
We would like to invite you to become part of the Kettle One Alliance, an exclusive invite

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.120

I think you've had pretty much every Kettle One experience and opportunity that is to

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.040
be had.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:09.600
By the way, an all expense paid funeral.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.000
If you know what's crazy, you say the guy's name.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
His signature is on this fucking bottle.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's on the bow and word?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
All right.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Nolay.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:57.400
It's in the way that you use it.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:01.040
You're like in the Avengers of Booze.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040
Yeah.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.600
Yeah, that's Sam Jackson like yelling at me.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600
Exactly.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.000
You think you drink Kettle One motherfucker?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Yeah.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Exactly.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.440
Get ready to drink more for the planet.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.440
That segment brought to you by Fernet Broncker.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.120
Fernet Broncker, the king of Italian Amari.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120
All right.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.080
So, anyways, another thing.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.480
That's fucking, it's not surprising that it happened.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.720
It's surprising that it took this long.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.920
I think you should have gotten this email years ago.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920
Yeah.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.760
I think they go by liquid volume.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.080
I think they're like, holy shit, this guy has put us on the map.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080
Can I tell you?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.400
But not because he created community because he's had so much to drink.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:51.040
My manager had a client whose name will escape me for a moment, but she played a character

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.480
on Chicago Hope called Lisa Katerra.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:10:00.240
And my manager called up Cadillac and they have a car called the Cadillac Katerra.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.320
And she said, my client plays Lisa Katerra.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.240
Oh, so it's like subliminal marketing.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.680
Well, actually, I think the guy that wrote the show might have picked that name because

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680
of that.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680
Oh, it's like Jesus.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.080
They're also in a character called Bio Corvette.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.160
So she called up Cadillac and said, can you just give her a car?

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.920
I'm like, well, will she drive it in the show?

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.960
I can't guarantee that, but she'll talk about it on Leno and Conan and shit.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.040
And so she did and they gave her a goddamn car.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.200
And so I was in a show and I'm like, can I change my character's name to Porsche 911?

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200
Yeah.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.200
9-Eleven is not a good association.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.120
This was in 2000.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120
It was before.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120
This was before?

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120
Yes.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.440
My fascination with 9-Eleven predates all of the tragedy.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:54.640
Not to take away from that story, but just to express how exciting this is for me.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.560
It's fucking big news, man.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560
That's a story about.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.240
That's another story about, like, oh, we finagled the thing and we got free play stations

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.840
because it's a Sony show and I told them my habit was going to play a play station.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.440
This is you becoming the Highlander.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.320
They called me authentic.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.720
They came to me.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.280
They called me an inspiration.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.640
Do you think that was a 4M email or that was a handcrafted email?

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.440
I think that he sat, he was like, well, I've.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440
What's his name?

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.440
Carl Nole.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440
Yeah.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440
Carl Nole.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440
Carl Nole.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.040
He sat down and said pen to paper and he goes, dear Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040
Yeah.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040
And his family.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040
I'm a big fan of Harmontown.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.760
He's the 11th generation of the family that's been distilling this vodka.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.440
So you know his great-great-grandpa was writing to, like, Thomas Edison.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.440
We hear you.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.440
We don't know that.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440
We don't know that.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.520
You invented the cool shit.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Something like that.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
Yeah.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.920
You're the Thomas Edison of our day.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.320
So what's going to happen now?

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.920
Do we know what the outcome of this will be?

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920
He's going to be drinking more cattle wine.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.920
No, he won't.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.480
He'll be paying less.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Yeah.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480
He'll be drinking this wine.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.840
I mean, that's the cool thing, is that now that this has happened, the rest of life

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.360
is improv.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.640
Like I become a constellation.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.840
That's what happens.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:24.080
I join Ursa Major and Archimedes in the.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.080
Yeah.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.120
He's like, oh, you see that thing that looks like a Kettle One bottle?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.920
That's Dan Harmon.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920
Yeah.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.920
He drank himself into the cosmos.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.920
Is that what you've been trying to do?

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920
Yeah.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920
Yeah.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.840
Like, oh boy, that makes me happy.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.320
That is amazing.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320
That is.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.760
That's like if Popeye got a letter of recommendation from Spinach.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.840
We just want to let you know Popeye.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:01.000
It's like he'd be like, it's about time, you know, like, wait, so you, you're like

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.360
the Popeye of Vodka is what you're saying?

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.160
It's where I get my strength.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.160
Okay.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.200
I mean, my family has a relationship with.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.320
What is the, I'm imagining, because I've been to the writer's room at community up

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.600
in Paramount and there's always giant cost-coercised bottles of Kettle One there.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.920
Courtesy of my assistant Spencer.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.920
Oh, well, fuck it, let's bring him out on that.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.920
Spencer, everybody, come on out.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920
Spencer.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920
Yeah.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920
What's up?

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:46.280
I saw that in the mail before you did, Dan, about your club ownership or whatever.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.280
Alliance membership.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.280
Yeah.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280
Yeah.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.360
You don't seem stoked.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.840
I mean, I'm not getting any free vodka.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:57.840
Yeah, you are.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840
You're getting free vodka.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840
It's cutting into my job, like making sure he has steady access to vodka is a huge responsibility

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840
of mine.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.520
Oh, so you're saying you might be getting made redundant because.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.520
Yeah.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.560
And I mean, he has a concierge service, like.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.280
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280
That's the same thing.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Did you get concierge service?

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280
Yes.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.280
Well, it says concierge is really, what does that really mean?

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.320
Don't bring you the vodka.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.480
That's what that means.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.880
You can call him at midnight and be like, I need some fucking vodka and at 12 or five,

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880
your doorbell.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880
Yeah.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.880
You really think that's what it is?

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880
Well, yes.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.080
Drew Carey had like a Budweiser, like that kind of hookup where he said Budweiser.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.080
He's Drew Carey.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:46.360
I guess he is the Budweiser of comedies at any point that is not an insult that I love

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360
Drew Carey.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.320
I think he's fucking hilarious.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320
He's the king of beers.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.920
I said that because the joke was there, but I think he's hilarious.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.920
He's great.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.080
But if at any point Drew Carey picks up a certain, like the calls a number, a truck

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:05.200
pulls up at his house with kegs or cases or whatever he wants, like the Budweiser is

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.360
on the house, like forever.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360
Yeah.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360
Well, that's you.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.360
What cattle won?

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360
And you're like.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.440
I want that with Vivian Westwood suits.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.120
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want a fucking giant black truck to pull up

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.440
like Knight Rider and there just be a giant rack of suits at all, all size 54 UK size.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.520
And I just, just, I want them to just like, just push it all into my place.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.520
Yeah.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520
Huh.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.920
I don't know what mine would be.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.200
I guess video games.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200
I would take some.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.200
Oh man.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.200
Yeah.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:45.120
I want to read the Xbox Alliance.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.120
All right.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.480
Camille, not to be provocative, but, uh, and not to, not, not to like probe in a, in a

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.640
weird way, but how do you feel about he'll pop?

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640
About what?

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640
He'll popping.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.200
Oh, I've never been, I, I feel like, okay, so people talk about fetishes and stuff.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.400
I don't have any, but just cause I'm still just happy to be there.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:13.920
You know, like, I'm just like so grateful genuinely just to sort of be involved in the

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:19.280
process of sex, but that's, that's once you're, you're in a room with a naked lady.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280
That's how we all feel.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.120
But what, is there anything that turns your head and like, like makes your brain spark?

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:30.000
I've been married for six years and I am still, will take any part of her that she

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.680
let me have, seriously, I mean, it sounds withholding, but still sexy.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.680
Number one is the butt.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.680
Her most precious prize.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:52.600
That was an anal sex joke about my wife.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.600
Really horrible.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.480
For me, for me, like, like, when I watch porn and I do, of course, as we all must.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.480
Yeah.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.600
So, somebody's, somebody's given it a look, somebody's watching it.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600
Yeah.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600
Yeah.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600
There's certainly an industry.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.320
Here's, I have a couple of notes for the porn people.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.800
Learn how to fucking hold a camera and then get the girl in the frame, like, like, there's

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.800
the girl in the frame.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.800
There's headroom.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800
You had one job.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.640
Why is there, there's six feet of headroom and I can't see her legs and like, get the

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.680
gal in the shot.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680
Here's my other.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.040
I don't like it when they, when the girl looks in, into the camera, because that, I'm like,

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.560
I don't know why they keep doing that.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.440
I don't, I know I'm not there, I'm not an idiot.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.440
Because they're not, they're not theatrically trained.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.440
No.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.680
But they're like, talk to the camera and I'm like, not at my best right now.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.480
Like, I don't want to see you, I don't want you to see me like this and also horrible

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480
right now.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.920
To the extent that I'm immersed at all, I'm pretending to be the guy, so then you're

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.840
looking and the weirdest thing is when they, they, they do what they're doing to the fella

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.640
and then they're looking at the camera and going, you like that?

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.640
You like the way I do that?

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640
I'm like, well, what now?

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.640
How am I involved?

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640
I'm not involved.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.640
I know.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.640
Who's that?

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.640
What do you mean?

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640
Do I like that?

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640
Well, ask him.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640
Jesus Christ.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.960
I, I don't, I don't, I wouldn't be watching it.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.920
I don't want them to ask him because the fuck when the guys talk, it's over.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920
It's fucking over.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.200
And also, will the guys stop putting their fingers in the girl's mouth?

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.920
Will you, can you please stop fish-hooking and doing that douchey shit?

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.320
Well, there's a lot of like that weird violence.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.520
I, I, I feel like there's a lot of incredible rampant misogyny in porn.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.400
I was like, you don't like fucking her.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.360
Therefore, she doesn't like being fucked by you.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.280
And now nobody wins.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.240
The biggest turn on for me in porn is when the gal at least appears, hopefully realistically

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.480
is enjoying it.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.320
That's why I like, this is weird.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.920
I go, I, if there's like a squirting one, I go for that because then I'm like, oh,

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.160
for sure she's into it.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160
Oh yeah.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:06.400
Squirting, squirting's great, but it's always that fucking Scytheria chick is fucking weird.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.400
She's good at it.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400
I don't like when it gets on the camera.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.400
She's weird.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400
She's not.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.920
You don't like it when a droplet hits the lens because it's like, it takes you out of

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.920
it.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920
Yeah.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.240
Because it's not like, you know, like in video games now when it rains, it gets on the screen.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.440
And then I think of that.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.800
And then I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like that.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.280
It's not the act of squirting.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.480
It's just the idea of she wants to be there.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:35.280
What's amazing about squirting is it's physical, empirical evidence that the girl enjoyed herself.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.280
That's what I like.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.280
It's proof.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280
You know what I also don't like?

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.600
But often supported by an on-site special effects crew.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.720
I mean, there's an online, like, there is a lot where I'm like, that was, you should

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.160
be hydrating because.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160
There's a lot of.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160
You think so?

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.160
Yes.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160
It's trickery.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.160
Yeah.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.160
It's, it's sort of a stunt.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.160
Am I, am I being lied to by the porn industry?

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160
Yeah.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:05.400
Um, but isn't it interesting when we talked about the dichotomy between gay and straight,

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.680
the other interesting thing is the dichotomy between, which, which, which it's, it's actually

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:16.160
remarkable how this threshold has been able to maintain itself in a society which clearly

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.080
holds nothing sacred anymore, in which there's network shows called who wants to marry a

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:27.160
dwarf or, you know, who wants to eat spider shit for, for, for a, for a chance at a Verizon

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160
job.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.800
Like, like we, we are in the darkest days possible.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.160
We are, what is on our TV is what was on the TV in the background of time bandits.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.480
Like we, we are, we, we have, we have gone beyond the pale of Paddy Chayefsky's vision

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.480
and network all the way into just like people hanging upside down over lava and going, are

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.480
you afraid to die, you dumb bitch?

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.480
Okay.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480
$5,000.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.680
Um, but, but we maintain this sexual obsession.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680
I read for that.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.320
There's a dichotomy between what we call pornography and what we call reality.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.760
When the truth is like, like pornography, when you really use that word correctly, everything

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.320
in our society has become pornography.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.840
It's all for the prairie and interest.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.480
It's all just garbage.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.800
Um, none of it is for the furtherment of the fucking species.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.840
So, and yet we are so, it's, it's, it's interesting and I'm good.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.360
I'm not going to be cynical about it.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:29.200
I'm going to, I'm going to say this is adorable about us that we are so obsessed with sex.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.240
So in love with it and consider it so powerful that we have, we still have been able to maintain

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.920
the schism so that the people that are willing to have sex on camera are, you know, the guy,

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.440
I'll just talk about the guys cause I don't want to, you know, we've had Dan and our friend

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:49.320
Dana D'Armanda on here and like, like I'm not going to, uh, I, I, I don't want to add

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.240
to the fucking landfill of misogyny that must be rampant in the, in that when you go into

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.360
a pornography, so let's just talk about the guys.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.840
There's no chance of being politically incorrect about that.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:03.640
The dumbest fucking people in the world are the only people that are willing to do it.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.240
Like the guy, like the, when they improvise their dialogue and the things that they say

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.440
to the women, when they're so like, like, like, she's, she's on the hook.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.040
She's willing to have sex with you on camera.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.760
You don't have to, you don't have to spike that football.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.040
Oh, what are you saying?

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.040
I just blush.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.040
I'm like, you're, oh God.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040
No.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040
Just tell her you love her.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:32.080
I mean, it might not be true, but either is the idea of like, like slapping the face

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:41.080
with your dick and your, yeah, it's just the weird urban inflection, you grew up rich.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:44.160
Can everybody, can everybody stop spitting on everything?

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.320
Like the fucking spitting is fucking.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.400
Can everything stop being like fucking crooked and pierced and covered with butterflies?

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.480
And like, what about the poor little 40 year old guy with a little dick just wants to watch

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.280
a librarian say, your books are overdue.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:06.040
If you owe me so much money and have the guy like Ron Jeremy or something like troll like

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:12.280
guy that represents me go, but I don't have any money.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.280
Well you're going to have to do something because this book is overdue.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280
What are you doing?

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.280
What are you doing?

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.280
Refusal of the call.

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.280
Yeah.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.280
Powerful.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280
Powerful.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:36.280
Makes, makes, makes a person hard as a diamond, thresholds, goddesses, atonements with fathers.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:44.960
Don't take that literally, but, but that is Debbie does Dallas is a big atonement with

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:50.360
the father in there called doing Debbie.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.960
I think it's weird to think about how it's the only industry I can think of that could

01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.360
end right now and we would be fine forever because there is so much porn out there.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360
Oh yeah.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.360
The worst would be before you die, you have to watch one video for the second time.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360
Yeah.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.360
Like you could watch porn every single day.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.360
Like if we stop making salt at some point, we're going to be like, we need some fucking

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.360
salt, but with porn, there's always so much porn.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:26.360
We've been fucking great at it for so long, but porn is something where like you, you

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.360
have that one image that one video that you can go back to over and over again.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.360
That's like that one for some reason is potent.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360
Like the way they make eye contact or something.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.360
I had this weird thing when I was a kid, I had a very, very religious Muslim upbringing.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.360
So I found porn, but I would feel like immense amount of guilt for it.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:50.360
So I would always watch it, but I had to be done before they achieved penetration.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.360
Also the fact that I call it achieved.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360
And done.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.360
So just how far away outside my reality was.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.360
Xbox Alliance.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360
Yeah.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360
Xbox Alliance.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360
Achievement unlocked, yeah.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360
Yeah.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.360
So I would watch it, but right before they actually started fucking, I had to like come

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.360
and be done before that because then I thought that it was, that then it wasn't a sin.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360
Hmm.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.360
I like, I like when the gals enjoy it and I want the guys to have a giant dick and not

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.360
talk.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360
Don't talk.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.360
You don't like them to talk even if it's not like terrible talk.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.360
If they talk, it better be fucking interesting and fucking.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.360
It better be.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.360
My life is in this here in Yellow Leaf, Leon McDuff.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.360
You want them to talk about how we don't use words enough?

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360
Shit.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.360
The girl says, hopefully you'll let me suck your dick again to the guy.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.360
You just, his voice above the camera goes like, actually hopefully used as an adverb

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.360
as being misappropriated there.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.360
If you're saying that you would like to suck my dick in full of hope.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360
It's so ironic you're eating my pussy.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360
It's not ironic.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360
It's coincidental.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.360
Two titties emerged in a yellow wood.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.360
And I chose the one less nibbled on.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.360
I've been obsessed with the number 9-11 for many years.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360
I'll expand on it while you suck my balls.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:18.360
I used to have dreams of you rubbing my nuts like this and now it's happening.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:26.360
Spencer, let's play some Dungeons and Dragons, shall we?

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.360
Yeah.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.360
Let's do that.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.360
Or do you, or does Spencer want to talk about his debut as a network single actor?

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.360
Fuck D&D.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.360
Let's talk about that.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.360
That's better.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.360
Yeah, going from sex to the polar opposite of sex doesn't seem like a good transition.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360
I don't know.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.360
I crave nothing more after sex than Dungeons and Dragons, but...

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:53.360
Well, that's funny because when I play Dungeons and Dragons, I crave nothing more than sex.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360
It's a game that...

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.360
I combine D&D with sex because I fuck every goddamn thing I meet.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.360
But, yeah, I mean, I kind of dropped it on you like a sandbag.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.360
Yeah.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.360
And I did that because I didn't want you to have to worry about whether or not you were

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360
supposed to say yes or no to it.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.360
I just wanted you to have the luxury of having it thrust upon you.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.360
Yeah, no, it was a really good methodology there.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.360
When did you do it?

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360
When was this?

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360
It was Monday and Wednesday.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.360
Oh, wow.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360
It was my days.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.360
And without...

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360
He was in a total of four scenes, right?

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.360
He was like a legitimate guest star role.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.360
Have you ever done any television, like any acting, learning lines, any theater in school

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360
or anything?

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360
No.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.360
I mean, when I was in college, I took a speech class, but you didn't even have to, like,

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360
memorize, so...

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.360
So what was it like for you to get a script, have these lines?

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.360
Like, what was your process?

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.360
I vomited a lot.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360
Did you really?

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360
I mean, not like a lot.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360
But you did.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.360
And then it goes a long way with vomit.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.360
Yeah, that's my rule when it comes to vomit.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360
Yeah.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360
You did vomit because you were nervous?

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.360
Yeah, I mean, the Harmontown, you know, Die Hard Harmontown fans will know I feel like shit

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:17.360
a lot because a combination of weird anxiety and eating garbage 100% of the time makes

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360
me feel weird.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.360
So, like, sometimes when I come to Harmontown, I'm feeling weird, and that's what it is.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360
It's just these two things.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360
So that's what was happening.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:31.360
It makes you understand why, you know, famous people are all about health, because, like,

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.360
you can't afford not to be healthy if you're vomiting when you're supposed to be in front

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360
of the camera, like, you're fucked, right?

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360
Yeah, you can't be sick at all.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360
Yeah.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.360
I don't get why people...

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360
Did you have a good time?

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.360
How was it?

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.360
It was, like, it was really nerve-wracking because, I mean, I don't even talk to people

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360
that are near me.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:57.360
But he was, yeah, he's doing scenes with, like, I'll make arbitrary decisions about what's

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.360
a spoiler and what's not, but he was doing scenes with Danny Pudi, Allison Brie, and

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.360
Brie Larson, like, and he was the fourth and was an equal part of all of these scenes.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.360
Oh, that's great.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360
And I can't express enough how...

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:15.360
Much I'd like to finish a sentence without being applauded.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.360
That's your curse.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.360
That's just, like, the Midas touch and many, many, many, like, punchlines.

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:28.360
Like, I just created a character that was, like, like, I did my best to go, like, okay,

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.360
it doesn't matter if you are nervous or if you, you know, that it would just be, like,

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360
because you seem unflappable.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.360
Like, a lot of people cannot handle if you go, like, oh, we like you.

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.360
Why don't you stand up on this slightly higher platform because of what we like about you?

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:49.360
Well, most of us, like, when we step onto that higher platform, we start to become so

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:57.360
conscious of the meta context that we actually, we kind of can't keep being the version of

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360
ourselves that the people value down here.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360
Yeah.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.360
But we brought you out of the audience and you're a dungeon master.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360
We brought you on tour.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.360
You're in Brooklyn.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.360
400 people are giving you a standing ovation for rolling dice and stuff.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.360
And it's just, like, you're kind of unflappable.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.360
Maybe you're puking in the bathroom, I guess we're learning, but, but, but, and I was like,

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.360
That's, that's all though.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.360
I mean, I did that at my old jobs and stuff too.

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.360
But, but I was very serious to see.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.360
That's your process.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.360
Because now you're beyond anything that I think I would be willing to do.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:31.360
I don't think I would have been, I don't, they're on that, on the set of community,

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:39.360
they're, it's, it's like, like, just lights and a lot of them and like people hanging from

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360
rafters and you're used to it.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.360
Like literally in the rafters, like you'll hear someone talking like seven feet above

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360
your head.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360
Yeah.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.360
Holy shit.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.360
And hundreds of people in the, in the space around you, everything is an illusion.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.360
What you see on TV is an apartment, but it is a crowd.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.360
It is a town hall meeting surrounding you and three cameras on giant dollies.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:07.360
And it gets, it's, I don't know how, I don't know how, how, how, how, to what extent I'd

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:12.360
be able to act naturally in that environment and actors have to have a kind of psychosis

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.360
because they have to know that the camera's there and they have to act like they don't

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.360
know it's there.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.360
But they also have to act in a way that no one would act in real life because the camera

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360
needs them to act a certain way.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360
They need to keep their chin up.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:28.360
But Spencer's kind of a slam dunk for that because he, like, you're, you're, you, we only

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.360
know you on camera.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:34.360
You're on stage and nobody asked you to be, you're on camera in the documentary, nobody

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.360
asked you to be like, your, your persona is the Spencer that we know, which is the guy

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360
that's like, why is everybody looking at me?

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360
Yeah, maybe.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:47.360
But you, whether you're inwardly or, you know, you're shitting like a Canadian goose, like

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360
we don't know.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:52.360
Like outwardly, you're just being Spencer that we all know and love.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360
Yeah.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360
I mean, I don't know.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.360
I can foresee you standing next to like Joaquin Phoenix, like presenting an award at like

01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.360
in two years.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.360
I could see that.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360
Yeah.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.360
Not that that's an important goal, but I think it's, I think, I think it's interesting.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.360
That's great.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.360
I can't wait to see it.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.360
Spencer, real quick, before we play D&D for a moment, weird fetish.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.360
Um, I like it when the clothes are off.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.360
What a weirdo.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:26.360
Can I say one thing about the, what percentage gay do you think Spencer is?

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.360
Huh?

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360
What percentage gay do you think?

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.360
I'm a zero on the Kinsey scale, I think, am I getting there?

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.360
You're pretty straight.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360
You mean?

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.360
Yeah.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:39.520
I will say this about myself is that one of my biggest regrets is going to be that I'll

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.860
probably die without ever having sucked a penis.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:49.860
Not because I just feel like it's an experience that so many people have and I just want to

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:53.360
be able to relate to it.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360
And it's never going to happen.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.360
I don't want to fuck a dude in the ass.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360
I think most people would let a guy go down on them.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.360
I think that's fine.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:06.360
But, but like sucking a penis is such a specific thing and I'll never have it.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:10.360
Camille, you can do anything you want.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.360
You know what?

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360
It's crazy to me.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.360
Can we turn the lights down real quick?

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.360
In movies and stuff when you get introduced to, uh...

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360
Oh!

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360
Oh, Camille!

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360
Camille!

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:27.360
Like in...

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:34.360
Hey, not bad first time out, huh?

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.360
What were you saying?

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360
I didn't mean to step on that bit.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.360
I didn't know.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.360
No, no, no.

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360
It wasn't even...

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.360
What were you saying?

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:48.360
Well, it's interesting to me like a closeted gay culture in movies, like in other words,

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:56.360
archetypes where you in movies and TV when closeted gay men are represented in media,

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:04.360
like the idea that they pay money for the privilege of blowing another dude, which is

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360
really profound.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.360
And interesting because it's like, oh my God, that's how repressed we are.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:15.360
That men who are pigs and who don't care about anything with themselves and that they could

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:22.360
be so fenced in psychologically that they would give money something they don't give

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360
to...

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360
They're like, can I give you $50?

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360
Can I just give you pleasure, another guy?

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.360
That's really profound to me.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.360
I think that's the one thing that is definitely...

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360
That's definitely gay.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.360
If you're fucking a dude in the ass, you could be like, oh, this is a woman.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.360
If someone's fucking you in the ass, it could be a woman with a strap on.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.360
But if you're sucking a penis, you're definitely sucking a penis, you know?

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.360
There's no...

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.360
So I think if you're someone that's a very tough stance to take, no jobs are great.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:55.360
I think it's a Drew Carey's joke.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.360
You know you're gay when you're sucking a guy's dick, but you're thinking about another

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360
guy's dick.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360
That's gay.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:15.360
It's kind of a Budweiser-y joke because I prefer something more important than that.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.360
More alliance-y, if you will.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.360
I like that it's an alliance.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.360
You're like part of NATO now.

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.360
Yeah, I feel like...

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360
Can we get a list of the other people who are currently in NATO?

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.360
You don't think they frown on me, like humble bragging or bragging or whatever.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.360
They like it, right?

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360
This is what they want.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.360
Do you think it's tacky?

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.360
They're like, don't tell them about the alliance.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:42.360
I would venture a guess and say that you'd be disappointed to find out who's also received

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360
that email.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.360
Seth Green.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360
Jeremy Piven.

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.360
Jeremy Piven.

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.360
Definitely.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.360
But this time Jeremy Piven probably has a humanitas, you hang out long enough.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.360
Yeah, he's been around a while.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360
Look, time is short.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.360
Let's play a little bit of D&D.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.360
Yeah, come on.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360
Just give us a...

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.360
Give it to us.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.360
Give us a sweet taste, Spencer Shaik.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360
I always do.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.360
I don't get it.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:21.360
Last time on Harmontown, our heroes clashed with Admiral Darkstar at the top of his black

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360
keep.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.880
The Admiral thought the heroes were playing into his hands, but Darkstar had a rude awakening

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.680
as he realized the shards were nowhere to be found.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.520
After yet more disappointment, Chris de Burgh knocked Admiral Darkstar from his post onto

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:45.040
the ground, where he was then sat upon by Mulraine.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.000
Sharpie cast reduced person on himself, and as a miniature man tried to trick the Dark

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.320
Lord by conjuring a crude figment of what he hoped would be the demonic warlord's mother.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.040
When it failed to beguile Darkstar, Sharpie broke out into rap.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.040
What did it mean?

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.440
How did the rap play out in terms of combat time?

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440
Was it actually canon?

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.440
We'll find out tonight.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.440
That's it.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.440
That's all I got.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.920
Dan, should we get Ian?

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920
He's here tonight to play Mulraine?

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.400
You want Ian to play Mulraine?

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.440
Ian, get out of the genre and come up and play Mulraine for us.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:35.680
Ian, everybody.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.720
So yeah, Ian played us Chris de Burgh last week.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.040
Yeah, it was you last week.

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.040
How was it?

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.040
It was hard.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040
It was hard?

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.040
He kicked some ass.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.040
I did kick some ass.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.280
I had some good weapons.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.280
Really?

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280
I've never looked.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.960
He just keeps tying a rope to a dagger.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.880
Did you know you have a Bola?

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.160
Ebola?

01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.880
I don't know how that's a weapon.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.160
I give it to other people.

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.760
You could weaponize it.

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.760
It's a Bola.

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.760
A weapon.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.760
A Bola.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760
Like, you throw it.

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.760
Oh, it's like a ropey thing?

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.760
Was it?

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.760
Yeah.

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.760
It has ropes on it.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:11.760
I know you like ropes.

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.760
Yeah, I've been doing ropes.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.360
It's like a cat or nine tails, kind of.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.600
It's like two weights separated by a cord, and you whip one around like a lasso and

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.960
let it go, and then it'll wrap around.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.600
Oh, around people's legs and stuff?

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:25.600
Yeah.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.600
Like a kinect.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.600
Like superheroes.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.600
Like Batman has a thing like that.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.600
Yeah.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.600
Cool.

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.600
He was the superhero I was thinking of.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.040
Okay, so Spencer, give us the physical layout, where we're all standing and what we're doing

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.040
right now.

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.040
You're in a room.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.360
It's rather unadorned, except there's a big pillar of black crystal, and on the ground

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.560
is Admiral Darkstar is being set upon by Moraine.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.560
There's an illusion of a woman standing nearby.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.560
I'm sorry.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.560
There's what?

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:54.800
An illusion of a woman standing nearby that Sharpie had conjured and was talking about

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.880
buying dicks off.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.360
I think she's an older lady, right?

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360
Yeah, definitely older.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360
Someone's mom.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.360
Yeah.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360
I have a wire saw.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.360
Yeah.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360
This is great.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360
Yeah, man.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360
There's two pages.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360
I put a lot of thought into these things.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.720
All right, so what's going on with Darkstar?

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.200
He's being set on.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.200
Is he...

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.560
He's not digging it so much.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.240
Can I take my wire saw to his head?

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.240
You can try.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:27.040
Admiral Darkstar, we're about to take a wire saw to your head.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.160
Do you have anything to say about that?

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.160
Yeah.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160
That's good.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.840
What do you say about that?

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.440
He has nothing to say.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.440
All right.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440
You're just saying nothing?

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440
Yeah.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.440
Who knows?

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.160
He's definitely not saying anything.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.160
Wait a minute.

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.160
Do it.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.160
You're so...

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.920
Your trademark is your speaking voice, Admiral Darkstar.

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.920
Speak.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:53.920
I think it's because I'm sitting on him.

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.920
Maybe I should move.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920
Yeah.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920
No, don't move.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:59.840
It's because he's being set on.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.840
Okay.

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.360
That's why he's not talking.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.880
I kiss him.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.600
Well, you'd have to move more rain.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.600
Well, no, I don't.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.480
I can bend down and kiss his face.

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.080
His face is being set on.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.080
Oh, he's...

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080
He's going on his face.

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.080
I'll take it.

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.080
Yeah.

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.080
Didn't I say that?

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.680
So, how would I cut his...

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.080
I guess sort of sideways, top of his head, cut it like that.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.360
I mean, I'd start at the neck.

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.160
But isn't the neck being set on?

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.720
Well, the face is being set on.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.040
I mean, presumably the neck has a bit of a exposure.

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.640
Can I get into a flanking position and be ready to fuck him?

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640
Yes.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640
All right.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.120
I go to his neck and I start cutting his neck.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.560
You start cutting his neck.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560
Let me see.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.560
Oh, God.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.320
Time to get some head and I start sawing.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.560
I'm not happy with it.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.560
And I say, already am.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.400
Right now?

01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.600
You hear a pain like screaming, muffled, coming through like armor and anus.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.600
This is awful.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.640
What are we doing?

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.640
What are we doing?

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640
We want to kill this guy, right?

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640
Well, I don't know.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.040
We've already beaten him.

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.080
We're cutting his head off surgically.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.280
His limbs are flailing around.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.560
It's a little Taliban, sure.

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560
I stop.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.880
I have my pants down around my ankles behind him and I look at Sharpie and go, wait, wait,

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.160
is there a flag in the play?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.160
What's going on?

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.200
Well, why do we not like this guy?

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.720
Because he does stuff like this?

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:38.080
I mean, like, what is the difference between him and us if this is how we beat him?

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.000
He has represented evil the entire time we've ever heard him say.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.240
He just wanted some shards of power and had some UFOs and stuff.

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.240
Okay.

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.960
I keep my pants down around my ankles and I back off and I give the floor to Sharpie.

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:56.720
I stop and I go, I'm sorry, and then Mulraine, could you get off his face?

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.720
I just, okay.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720
This is a bad idea.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.720
I get off his face.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.720
Who's going to tie his head off?

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:09.120
Also, Spencer, real quick, could you physically describe Admiral Darkstar right now?

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.400
Yeah, he looks like he's, you know, just wearing black armor.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.160
He can't see any part of him.

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.160
What size is he?

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160
Is he a regular humanoid?

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.000
He's like six foot tall and he has a horned helmet on the black cape.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.280
Everything's all black and matte.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.720
All right, so we all get off him and we give him some space because Sharpie wants to have

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.200
a little coffee clutch with him.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.760
I go, look, we can kill you if we want.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.280
We were cutting your neck off, head off.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.800
We could have done it before you had freedom.

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.120
I mean, you say those things, I guess.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.120
What is he doing?

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.800
He's just staring at you guys.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.600
He pulls himself to his feet.

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.600
What?

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.600
No, he's sitting down.

01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.160
When I kick him back down, that happens.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:05.960
That was not an invitation to be equals with us.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.160
This is magnanimity.

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:12.960
This is, I mean, do you just want to die?

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.960
Yes or no?

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.960
No!

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.680
See, he doesn't want to die.

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:18.680
That's how he sounds?

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.680
Oh, yeah.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.680
Yes.

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680
Yes, the best.

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.440
He sounds like Axl Rose.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.840
Let's just tie him up and take him with us on our next adventure.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.840
Do you know where you are?

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.840
What?

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840
That's all right.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840
What?

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.840
You in my keep now.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.960
I make the rules.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.800
You have to understand it doesn't look like that to us.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.960
He does respond.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.960
If you almost cut your head off, we totally could have.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.960
So are we cool now?

01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:00.960
If you cut my head off, I'll be more strong than you can imagine.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:07.960
It's a good thing we didn't cut his head off.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:12.960
I love cutlerosis, so I'm bad.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.960
I don't know.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.040
I've never just assassinated someone.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.200
We've beaten him and we're just supposed to terminate his life.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.200
I go up to him and I rifle through his pockets.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.920
He stops you.

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920
Stops you?

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920
Yeah.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.600
I grapple him and then try to wrestle him to the floor.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.600
All right.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.440
What's your grapple bonus?

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.440
Grapple bonus?

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.000
I hope it's like 14 or something.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
That's a very good question.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.240
What's my grapple bonus?

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.240
My grapple?

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.920
I'm going to call a critical fail a critical fail when I see one.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:47.920
Oh, fuck hell.

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920
Yeah.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.480
So you go to grab him and he does this weird judo move, like some sort of crazy nerd.

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.960
And before you know it, you're on your back and he's like, I had a plus five grapple

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.960
bonus.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:44:59.960
Yeah.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:00.960
I know.

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:01.960
That's why I said you need like a 14 or something.

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960
Jesus Christ.

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:03.960
Yeah.

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.360
So now, now he's, he's over you and he's got your arm and like one of those poses when

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.800
the guy has your arm and it makes you not able to do stuff.

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.800
Oh yeah.

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:12.800
That's happening.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.800
Okay.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.800
Sure.

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.440
Like some kind of half Nelson or something?

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.440
Yeah.

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:25.240
I do the, the WWF thing where I slap my shoulder like fake pain.

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:27.640
I, I scorching Ray his face.

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.640
Okay.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.640
Wait.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.280
So cutting his head off is not okay, but I had to wait like in the movies for him to

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.760
try to kill us.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.760
He hasn't tried at all to attack us.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760
He's just not very good.

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.880
He's tried a thousand ways to kill us over the, over the years.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.120
Dealing 20 damage.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.120
Nice.

01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.520
You're scorching, you know, missile and it hits him in the face and his, his armor begins

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.200
to glow red with heat.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.120
What do you, what do you, his armor starts to glow red with heat.

01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.120
Yeah.

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.120
Cause he hit it with a scorching missile.

01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.120
Okay.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.120
So that'll happen.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120
All right.

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.120
Well, damage report.

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.120
I said 20 damage.

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120
Okay.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120
Yeah.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120
But what is it?

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.120
Is he dead?

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.120
No.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.120
All right.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120
He's Admiral Darkstar.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120
All right.

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.120
He's not on the ground anymore.

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.680
He's got quark, uh, grappled to take his helmet off.

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.120
You could definitely ask him.

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.120
Well, is it, is it more range turn?

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.320
Whoever wants to ask a question, honestly, I don't, I don't want to ask him.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.520
I say we just tie his ass up and then we take his home.

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.520
He's up and about.

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.240
Now he's got our friend hostage, which just kill him.

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.240
I, I'm sorry.

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:38.400
I caused an extra epilogue to killing him.

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.400
I didn't feel comfortable sitting on a man's face and sawing his head off.

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.400
There's no, there's no dignity in that.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.120
I felt uncomfortable doing it.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.720
I go into the corner and start, uh, I take my shoe off.

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.720
You're being grappled.

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.220
Oh, I'm being grappled.

01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:56.720
What am I here for?

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.720
Okay.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:01.200
You go into the corner.

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.200
Okay.

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:10.320
While I'm being grappled with my right foot, I start, I start dangling my shoe.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.960
I dip it, I dangle it, couple, couple, couple of heel pops.

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:17.960
Pop that heel baby.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960
Yeah.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.960
Pop that thigh, heel pop it.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.960
Dan.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:21.960
I guess.

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:22.960
Sorry.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.960
I thought I was going full character there.

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:35.960
Um.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960
What do we do guys?

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960
Kill him.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.960
Kill him.

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960
Kill him.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:40.960
All right.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:49.520
I take out the wire saw and I go and I start sawing his neck off again and I go very loudly.

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.200
I say, uh, this feels familiar.

01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.320
So you start wire saw in his head and, uh, he's not doing the same thing as he did last

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.320
time.

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.600
In fact, you, you, you start, you get a few strokes in his helmet pops off and you see

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.640
there's no head inside.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.800
It's all crazy.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800
You guys.

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800
Head.

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800
Is that helmet?

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800
What?

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:14.800
What?

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:15.800
Is there wires in there?

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.800
No.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.800
Yeah.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.800
There's confetti.

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.800
It's happy birthday.

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:26.600
No, inside you see billowing black smoke that pours into the room and swirls and begins

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:34.480
swirling and continues this swirling into a black dark vortex of powerful magical energy.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:44.280
And you can hear a voice kind of, uh, kind of scream out, I told you, he did tell you.

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.280
Yeah.

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.720
I can confirm that you become more powerful than we could possibly imagine.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720
Something like that.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.720
I can't go that far to confirm.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:52.720
God damn it.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.720
We shouldn't.

01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.720
We should have killed him.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720
We shouldn't have.

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.720
This is like the second time you've taken off his head and something like this has happened.

01:48:58.720 --> 01:48:59.720
Right.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:00.720
What?

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.720
Yeah.

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.720
I don't even remember the other one.

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:03.720
Thanks, Adam.

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.720
He knows.

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:05.720
I think it was a tiring episode.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:06.720
Yeah.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.440
I, I, I yell out, what do you want from us, Admiral Darkstar?

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.960
You hear no response, only the roaring vortex of magical power.

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:27.280
Dispel that shit, shut up, who has, all right, does somebody have to spell that shit on

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:29.280
their character sheet?

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:36.960
No, it's, he might as well be calling out, achieve victory, black smoke around it.

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.960
I cast achieve victory.

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:47.960
You achieve victory, because he's really just going away, right?

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.960
I, I wave the smoke around like a spark.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.960
The smoke continues to spin and it spins downward, kind of like a spiral funnel cloud.

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.960
And it kind of, you see it go through the ground and then it disappears.

01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.960
Yeah.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.960
So it's kind of like the worst episodes of Lost.

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:02.960
Kind of.

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:10.600
But before you can react, you hear a rumbling followed by a cracking followed by an explosion

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.760
of stones from the floor below.

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:21.960
As you see a metal clawed hand, maybe about seven feet long, seven feet in some dimension,

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.800
smash through the floor.

01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:31.840
It's a metal claw and it grabs, it attempts to grab quark, it grabs quark and grabs him

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:38.240
and begins pulling him towards this stone hole and it's like, it's, it's anxiety inducing.

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.760
It builds tension.

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760
Almost like a cliffhanger.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760
Oh.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760
It's a cliffhanger.

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.760
Cliffhanger!

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.760
Thank you.

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.760
Thank you.

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:48.760
Thank you.

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760
Thank you.

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.760
Thank you.

01:50:50.760 --> 01:51:03.760
Thank you, it wasn't all Harmontown, give it up for Ian.

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.760
Camille, not Gianni.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:10.760
Thank you, everyone.

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760
Bertie Stevens earlier on.

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.760
Thank you.

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.760
And all of our lovely Harmonites and Harmonians.

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.760
I'm Jeff James, your mayor.

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.760
Oh, Dan Harmon.

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760
Hello.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.760
I have to go back to the community offices where the writers are waiting for me.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:31.760
Because we're, we have to finish writing the episode that shoots tomorrow.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:37.760
So if I'm, if I'm, if I shoot through like an aloof meteor to my car, don't judge me.

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:44.760
Well, Special Clinton too, everybody.

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:49.760
I meant to hit Xanadu, but my fingers are too fat and I hit a country song for no reason.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:50.760
So pretend it's Xanadu.

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.760
I love you all.

01:51:51.760 --> 01:52:17.760
I love you all. Good night.
