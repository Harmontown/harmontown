{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.720\nHello everyone and welcome once again to those of you, the lucky few digging it live here at Meltdown\n\n00:26.720 --> 00:34.720\nComics in Hollywood, to those listening around the world, the beautiful planet Earth, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:34.720 --> 01:04.440\nPlease welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, the Dan Harmon.wn, thank you, thank you, this is buttoning my sweatshirt in front of my gut, it's pretty, it's fooling\n\n01:04.440 --> 01:13.440\neverybody, right? It's slimming. If you cover something, you don't know it's there. Are you saying you've put on a couple?\n\n01:13.440 --> 01:32.440\nYeah, definitely, definitely. A lot of stress at work and a lot of seeking comfort. You're on a diet and it's just like, that's its own thing, it's discipline and then any excuse at work, you just go, well, if I'm staying here all night, then I'm going to eat chicken and waffles because I deserve that and all that stuff.\n\n01:32.440 --> 01:40.440\nI talked to Dino and he said that, you know, Dino Stamatopoulos friend and writer on your show, he said that you guys are ordering lots of gourmet food like every day.\n\n01:40.440 --> 01:49.440\nWe try, you know, Sony doesn't pay for coffee, they still pay for meals, so we really try to shiv them.\n\n01:49.440 --> 01:51.440\nWhat's the average?\n\n01:51.440 --> 02:08.440\nPuffer fish again or whatever. You having fugu? Yeah. Anyways, and every Friday is wings Friday, I get hot wings for everybody. That's actually out of pocket. I don't know why.\n\n02:08.440 --> 02:28.440\nWhat a great opening to the show. We're just talking about being fat and eating. There's some corrections in order, somebody tweeted me to let us know that the internet was developed for scientific purposes, not military, so I guess that's the one thing we got wrong last week.\n\n02:28.440 --> 02:43.440\nThe only thing we've ever gotten wrong. Yeah. For all of you, history buffs using our show as some kind of archive or you aliens digging this up and putting it into your factoids about Earth, yeah, we don't know what we're doing here.\n\n02:43.440 --> 02:55.440\nWe just drop into a pool and we reach for a laugh. What's the difference between scientific pursuits and military? Don't military people constantly think that they're being scientific?\n\n02:55.440 --> 03:02.440\nI feel like anytime anything beautiful is developed or invented, the military finds an awesome way to turn that into a way to kill people.\n\n03:02.440 --> 03:10.440\nAnd yet not the internet. They couldn't figure it out. Isn't that great? They can kill you with the internet.\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:28.440\nWell, now they can use it to enslave you. But it's kind of beautiful that they didn't see it coming and figure out a way to roll it out in a way that we enslaved ourselves with the internet. Nobody pulled a sheet off of it and said, here's how it works and this is the only way you can use it.\n\n03:28.440 --> 03:40.440\nYou have to have a six on your forehead in order to log into this level and you have orange clearance here. It just kind of evolved organically and we found out something from the internet which is that we all want to be idiots.\n\n03:40.440 --> 03:49.440\nWe don't want to topple the power structures. We like Twinkies. We like YouTube.\n\n03:49.440 --> 03:58.440\nIt's willful surrender to control. The book We by Zamiat and I was the first, people have read that before?\n\n03:58.440 --> 04:07.440\nYeah. It's like proto sci-fi. It's the only book written in the future and people very willfully submit to control.\n\n04:07.440 --> 04:20.440\nWell, when you have a society that's high on the hog, it's that whole bread and circuses thing. That's where the Coliseum comes from. Just give us entertainment in exchange for all this power and wealth that we all have.\n\n04:20.440 --> 04:35.440\nLike America, we're very self-loathing lately about our economy but we still are not eating our own feet. There's still more food in the garbage than there is available and we need a lot of entertainment and stuff, a lot of distraction.\n\n04:35.440 --> 04:41.440\nThis show's kicked off in a very cheery note. I think it bodes well.\n\n04:41.440 --> 04:51.440\nWell, further from the corrections department, when we brought up Glenn who brought the earth shine, he wrote us a very nice letter, gave us some more earth shine. I'm going to stay off of it.\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:59.440\nAnd my earth shine, for those of you who don't know, it's high quality moonshine. I'm certain that we're all going to jail for some sort of federal crime.\n\n04:59.440 --> 05:07.440\nHe typically uses it for his absinthe, but it's an ingredient of his absinthe. Her absinthe, that's what the correction is.\n\n05:07.440 --> 05:09.440\nWait, what?\n\n05:09.440 --> 05:12.440\nWe have a lot of transgender Harmontown fans.\n\n05:12.440 --> 05:14.440\nHow many?\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:20.440\nThree is a lot. It's a very peculiar state to be in transgender. Three is a crowd.\n\n05:20.440 --> 05:22.440\nIs Glenn here?\n\n05:22.440 --> 05:30.440\nGlenn is not here, Glenn slash Jane, who he wanted to, he said, she said that when she came up,\n\n05:30.440 --> 05:38.440\nI know what it's like to be dead.\n\n05:38.440 --> 05:47.440\nI asked, what's your name? And she blurted out Glenn, force of habit, wanted to send a letter of, among other things, saying like, by the way,\n\n05:47.440 --> 05:58.440\nso that people don't get confused on the internet where he is very much out of the transgen closet and things, as Jane spelled G-A-N-N-E rhymes with plain.\n\n05:58.440 --> 06:06.440\nThat's the thing that kills me, Jane. You're transgender, but not enough complexity for you.\n\n06:06.440 --> 06:17.440\nYour name is Jane, spelled G-A-N-N-E, just in case anybody got through the transgender gauntlet without being alarmed or confused.\n\n06:17.440 --> 06:21.440\nDid she or he, how do I address he or her? He or she?\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:27.440\nI think the whole idea is that they identify as a female, and so the pronoun you use is she.\n\n06:27.440 --> 06:30.440\nBecause Glenn could be a female name as well.\n\n06:30.440 --> 06:38.440\nI suppose anything could be, but she has assumed a new angle of identity? I don't know.\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:42.440\nIt's a new emergent thing. It's exciting. I'm actually very excited.\n\n06:42.440 --> 06:46.440\nWhy do our transgender fans come here and male attire?\n\n06:46.440 --> 06:52.440\nBecause they're not transvestites. They are not necessarily...\n\n06:52.440 --> 06:54.440\nI don't know anything about this.\n\n06:54.440 --> 07:00.440\nWhat's funny is that half of the people you brought Levi up and he started talking about his thing.\n\n07:00.440 --> 07:05.440\nYou could hear people in our L.A. audience going...\n\n07:05.440 --> 07:11.440\nHe's being closed-minded about describing himself as transgender because he said he wanted to...\n\n07:11.440 --> 07:15.440\nHe's okay having a mustache because he doesn't have a uterus and you could hear people going...\n\n07:15.440 --> 07:18.440\nGlass ceiling.\n\n07:18.440 --> 07:24.440\nWhatever. He said something that wasn't the exact way that other people understand transgender to be.\n\n07:24.440 --> 07:28.440\nTransgenderism, I don't even know what to call it, but I am very flattered that...\n\n07:28.440 --> 07:34.440\nBecause I don't think you could get more fringe psychologically. Is that politically incorrect to say?\n\n07:34.440 --> 07:42.440\nI don't think you could be more complex on the inside of a human head compared to what's going on outside your body, in other words.\n\n07:42.440 --> 07:52.440\nAs far as somebody that you would look at in line at the bank and not be immediately presented with something that registered with you...\n\n07:52.440 --> 07:58.440\nYou couldn't have more noodles going on up there. More twists and turns.\n\n07:58.440 --> 08:03.440\nMore reasons to be distrustful of the people around you.\n\n08:03.440 --> 08:11.440\nMore suspicion, more fear that somebody might bully you for answering questions about yourself or expressing yourself.\n\n08:11.440 --> 08:21.440\nSo I'm very, very flattered. I take that as a barometer of our good work here and my good philosophy and religion.\n\n08:21.440 --> 08:33.440\nAny person in that situation would listen to our podcast and feel comfortable expressing that.\n\n08:33.440 --> 08:40.440\nIs anybody else here a transgender that we don't know about? Have we met all of them or are there more lurking about?\n\n08:40.440 --> 08:45.440\nI think they all are. They're just more afraid to say it.\n\n08:45.440 --> 08:54.440\nThere's a couple of trans-scientologists. People who identify as a Scientologist but they're not Scientologists.\n\n08:54.440 --> 09:03.440\nThey want to be called Scientologists because they feel like a Scientologist but they're not going to pay for that class.\n\n09:03.440 --> 09:12.440\nI'm not being like flippant. You can identify as a woman, look like a man, not want to dress like a woman.\n\n09:12.440 --> 09:17.440\nJust inside you're a woman but dress like a guy.\n\n09:17.440 --> 09:30.440\nIs that someone not following through with it or is that somebody saying, I just am a woman and I'll still dress like a guy named Tony?\n\n09:30.440 --> 09:35.440\nI think it's just breaking it up into different strata. You can stop there if you want.\n\n09:35.440 --> 09:43.440\nThat's a thing and then there's people that are in that situation that therefore want to...\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:47.440\nI don't know if there's a different language for it. They take steps medically, hormones and stuff.\n\n09:47.440 --> 09:48.440\nTransition.\n\n09:48.440 --> 09:51.440\nThey transition. Our friend...\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:59.440\nI heard it said a long time ago that very few people would be completely heterosexual if it was a sliding scale from 0 to 100\n\n09:59.440 --> 10:06.440\nor from left to right that people's sexuality tends to be somewhere along a sliding scale\n\n10:06.440 --> 10:09.440\nthat nobody is completely masculine or completely feminine.\n\n10:09.440 --> 10:12.440\nWhere do you feel you fall on the scale, Dan?\n\n10:12.440 --> 10:20.440\nHow close to totally masculine or toward the middle to the nether regions?\n\n10:20.440 --> 10:25.440\nI think Mark Rufalo is a real charming piece of...\n\n10:25.440 --> 10:35.440\nI wouldn't mind if he pulled up on his motorbike and showed me at a garden.\n\n10:35.440 --> 10:39.440\nI could surrender to...\n\n10:39.440 --> 10:50.440\nSexually speaking, sexually, I've never even had the time or energy to examine where in the spectrum between hetero and homo I would fall\n\n10:50.440 --> 10:58.440\nbecause there's too much going on in the hetero side with me and my various kinks and things.\n\n10:58.440 --> 11:05.440\nI'm sort of caught between hetero and asexual.\n\n11:05.440 --> 11:11.440\nI feel like some weird shit happened to me when I was a kid involving maybe hanging out under the table\n\n11:11.440 --> 11:15.440\nwhile 70s pantyhose clad women hung out.\n\n11:15.440 --> 11:21.440\nThere's some kind of leg fetish thing that I almost feel is like I really fully clothed women.\n\n11:21.440 --> 11:25.440\nIt's very strange.\n\n11:25.440 --> 11:31.440\nThere are things that I consume as pornography that you would not consider pornography.\n\n11:31.440 --> 11:40.440\nLet's just say for Thanksgiving, I invited Mark Rufalo over and he was wearing nice trousers.\n\n11:40.440 --> 11:48.440\nLet's say that you dropped your napkin under the table and you saw that Mark Rufalo was wearing kind of a high heel.\n\n11:48.440 --> 11:53.440\nNo, I like the feminine leg.\n\n11:53.440 --> 11:56.440\nHave you seen Mark Rufalo's leg?\n\n11:56.440 --> 12:01.440\nWell, if he could pass, there's guys on YouTube that do that.\n\n12:01.440 --> 12:11.440\nYou're clicking around, you're like, here's what peels my banana, legs and tights.\n\n12:11.440 --> 12:14.440\nYou find something and it's like, oh, wow, that's pretty good.\n\n12:14.440 --> 12:18.440\nAnd then the conversation was like, dude, guy, guy, dude.\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:22.440\nAnd you're like, oh, god damn it.\n\n12:22.440 --> 12:27.440\nYou got me, Michael.\n\n12:27.440 --> 12:35.440\nYou know, you have to look closely for that Adam's apple right on the back of the calf.\n\n12:35.440 --> 12:36.440\nI didn't know that.\n\n12:36.440 --> 12:37.440\nWhat is shoe play?\n\n12:37.440 --> 12:43.440\nShoe play is dangling, dipping, heel popping.\n\n12:43.440 --> 12:46.440\nThose are the three subtypes of shoe play.\n\n12:46.440 --> 12:48.440\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n12:48.440 --> 12:53.440\nDan, would you please elicit the difference between dangling and dipping?\n\n12:53.440 --> 13:00.440\nDangling and dipping, dangling is a leg crossed shoe hanging off the tail, you know.\n\n13:00.440 --> 13:03.440\nSexy secretary librarian or something like, you know.\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:05.440\nAnd is the whole woman in frame or just a leg?\n\n13:05.440 --> 13:11.440\nJust a leg is fine with this old timer.\n\n13:11.440 --> 13:15.440\nWe have a colloquy here.\n\n13:15.440 --> 13:18.440\nHow many other people are into dangling and dipping?\n\n13:18.440 --> 13:20.440\nI dated a shoe fetishist.\n\n13:20.440 --> 13:21.440\nYou dated a shoe fetishist?\n\n13:21.440 --> 13:22.440\nYeah.\n\n13:22.440 --> 13:27.440\nAnd so did you dangling, dipping, popping, the whole speed squad and the flip flap?\n\n13:27.440 --> 13:31.440\nI know the vernacular with it.\n\n13:31.440 --> 13:33.440\nDangling, dipping, heel popping.\n\n13:33.440 --> 13:34.440\nOkay, so what's dipping?\n\n13:34.440 --> 13:35.440\nWhat is dipping?\n\n13:35.440 --> 13:40.440\nDipping is like a shoe on the floor as far as I understand it.\n\n13:40.440 --> 13:41.440\nDo you have my heels on right now?\n\n13:41.440 --> 13:42.440\nYeah.\n\n13:42.440 --> 13:43.440\nCan you dangling and dip for us up there?\n\n13:43.440 --> 13:46.440\nThey're like, let's walk around to the stage.\n\n13:46.440 --> 13:48.440\nWell, it's an audio podcast.\n\n13:48.440 --> 13:53.440\nYeah, but I don't think she's going to be able to dip with those shoes.\n\n13:53.440 --> 13:54.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n13:54.440 --> 13:57.440\nIf you're dipping into the shoe.\n\n13:57.440 --> 14:04.440\nJust imagine like a loose or like a high heel shoe or like a flat or something that had\n\n14:04.440 --> 14:06.440\nlike easy, like you can get your foot in and out of it.\n\n14:06.440 --> 14:10.440\nSo dipping is like the woman is like in and out, you know, like kind of.\n\n14:10.440 --> 14:12.440\nDo you want the shoe?\n\n14:12.440 --> 14:13.440\nI don't.\n\n14:13.440 --> 14:17.440\nIt's an audio podcast and also I'm getting weirdly like.\n\n14:17.440 --> 14:18.440\nYeah.\n\n14:18.440 --> 14:20.440\nThis is making me nervous.\n\n14:20.440 --> 14:21.440\nLauren, right?\n\n14:21.440 --> 14:22.440\nYeah.\n\n14:22.440 --> 14:25.440\nLauren from the front row came up and offered to dip and dangle and dingle and screebscrab.\n\n14:25.440 --> 14:27.440\nI went for the second row.\n\n14:27.440 --> 14:28.440\nI just offered up a shoe.\n\n14:28.440 --> 14:30.440\nI just produced a high heel.\n\n14:30.440 --> 14:34.440\nYeah, we're getting to the city limits of where Eric's not going to be very happy.\n\n14:34.440 --> 14:35.440\nGet the shoe up here.\n\n14:35.440 --> 14:36.440\nFuck it.\n\n14:36.440 --> 14:37.440\nLet's do this.\n\n14:37.440 --> 14:44.440\nI want to know about dangles and dips and scoops and screebs and the whole flim flim.\n\n14:44.440 --> 14:45.440\nWhat's your name, madam?\n\n14:45.440 --> 14:46.440\nAnnie.\n\n14:46.440 --> 14:48.440\nThis is a weird choice for a podcast to make.\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:52.440\nI'm just, I'm worried as a producer, like what are we, what are people listening to?\n\n14:52.440 --> 14:54.440\nWe're bringing women up on stage.\n\n14:54.440 --> 14:57.440\nAnd also just so Aaron knows, I'm not like Howard Sterninger or anything.\n\n14:57.440 --> 15:00.440\nI'm not, I'm not, I'm not even going to look or anything.\n\n15:00.440 --> 15:04.440\nLike Aaron, if you're listening, like I'm not, this is not like, I'm not, I'm not being like\n\n15:04.440 --> 15:06.440\nany Kaufman wrestling with women or anything.\n\n15:06.440 --> 15:11.440\nAaron, if you're listening, Dan has his pants down already.\n\n15:11.440 --> 15:13.440\nThis is very, that's very important to me.\n\n15:13.440 --> 15:16.440\nI wouldn't, I wouldn't tolerate the equivalent with Aaron, you know?\n\n15:16.440 --> 15:17.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n15:17.440 --> 15:19.440\nI was, I was a little upset when she was fucking around with that cat shirt guy.\n\n15:19.440 --> 15:21.440\nWait a minute, the cat shirt guy.\n\n15:21.440 --> 15:23.440\nOkay, fuck it.\n\n15:23.440 --> 15:26.440\nNo, no, no.\n\n15:26.440 --> 15:27.440\nAnyways, okay.\n\n15:27.440 --> 15:28.440\nOkay.\n\n15:28.440 --> 15:29.440\nWhat's your name, ma'am?\n\n15:29.440 --> 15:30.440\nAnnie, Annie.\n\n15:30.440 --> 15:31.440\nAnnie's dangling right now.\n\n15:31.440 --> 15:34.440\nOkay, so I, I, I, I, I, I, she was dangling from her toe.\n\n15:34.440 --> 15:35.440\nThat's a dangle.\n\n15:35.440 --> 15:36.440\nThat's very difficult to do, actually.\n\n15:36.440 --> 15:37.440\nAll right.\n\n15:37.440 --> 15:38.440\nYeah.\n\n15:38.440 --> 15:39.440\nOkay, now, now give us some dipping, Annie.\n\n15:39.440 --> 15:40.440\nOkay, so what's, what's dipping?\n\n15:40.440 --> 15:42.440\nDipping is, you'd have to stand up and then, then you're.\n\n15:42.440 --> 15:46.440\nSay you're, pretend you're checking somebody into a hotel and you're working with a computer\n\n15:46.440 --> 15:51.440\nand you're kind of absent-mindedly like, yeah.\n\n15:51.440 --> 15:53.440\nThat's dipping.\n\n15:53.440 --> 15:54.440\nAll right.\n\n15:54.440 --> 15:58.440\nAlthough, although now I'm wondering what, what heel popping actually is because that,\n\n15:58.440 --> 15:59.440\nthat involves a.\n\n15:59.440 --> 16:02.440\nI thought this was heel popping where it's like where you've got the, like.\n\n16:02.440 --> 16:04.440\nNo, that's, that's Nancy Drew.\n\n16:04.440 --> 16:06.440\nWhere the heel pops out of it.\n\n16:06.440 --> 16:08.440\nI can't do it in these shoes.\n\n16:08.440 --> 16:09.440\nThen how is that different?\n\n16:09.440 --> 16:10.440\nI'm so confused.\n\n16:10.440 --> 16:13.440\nBut it's where your heel sort of pops out.\n\n16:13.440 --> 16:14.440\nOkay.\n\n16:14.440 --> 16:17.440\nSomehow, somehow I'm still not turned on.\n\n16:17.440 --> 16:20.440\nI don't understand.\n\n16:20.440 --> 16:23.440\nNot because you're not beautiful in that, in sexy, in sexy way.\n\n16:23.440 --> 16:25.440\nI don't know why this isn't doing anything for you.\n\n16:25.440 --> 16:27.440\nI've never got the feet thing.\n\n16:27.440 --> 16:28.440\nI mean, I, I like feet.\n\n16:28.440 --> 16:29.440\nI'm not, I'm not averse to feet.\n\n16:29.440 --> 16:31.440\nI've never, I've never seen the allure of.\n\n16:31.440 --> 16:32.440\nOh, I know what heel popping is.\n\n16:32.440 --> 16:33.440\nI just realized.\n\n16:33.440 --> 16:39.440\nIt's, heel popping is the precursor to a dangle because you can't, you can't dangle unless\n\n16:39.440 --> 16:40.440\nyou, unless you pop the heel.\n\n16:40.440 --> 16:44.440\nBut the heel popping enthusiasts just want to see that popping of the heel over and over\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:45.440\nagain.\n\n16:45.440 --> 16:46.440\nI just want to see this moment.\n\n16:46.440 --> 16:47.440\nYeah.\n\n16:47.440 --> 16:48.440\nThat moment there.\n\n16:48.440 --> 16:49.440\nBack on and off and on.\n\n16:49.440 --> 16:52.440\nBut as far as I've been told, once you pop, you can't stop.\n\n16:52.440 --> 16:53.440\nAll right.\n\n16:53.440 --> 16:54.440\nCome on.\n\n16:54.440 --> 16:55.440\nLet's, let's thank these ladies.\n\n16:55.440 --> 16:56.440\nAll right.\n\n16:56.440 --> 16:57.440\nSit the fuck down.\n\n16:57.440 --> 16:58.440\nThank you very much.\n\n16:58.440 --> 16:59.440\nThank you.\n\n16:59.440 --> 17:00.440\nThank you.\n\n17:00.440 --> 17:01.440\nThank you.\n\n17:01.440 --> 17:02.440\nThank you.\n\n17:02.440 --> 17:03.440\nThank you.\n\n17:03.440 --> 17:04.440\nThank you.\n\n17:04.440 --> 17:05.440\nThank you.\n\n17:05.440 --> 17:06.440\nThank you.\n\n17:06.440 --> 17:07.440\nThank you.\n\n17:07.440 --> 17:08.440\nThank you.\n\n17:08.440 --> 17:09.440\nThank you.\n\n17:09.440 --> 17:10.440\nThank you.\n\n17:10.440 --> 17:11.440\nYou want to, you want to welcome us into this world?\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:12.440\nWhat are you doing?\n\n17:12.440 --> 17:14.880\nYou got, you've got people up on stage showing us shoe things.\n\n17:14.880 --> 17:16.380\nOur job is not to care about the listeners.\n\n17:16.380 --> 17:19.020\nIt's our job to reward the live audience, then.\n\n17:19.020 --> 17:20.080\nAll right.\n\n17:20.080 --> 17:21.080\nStart the laser show.\n\n17:21.080 --> 17:22.080\nWhoa.\n\n17:22.080 --> 17:23.080\nToo soon.\n\n17:23.080 --> 17:29.360\nOh, interesting tag on the Jimmy Kimmel situation visually.\n\n17:29.360 --> 17:30.360\nHuh.\n\n17:30.360 --> 17:33.840\nI never thought about that laid out in that diagram.\n\n17:33.840 --> 17:38.080\nOh, that brings it all together again.\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:40.080\nGood night, folks.\n\n17:40.080 --> 17:45.080\nDan, for the listener, describe the Jimmy Kimmel situation for us.\n\n17:45.080 --> 17:48.080\nWell, you're asking as a joke because you think I improvised\n\n17:48.080 --> 17:50.080\nthe words Jimmy Kimmel situation, but there is one.\n\n17:50.080 --> 17:52.080\nThere was one, I don't know.\n\n17:52.080 --> 17:55.080\nI feel like I'm part of the problem saying there was one.\n\n17:55.080 --> 17:58.080\nThere was just the tabloid streak.\n\n17:58.080 --> 18:01.080\nJimmy Kimmel did a segment that was sort of like kids say the darndest things.\n\n18:01.080 --> 18:06.080\nHe was having kids talk about how to handle the various world crises,\n\n18:06.080 --> 18:11.080\none of them being America's trillion-dollar debt to Japan, or to China.\n\n18:11.080 --> 18:18.080\nAnd one of the kids kind of half through a chuckle and little kid flustery thing said,\n\n18:18.080 --> 18:21.080\nlike, I don't know, maybe we should kill all the people in China.\n\n18:21.080 --> 18:24.080\nAnd Jimmy was like, ah, that's an interesting answer.\n\n18:24.080 --> 18:26.080\nI don't know, moving on.\n\n18:26.080 --> 18:31.080\nFlash cut two headlines saying, like, you know,\n\n18:31.080 --> 18:38.080\nWhite House apologizes to China for the, you know, genocide jokes on the thing.\n\n18:38.080 --> 18:42.080\nAsian Americans in comment section saying, ah, that's a funny joke.\n\n18:42.080 --> 18:44.080\nHow about this one? Let's kill all the Jews.\n\n18:44.080 --> 18:49.080\nNo comment on any of this. I'm out.\n\n18:49.080 --> 18:54.080\nAll I can say is I don't care what you find funny.\n\n18:54.080 --> 18:56.080\nI don't care what any of us think are funny.\n\n18:56.080 --> 19:00.080\nI don't care about the empirical definitions of humor, but I just got one question.\n\n19:00.080 --> 19:02.080\nAre we going to be fucking cone heads?\n\n19:02.080 --> 19:04.080\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n19:04.080 --> 19:07.080\nWhat is this world going to look like in 2070?\n\n19:07.080 --> 19:13.080\nDo we really think we're going to achieve some world where everyone just kind of quietly glides around\n\n19:13.080 --> 19:17.080\nand someone, like, emits a proton and it's the equivalent of a fart?\n\n19:17.080 --> 19:19.080\nAnd everyone, like, titters?\n\n19:19.080 --> 19:24.080\nDo you really think that once a noose starts tightening, it ever gets loose?\n\n19:24.080 --> 19:26.080\nLinguistically, verbally, socially?\n\n19:26.080 --> 19:33.080\nDo you really have you ever experienced anything that indicated to you that once people started introducing the concept of limitation,\n\n19:33.080 --> 19:35.080\nanything ever got more liberated?\n\n19:35.080 --> 19:41.080\nI know we all think that we are advanced because they didn't have the Seinfeld masturbation episode in Victorian England,\n\n19:41.080 --> 19:45.080\nbut there's another way of looking at this.\n\n19:45.080 --> 19:48.080\nWe are becoming insects.\n\n19:48.080 --> 19:53.080\nWe are envying everything that ants have and not embracing anything that primates have.\n\n19:53.080 --> 20:00.080\nAnd we are just looking so forward to the day when we have a hive mind and we just barf trophallaxis into each other's mouths\n\n20:00.080 --> 20:03.080\nand that you can tell from the chemical where you've been and where you're going.\n\n20:03.080 --> 20:05.080\nAnd we just love it. We can't wait.\n\n20:05.080 --> 20:08.080\nWe're just sanding down the little bumps and edges.\n\n20:08.080 --> 20:11.080\nWe're just taking so much glee in it, too. That's the weird thing.\n\n20:11.080 --> 20:17.080\nThere's a primatological glee taking a gazelle femur and smashing a racist joke's head.\n\n20:17.080 --> 20:19.080\nThat's a racist joke. A racist.\n\n20:19.080 --> 20:24.080\nAnd it's like you're emitting a pheromone.\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:31.080\nYou're getting flushed and excited by bashing the world around you,\n\n20:31.080 --> 20:38.080\ntrying to round up all the little anomalies and get all the air bubbles out of the waterbed mattress.\n\n20:38.080 --> 20:44.080\nThis finish line that you think you're headed towards, I feel like I can see it at 40.\n\n20:44.080 --> 20:47.080\nI feel like I know it's not going to be that fun.\n\n20:47.080 --> 20:53.080\nYeah, we're very willfully and kind of gleefully sacrificing liberty for security.\n\n20:53.080 --> 20:55.080\nWe're not getting any smarter. That's the thing.\n\n20:55.080 --> 21:00.080\nNone of these people that are learning how to be offended know where Guatemala is on a map.\n\n21:00.080 --> 21:05.080\nBut the thing is, someone's going to go online after the show when they hear this\n\n21:05.080 --> 21:08.080\nand go on a forum and say, we are getting smarter, man.\n\n21:08.080 --> 21:12.080\nLife is evolution, Jack. Everything is getting better.\n\n21:12.080 --> 21:18.080\nI was saying that the English language, and I would say all languages are probably degrading\n\n21:18.080 --> 21:21.080\nbecause we're all truncating language, and people say, no, it's not.\n\n21:21.080 --> 21:24.080\nLanguage is always evolving. I fucking disagree with that.\n\n21:24.080 --> 21:29.080\nI think that language, the English language is a huge language, and we don't use any of the words.\n\n21:29.080 --> 21:36.080\nInstead of having five words that mean one thing, we now use one word to mean 11 things.\n\n21:36.080 --> 21:40.080\nThat's not the growth of the language. That is the shrinking of the language.\n\n21:40.080 --> 21:43.080\nAnd if anyone wants to go online with me and have a conversation about that, I'd love to.\n\n21:43.080 --> 21:48.080\nI don't think that we're evolving at all with technology.\n\n21:48.080 --> 21:54.080\nIt's not just me being grumpy, old man. I really do think that the language dies every time.\n\n21:54.080 --> 21:58.080\nPeople say, oh, what's the fucking word that people use?\n\n21:58.080 --> 21:59.080\nAwesome sauce.\n\n21:59.080 --> 22:01.080\nAwesome sauce. Amazeballs.\n\n22:01.080 --> 22:02.080\nAmazeballs?\n\n22:02.080 --> 22:04.080\nNo, I will stand by amazeballs because that's...\n\n22:04.080 --> 22:07.080\nAmazeballs is a new way to save it.\n\n22:07.080 --> 22:13.080\nThere's something like 180 synonyms for the word nice, and we use nice for 180 of them,\n\n22:13.080 --> 22:16.080\nbecause we don't know all the fucking words anymore.\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:20.080\nOh, what's that? He was...\n\n22:20.080 --> 22:22.080\nWhat's that? Not chastity. What's the fucking word?\n\n22:22.080 --> 22:23.080\nRedicent.\n\n22:23.080 --> 22:26.080\nRedicent. I was redicent to do that.\n\n22:26.080 --> 22:29.080\nNo, you were reluctant to do that. Redicent doesn't mean reluctant.\n\n22:29.080 --> 22:34.080\nNow it does. We've made redicent mean reluctant because we've misused it for so long,\n\n22:34.080 --> 22:38.080\nthat the dictionaries have just said, fuck it. Now it means reluctant.\n\n22:38.080 --> 22:42.080\nAnd that's not the growth of a language. That's a language dying a little bit\n\n22:42.080 --> 22:46.080\nbecause redicent is a better word than...\n\n22:46.080 --> 22:48.080\nWe don't need two words to say reluctant.\n\n22:48.080 --> 22:51.080\nI love this great show. We went from Uncle Creepy's foot fetish corner\n\n22:51.080 --> 22:56.080\nto grandpa Grumpy's vocabulary police.\n\n22:56.080 --> 22:58.080\nFucking...\n\n22:58.080 --> 23:01.080\nAlso, the dictionary in your iPhone sucks.\n\n23:01.080 --> 23:02.080\nDon't use that dictionary.\n\n23:02.080 --> 23:05.080\nHave a fucking real Miriam Webster, giant OED.\n\n23:05.080 --> 23:09.080\nHave a big motherfucking dictionary with you at all times and use it.\n\n23:09.080 --> 23:14.080\nThe iPhone dictionary is as good as fucking Google Weather.\n\n23:14.080 --> 23:17.080\nGoogle Weather says it's 73. It's fucking 45 now.\n\n23:17.080 --> 23:20.080\nThey don't know. Don't trust your iPhone for fuck...\n\n23:20.080 --> 23:22.080\nAlthough today I was experimenting with Siri,\n\n23:22.080 --> 23:25.080\nand she's quite funny if you say dirty things to her.\n\n23:25.080 --> 23:28.080\nOh yeah, you can have a good time in bed just hanging out.\n\n23:28.080 --> 23:35.080\nAaron and I, we talked to Siri and get Siri to talk to the other Siri.\n\n23:35.080 --> 23:38.080\nI'll say to Siri, why don't you go fuck yourself,\n\n23:38.080 --> 23:41.080\nand then she'll turn on her Siri and then Siri's response,\n\n23:41.080 --> 23:44.080\nwhich will be something like, oh, I think you should watch your language,\n\n23:44.080 --> 23:46.080\nand then Siri will say to Siri,\n\n23:46.080 --> 23:49.080\nI'm sorry, would you like me to look that up on the internet?\n\n23:49.080 --> 23:53.080\nHow do you like it, bitch?\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:56.080\nI blush if I could.\n\n23:56.080 --> 23:59.080\nI turned mine on in Italian. Have you tried the Italian lady?\n\n23:59.080 --> 24:00.080\nNo.\n\n24:00.080 --> 24:03.080\nTalk to her.\n\n24:03.080 --> 24:05.080\nThere's my fetish.\n\n24:05.080 --> 24:09.080\nSiri, dove il ristorante.\n\n24:09.080 --> 24:14.080\nIt's fucking good.\n\n24:14.080 --> 24:16.080\nIt's very sexy.\n\n24:16.080 --> 24:18.080\nAll right, we have a guest here.\n\n24:18.080 --> 24:21.080\nDid you know that Feral Audio is a whole network, Jeff?\n\n24:21.080 --> 24:23.080\nYou gotta be shitting me.\n\n24:23.080 --> 24:25.080\nI thought we were the only thing on Feral Audio.\n\n24:25.080 --> 24:26.080\nNo, no.\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:29.080\nWe're part of a fucking union of brothers and sisters.\n\n24:29.080 --> 24:31.080\nWell, that sounds like bullshit.\n\n24:31.080 --> 24:37.080\nWho represent the cutting edge of unpaid comedy types.\n\n24:37.080 --> 24:42.080\nAnd here's another member of our family, Mr. Brody Stevens.\n\n24:42.080 --> 24:44.080\nYeah!\n\n24:44.080 --> 25:06.080\nYou know, thank you for having me here, Dan and Jeffrey.\n\n25:06.080 --> 25:08.080\nI am wearing a hat.\n\n25:08.080 --> 25:11.080\nI just flew in from Toronto,\n\n25:11.080 --> 25:14.080\nand I was able to wear kind of a knit cap thing.\n\n25:14.080 --> 25:15.080\nIt was cold there.\n\n25:15.080 --> 25:16.080\nYeah.\n\n25:16.080 --> 25:21.080\nSo I was bringing the energy of Toronto with me here to Meltdown.\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:23.080\nWhat's the Toronto scene like?\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:25.080\nIs it like a Seattle in the north?\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:28.080\nYou know, you would think so.\n\n25:28.080 --> 25:29.080\nFrom the hat.\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:30.080\nI mean, well, there you go.\n\n25:30.080 --> 25:31.080\nWell, it was cold.\n\n25:31.080 --> 25:34.080\nI mean, I would say it's like more...\n\n25:34.080 --> 25:35.080\nI mean, it's like Buffalo.\n\n25:35.080 --> 25:36.080\nObviously, it's near.\n\n25:36.080 --> 25:37.080\nIt's near.\n\n25:37.080 --> 25:39.080\nThey share the Niagara Falls.\n\n25:39.080 --> 25:40.080\nI learned about that.\n\n25:40.080 --> 25:43.080\nI've been to Vancouver, but I've been to Toronto a couple of times.\n\n25:43.080 --> 25:45.080\nIt's like America, you know?\n\n25:45.080 --> 25:50.080\nI was doing shows last night, and I think they are...\n\n25:50.080 --> 25:52.080\nIt's just a little...\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:54.080\nIt's a little different up there.\n\n25:54.080 --> 25:57.080\nYou know, it's like, it is America,\n\n25:57.080 --> 26:01.080\nbut it's not right there.\n\n26:01.080 --> 26:04.080\nI like Canadian comedy audiences.\n\n26:04.080 --> 26:06.080\nI think Canadians have an awesome sense of humor.\n\n26:06.080 --> 26:09.080\nI think they're quite game, especially...\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:11.080\nI'm not ripping Canada.\n\n26:11.080 --> 26:13.080\nBrody, you were fucking shitting all over Canada.\n\n26:13.080 --> 26:15.080\nLet's be honest about...\n\n26:15.080 --> 26:20.080\nLast night, I was doing a show in an underground pot club.\n\n26:20.080 --> 26:21.080\nWhat?\n\n26:21.080 --> 26:22.080\nIt's a comedy club.\n\n26:22.080 --> 26:26.080\nThere's like six clubs up there where they smoke pot.\n\n26:26.080 --> 26:27.080\nThey do shows.\n\n26:27.080 --> 26:29.080\nUnderground meaning not legitimate?\n\n26:29.080 --> 26:30.080\nLike secret?\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:33.080\nKind of, yeah, but the cops let it go,\n\n26:33.080 --> 26:36.080\nbut they have a big comedy scene up there for that in Toronto.\n\n26:36.080 --> 26:40.080\nSo I was doing a show last night, and they're smoking pot in there,\n\n26:40.080 --> 26:42.080\nand I've done shows where they smoke pot at the ice house.\n\n26:42.080 --> 26:44.080\nI've been there.\n\n26:44.080 --> 26:47.080\nI know we're a podcast live audience.\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:49.080\nI'm going to focus more on the podcast.\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:50.080\nOh, good.\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:51.080\nThat's my thing.\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:53.080\nWell, I think they were left out of their foot fetish stuff.\n\n26:53.080 --> 26:54.080\nOh, okay.\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:55.080\nI don't really have a foot fetish.\n\n26:55.080 --> 27:01.080\nI mean, I have one time I did something with a sock, I think, one time,\n\n27:01.080 --> 27:02.080\na girl's sock.\n\n27:02.080 --> 27:07.080\nI don't know, the foot, and the tree, and the tree of foot fetishes,\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:12.080\nlike, because I'm a heavy duty leg man, and kind of, and like a nylon guy,\n\n27:12.080 --> 27:16.080\nand because the leg terminates at this beautiful part of the,\n\n27:16.080 --> 27:18.080\nthe equally feminine part of the feminine leg.\n\n27:18.080 --> 27:22.080\nYou love legs, and you love terminus.\n\n27:22.080 --> 27:26.080\nBut there's a, then there's a branch of the whole,\n\n27:26.080 --> 27:29.080\nlike the foot, when you say foot fetish, it gets into like,\n\n27:29.080 --> 27:33.080\nI want someone to walk in chocolate, and then walk on my face,\n\n27:33.080 --> 27:38.080\nand masturbate me with their toes, and I'm going to eat the toes,\n\n27:38.080 --> 27:40.080\nand you put the other toe in the butt and stuff.\n\n27:40.080 --> 27:44.080\nAnd I'm not that focused on the foot.\n\n27:44.080 --> 27:47.080\nIt's just like the foot is a beautiful little period on the sentence\n\n27:47.080 --> 27:49.080\nthat is a woman's leg.\n\n27:49.080 --> 27:53.080\nI got called out for looking at a girl's foot in ninth grade.\n\n27:53.080 --> 27:54.080\nI remember it vividly.\n\n27:54.080 --> 27:56.080\nI grew up here in the valley, San Fernando Valley,\n\n27:56.080 --> 27:59.080\nand she was like, you know, in 80s.\n\n27:59.080 --> 28:02.080\nI'm not going to say like a stoner's chick, but she smoked cigarettes,\n\n28:02.080 --> 28:04.080\nand I remember I was like looking at her feet.\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:06.080\nShe was like, why are you looking at my feet?\n\n28:06.080 --> 28:08.080\nAnd I was just like, just into it.\n\n28:08.080 --> 28:12.080\nI was really, I don't think I need the dipped in chocolate.\n\n28:12.080 --> 28:14.080\nI like looking at them.\n\n28:14.080 --> 28:16.080\nI would do what you said with the feet on the penis.\n\n28:16.080 --> 28:18.080\nI'm okay with that.\n\n28:18.080 --> 28:21.080\nWhen I was in high school, like late high school and early college,\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:23.080\nmy friend Chris, he would have these parties,\n\n28:23.080 --> 28:26.080\nand his father was a sheriff.\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:28.080\nAnd they were awesome because they were,\n\n28:28.080 --> 28:31.080\nwe went into the parents' room one time,\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:33.080\nand there was tons of bondage gear,\n\n28:33.080 --> 28:37.080\nlike lots of fucking chains and whips and strap-ons\n\n28:37.080 --> 28:40.080\nand all kinds of good, like get it on kind of shit.\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:43.080\nBetween, you know, like late 40s husband and wife,\n\n28:43.080 --> 28:46.080\nthey didn't care that we would have these parties\n\n28:46.080 --> 28:48.080\nand everybody would get naked in their jacuzzi\n\n28:48.080 --> 28:50.080\nand everybody would suck each other's toes.\n\n28:50.080 --> 28:53.080\nShrimp jobs, shrimpin'?\n\n28:53.080 --> 28:55.080\nShrimp, shrimp, shrimp jobs.\n\n28:55.080 --> 28:57.080\nWe called it shrimp jobs.\n\n28:57.080 --> 29:01.080\nWhich made the unsexy even less sexy.\n\n29:01.080 --> 29:03.080\nBut we would all suck each other's toes,\n\n29:03.080 --> 29:04.080\nand it was good fun.\n\n29:04.080 --> 29:06.080\nBecause in the jacuzzi,\n\n29:06.080 --> 29:09.080\nyou're all boiled up, you know.\n\n29:09.080 --> 29:12.080\nAll the pathogens have been sucked up.\n\n29:12.080 --> 29:14.080\nIf you're gonna suck a toe, you should,\n\n29:14.080 --> 29:16.080\nthat would be the spot to do it.\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:19.080\nA pool of hot water would be a good place to get started,\n\n29:19.080 --> 29:20.080\nI think.\n\n29:20.080 --> 29:23.080\nWhen you're looking at feats on the internet,\n\n29:23.080 --> 29:25.080\nlike what is the...\n\n29:25.080 --> 29:27.080\nWhat's going on through your mind?\n\n29:27.080 --> 29:29.080\nWhat's the fantasy that's happening?\n\n29:29.080 --> 29:33.080\nYou know, I'm looking and I just like,\n\n29:33.080 --> 29:34.080\nit doesn't go beyond that.\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:37.080\nA fetish is like, it's like the object itself\n\n29:37.080 --> 29:39.080\nis like this thing that's more important than anything\n\n29:39.080 --> 29:41.080\nand it's a really interesting question\n\n29:41.080 --> 29:44.080\nbecause I think that's part of what makes me,\n\n29:44.080 --> 29:47.080\nyou know, potentially asexual sometimes.\n\n29:47.080 --> 29:49.080\nMy behavior.\n\n29:49.080 --> 29:52.080\nLike if I'm working and I'm too busy\n\n29:52.080 --> 29:53.080\nand then I'm so, I'm like,\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:55.080\nokay, I'm gonna gratify myself\n\n29:55.080 --> 29:57.080\nbecause, you know,\n\n29:57.080 --> 29:59.080\nwell, a nice excuse is,\n\n29:59.080 --> 30:02.080\nhey, who wants to get prostate cancer?\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:04.080\nYou gotta come constantly, right?\n\n30:04.080 --> 30:06.080\nThat's true.\n\n30:06.080 --> 30:08.080\nIs that true?\n\n30:08.080 --> 30:10.080\nYeah, they got Ernest Borgnine.\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:12.080\nI think he recently passed maybe,\n\n30:12.080 --> 30:14.080\nbut he was like 95, he was on Kona\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:18.080\nand he said he masturbated like all the time every day\n\n30:18.080 --> 30:21.080\nand that's what led him to be happy and live that long.\n\n30:21.080 --> 30:23.080\nYou guys remember that a couple years ago?\n\n30:23.080 --> 30:24.080\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n30:24.080 --> 30:25.080\nYou guys?\n\n30:25.080 --> 30:26.080\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n30:26.080 --> 30:27.080\nWe're all gonna live forever then.\n\n30:27.080 --> 30:29.080\nLast night in Toronto, they wouldn't have agreed,\n\n30:29.080 --> 30:31.080\nthey would have just left me out there hanging.\n\n30:31.080 --> 30:33.080\nCanadian audiences are a little more laid back.\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:34.080\nYeah.\n\n30:34.080 --> 30:35.080\nThey're not responsive.\n\n30:35.080 --> 30:36.080\nWell, they were also super high.\n\n30:36.080 --> 30:38.080\nIt was an apartment.\n\n30:38.080 --> 30:41.080\nAlso, in Toronto, they have the street meat.\n\n30:41.080 --> 30:44.080\nThey have those fucking carts with the hot dogs and stuff\n\n30:44.080 --> 30:45.080\nand it's quite good.\n\n30:45.080 --> 30:47.080\nOh yeah, I had Schwarma last night\n\n30:47.080 --> 30:49.080\nand I love Zanku.\n\n30:49.080 --> 30:50.080\nIt's right up the street.\n\n30:50.080 --> 30:51.080\nI go there all the time.\n\n30:51.080 --> 30:53.080\nI'm a proud member of the Zanku Army.\n\n30:53.080 --> 30:55.080\nBut I went to a place,\n\n30:55.080 --> 30:59.080\nI mean, it said it was a falafel king.\n\n30:59.080 --> 31:02.080\nIt looked like a chain thing, but it wasn't\n\n31:02.080 --> 31:04.080\nand I went in there and they were just very nice\n\n31:04.080 --> 31:09.080\nand I had a chicken tiki marsala or something like that.\n\n31:09.080 --> 31:12.080\nIt was good.\n\n31:12.080 --> 31:15.080\nI said it was better than Zanku\n\n31:15.080 --> 31:17.080\nand I hate to say that.\n\n31:17.080 --> 31:20.080\nSo Toronto is multicultural.\n\n31:20.080 --> 31:21.080\nIt's great.\n\n31:21.080 --> 31:22.080\nPeople get along.\n\n31:22.080 --> 31:23.080\nI grew up here in Los Angeles.\n\n31:23.080 --> 31:25.080\nPeople don't get along.\n\n31:25.080 --> 31:26.080\nI lived in New York.\n\n31:26.080 --> 31:28.080\nPeople actually get along in New York.\n\n31:28.080 --> 31:29.080\nYou have to.\n\n31:29.080 --> 31:30.080\nYou're together.\n\n31:30.080 --> 31:32.080\nI grew up here.\n\n31:32.080 --> 31:33.080\nValley, busing.\n\n31:33.080 --> 31:34.080\nI've been all around.\n\n31:34.080 --> 31:39.080\nAnd you were talking about, you know, asexuality\n\n31:39.080 --> 31:40.080\nand things of that.\n\n31:40.080 --> 31:45.080\nIf you do listen to my podcast, maybe nine months ago,\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:49.080\nI did come out on my podcast.\n\n31:49.080 --> 31:53.080\nI am 10% gay.\n\n31:53.080 --> 31:55.080\nAnd 52%.\n\n31:55.080 --> 31:56.080\nThank you.\n\n31:56.080 --> 32:00.080\nI mean, I went to Bangkok and I pushed it to the limit.\n\n32:00.080 --> 32:03.080\nYou were talking about strap-ons and Adam's apples.\n\n32:03.080 --> 32:08.080\nI got pulled into the night of Bangkok and I went there.\n\n32:08.080 --> 32:10.080\nWell, let's be more specific, Brody.\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:11.080\nI can't be too.\n\n32:11.080 --> 32:12.080\nWell, you know what?\n\n32:12.080 --> 32:16.080\nI think the more I talk about it, the more comfortable I'll get with it\n\n32:16.080 --> 32:20.080\nand I can really chisel down that story for my one lady boy.\n\n32:20.080 --> 32:22.080\nI mean, my one-man show.\n\n32:22.080 --> 32:26.080\nWait, you had a lady boy encounter in Bangkok?\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:27.080\nYou know what?\n\n32:27.080 --> 32:28.080\nYeah.\n\n32:28.080 --> 32:29.080\nI'm going to own up to it.\n\n32:29.080 --> 32:30.080\nYes.\n\n32:30.080 --> 32:31.080\nGood for you.\n\n32:31.080 --> 32:32.080\nThree people applauding me.\n\n32:32.080 --> 32:34.080\nEveryone else, gay bad.\n\n32:34.080 --> 32:36.080\n10% gay bashing.\n\n32:36.080 --> 32:41.080\nBut I only call the Bangkok experience because we all go there.\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:45.080\nIf you ask, that is almost accepted over there.\n\n32:45.080 --> 32:47.080\nSo I count that.\n\n32:47.080 --> 32:48.080\nIt's like a 4%.\n\n32:48.080 --> 32:51.080\nNow, did you go out in search of a lady boy experience\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:54.080\nor did the lady boy find you by accident?\n\n32:54.080 --> 32:56.080\nWell, you go, you hang out.\n\n32:56.080 --> 33:01.080\nI was over there working on a project and you hang out and you go.\n\n33:01.080 --> 33:05.080\nIt's a very, you know, it's just, it's a nice culture.\n\n33:05.080 --> 33:11.080\nThey're very outgoing, massage and haircut late at night, all that stuff.\n\n33:11.080 --> 33:13.080\nLike, it's a good vibe.\n\n33:13.080 --> 33:15.080\nSo you go to these clubs.\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:19.080\nI could go for a late night haircut.\n\n33:19.080 --> 33:23.080\nAnd then a hand job from a guy named Kim.\n\n33:23.080 --> 33:24.080\nNo.\n\n33:24.080 --> 33:25.080\nOh, it's funny.\n\n33:25.080 --> 33:29.080\nYou know, funny you should, I'll tell you about that off camera.\n\n33:29.080 --> 33:31.080\nI should say Kim, but I'll get back to that.\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:32.080\nWhy is that?\n\n33:32.080 --> 33:37.080\nWell, I, it's a code word for something that I know.\n\n33:37.080 --> 33:39.080\nI'll tell you off camera.\n\n33:39.080 --> 33:40.080\nOff mic.\n\n33:40.080 --> 33:43.080\nLook, if you're coming onto me, just fucking get it out.\n\n33:43.080 --> 33:45.080\nNo, I'm not, I know I'm not gay like that.\n\n33:45.080 --> 33:47.080\nSee, see, it's not that way.\n\n33:47.080 --> 33:50.080\nThey're talking about, do I see a guy like whoever you're talking about,\n\n33:50.080 --> 33:53.080\nlike, oh, he's got great legs and great chest.\n\n33:53.080 --> 33:58.080\nAnd I want to, I want to kiss his, his thick, his beard.\n\n33:58.080 --> 34:00.080\nNo, I'm not into that.\n\n34:00.080 --> 34:01.080\nAll right.\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:03.080\nSo that's not what a lady boy is.\n\n34:03.080 --> 34:04.080\nThank you.\n\n34:04.080 --> 34:06.080\nBecause they take hormones.\n\n34:06.080 --> 34:11.080\nNow, so I went over there to see.\n\n34:11.080 --> 34:12.080\nAll right.\n\n34:12.080 --> 34:15.080\nAnd I, and I, I walk around, I see my mannerisms.\n\n34:15.080 --> 34:17.080\nYou know, I got picked on a lot because I was a nice guy,\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:20.080\nlike I'm a happy guy and kids are cruel.\n\n34:20.080 --> 34:22.080\nAnd I grew up here in the valley, a Jewish kid.\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:24.080\nI should have been sheltered by the Hebrew school.\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:26.080\nYou sound like you're from Chicago.\n\n34:26.080 --> 34:27.080\nHow'd you get that?\n\n34:27.080 --> 34:29.080\nWell, I was in Toronto over the weekend.\n\n34:29.080 --> 34:32.080\nI think that Chicago, I think the Chicago jet stream.\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:34.080\nYou don't, you don't sound like you were raised in California.\n\n34:34.080 --> 34:35.080\nI know.\n\n34:35.080 --> 34:36.080\nI've heard that a lot.\n\n34:36.080 --> 34:37.080\nI grew up in the valley.\n\n34:37.080 --> 34:40.080\nI think as I'm kind of nasally, I always would get New York.\n\n34:40.080 --> 34:41.080\nNew York City.\n\n34:41.080 --> 34:43.080\nI lived in Brooklyn for three years.\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:45.080\nWilliamsburg, L train before it got hip.\n\n34:45.080 --> 34:49.080\nI was there three years in Seattle.\n\n34:49.080 --> 34:50.080\nOkay.\n\n34:50.080 --> 34:51.080\nSorry, Jeff.\n\n34:51.080 --> 34:52.080\nSo you're fucking this lady boy.\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:55.080\nI'm the one, you know what?\n\n34:55.080 --> 34:59.080\nI'll tell you what, if I did that, that ain't so bad.\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:00.080\nThat ain't so bad.\n\n35:00.080 --> 35:02.080\nI watched locked up raw.\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:03.080\nIt ain't that bad.\n\n35:03.080 --> 35:06.080\nNobody in Harmontown is going to judge you.\n\n35:06.080 --> 35:07.080\nYeah.\n\n35:07.080 --> 35:08.080\nWell, I feel like first three.\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:09.080\nThose are what?\n\n35:09.080 --> 35:10.080\nNo, no, no.\n\n35:10.080 --> 35:14.080\nBut you know hard that it, I mean, it, it's, I'm okay with it.\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:18.080\nAnd then I'll tell you what, I came back to the mainland.\n\n35:18.080 --> 35:24.080\nAnd I went a little further just to see, just to see that line\n\n35:24.080 --> 35:26.080\nand maybe go over it.\n\n35:26.080 --> 35:28.080\nWhat, what, what did that entail?\n\n35:28.080 --> 35:32.080\nUh, there was a hotel in Hollywood and, um, free shout.\n\n35:32.080 --> 35:33.080\nDoesn't it people?\n\n35:33.080 --> 35:34.080\nNo.\n\n35:34.080 --> 35:35.080\nFree shout.\n\n35:35.080 --> 35:36.080\nBrody, nobody.\n\n35:36.080 --> 35:38.080\nThis is why people stay in the closet.\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:39.080\nBrody.\n\n35:39.080 --> 35:40.080\nI'm only, I'm 10% gay.\n\n35:40.080 --> 35:41.080\nBrody.\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:42.080\nIt's scary.\n\n35:42.080 --> 35:44.080\nBrody, you're, you're, you're 50% gay.\n\n35:44.080 --> 35:45.080\nNo, I'm not, Jeff.\n\n35:45.080 --> 35:46.080\nHow dare you?\n\n35:46.080 --> 35:47.080\nBrody.\n\n35:47.080 --> 35:52.080\nThese, this audience is so, it's so, it's so accustomed to hearing so much worse and\n\n35:52.080 --> 35:53.080\nso much more bizarre.\n\n35:53.080 --> 35:54.080\nWell, thank you.\n\n35:54.080 --> 35:56.080\nWell, you know, I'm, I played baseball.\n\n35:56.080 --> 35:57.080\nI just feel like it's going to come back.\n\n35:57.080 --> 35:58.080\nIt's okay to be gay.\n\n35:58.080 --> 35:59.080\nIt's okay to be gay, Brody.\n\n35:59.080 --> 36:03.080\nI'm, I'm saying it's okay, but I'm, I told you, I'm not into hand holding.\n\n36:03.080 --> 36:11.080\nI, uh, I am into, I'm into human love.\n\n36:11.080 --> 36:12.080\nThat's good.\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:14.080\nSo what happened to the hotel?\n\n36:14.080 --> 36:22.080\nYou know, well, Kim, excuse me, um, Kim, AK, I can't give the name away, but you know\n\n36:22.080 --> 36:23.080\nwhat?\n\n36:23.080 --> 36:27.080\nI'll tell you what, the TS community, I'm, I'm very active in the TS community.\n\n36:27.080 --> 36:28.080\nWhat's TS?\n\n36:28.080 --> 36:29.080\nTranssexual.\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:30.080\nOh.\n\n36:30.080 --> 36:34.080\nAnd, um, when you say act, when you say active in the community, what do you mean?\n\n36:34.080 --> 36:39.880\nI just like, I just like saying that, um, because you know what, it's very popular.\n\n36:39.880 --> 36:45.520\nIf you were to go, uh, back in the day, my friends ran, uh, taboo video up in Seattle,\n\n36:45.520 --> 36:49.760\nwhich was the number one, uh, grossing adult video store in Seattle.\n\n36:49.760 --> 36:55.440\nJust right before DVDs started coming out and the number one, and probably to this day,\n\n36:55.440 --> 36:59.920\nif you ask the guys, you still make it the number one, it's, it's, it's TS stuff.\n\n36:59.920 --> 37:02.280\nThat's the number one thing for whatever reason.\n\n37:02.280 --> 37:04.480\nDoes that mean like chicks with dicks?\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:05.480\nIs that?\n\n37:05.480 --> 37:06.480\nYeah.\n\n37:06.480 --> 37:09.760\nThat's what it is because you see a, you see a breast and you're into that and you're\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:12.520\ninto this face and the hair, they look good.\n\n37:12.520 --> 37:15.800\nThey're, they're like, there's no problems.\n\n37:15.800 --> 37:17.040\nAnd then you go, isn't it girl?\n\n37:17.040 --> 37:18.040\nI don't know.\n\n37:18.040 --> 37:19.040\nI'm in Bangkok.\n\n37:19.040 --> 37:21.280\nIt's something got shaved down.\n\n37:21.280 --> 37:27.840\nUh, is this, you got to like, it's the sixties all over again, just, and you got, it's rock\n\n37:27.840 --> 37:28.840\nand roll.\n\n37:28.840 --> 37:29.840\nI'm a comedian.\n\n37:29.840 --> 37:35.280\nI felt like I had to kind of do that to share that story with you as a, as a guy who wants\n\n37:35.280 --> 37:37.040\nto move on and don't.\n\n37:37.040 --> 37:38.040\nDon't bring us into it.\n\n37:38.040 --> 37:39.040\nIt was.\n\n37:39.040 --> 37:40.040\nOh yeah.\n\n37:40.040 --> 37:46.040\nI mean, I, no, it's like, you, you're, you're following some sort of, uh, like trail.\n\n37:46.040 --> 37:47.840\nLike you're, you're certainly going down some sort of road.\n\n37:47.840 --> 37:51.720\nI think that as you age and as you, like, as you progress, like your fetishes do kind\n\n37:51.720 --> 37:56.200\nof start meandering towards like, like more specific things, like, wouldn't you say?\n\n37:56.200 --> 37:57.200\nYeah.\n\n37:57.200 --> 38:02.600\nI mean, but today I was in Starbucks and I was sitting there and I, I mean, I saw a girl\n\n38:02.600 --> 38:08.400\nlike with a nice, uh, butt and I just wanted to put my face in it and I confirmed to me\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:09.400\nright there.\n\n38:09.400 --> 38:13.480\nI'm not who, what gay guy wants to put his face in a girl's butt.\n\n38:13.480 --> 38:14.480\nI did.\n\n38:14.480 --> 38:15.480\nThat just confirmed him.\n\n38:15.480 --> 38:16.480\nThere's my 90%.\n\n38:16.480 --> 38:18.400\nWe didn't say that you were gay.\n\n38:18.400 --> 38:19.400\nI am 10%.\n\n38:19.400 --> 38:20.400\nI will stick with that.\n\n38:20.400 --> 38:21.400\nI'm going to put it at 48.\n\n38:21.400 --> 38:22.400\nAre you?\n\n38:22.400 --> 38:23.400\nI mean, 48.\n\n38:23.400 --> 38:24.400\n48.\n\n38:24.400 --> 38:25.400\nIs this a new segment?\n\n38:25.400 --> 38:29.360\nIt's like, like, like guessing someone's weight, like you're going to, are you going\n\n38:29.360 --> 38:34.600\nto work in a carnival and just dance with dance only at 22?\n\n38:34.600 --> 38:35.600\nOkay.\n\n38:35.600 --> 38:41.040\nI mean, the percentage thing is, is it raises interesting questions because how do you go\n\n38:41.040 --> 38:45.800\nbecause like it all has to do with the amount of repression in the, in the society that\n\n38:45.800 --> 38:47.200\nyou're in the context of?\n\n38:47.200 --> 38:55.320\nBecause if you're in a society that for instance views sexual preference as a binary dichotomy,\n\n38:55.320 --> 39:01.120\nthen that puts a lot of significance on whether, and the difference between 49 and 50%.\n\n39:01.120 --> 39:05.240\nBecause that, I, I, I'm assuming just being sort of a computer programmer of old.\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:09.240\nLike, like, like, like there's a, but, but if you're living in a genuinely, if you're\n\n39:09.240 --> 39:12.560\nliving in an open field after some kind of nuclear holocaust and everyone's just running\n\n39:12.560 --> 39:18.200\naround in deerskin togas and, and using bottle caps for money and, and there's no more, like,\n\n39:18.200 --> 39:22.280\nlike, you know, there's no more magazine covers or search billboards to, to kind of drive\n\n39:22.280 --> 39:26.480\nhome anything, then, then the difference between 20% and 30% is what?\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:27.960\nI mean, we don't even, yeah.\n\n39:27.960 --> 39:28.960\nI will definitely agree.\n\n39:28.960 --> 39:33.200\nLike what in the world would be, what would be the meaning of 100% heterosexual?\n\n39:33.200 --> 39:37.800\nI think so, whatever that would manifest itself as would certainly appear, I would, I would\n\n39:37.800 --> 39:41.000\nimagine to be less straight than what we consider straight.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:45.600\nI mean, we don't, we don't want, nobody likes anybody that's, that's overtly masculine\n\n39:45.600 --> 39:47.880\nor we don't like people that are overtly feminine.\n\n39:47.880 --> 39:51.800\nWe don't like a, she's like, she's being such a, like a girl right now or a guy who's\n\n39:51.800 --> 39:52.800\nbeing such a guy.\n\n39:52.800 --> 39:57.800\nI'm a damn fucking dude, chicken wings, fuck, yeah, like, we don't like that and we don't\n\n39:57.800 --> 40:01.320\nlike, oh my God, go to the mall, shopping, we don't, we don't like that either.\n\n40:01.320 --> 40:06.880\nAnd so we also, we don't like, I mean, I won't say we, I'll say I, like, when you meet a\n\n40:06.880 --> 40:12.200\ngay, when you meet a gay guy, let's say, and he's really queenie, that wears you out pretty\n\n40:12.200 --> 40:13.200\nquickly.\n\n40:13.200 --> 40:17.800\nIt's like, enough with the femininity thing, like, like, temper that a little bit, like,\n\n40:17.800 --> 40:22.320\nthe more towards the middle you get, the more complete of a person you become, we, we don't\n\n40:22.320 --> 40:30.320\nwant to see a really butch lesbian, like, how about be a woman too, while you're being\n\n40:30.320 --> 40:35.000\na man, like, like, a little bit, like, lean towards the middle, and I would say towards\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:39.240\nall things, like, like, see both sides of everything and, like, and, and, and, and, like,\n\n40:39.240 --> 40:43.680\nkind of combine the beauty that is masculinity and the beauty that is femininity.\n\n40:43.680 --> 40:47.680\nWell, that's what I'm saying, look at the, if you, so, I, I think nature goes in bell\n\n40:47.680 --> 40:48.680\ncurves.\n\n40:48.680 --> 40:52.440\nLike, I, I, I think that's a, I mean, that's probably pinning things in too much too, but\n\n40:52.440 --> 40:57.960\nthat's an easier way to understand things, that, that, uh, if you, if a frog lays a thousand\n\n40:57.960 --> 41:03.080\neggs, then you're gonna look at, like, there's a, there's a, there's a bulge in the center\n\n41:03.080 --> 41:08.800\nof the survival eggs, you know, and then there's fringe eggs that don't survive for one reason\n\n41:08.800 --> 41:11.160\nand fringe eggs that don't survive for another reason.\n\n41:11.160 --> 41:16.160\nThey're every, everything goes in a bell, a bell curve, so, so, I, I, I accuse, there's\n\n41:16.160 --> 41:21.520\na bunch, there's not a lot of incredibly stupid people, there's a bunch of people in the middle\n\n41:21.520 --> 41:25.680\nthat are running everything, and, uh, and then there's not a lot of incredibly smart\n\n41:25.680 --> 41:32.880\npeople who are, you know, all here tonight, uh, uh, but sexually, so sexually, give yourself\n\n41:32.880 --> 41:33.880\na round of applause for being very smart.\n\n41:33.880 --> 41:37.880\nIf you think of sexuality as a bell curve, then I would assume, like, I think what you're\n\n41:37.880 --> 41:43.040\nsaying to, that, that, that a hundred percent straight means actually some kind of weird\n\n41:43.040 --> 41:47.280\ninside-out, weird thing where you're so straight, you're not even human, because, because the\n\n41:47.280 --> 41:51.840\nbell curve would probably be, well, if I put my penis through a hole and I don't know what's\n\n41:51.840 --> 41:57.560\nsucking it, and then later I find out it was my friend Kevin, uh, uh, in other words,\n\n41:57.560 --> 41:58.560\ntwo percent.\n\n41:58.560 --> 42:04.120\nI mean, I, I, I, I imagine that those of us in the middle are people whose sexuality\n\n42:04.120 --> 42:09.400\ndoesn't define us so much that it prevents us from doing other things, the same way that\n\n42:09.400 --> 42:15.360\na, uh, incredibly sober person whose sobriety defines every conversation they have is just\n\n42:15.360 --> 42:18.840\nas annoying as a fall-down drunk, who you can't, you can't trust to.\n\n42:18.840 --> 42:22.480\nYeah, and, and there's nothing more, uh, fascist than a hippie, like, like, like a really hardcore\n\n42:22.480 --> 42:26.720\nhippie can be the most fascistic, most dogmatic asshole that you'll ever talk to.\n\n42:26.720 --> 42:27.720\nYeah.\n\n42:27.720 --> 42:30.560\nLike, temper it a little bit, like, like, see both sides of it.\n\n42:30.560 --> 42:34.320\nIt's hilarious, like, in NASCAR, uh, once in a while for breast cancer awareness, they'll\n\n42:34.320 --> 42:37.680\npaint one car pink, and there's people that are really bummed out about it.\n\n42:37.680 --> 42:43.320\nThat's like, oh, pink car, God, dude, like, like, I'm not a man anymore, I'm like, I can't\n\n42:43.320 --> 42:49.400\nlook at a pink car going a circle, like, I'm like, hey, hey, um, if, if you could like\n\n42:49.400 --> 42:52.600\nthe color pink a little more, you'd fuck your wife a little better and fucking take it\n\n42:52.600 --> 42:53.600\neasy.\n\n42:53.600 --> 42:58.600\nYeah, I were polarized gray bands.\n\n42:58.600 --> 43:04.120\nEvery white car is pink.\n\n43:04.120 --> 43:05.600\nYou're back down to 10% again.\n\n43:05.600 --> 43:07.360\nThere you go, back down.\n\n43:07.360 --> 43:11.360\nAre you sure you didn't wash your white car with a pink bicycle?\n\n43:11.360 --> 43:13.520\nA red, oh, she had a red bicycle.\n\n43:13.520 --> 43:15.560\nGod damn it, I fucked up.\n\n43:15.560 --> 43:26.160\nYou guys are talking about, uh, feet, no, the language, I'm with you on that, on language,\n\n43:26.160 --> 43:28.280\nI want to go on a whole thing on that.\n\n43:28.280 --> 43:33.360\nI mean, Jeff goes on these tears, like, uh, he's a real HL Mankin, like, like, really\n\n43:33.360 --> 43:37.280\nthinks that everyone should be, you know, going about talking like a steampunk person,\n\n43:37.280 --> 43:39.800\notherwise that means that we're regressing.\n\n43:39.800 --> 43:43.800\nWe should use our, the English language is one of the most expansive vocabularies of\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:44.800\nall time.\n\n43:44.800 --> 43:48.360\nOne of the biggest vocabularies I've ever made, and we don't fucking use it.\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:50.280\nI'd like to use it more, huh?\n\n43:50.280 --> 43:57.440\nI'd like to use it more, yeah, absolutely, but, but, but I will, I, so, so I think where\n\n43:57.440 --> 44:03.560\nI agree with Jeff is that, is that there's a danger in, uh, in, in getting trained by\n\n44:03.560 --> 44:10.840\nmedia and, uh, in each other that everything is either awesome or lame, because if there's\n\n44:10.840 --> 44:15.120\nno more words for different kinds of awesome, like, like, yeah, you're getting trained to\n\n44:15.120 --> 44:18.880\nchoose between Pepsi and Coke, you know, they're fooling you into not realizing that there's\n\n44:18.880 --> 44:20.960\na difference between corn syrup and water.\n\n44:20.960 --> 44:27.440\nSo linguistically, we need to think outside the box, but that is exactly why I bristle\n\n44:27.440 --> 44:33.240\nand freak out, get very uncomfortable when people campaign and parade and things in celebration\n\n44:33.240 --> 44:36.600\nof just scrubbing out those couple little words.\n\n44:36.600 --> 44:41.320\nYeah, because it's like, it doesn't, it's, you don't even see where that stops.\n\n44:41.320 --> 44:46.280\nYou just, you think that you, you, when you, when you don't make up words for a living,\n\n44:46.280 --> 44:51.280\nlike, maybe it's harder to see how you can't just point at something across on the other\n\n44:51.280 --> 44:53.560\nside of the room and go, I want that potted plant out of here.\n\n44:53.560 --> 44:55.280\nNow the apartment's going to be perfect.\n\n44:55.280 --> 44:58.480\nIt, it, you know, it's, it, that's not how it works.\n\n44:58.480 --> 45:03.880\nLike you're, you're free or you're not, you, you, you come out of the womb with the freedom\n\n45:03.880 --> 45:04.880\nof speech.\n\n45:04.880 --> 45:10.240\nThe constitution gets drafted up by some lawyers and says, you have freedom of speech.\n\n45:10.240 --> 45:14.160\nNext thing that happens is, unless you say fire in a crowded theater, next thing that\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:18.160\nhappens is unless you say this thing and that thing, we can all agree that this would be\n\n45:18.160 --> 45:19.160\na terrible thing to say.\n\n45:19.160 --> 45:20.160\nYes.\n\n45:20.160 --> 45:21.160\nOkay.\n\n45:21.160 --> 45:22.160\nAll in favor of eliminating it.\n\n45:22.160 --> 45:25.640\nI, I, I, this, this, this, we, we, whatever, man.\n\n45:25.640 --> 45:27.320\nThis is why, what a boring conversation.\n\n45:27.320 --> 45:28.320\nIt's not boring.\n\n45:28.320 --> 45:29.320\nI'm right there with you.\n\n45:29.320 --> 45:30.480\nBut it's, it's, it's the same thing.\n\n45:30.480 --> 45:33.720\nWe're talking about the, a binary idea that there's, that there's goodness bad, there's\n\n45:33.720 --> 45:35.600\nPepsi, there's coke, there's straight or there's gay.\n\n45:35.600 --> 45:38.600\nI don't like non-lateral thinking, but, but here's the thing.\n\n45:38.600 --> 45:39.600\nYeah.\n\n45:39.600 --> 45:43.440\nI don't, I also don't like people that aren't verbal thinkers necessarily who think that\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:48.840\nthey shouldn't speak because they don't have the same kind of word power.\n\n45:48.840 --> 45:52.040\nYou know, I don't like those people feeling censored by smart people.\n\n45:52.040 --> 45:55.080\nI don't, I don't, I don't like people being bullied because they don't know how to use\n\n45:55.080 --> 45:56.080\nan apostrophe.\n\n45:56.080 --> 46:01.880\nI don't like, I don't, I don't, I don't think that someone who speaks great truths is necessarily\n\n46:01.880 --> 46:03.920\ngoing to be the most articulate person in the world.\n\n46:03.920 --> 46:10.240\nI think that the use of seven words, if there's only seven, can, there's, we can still create\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:13.920\na revolution and, and, and, you know, like you, we could, someone can use those seven\n\n46:13.920 --> 46:17.040\nwords in an order that's going to make everybody flip over.\n\n46:17.040 --> 46:20.640\nThere's a way to speak wrong so well that you're, that you're amazing.\n\n46:20.640 --> 46:25.680\nLike Yogi Berra, like, like if you go online and look, look, look, look up Yogi Berra quotes.\n\n46:25.680 --> 46:30.120\nHe malaproped all the time and malapropism is a Shakespeare character, malaprop.\n\n46:30.120 --> 46:35.440\nAnd he constantly said things wrong and it was using the language perfectly and you can't\n\n46:35.440 --> 46:36.440\ntell at some point.\n\n46:36.440 --> 46:39.400\nDid he, did he say it wrong on purpose or by accident?\n\n46:39.400 --> 46:43.160\nBut because he said something really, really funny, really, really, really good.\n\n46:43.160 --> 46:44.920\nI was going to tie this in.\n\n46:44.920 --> 46:49.760\nI, I played baseball at Arizona State, number one, played there, starred at.\n\n46:49.760 --> 46:50.760\nWhat position?\n\n46:50.760 --> 46:51.760\nI was a pitcher.\n\n46:51.760 --> 46:52.760\nI, I, I could see you as a pitcher.\n\n46:52.760 --> 46:53.760\nThank you.\n\n46:53.760 --> 46:54.760\nThank you.\n\n46:54.760 --> 46:55.760\nNine girls.\n\n46:55.760 --> 46:56.760\nI think you're 10% catcher.\n\n46:56.760 --> 46:57.760\nOkay.\n\n46:57.760 --> 46:58.760\nAll right.\n\n46:58.760 --> 46:59.760\nAll right.\n\n46:59.760 --> 47:00.760\nCome on.\n\n47:00.760 --> 47:01.760\nCome on.\n\n47:01.760 --> 47:09.040\nWe, we, we might have the name of our episode.\n\n47:09.040 --> 47:13.680\nAre we all 10% catcher at some point?\n\n47:13.680 --> 47:17.360\nSo I play.\n\n47:17.360 --> 47:23.840\nSo I think some of that comes from being in that jock world, not being in that, uh, the\n\n47:23.840 --> 47:25.040\nartist world.\n\n47:25.040 --> 47:34.960\nI, I definitely have those jock energy and experiences and also my pre comedy experiences\n\n47:34.960 --> 47:40.560\nto, you know, that really kind of like, I carry with me and not necessarily in a good\n\n47:40.560 --> 47:41.560\nway.\n\n47:41.560 --> 47:46.160\nAnd then sometimes I'll see myself on, like I'm working on a project also and I can go\n\n47:46.160 --> 47:50.560\ninto like how we argue over words and argue over comedy.\n\n47:50.560 --> 47:54.080\nAnd then I think like, who are you, where's your, where's your, you know, I don't want\n\n47:54.080 --> 47:59.760\nto go into like specifics here, but yeah, there's kind of debates and I feel like I don't, I\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:00.760\ndon't get that freedom.\n\n48:00.760 --> 48:06.200\nThat's one reason why I do podcasts because I get that freedom to talk and maybe it's\n\n48:06.200 --> 48:09.640\nbecause I'm Jewish or I'm neurotic or there's heart disease in my family.\n\n48:09.640 --> 48:11.240\nI got to get it out.\n\n48:11.240 --> 48:16.680\nAnd when I don't, and it really is hard when it's your living or your own production and\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:25.120\nit's your own, you know, introduction to America and it's truly not you getting to do that.\n\n48:25.120 --> 48:29.960\nSo I'm dealing with that and I think it's all a combination and a hybrid of everything.\n\n48:29.960 --> 48:33.840\nYou know, hopefully when I come out on the other side, I'll grow from it, but\n\n48:33.840 --> 48:36.800\nYeah, I don't know you very well, but like from what little I know, like, and just from\n\n48:36.800 --> 48:40.920\nhearing it tonight, like you are, you're revealing stuff about yourself, but also you're hard\n\n48:40.920 --> 48:41.920\non yourself about it.\n\n48:41.920 --> 48:42.920\nYeah, a little bit.\n\n48:42.920 --> 48:46.080\nSo like it's almost like you're like, and not to overstate it, like it's almost like\n\n48:46.080 --> 48:48.920\nyou're kind of gay bashing yourself about a gay experience.\n\n48:48.920 --> 48:52.760\nLike you're, you're, you're, you're saying, Hey, I did this thing and I'm not proud of\n\n48:52.760 --> 48:53.760\nit.\n\n48:53.760 --> 48:54.760\nI don't know.\n\n48:54.760 --> 48:57.840\nBut you're, you're well, I mean, growing up, I was called a gay boy.\n\n48:57.840 --> 48:58.840\nYou're Siri.\n\n48:58.840 --> 49:04.160\nI was a nice guy, a nice kid, you know, now being nice, I think in Hollywood or whatever\n\n49:04.160 --> 49:09.280\nwe call this has helped me because people want nice people around, you know, and hustling\n\n49:09.280 --> 49:12.400\nand hard work, which I got, you know, helped me in baseball.\n\n49:12.400 --> 49:16.520\nBut I think growing up, maybe in the valley at the time, going to public, going to public\n\n49:16.520 --> 49:20.520\nschools, getting bused out to South Central, maybe it made me tougher.\n\n49:20.520 --> 49:21.520\nI don't know.\n\n49:21.520 --> 49:26.320\nAnd then playing baseball with like the necessarily a little bit of hazing and bullying.\n\n49:26.320 --> 49:28.960\nIt was kind of, yeah, like stuck with me.\n\n49:28.960 --> 49:32.920\nAnd then when I started doing comedy, like, uh, opened up a lot, but now when I see myself\n\n49:32.920 --> 49:37.520\non TV, sometimes I can, I kind of see like, I would pick on myself.\n\n49:37.520 --> 49:38.520\nYeah.\n\n49:38.520 --> 49:39.520\nAnd I don't know what that is.\n\n49:39.520 --> 49:40.520\nI don't know where that comes from.\n\n49:40.520 --> 49:42.560\nYou know, you're on, you're on self loathing.\n\n49:42.560 --> 49:43.560\nYeah.\n\n49:43.560 --> 49:46.360\nWell, it's probably something that, that we, we don't all see that it's something that\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:52.200\nyou train yourself to, but I've learned as I've learned, you know, especially lately,\n\n49:52.200 --> 49:56.680\nlike turn it into comedy, turn it into something uses a positive and I get a lot of support\n\n49:56.680 --> 49:57.680\nfrom people.\n\n49:57.680 --> 50:01.160\nAgain, I'm older and, you know, Twitter and the internet and all that stuff.\n\n50:01.160 --> 50:05.440\nLike it has helped me and doing the podcast is just like, there's a things like you seem\n\n50:05.440 --> 50:10.080\nlike, you seem like a very soft, like emotionally very soft guy, but you exude a very like\n\n50:10.080 --> 50:15.440\nyour voice, your posture is very like loud and like, like you seem very sportsy and\n\n50:15.440 --> 50:19.840\nvery like, like macho and gruff, but like you, you can still like, you can't totally\n\n50:19.840 --> 50:24.440\nhide the fact that there's a softness to you, which is not gay.\n\n50:24.440 --> 50:28.880\nIt's just, it's just being soft and all, you know, but that's a negative, that's kind\n\n50:28.880 --> 50:30.440\nof a negative term in sports.\n\n50:30.440 --> 50:32.600\nIf you're labeled as soft, you know what I mean?\n\n50:32.600 --> 50:33.600\nWe're not playing sports.\n\n50:33.600 --> 50:34.600\nWe're not playing sports.\n\n50:34.600 --> 50:35.600\nSo I'm okay with that.\n\n50:35.600 --> 50:40.600\nI am getting, I am getting used to that.\n\n50:40.600 --> 50:44.160\nIt's just some, maybe it's some of those jock sensibilities in me and the fact that I'm\n\n50:44.160 --> 50:46.160\nstill around that world a little bit.\n\n50:46.160 --> 50:48.360\nI'm around Major League Baseball.\n\n50:48.360 --> 50:51.520\nYou certainly take taking a major step by talking about your lady boy experience.\n\n50:51.520 --> 50:52.520\nSilence.\n\n50:52.520 --> 50:55.640\nWell, you know, it is, I'm getting it out there and it's also just other things talking\n\n50:55.640 --> 51:01.040\nabout it, owning it and, you know, again, not being hard on myself and then, you know,\n\n51:01.040 --> 51:03.520\nbe, I don't want to, you just keep doing it.\n\n51:03.520 --> 51:07.960\nAnd I think you just work through it and the fans and it's like, I don't need therapy\n\n51:07.960 --> 51:10.600\nto be honest with you for me.\n\n51:10.600 --> 51:11.600\nAnd I do speak loud.\n\n51:11.600 --> 51:15.840\nI mean, I am, and that's one thing I do kind of like, I do the sensitivity because I am\n\n51:15.840 --> 51:19.240\na nice guy and I'll put it out and it's like, well, you're being loud.\n\n51:19.240 --> 51:20.240\nYou're this.\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:25.240\nAnd it's like, professionally, I have learned like how to do warmup and I start off nice.\n\n51:25.240 --> 51:28.840\nOkay, we're going to do this.\n\n51:28.840 --> 51:29.840\nAnd then I crank it.\n\n51:29.840 --> 51:32.840\nYou know, I work at the midnight show with Chris Hardwick kind of thing and go in nice\n\n51:32.840 --> 51:33.840\nand nice.\n\n51:33.840 --> 51:34.840\nWe don't want you to be quiet.\n\n51:34.840 --> 51:35.840\nWe want, we want you to be loud.\n\n51:35.840 --> 51:36.840\nYou want it?\n\n51:36.840 --> 51:37.840\nYeah.\n\n51:37.840 --> 51:39.840\nBecause there's a little audience and that's the, that's the, what I think about is like,\n\n51:39.840 --> 51:41.280\nall right, I'm doing a podcast.\n\n51:41.280 --> 51:45.640\nI've had some experiences when I've done video podcasts and like, I've played completely\n\n51:45.640 --> 51:50.480\nto the camera and then people in the podcast feel like, oh, it's too much and I'm doing\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:51.480\na live show.\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:54.760\nI can play to the audience and I feel like maybe the podcast, a lot of things going on.\n\n51:54.760 --> 51:55.760\nBut you know what?\n\n51:55.760 --> 52:01.840\nI'm comfortable here with Dan, Jeff, Dustin and the, what's the fear, what's the fear,\n\n52:01.840 --> 52:09.400\nI'm sorry to cut you off, like, what would be the big, we're talking about this, I think\n\n52:09.400 --> 52:14.560\nlast time about the way we're perceived or a couple of shows ago about, we all exude\n\n52:14.560 --> 52:20.840\nsomething that we're not in control of, like Dan wants to be perceived as smart and also\n\n52:20.840 --> 52:26.200\npeople come to him and want, they want Dan to say that he's smart, like what do you want\n\n52:26.200 --> 52:29.720\npeople to see you as, or what are you afraid that people see in you that you wish they\n\n52:29.720 --> 52:34.600\ndidn't see?\n\n52:34.600 --> 52:36.600\nWeird?\n\n52:36.600 --> 52:37.600\nWeird how?\n\n52:37.600 --> 52:41.640\nJust weird thinking about stuff that doesn't matter, you know, like, I mean, that's a whole\n\n52:41.640 --> 52:42.640\nanother thing.\n\n52:42.640 --> 52:43.640\nI was asking.\n\n52:43.640 --> 52:44.640\nWhat's the fear of being perceived as weird?\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:49.600\nI don't want to be, it's like a Pandora's box, it's like you talk about it, you bring\n\n52:49.600 --> 52:53.560\nattention to it, it's like, you know, things that we notice, I'm sure, you know, you're\n\n52:53.560 --> 52:57.680\nan actor, you see yourself on TV, like some people can't watch themselves, Johnny Depp\n\n52:57.680 --> 53:03.320\ndoesn't watch his movies, Jared Leto freaked out, you know, I know that's there, you know,\n\n53:03.320 --> 53:06.960\nthat's normal, but it feels like it affects me a little bit more.\n\n53:06.960 --> 53:10.120\nBut you're doing a Comedy Central show now, right?\n\n53:10.120 --> 53:11.120\nAre you?\n\n53:11.120 --> 53:13.640\nYeah, I'm doing that and some of that has seen myself on that.\n\n53:13.640 --> 53:20.560\nMy fear, like that's all I was thinking about, like my fear regarding that would be one weird,\n\n53:20.560 --> 53:21.560\nso that's kind of.\n\n53:21.560 --> 53:22.640\nYou don't want people to think you're weird.\n\n53:22.640 --> 53:26.960\nI don't mind it, but I don't want it to be a Pandora's box of weirdness, if we could\n\n53:26.960 --> 53:27.960\nturn into a joke.\n\n53:27.960 --> 53:31.080\nYou mean they're going to find out you're weird in what way, like what's the, what's\n\n53:31.080 --> 53:32.080\nthe.\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:36.760\nAh, like obsessive about my eyebrows, weird about my hairline, my mannerisms, do I think\n\n53:36.760 --> 53:40.480\nI'm gay, why do you even think you're, you know, that kind of stuff, okay.\n\n53:40.480 --> 53:43.400\nAnd if you revealed all that, if you took off your hat and showed us your hair on your\n\n53:43.400 --> 53:44.400\neyebrows.\n\n53:44.400 --> 53:48.200\nI'll do that, I'm in bold, I'm bold, it doesn't bother me, but I just felt cooler doing this\n\n53:48.200 --> 53:49.200\ntoday.\n\n53:49.200 --> 53:50.200\nYeah.\n\n53:50.200 --> 53:51.200\nAnd I was in Toronto.\n\n53:51.200 --> 53:52.200\nBut it's off?\n\n53:52.200 --> 53:53.200\nIt's off?\n\n53:53.200 --> 53:58.040\nI'm hiding behind some stuff, the glasses kind of.\n\n53:58.040 --> 54:01.760\nOh, believe me, I hide behind a suit, I hide behind a weird hairdo all the time, like I\n\n54:01.760 --> 54:02.760\nbraid hair.\n\n54:02.760 --> 54:03.760\nWell, thank you.\n\n54:03.760 --> 54:04.760\nBut like, it's all, it's all an act.\n\n54:04.760 --> 54:05.760\nIt's all affectation.\n\n54:05.760 --> 54:10.560\nI hide behind my Aunt Rachel's beautiful pantyhose clad legs.\n\n54:10.560 --> 54:18.480\nI just play with my matchbox cars, rolling them gently up and down our calves.\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:20.640\nIs that where it comes from?\n\n54:20.640 --> 54:23.920\nI feel like, I feel like researching that stuff that, did she have red hair?\n\n54:23.920 --> 54:25.360\nI said, Oh, I don't know.\n\n54:25.360 --> 54:28.960\nI had an aunt that had red hair that married into the family, but I know I was in the red\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:31.280\nhead since Nicole McHugh and kindergarten.\n\n54:31.280 --> 54:33.800\nWho's Nicole McHugh?\n\n54:33.800 --> 54:35.800\nWho wasn't she?\n\n54:35.800 --> 54:42.960\nNicole McHugh was the first girl that I ever felt hormones generated in my body about like,\n\n54:42.960 --> 54:49.200\nI was kindergarten and the teachers would call your name and then she, every time the teacher\n\n54:49.200 --> 54:56.400\nwould call my name, she'd say Daniel Harmon, Nicole McHugh would go, and then every time\n\n54:56.400 --> 55:05.280\nshe'd say Nicole McHugh, I'd go, and we never spoke to each other, but she was my first\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:06.280\nlover.\n\n55:06.280 --> 55:09.840\nWell, that's one of the most beautiful relationships I've ever heard of.\n\n55:09.840 --> 55:15.920\nAnd she had copper red curly hair and, yeah, but so did Batgirl, so I don't know where it\n\n55:15.920 --> 55:22.080\ncame from, you know, because Batgirl was like a huge, like a cork got popped there sexually.\n\n55:22.080 --> 55:27.760\nI would get so excited, the opening credits of Batman, my brother would be like, you know,\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:31.680\nmy brother loved Batman and we would play Batman together, like, you know, we'd put\n\n55:31.680 --> 55:36.800\nski caps and stuff on the, on the banister to the basement and pretend it was the Bat\n\n55:36.800 --> 55:40.440\npole and like get dressed up as Bat, you know, like, like get to the bottom of the stairs\n\n55:40.440 --> 55:43.880\nand go, I heard the Joker's broken out, let's go get him.\n\n55:43.880 --> 55:48.080\nAnd then we'd watch Batman together and then like, there was a title card in the Batman\n\n55:48.080 --> 55:53.200\ntitle sequence, because I now, now being a producer, I guess I know that like, it must\n\n55:53.200 --> 55:57.560\nhave meant that Von Craig was probably six of 13 or something like, like she was recurring\n\n55:57.560 --> 55:58.880\nbut not regular.\n\n55:58.880 --> 56:03.920\nAnd so there was an opening title card that was either there or not there.\n\n56:03.920 --> 56:07.160\nAnd it wasn't a picture of Batgirl, but it was always there when she was going to be\n\n56:07.160 --> 56:08.640\nin the episode, I would say.\n\n56:08.640 --> 56:14.520\nAnd so it's always Batgirl and I would, I would, my body would just twitch, even though\n\n56:14.520 --> 56:18.520\nI was absolutely years and years away from generating any kind of fluid that would have\n\n56:18.520 --> 56:20.400\nanything to do with that.\n\n56:20.400 --> 56:26.000\nI was just like transfixed and I was so excited that Batgirl was going to be involved and that\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:31.720\nshe would be flying around, whipping her red wig around and kicking people and very often\n\n56:31.720 --> 56:37.280\ngetting like Batman, there was a lot of like, a lot of nylon or spandex or whatever and a\n\n56:37.280 --> 56:42.040\nlot of like, bondage, a lot of like, which I'm not, I'm not a bondage guy, like, but\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:47.600\na lot of like, when I was a kid, like, it was a lot of like, like, I remember being\n\n56:47.600 --> 56:54.160\na kid of like, squeezing myself in between like, couch cushions and getting really excited\n\n56:54.160 --> 56:58.040\nand thinking about Batgirl.\n\n56:58.040 --> 57:02.000\nAnd then I saw Temple Grandin and she had the squeeze machine and I was wondering, was\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:07.640\nit a sexual thing or was it like, I don't know, like, like, I used to like, get rolled\n\n57:07.640 --> 57:10.640\nup like a sausage in a blanket and I couldn't move.\n\n57:10.640 --> 57:14.400\nDo you think your sexuality is a moving target or do you think that you're slowly honing\n\n57:14.400 --> 57:16.840\nin on a fixed target that's always been there?\n\n57:16.840 --> 57:21.440\nDo you think it changes as you grow or do you think it's something that you've, it's\n\n57:21.440 --> 57:24.440\nalways been there, that you're just now getting better at finding?\n\n57:24.440 --> 57:26.880\nNo, I don't think I'm good at finding it.\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:31.680\nI have fetishes and I think it are almost, as the name would suggest, they're almost\n\n57:31.680 --> 57:34.240\nremoved from proper sexuality.\n\n57:34.240 --> 57:42.080\nI think that, I think that I fetishize things and then it's like, it removes me from sex.\n\n57:42.080 --> 57:50.800\nLike my fetish for women's legs clad in a material that essentially removes the chaos\n\n57:50.800 --> 57:51.800\nfrom them.\n\n57:51.800 --> 57:54.280\nIt turns them more into cartoons.\n\n57:54.280 --> 57:59.000\nYou know, it's all about removal and like, like fully clothed women just hanging out\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:05.280\nand like, I'm just sitting there going, and I gratify myself and then I'm done.\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:12.440\nYou know, I did my little penis sneeze and I go, it's not, it's not romantic, it's not\n\n58:12.440 --> 58:13.440\nsexual.\n\n58:13.440 --> 58:14.440\nStop having penis sneezes.\n\n58:14.440 --> 58:17.440\nAnd then when you fall, you fall in love with a woman, you know, and then you welcome her\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:21.600\ninto your life and you like, like, like then the, during the courtship phase, like, there's\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:26.960\nnone of that going on because you love this person other than your sex life is involved\n\n58:26.960 --> 58:30.960\nwith theirs and the courting of them and stuff.\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:35.280\nAnd then I go back to work and then all of a sudden I'm like, gollum again, like, regarding\n\n58:35.280 --> 58:43.120\nthis, you know, I'm just using like this fetish object to like, get through the day.\n\n58:43.120 --> 58:47.120\nSo to answer your question, I don't, I don't, I don't, I haven't been honing in on anything.\n\n58:47.120 --> 58:53.440\nI think there's always been like this sort of childish asexual impulse that's like unhealthy.\n\n58:53.440 --> 58:55.800\nIt's like an outcropping of sexuality.\n\n58:55.800 --> 58:58.560\nMaybe you just masturbate on your lunch break.\n\n58:58.560 --> 59:00.800\nThat would, uh, I often do, my friend.\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:01.800\nThere you go.\n\n59:01.800 --> 59:04.840\nI mean, I've done, I've done in some strange places.\n\n59:04.840 --> 59:08.040\nI do want to go back to this because you can see my little OCD working.\n\n59:08.040 --> 59:10.760\nI just want to have closure on this one thing, talking about the show.\n\n59:10.760 --> 59:14.760\nI don't want to think too weird, okay, too weird.\n\n59:14.760 --> 59:19.280\nThat's the jock guy in me, but weird is okay.\n\n59:19.280 --> 59:24.560\nThe gay stuff where it goes, I can't be involved in baseball, it's a very jock world.\n\n59:24.560 --> 59:25.560\nIt's conservative.\n\n59:25.560 --> 59:27.280\nI've done a lot of stuff for baseball.\n\n59:27.280 --> 59:28.280\nIt's in my heart.\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:31.720\nI would hate to be there and go, Oh, there's the guy who goes to Bangkok.\n\n59:31.720 --> 59:32.720\nWe can't have, I don't know.\n\n59:32.720 --> 59:35.120\nI have some like nightmare, not a nightmare.\n\n59:35.120 --> 59:36.480\nIt's just a weird thought.\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:42.080\nAnd the other thing is just like unfunny and not reflective of me.\n\n59:42.080 --> 59:43.400\nThose are my fears.\n\n59:43.400 --> 59:44.400\nEverything else I let go.\n\n59:44.400 --> 59:50.880\nLike I'll go on, I'll be on a necrol show or I'll do Chelsea lately or I'll do, uh,\n\n59:50.880 --> 59:51.880\nyou know, a sky.\n\n59:51.880 --> 59:52.880\nIt's like go ahead and do it.\n\n59:52.880 --> 59:59.880\nIt's because my show is so, it's so personal and we talk about lady boy stuff.\n\n59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.240\nWe talk about 10% gay stuff and it's kind of not in my hands.\n\n01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.200\nWhen I do it here or I do it on stage or at the comedy store or on a podcast, it's kind\n\n01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200\nof funny.\n\n01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.440\nAnd I know I've gotten traction on it based on Twitter emails, but when you hand it over\n\n01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:21.400\nto somebody else to do it and then you see what they do, it's like, uh, not your vision.\n\n01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.720\nAnd then you have to kind of give notes based on their vision.\n\n01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.600\nAnd then it's like, uh, not, it's like, it's like a C plus.\n\n01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.600\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600\nThat's how I feel.\n\n01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.280\nNow I could be, you know, being too hard on myself again, thinking worst case scenario,\n\n01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280\nbut that's how I am.\n\n01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.680\nAnd that's why I'm carrying this stress and I would probably guess that like what's funny\n\n01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:46.400\nabout you, what's like enjoyable, marketable, successful about you is the fact that we want\n\n01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.640\nto watch you go through that struggle.\n\n01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.440\nWe want to watch a guy that throws like a, like a wicked slider or a fucking curve ball\n\n01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.080\nand a fast ball and a breaking ball and all this stuff and also goes to Bangkok and might\n\n01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.120\nhave an encounter with a lady boy.\n\n01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.200\nAnd also we don't want you to be like totally okay with that.\n\n01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.200\nWe want you, we want to watch you have to come home to your kitchenette and say, okay,\n\n01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.480\nlook, here's what happened in Thailand.\n\n01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480\nAll right.\n\n01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.080\nNow don't interrupt me.\n\n01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.280\nSome stuff went down and I don't want you to judge me before I finish.\n\n01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.280\nOkay.\n\n01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280\nHere's what happened.\n\n01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280\nYeah.\n\n01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280\nIt's almost like that.\n\n01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.400\nLike a rebuttal.\n\n01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400\nThat's what I would say.\n\n01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.360\nLike just like a walking Brody or whatever they do after the shows.\n\n01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.000\nLike just give me 30 minutes.\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.160\nIt'll be closure.\n\n01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160\nIt's the little OCD.\n\n01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:43.040\nThe protagonist that you are is the struggle, like not to be like a pedant, but like brothers\n\n01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.760\nKaramazov, there's two brothers, one's really idealistic, one's really realistic.\n\n01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:53.240\nThe middle brother, fuck, Dimitri, he is torn between those two things.\n\n01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.120\nIt's the struggle between, here's what I think I am.\n\n01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.120\nHere's what I wish I were.\n\n01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.320\nHere's what I know I am.\n\n01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.320\nHere's how I'm perceived.\n\n01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320\nHere's how I don't want to be perceived.\n\n01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:06.960\nWe want to watch you fucking flip and flop like a fish out of water about being you,\n\n01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.680\nbeing, what are you like, six, four?\n\n01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680\nHow tall are you?\n\n01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.680\nSix, two.\n\n01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680\nTwo hundred and eleven pounds.\n\n01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.160\nIt doesn't take silly of Husky.\n\n01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160\nExactly.\n\n01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.160\nExactly.\n\n01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.160\nLook at that.\n\n01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.360\nThere's that part of you that is so macho and then the other part, like keep struggling\n\n01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.560\nfor our benefit.\n\n01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.720\nI'm okay with that.\n\n01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.160\nIt's talks like this, Jeff.\n\n01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.880\nIt's like when I get that reassurance, like Brody, it's okay.\n\n01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880\nIt's all right.\n\n01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.360\nBecause sometimes production wise, I don't want to complain, I was, you know, I just need\n\n01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.000\na little bit of hand holding sometimes, especially with the subject matter, you're dealing with\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.320\nthe guy who is a little on the edge.\n\n01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.080\nSo I went out on this tour, I was on this comedy tour, and it's like, sometimes I just\n\n01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:50.560\nfelt like it's hard to communicate on your own personal project via Vimeo and email.\n\n01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.640\nAnd I mean, at least I felt like, let's verbalize something.\n\n01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640\nSo it's tough.\n\n01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640\nIt's a struggle.\n\n01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.320\nI know that's how shows are done.\n\n01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.880\nHopefully, I'll get another chance.\n\n01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.240\nI just don't want to have a heart attack.\n\n01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.560\nI don't want to have our heart attack, and I don't want my, you know, Molotov cocktails\n\n01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.200\nto my, to my one.\n\n01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.600\nAnd one thing that we don't want out of you, we don't, we don't ever want you Brody Stevens\n\n01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.680\nor anybody here in Harmontown, the one, the one thing that we all like agree on is we\n\n01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.520\ndon't, anyone to have to change themselves for anybody else.\n\n01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.920\nBut we also want everybody to like become the best version of themselves.\n\n01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.960\nJust keep, keep being conflicted.\n\n01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.960\nLike that's, that's really beautiful.\n\n01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960\nReally?\n\n01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.960\nYeah.\n\n01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.960\nThat's how you grow, right?\n\n01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960\nYeah.\n\n01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960\nAll right.\n\n01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.960\nGood.\n\n01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.960\nI'll take that.\n\n01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.840\nKeep your fists in the air and keep being soft and hard at the same time.\n\n01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.480\nIt's, you're, you're a coin spinning on its edge.\n\n01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480\nIt's great.\n\n01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480\nOkay.\n\n01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480\nI like, I could take that.\n\n01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.760\nIt's a good, it's a good metaphor.\n\n01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760\nI'll keep doing it.\n\n01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.680\nI'm learning to deal with that exercise, meditation, podcasting.\n\n01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680\nI'm going to get through that.\n\n01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.680\nThank you.\n\n01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.680\nBrody Stevens, everybody.\n\n01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680\nAll right.\n\n01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.800\nListen to the Festival of Friends on Feral Friendship.\n\n01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800\nYou got it.\n\n01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800\nBrody Stevens.\n\n01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800\nThanks, Steve.\n\n01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800\nThanks, Jeff.\n\n01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800\nYeah.\n\n01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:14.840\nThat's how good you, you dismissed Brody right at 9-Eleven.\n\n01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:21.800\nThere's no such thing as accidents, man.\n\n01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.680\nWell, it's the, it's the, it's the second worst thing that ever happened to this country.\n\n01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.080\nBrody, Brody leaving the stage at 9-Eleven.\n\n01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.960\nWait, should we, should we have kept them up?\n\n01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.200\nShould we just stay here?\n\n01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.680\nShould we, should we keep them out here?\n\n01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.640\nNo, no, I wanted to, because I offered him in the green room, it was like, well, your\n\n01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.000\noptions are you could come up later and then you can play D&D with us because Aaron's not\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nhere tonight.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.760\nBut no, he wanted to actually, I think I brought him up too late and kept him here too long.\n\n01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:58.800\nBut let's get Kumail out here because he has, Jesus, hello, stranger, yes, Kumail, Nanjiani.\n\n01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.800\nIt's been a while, then it feels like it's been a long time.\n\n01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.040\nI miss you so much.\n\n01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.320\nI miss coming here a lot.\n\n01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.720\nI really get bummed out every Sunday.\n\n01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.320\nYou're on stage every goddamn night of the week.\n\n01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.840\nEvery time I look, I open up the Instagrams or the Facebooks, so you're doing something.\n\n01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.720\nNo, actually, I haven't been performing on stage that much.\n\n01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.200\nI really haven't.\n\n01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.560\nI was, last night I was in New York and I performed there, but I really haven't been.\n\n01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.840\nI haven't really been doing anything.\n\n01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.200\nSo you have other friends you like better than us in New York, is that what's going\n\n01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200\non?\n\n01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200\nOh, no, I just had a show.\n\n01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.000\nNo, I started shooting the HBO show, so I've had like 6 a.m. calls and stuff in one day,\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.400\nso I go to bed at 8 p.m.\n\n01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.880\nI'm like, my schedule's all fucked.\n\n01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.680\nBut you've been working like a dog.\n\n01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680\nYeah.\n\n01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.600\nYou're all over the televisions.\n\n01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.080\nTrying to be, yeah.\n\n01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080\nI love it.\n\n01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.080\nI think the world needs a little more Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.080\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.080\nThank

--> 01:06:07.400\nI'm 100% gay for you.\n\n01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.080\nThat makes you a regular person.\n\n01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:17.920\nAll right, wait, before we focus on Kumail, I want to get Kumail's, I just, response\n\n01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.360\nto this.\n\n01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.800\nI got this email, not because it involves you, but I just, I wanted you to be here for\n\n01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800\nthis.\n\n01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800\nGreat.\n\n01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.720\nAnd Jeff in Harmontown.\n\n01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:38.200\nThis is, you know, I'm 40 years old and I came out to Los Angeles and I wanted to maybe\n\n01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.880\nwrite some TV and some movies and things.\n\n01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.920\nMaybe meet a nice girl, maybe get married, move into a big house, have a little golden\n\n01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920\ndoodle.\n\n01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.480\nI'm achieving a lot of my dreams, step by step, but there's one dream I didn't even\n\n01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480\nknow.\n\n01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480\nI don't know what this is about.\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:07:00.680\nI really had, until this email came in, God, I can't, I just, this is from Carl Nolay,\n\n01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:06.640\nJr., 11th generation distiller from the Nolay distillery.\n\n01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:17.840\nOn behalf of Kettle One, this is already, already the best email you've ever gotten.\n\n01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:28.680\nWe would like to invite you to become part of the Kettle One Alliance, an exclusive invite\n\n01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.120\nonly VIP program.\n\n01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:41.080\nAs one of the select few members, you will receive monthly Kettle One shipments, a

Kettle One experience and opportunity that is to\n\n01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.040\nbe had.\n\n01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:09.600\nBy the way, an all expense paid funeral.\n\n01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.000\nIf you know what's crazy, you say the guy's name.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nHis signature is on this fucking bottle.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nIt's on the bow and word?\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nAll right.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nNolay.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nRight here.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.760\nKettle One prides itself on being an ultra premium vodka that aligns with authentic\n\n01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:35.640\ninfluential leaders like yourself.\n\n01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.920\nWe hope you enjoy the handcrafted bottle of Kettle One in clothes and look forward to\n\n01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.120\nwelcoming you as part of the family.\n\n01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.400\nWe are excited about the opportunity for you to represent the Kettle One Alliance.\n\n01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400\nAlliance!\n\n01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.400\nAlliance!\n\n01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:57.400\nIt's in the way that you use it.\n\n01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:01.040\nYou're like in the Avengers of Booze.\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040\nYeah.\n\n01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.600\nYeah, that's Sam Jackson like yelling at me.\n\n01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600\nExactly.\n\n01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.000\nYou think you drink Kettle One motherfucker?\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nExactly.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.440\nGet ready to drink more for the planet.\n\n01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.440\nThat segment brought to you by Fernet Broncker.\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.120\nFernet Broncker, the king of Italian Amari.\n\n01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120\nAll right.\n\n01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.080\nSo, anyways, another thing.\n\n01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.480\nThat's fucking, it's not surprising that it happened.\n\n01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.720\nIt's surprising that it took this long.\n\n01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.920\nI think you should have gotten this email years ago.\n\n01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920\nYeah.\n\n01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.760\nI think they go by liquid volume.\n\n01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.080\nI think they're like, holy shit, this guy has put us on the map.\n\n01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080\nCan I tell you?\n\n01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.400\nBut not because he created community because he's had so much to drink.\n\n01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:51.040\nMy manager had a client whose name will escape me for a moment, but she played a character\n\n01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.480\non Chicago Hope called Lisa Katerra.\n\n01:09:53.480 --> 01:10:00.240\nAnd my manager called up Cadillac and they have a car called the Cadillac Katerra.\n\n01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.320\nAnd she said, my client plays Lisa Katerra.\n\n01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.240\nOh, so it's like subliminal marketing.\n\n01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.680\nWell, actually, I think the guy that wrote the show might have picked that name because\n\n01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680\nof that.\n\n01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680\nOh, it's like Jesus.\n\n01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.080\nThey're also in a character called Bio Corvette.\n\n01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.160\nSo she called up Cadillac and said, can you just give her a car?\n\n01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.920\nI'm like, well, will she drive it in the show?\n\n01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.960\nI can't guarantee that, but she'll talk about it on Leno and Conan and shit.\n\n01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.040\nAnd so she did and they gave her a goddamn car.\n\n01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.200\nAnd so I was in a show and I'm like, can I change my character's name to Porsche 911?\n\n01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200\nYeah.\n\n01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.200\n9-Eleven is not a good association.\n\n01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.120\nThis was in 2000.\n\n01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120\nIt was before.\n\n01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120\nThis was before?\n\n01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120\nYes.\n\n01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.440\nMy fascination with 9-Eleven predates all of the tragedy.\n\n01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:54.640\nNot to take away from that story, but just to express how exciting this is for me.\n\n01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.560\nIt's fucking big news, man.\n\n01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560\nThat's a story about.\n\n01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.240\nThat's another story about, like, oh, we finagled the thing and we got free play stations\n\n01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.840\nbecause it's a Sony show and I told them my habit was going to play a play station.\n\n01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.440\nThis is you becoming the Highlander.\n\n01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.320\nThey called me authentic.\n\n01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.720\nThey came to me.\n\n01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.280\nThey called me an inspiration.\n\n01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.640\nDo you think that was a 4M email or that was a handcrafted email?\n\n01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.440\nI think that he sat, he was like, well, I've.\n\n01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.440\nCarl Nole.\n\n01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440\nYeah.\n\n01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440\nCarl Nole.\n\n01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440\nCarl Nole.\n\n01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.040\nHe sat down and said pen to paper and he goes, dear Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040\nAnd his family.\n\n01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040\nI'm a big fan of Harmontown.\n\n01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.760\nHe's the 11th generation of the family that's been distilling this vodka.\n\n01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.440\nSo you know his great-great-grandpa was writing to, like, Thomas Edison.\n\n01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.440\nWe hear you.\n\n01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.440\nWe don't know that.\n\n01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440\nWe don't know that.\n\n01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.520\nYou invented the cool shit.\n\n01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520\nSomething like that.\n\n01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520\nYeah.\n\n01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.920\nYou're the Thomas Edison of our day.\n\n01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.320\nSo what's going to happen now?\n\n01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.920\nDo we know what the outcome of this will be?\n\n01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920\nHe's going to be drinking more cattle wine.\n\n01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.920\nNo, he won't.\n\n01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.480\nHe'll be paying less.\n\n01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480\nHe'll be drinking this wine.\n\n01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.840\nI mean, that's the cool thing, is that now that this has happened, the rest of life\n\n01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.360\nis improv.\n\n01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.640\nLike I become a constellation.\n\n01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.840\nThat's what happens.\n\n01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:24.080\nI join Ursa Major and Archimedes in the.\n\n01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.080\nYeah.\n\n01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.120\nHe's like, oh, you see that thing that looks like a Kettle One bottle?\n\n01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.920\nThat's Dan Harmon.\n\n01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920\nYeah.\n\n01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.920\nHe drank himself into the cosmos.\n\n01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.920\nIs that what you've been trying to do?\n\n01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920\nYeah.\n\n01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920\nYeah.\n\n01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.840\nLike, oh boy, that makes me happy.\n\n01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.320\nThat is amazing.\n\n01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320\nThat is.\n\n01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.760\nThat's like if Popeye got a letter of recommendation from Spinach.\n\n01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.840\nWe just want to let you know Popeye.\n\n01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:01.000\nIt's like he'd be like, it's about time, you know, like, wait, so you, you're like\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.360\nthe Popeye of Vodka is what you're saying?\n\n01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.160\nIt's where I get my strength.\n\n01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.160\nOkay.\n\n01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.200\nI mean, my family has a relationship with.\n\n01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.320\nWhat is the, I'm imagining, because I've been to the writer's room at community up\n\n01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.600\nin Paramount and there's always giant cost-coercised bottles of Kettle One there.\n\n01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.920\nCourtesy of my assistant Spencer.\n\n01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.920\nOh, well, fuck it, let's bring him out on that.\n\n01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.920\nSpencer, everybody, come on out.\n\n01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920\nSpencer.\n\n01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920\nYeah.\n\n01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920\nWhat's up?\n\n01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:46.280\nI saw that in the mail before you did, Dan, about your club ownership or whatever.\n\n01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.280\nAlliance membership.\n\n01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.280\nYeah.\n\n01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280\nYeah.\n\n01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.360\nYou don't seem stoked.\n\n01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.840\nI mean, I'm not getting any free vodka.\n\n01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:57.840\nYeah, you are.\n\n01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840\nYou're getting free vodka.\n\n01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840\nIt's cutting into my job, like making sure he has steady access to vodka is a huge responsibility\n\n01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840\nof mine.\n\n01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.520\nOh, so you're saying you might be getting made redundant because.\n\n01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.520\nYeah.\n\n01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.560\nAnd I mean, he has a concierge service, like.\n\n01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.280\nOh, don't worry about that.\n\n01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280\nThat's the same thing.\n\n01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280\nDid you get concierge service?\n\n01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280\nYes.\n\n01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.280\nWell, it says concierge is really, what does that really mean?\n\n01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.320\nDon't bring you the vodka.\n\n01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.480\nThat's what that means.\n\n01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.880\nYou can call him at midnight and be like, I need some fucking vodka and at 12 or five,\n\n01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880\nyour doorbell.\n\n01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880\nYeah.\n\n01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.880\nYou really think that's what it is?\n\n01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880\nWell, yes.\n\n01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.080\nDrew Carey had like a Budweiser, like that kind of hookup where he said Budweiser.\n\n01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.080\nHe's Drew Carey.\n\n01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:46.360\nI guess he is the Budweiser of comedies at any point that is not an insult that I love\n\n01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360\nDrew Carey.\n\n01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.320\nI think he's fucking hilarious.\n\n01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320\nHe's the king of beers.\n\n01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.920\nI said that because the joke was there, but I think he's hilarious.\n\n01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.920\nHe's great.\n\n01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.080\nBut if at any point Drew Carey picks up a certain, like the calls a number, a truck\n\n01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:05.200\npulls up at his house with kegs or cases or whatever he wants, like the Budweiser is\n\n01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.360\non the house, like forever.\n\n01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360\nYeah.\n\n01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360\nWell, that's you.\n\n01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.360\nWhat cattle won?\n\n01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360\nAnd you're like.\n\n01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.440\nI want that with Vivian Westwood suits.\n\n01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.120\nI want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want a fucking giant black truck to pull up\n\n01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.440\nlike Knight Rider and there just be a giant rack of suits at all, all size 54 UK size.\n\n01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.520\nAnd I just, just, I want them to just like, just push it all into my place.\n\n01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.520\nYeah.\n\n01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520\nHuh.\n\n01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.920\nI don't know what mine would be.\n\n01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.200\nI guess video games.\n\n01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200\nI would take some.\n\n01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.200\nOh man.\n\n01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.200\nYeah.\n\n01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:45.120\nI want to read the Xbox Alliance.\n\n01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.120\nAll right.\n\n01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.480\nCamille, not to be provocative, but, uh, and not to, not, not to like probe in a, in a\n\n01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.640\nweird way, but how do you feel about he'll pop?\n\n01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640\nAbout what?\n\n01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640\nHe'll popping.\n\n01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.200\nOh, I've never been, I, I feel like, okay, so people talk about fetishes and stuff.\n\n01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.400\nI don't have any, but just cause I'm still just happy to be there.\n\n01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:13.920\nYou know, like, I'm just like so grateful genuinely just to sort of be involved in the\n\n01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:19.280\nprocess of sex, but that's, that's once you're, you're in a room with a naked lady.\n\n01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280\nThat's how we all feel.\n\n01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.120\nBut what, is there anything that turns your head and like, like makes your brain spark?\n\n01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:30.000\nI've been married for six years and I am still, will take any part of her that she\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.680\nlet me have, seriously, I mean, it sounds withholding, but still sexy.\n\n01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.680\nNumber one is the butt.\n\n01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.680\nHer most precious prize.\n\n01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:52.600\nThat was an anal sex joke about my wife.\n\n01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.600\nReally horrible.\n\n01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.480\nFor me, for me, like, like, when I watch porn and I do, of course, as we all must.\n\n01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.480\nYeah.\n\n01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.600\nSo, somebody's, somebody's given it a look, somebody's watching it.\n\n01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600\nYeah.\n\n01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600\nYeah.\n\n01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600\nThere's certainly an industry.\n\n01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.320\nHere's, I have a couple of notes for the porn people.\n\n01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.800\nLearn how to fucking hold a camera and then get the girl in the frame, like, like, there's\n\n01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.800\nthe girl in the frame.\n\n01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.800\nThere's headroom.\n\n01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800\nYou had one job.\n\n01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.640\nWhy is there, there's six feet of headroom and I can't see her legs and like, get the\n\n01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.680\ngal in the shot.\n\n01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680\nHere's my other.\n\n01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.040\nI don't like it when they, when the girl looks in, into the camera, because that, I'm like,\n\n01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.560\nI don't know why they keep doing that.\n\n01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.440\nI don't, I know I'm not there, I'm not an idiot.\n\n01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.440\nBecause they're not, they're not theatrically trained.\n\n01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.440\nNo.\n\n01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.680\nBut they're like, talk to the camera and I'm like, not at my best right now.\n\n01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.480\nLike, I don't want to see you, I don't want you to see me like this and also horrible\n\n01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.480\nright now.\n\n01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.920\nTo the extent that I'm immersed at all, I'm pretending to be the guy, so then you're\n\n01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.840\nlooking and the weirdest thing is when they, they, they do what they're doing to the fella\n\n01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.640\nand then they're looking at the camera and going, you like that?\n\n01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.640\nYou like the way I do that?\n\n01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640\nI'm like, well, what now?\n\n01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.640\nHow am I involved?\n\n01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640\nI'm not involved.\n\n01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.640\nI know.\n\n01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.640\nWho's that?\n\n01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.640\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640\nDo I like that?\n\n01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640\nWell, ask him.\n\n01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.960\nI, I don't, I don't, I wouldn't be watching it.\n\n01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.920\nI don't want them to ask him because the fuck when the guys talk, it's over.\n\n01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920\nIt's fucking over.\n\n01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.200\nAnd also, will the guys stop putting their fingers in the girl's mouth?\n\n01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.920\nWill you, can you please stop fish-hooking and doing that douchey shit?\n\n01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.320\nWell, there's a lot of like that weird violence.\n\n01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.520\nI, I, I feel like there's a lot of incredible rampant misogyny in porn.\n\n01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.400\nI was like, you don't like fucking her.\n\n01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.360\nTherefore, she doesn't like being fucked by you.\n\n01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.280\nAnd now nobody wins.\n\n01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.240\nThe biggest turn on for me in porn is when the gal at least appears, hopefully realistically\n\n01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.480\nis enjoying it.\n\n01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.320\nThat's why I like, this is weird.\n\n01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.920\nI go, I, if there's like a squirting one, I go for that because then I'm like, oh,\n\n01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.160\nfor sure she's into it.\n\n01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160\nOh yeah.\n\n01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:06.400\nSquirting, squirting's great, but it's always that fucking Scytheria chick is fucking weird.\n\n01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.400\nShe's good at it.\n\n01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400\nI don't like when it gets on the camera.\n\n01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.400\nShe's weird.\n\n01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400\nShe's not.\n\n01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.920\nYou don't like it when a droplet hits the lens because it's like, it takes you out of\n\n01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.920\nit.\n\n01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920\nYeah.\n\n01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.240\nBecause it's not like, you know, like in video games now when it rains, it gets on the screen.\n\n01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.440\nAnd then I think of that.\n\n01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.800\nAnd then I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't like that.\n\n01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.280\nIt's not the act of squirting.\n\n01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.480\nIt's just the idea of she wants to be there.\n\n01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:35.280\nWhat's amazing about squirting is it's physical, empirical evidence that the girl enjoyed herself.\n\n01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.280\nThat's what I like.\n\n01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.280\nIt's proof.\n\n01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280\nYou know what I also don't like?\n\n01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.600\nBut often supported by an on-site special effects crew.\n\n01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.720\nI mean, there's an online, like, there is a lot where I'm like, that was, you should\n\n01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.160\nbe hydrating because.\n\n01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160\nThere's a lot of.\n\n01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160\nYou think so?\n\n01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.160\nYes.\n\n01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160\nIt's trickery.\n\n01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.160\nYeah.\n\n01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.160\nIt's, it's sort of a stunt.\n\n01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.160\nAm I, am I being lied to by the porn industry?\n\n01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:05.400\nUm, but isn't it interesting when we talked about the dichotomy between gay and straight,\n\n01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.680\nthe other interesting thing is the dichotomy between, which, which, which it's, it's actually\n\n01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:16.160\nremarkable how this threshold has been able to maintain itself in a society which clearly\n\n01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.080\nholds nothing sacred anymore, in which there's network shows called who wants to marry a\n\n01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:27.160\ndwarf or, you know, who wants to eat spider shit for, for, for a, for a chance at a Verizon\n\n01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160\njob.\n\n01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.800\nLike, like we, we are in the darkest days possible.\n\n01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.160\nWe are, what is on our TV is what was on the TV in the background of time bandits.\n\n01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.480\nLike we, we are, we, we have, we have gone beyond the pale of Paddy Chayefsky's vision\n\n01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.480\nand network all the way into just like people hanging upside down over lava and going, are\n\n01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.480\nyou afraid to die, you dumb bitch?\n\n01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.480\nOkay.\n\n01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480\n$5,000.\n\n01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.680\nUm, but, but we maintain this sexual obsession.\n\n01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680\nI read for that.\n\n01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.320\nThere's a dichotomy between what we call pornography and what we call reality.\n\n01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.760\nWhen the truth is like, like pornography, when you really use that word correctly, everything\n\n01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.320\nin our society has become pornography.\n\n01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.840\nIt's all for the prairie and interest.\n\n01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.480\nIt's all just garbage.\n\n01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.800\nUm, none of it is for the furtherment of the fucking species.\n\n01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.840\nSo, and yet we are so, it's, it's, it's interesting and I'm good.\n\n01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.360\nI'm not going to be cynical about it.\n\n01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:29.200\nI'm going to, I'm going to say this is adorable about us that we are so obsessed with sex.\n\n01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.240\nSo in love with it and consider it so powerful that we have, we still have been able to maintain\n\n01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.920\nthe schism so that the people that are willing to have sex on camera are, you know, the guy,\n\n01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.440\nI'll just talk about the guys cause I don't want to, you know, we've had Dan and our friend\n\n01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:49.320\nDana D'Armanda on here and like, like I'm not going to, uh, I, I, I don't want to add\n\n01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.240\nto the fucking landfill of misogyny that must be rampant in the, in that when you go into\n\n01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.360\na pornography, so let's just talk about the guys.\n\n01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.840\nThere's no chance of being politically incorrect about that.\n\n01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:03.640\nThe dumbest fucking people in the world are the only people that are willing to do it.\n\n01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.240\nLike the guy, like the, when they improvise their dialogue and the things that they say\n\n01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.440\nto the women, when they're so like, like, like, she's, she's on the hook.\n\n01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.040\nShe's willing to have sex with you on camera.\n\n01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.760\nYou don't have to, you don't have to spike that football.\n\n01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.040\nOh, what are you saying?\n\n01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.040\nI just blush.\n\n01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.040\nI'm like, you're, oh God.\n\n01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040\nNo.\n\n01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040\nJust tell her you love her.\n\n01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:32.080\nI mean, it might not be true, but either is the idea of like, like slapping the face\n\n01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:41.080\nwith your dick and your, yeah, it's just the weird urban inflection, you grew up rich.\n\n01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:44.160\nCan everybody, can everybody stop spitting on everything?\n\n01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.320\nLike the fucking spitting is fucking.\n\n01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.400\nCan everything stop being like fucking crooked and pierced and covered with butterflies?\n\n01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.480\nAnd like, what about the poor little 40 year old guy with a little dick just wants to watch\n\n01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.280\na librarian say, your books are overdue.\n\n01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:06.040\nIf you owe me so much money and have the guy like Ron Jeremy or something like troll like\n\n01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:12.280\nguy that represents me go, but I don't have any money.\n\n01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.280\nWell you're going to have to do something because this book is overdue.\n\n01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.280\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.280\nRefusal of the call.\n\n01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.280\nYeah.\n\n01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.280\nPowerful.\n\n01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280\nPowerful.\n\n01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:36.280\nMakes, makes, makes a person hard as a diamond, thresholds, goddesses, atonements with fathers.\n\n01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:44.960\nDon't take that literally, but, but that is Debbie does Dallas is a big atonement with\n\n01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:50.360\nthe father in there called doing Debbie.\n\n01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.960\nI think it's weird to think about how it's the only industry I can think of that could\n\n01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.360\nend right now and we would be fine forever because there is so much porn out there.\n\n01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360\nOh yeah.\n\n01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.360\nThe worst would be before you die, you have to watch one video for the second time.\n\n01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360\nYeah.\n\n01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.360\nLike you could watch porn every single day.\n\n01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.360\nLike if we stop making salt at some point, we're going to be like, we need some fucking\n\n01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.360\nsalt, but with porn, there's always so much porn.\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:26.360\nWe've been fucking great at it for so long, but porn is something where like you, you\n\n01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.360\nhave that one image that one video that you can go back to over and over again.\n\n01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.360\nThat's like that one for some reason is potent.\n\n01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360\nLike the way they make eye contact or something.\n\n01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.360\nI had this weird thing when I was a kid, I had a very, very religious Muslim upbringing.\n\n01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.360\nSo I found porn, but I would feel like immense amount of guilt for it.\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:50.360\nSo I would always watch it, but I had to be done before they achieved penetration.\n\n01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.360\nAlso the fact that I call it achieved.\n\n01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360\nAnd done.\n\n01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.360\nSo just how far away outside my reality was.\n\n01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.360\nXbox Alliance.\n\n01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360\nXbox Alliance.\n\n01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360\nAchievement unlocked, yeah.\n\n01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360\nYeah.\n\n01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.360\nSo I would watch it, but right before they actually started fucking, I had to like come\n\n01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.360\nand be done before that because then I thought that it was, that then it wasn't a sin.\n\n01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360\nHmm.\n\n01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.360\nI like, I like when the gals enjoy it and I want the guys to have a giant dick and not\n\n01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.360\ntalk.\n\n01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360\nDon't talk.\n\n01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.360\nYou don't like them to talk even if it's not like terrible talk.\n\n01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.360\nIf they talk, it better be fucking interesting and fucking.\n\n01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.360\nIt better be.\n\n01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.360\nMy life is in this here in Yellow Leaf, Leon McDuff.\n\n01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.360\nYou want them to talk about how we don't use words enough?\n\n01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360\nShit.\n\n01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.360\nThe girl says, hopefully you'll let me suck your dick again to the guy.\n\n01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.360\nYou just, his voice above the camera goes like, actually hopefully used as an adverb\n\n01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.360\nas being misappropriated there.\n\n01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.360\nIf you're saying that you would like to suck my dick in full of hope.\n\n01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360\nIt's so ironic you're eating my pussy.\n\n01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360\nIt's not ironic.\n\n01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360\nIt's coincidental.\n\n01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.360\nTwo titties emerged in a yellow wood.\n\n01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.360\nAnd I chose the one less nibbled on.\n\n01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.360\nI've been obsessed with the number 9-11 for many years.\n\n01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360\nI'll expand on it while you suck my balls.\n\n01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:18.360\nI used to have dreams of you rubbing my nuts like this and now it's happening.\n\n01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:26.360\nSpencer, let's play some Dungeons and Dragons, shall we?\n\n01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.360\nLet's do that.\n\n01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.360\nOr do you, or does Spencer want to talk about his debut as a network single actor?\n\n01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.360\nFuck D&D.\n\n01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.360\nLet's talk about that.\n\n01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.360\nThat's better.\n\n01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.360\nYeah, going from sex to the polar opposite of sex doesn't seem like a good transition.\n\n01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.360\nI crave nothing more after sex than Dungeons and Dragons, but...\n\n01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:53.360\nWell, that's funny because when I play Dungeons and Dragons, I crave nothing more than sex.\n\n01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360\nIt's a game that...\n\n01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.360\nI combine D&D with sex because I fuck every goddamn thing I meet.\n\n01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.360\nBut, yeah, I mean, I kind of dropped it on you like a sandbag.\n\n01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.360\nYeah.\n\n01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.360\nAnd I did that because I didn't want you to have to worry about whether or not you were\n\n01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360\nsupposed to say yes or no to it.\n\n01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.360\nI just wanted you to have the luxury of having it thrust upon you.\n\n01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.360\nYeah, no, it was a really good methodology there.\n\n01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.360\nWhen did you do it?\n\n01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360\nWhen was this?\n\n01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360\nIt was Monday and Wednesday.\n\n01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.360\nOh, wow.\n\n01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360\nIt was my days.\n\n01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.360\nAnd without...\n\n01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360\nHe was in a total of four scenes, right?\n\n01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.360\nHe was like a legitimate guest star role.\n\n01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.360\nHave you ever done any television, like any acting, learning lines, any theater in school\n\n01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360\nor anything?\n\n01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360\nNo.\n\n01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.360\nI mean, when I was in college, I took a speech class, but you didn't even have to, like,\n\n01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360\nmemorize, so...\n\n01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.360\nSo what was it like for you to get a script, have these lines?\n\n01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.360\nLike, what was your process?\n\n01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.360\nI vomited a lot.\n\n01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360\nDid you really?\n\n01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360\nI mean, not like a lot.\n\n01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360\nBut you did.\n\n01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.360\nAnd then it goes a long way with vomit.\n\n01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.360\nYeah, that's my rule when it comes to vomit.\n\n01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360\nYeah.\n\n01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360\nYou did vomit because you were nervous?\n\n01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.360\nYeah, I mean, the Harmontown, you know, Die Hard Harmontown fans will know I feel like shit\n\n01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:17.360\na lot because a combination of weird anxiety and eating garbage 100% of the time makes\n\n01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360\nme feel weird.\n\n01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.360\nSo, like, sometimes when I come to Harmontown, I'm feeling weird, and that's what it is.\n\n01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360\nIt's just these two things.\n\n01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360\nSo that's what was happening.\n\n01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:31.360\nIt makes you understand why, you know, famous people are all about health, because, like,\n\n01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.360\nyou can't afford not to be healthy if you're vomiting when you're supposed to be in front\n\n01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360\nof the camera, like, you're fucked, right?\n\n01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360\nYeah, you can't be sick at all.\n\n01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360\nYeah.\n\n01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.360\nI don't get why people...\n\n01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360\nDid you have a good time?\n\n01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.360\nHow was it?\n\n01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.360\nIt was, like, it was really nerve-wracking because, I mean, I don't even talk to people\n\n01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360\nthat are near me.\n\n01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:57.360\nBut he was, yeah, he's doing scenes with, like, I'll make arbitrary decisions about what's\n\n01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.360\na spoiler and what's not, but he was doing scenes with Danny Pudi, Allison Brie, and\n\n01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.360\nBrie Larson, like, and he was the fourth and was an equal part of all of these scenes.\n\n01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.360\nOh, that's great.\n\n01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360\nAnd I can't express enough how...\n\n01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:15.360\nMuch I'd like to finish a sentence without being applauded.\n\n01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.360\nThat's your curse.\n\n01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.360\nThat's just, like, the Midas touch and many, many, many, like, punchlines.\n\n01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:28.360\nLike, I just created a character that was, like, like, I did my best to go, like, okay,\n\n01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.360\nit doesn't matter if you are nervous or if you, you know, that it would just be, like,\n\n01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360\nbecause you seem unflappable.\n\n01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.360\nLike, a lot of people cannot handle if you go, like, oh, we like you.\n\n01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.360\nWhy don't you stand up on this slightly higher platform because of what we like about you?\n\n01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:49.360\nWell, most of us, like, when we step onto that higher platform, we start to become so\n\n01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:57.360\nconscious of the meta context that we actually, we kind of can't keep being the version of\n\n01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360\nourselves that the people value down here.\n\n01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360\nYeah.\n\n01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.360\nBut we brought you out of the audience and you're a dungeon master.\n\n01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360\nWe brought you on tour.\n\n01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.360\nYou're in Brooklyn.\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.360\n400 people are giving you a standing ovation for rolling dice and stuff.\n\n01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.360\nAnd it's just, like, you're kind of unflappable.\n\n01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.360\nMaybe you're puking in the bathroom, I guess we're learning, but, but, but, and I was like,\n\n01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.360\nThat's, that's all though.\n\n01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.360\nI mean, I did that at my old jobs and stuff too.\n\n01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.360\nBut, but I was very serious to see.\n\n01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.360\nThat's your process.\n\n01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.360\nBecause now you're beyond anything that I think I would be willing to do.\n\n01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:31.360\nI don't think I would have been, I don't, they're on that, on the set of community,\n\n01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:39.360\nthey're, it's, it's like, like, just lights and a lot of them and like people hanging from\n\n01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360\nrafters and you're used to it.\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.360\nLike literally in the rafters, like you'll hear someone talking like seven feet above\n\n01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360\nyour head.\n\n01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360\nYeah.\n\n01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.360\nHoly shit.\n\n01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.360\nAnd hundreds of people in the, in the space around you, everything is an illusion.\n\n01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.360\nWhat you see on TV is an apartment, but it is a crowd.\n\n01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.360\nIt is a town hall meeting surrounding you and three cameras on giant dollies.\n\n01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:07.360\nAnd it gets, it's, I don't know how, I don't know how, how, how, how, to what extent I'd\n\n01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:12.360\nbe able to act naturally in that environment and actors have to have a kind of psychosis\n\n01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.360\nbecause they have to know that the camera's there and they have to act like they don't\n\n01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.360\nknow it's there.\n\n01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.360\nBut they also have to act in a way that no one would act in real life because the camera\n\n01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360\nneeds them to act a certain way.\n\n01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360\nThey need to keep their chin up.\n\n01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:28.360\nBut Spencer's kind of a slam dunk for that because he, like, you're, you're, you, we only\n\n01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.360\nknow you on camera.\n\n01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:34.360\nYou're on stage and nobody asked you to be, you're on camera in the documentary, nobody\n\n01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.360\nasked you to be like, your, your persona is the Spencer that we know, which is the guy\n\n01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360\nthat's like, why is everybody looking at me?\n\n01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360\nYeah, maybe.\n\n01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:47.360\nBut you, whether you're inwardly or, you know, you're shitting like a Canadian goose, like\n\n01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360\nwe don't know.\n\n01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:52.360\nLike outwardly, you're just being Spencer that we all know and love.\n\n01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360\nYeah.\n\n01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.360\nI can foresee you standing next to like Joaquin Phoenix, like presenting an award at like\n\n01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.360\nin two years.\n\n01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.360\nI could see that.\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360\nYeah.\n\n01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.360\nNot that that's an important goal, but I think it's, I think, I think it's interesting.\n\n01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.360\nThat's great.\n\n01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.360\nI can't wait to see it.\n\n01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.360\nSpencer, real quick, before we play D&D for a moment, weird fetish.\n\n01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.360\nUm, I like it when the clothes are off.\n\n01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.360\nWhat a weirdo.\n\n01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:26.360\nCan I say one thing about the, what percentage gay do you think Spencer is?\n\n01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.360\nHuh?\n\n01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360\nWhat percentage gay do you think?\n\n01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.360\nI'm a zero on the Kinsey scale, I think, am I getting there?\n\n01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.360\nYou're pretty straight.\n\n01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360\nYou mean?\n\n01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.360\nYeah.\n\n01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:39.520\nI will say this about myself is that one of my biggest regrets is going to be that I'll\n\n01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.860\nprobably die without ever having sucked a penis.\n\n01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:49.860\nNot because I just feel like it's an experience that so many people have and I just want to\n\n01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:53.360\nbe able to relate to it.\n\n01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360\nAnd it's never going to happen.\n\n01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.360\nI don't want to fuck a dude in the ass.\n\n01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360\nI think most people would let a guy go down on them.\n\n01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.360\nI think that's fine.\n\n01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:06.360\nBut, but like sucking a penis is such a specific thing and I'll never have it.\n\n01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:10.360\nCamille, you can do anything you want.\n\n01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:11.360\nYou know what?\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360\nIt's crazy to me.\n\n01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.360\nCan we turn the lights down real quick?\n\n01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.360\nIn movies and stuff when you get introduced to, uh...\n\n01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360\nOh!\n\n01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360\nOh, Camille!\n\n01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360\nCamille!\n\n01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:27.360\nLike in...\n\n01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:34.360\nHey, not bad first time out, huh?\n\n01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.360\nWhat were you saying?\n\n01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360\nI didn't mean to step on that bit.\n\n01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.360\nI didn't know.\n\n01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.360\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360\nIt wasn't even...\n\n01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.360\nWhat were you saying?\n\n01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:48.360\nWell, it's interesting to me like a closeted gay culture in movies, like in other words,\n\n01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:56.360\narchetypes where you in movies and TV when closeted gay men are represented in media,\n\n01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:04.360\nlike the idea that they pay money for the privilege of blowing another dude, which is\n\n01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360\nreally profound.\n\n01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.360\nAnd interesting because it's like, oh my God, that's how repressed we are.\n\n01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:15.360\nThat men who are pigs and who don't care about anything with themselves and that they could\n\n01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:22.360\nbe so fenced in psychologically that they would give money something they don't give\n\n01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360\nto...\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nThey're like, can I give you $50?\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360\nCan I just give you pleasure, another guy?\n\n01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.360\nThat's really profound to me.\n\n01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.360\nI think that's the one thing that is definitely...\n\n01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360\nThat's definitely gay.\n\n01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.360\nIf you're fucking a dude in the ass, you could be like, oh, this is a woman.\n\n01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.360\nIf someone's fucking you in the ass, it could be a woman with a strap on.\n\n01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.360\nBut if you're sucking a penis, you're definitely sucking a penis, you know?\n\n01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.360\nThere's no...\n\n01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.360\nSo I think if you're someone that's a very tough stance to take, no jobs are great.\n\n01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:55.360\nI think it's a Drew Carey's joke.\n\n01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.360\nYou know you're gay when you're sucking a guy's dick, but you're thinking about another\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360\nguy's dick.\n\n01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360\nThat's gay.\n\n01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:15.360\nIt's kind of a Budweiser-y joke because I prefer something more important than that.\n\n01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.360\nMore alliance-y, if you will.\n\n01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.360\nI like that it's an alliance.\n\n01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.360\nYou're like part of NATO now.\n\n01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.360\nYeah, I feel like...\n\n01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360\nCan we get a list of the other people who are currently in NATO?\n\n01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.360\nYou don't think they frown on me, like humble bragging or bragging or whatever.\n\n01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.360\nThey like it, right?\n\n01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360\nThis is what they want.\n\n01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.360\nDo you think it's tacky?\n\n01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.360\nThey're like, don't tell them about the alliance.\n\n01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:42.360\nI would venture a guess and say that you'd be disappointed to find out who's also received\n\n01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360\nthat email.\n\n01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.360\nSeth Green.\n\n01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360\nJeremy Piven.\n\n01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.360\nJeremy Piven.\n\n01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.360\nDefinitely.\n\n01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.360\nBut this time Jeremy Piven probably has a humanitas, you hang out long enough.\n\n01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.360\nYeah, he's been around a while.\n\n01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360\nLook, time is short.\n\n01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.360\nLet's play a little bit of D&D.\n\n01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.360\nYeah, come on.\n\n01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360\nJust give us a...\n\n01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.360\nGive it to us.\n\n01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.360\nGive us a sweet taste, Spencer Shaik.\n\n01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360\nI always do.\n\n01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.360\nI don't get it.\n\n01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:21.360\nLast time on Harmontown, our heroes clashed with Admiral Darkstar at the top of his black\n\n01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360\nkeep.\n\n01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.880\nThe Admiral thought the heroes were playing into his hands, but Darkstar had a rude awakening\n\n01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.680\nas he realized the shards were nowhere to be found.\n\n01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.520\nAfter yet more disappointment, Chris de Burgh knocked Admiral Darkstar from his post onto\n\n01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:45.040\nthe ground, where he was then sat upon by Mulraine.\n\n01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.000\nSharpie cast reduced person on himself, and as a miniature man tried to trick the Dark\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.320\nLord by conjuring a crude figment of what he hoped would be the demonic warlord's mother.\n\n01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.040\nWhen it failed to beguile Darkstar, Sharpie broke out into rap.\n\n01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.040\nWhat did it mean?\n\n01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.440\nHow did the rap play out in terms of combat time?\n\n01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440\nWas it actually canon?\n\n01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.440\nWe'll find out tonight.\n\n01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.440\nThat's it.\n\n01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.440\nThat's all I got.\n\n01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.920\nDan, should we get Ian?\n\n01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920\nHe's here tonight to play Mulraine?\n\n01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.400\nYou want Ian to play Mulraine?\n\n01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.440\nIan, get out of the genre and come up and play Mulraine for us.\n\n01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:35.680\nIan, everybody.\n\n01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.720\nSo yeah, Ian played us Chris de Burgh last week.\n\n01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.040\nYeah, it was you last week.\n\n01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.040\nHow was it?\n\n01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.040\nIt was hard.\n\n01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040\nIt was hard?\n\n01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.040\nHe kicked some ass.\n\n01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.040\nI did kick some ass.\n\n01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.280\nI had some good weapons.\n\n01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.280\nReally?\n\n01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280\nI've never looked.\n\n01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.960\nHe just keeps tying a rope to a dagger.\n\n01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.880\nDid you know you have a Bola?\n\n01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.160\nEbola?\n\n01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.880\nI don't know how that's a weapon.\n\n01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.160\nI give it to other people.\n\n01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.760\nYou could weaponize it.\n\n01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.760\nIt's a Bola.\n\n01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.760\nA weapon.\n\n01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.760\nA Bola.\n\n01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760\nLike, you throw it.\n\n01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.760\nOh, it's like a ropey thing?\n\n01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.760\nWas it?\n\n01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.760\nYeah.\n\n01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.760\nIt has ropes on it.\n\n01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:11.760\nI know you like ropes.\n\n01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.760\nYeah, I've been doing ropes.\n\n01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.360\nIt's like a cat or nine tails, kind of.\n\n01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.600\nIt's like two weights separated by a cord, and you whip one around like a lasso and\n\n01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.960\nlet it go, and then it'll wrap around.\n\n01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.600\nOh, around people's legs and stuff?\n\n01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:25.600\nYeah.\n\n01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.600\nLike a kinect.\n\n01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.600\nLike superheroes.\n\n01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.600\nLike Batman has a thing like that.\n\n01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.600\nYeah.\n\n01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.600\nCool.\n\n01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.600\nHe was the superhero I was thinking of.\n\n01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.040\nOkay, so Spencer, give us the physical layout, where we're all standing and what we're doing\n\n01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.040\nright now.\n\n01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.040\nYou're in a room.\n\n01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.360\nIt's rather unadorned, except there's a big pillar of black crystal, and on the ground\n\n01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.560\nis Admiral Darkstar is being set upon by Moraine.\n\n01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.560\nThere's an illusion of a woman standing nearby.\n\n01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.560\nThere's what?\n\n01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:54.800\nAn illusion of a woman standing nearby that Sharpie had conjured and was talking about\n\n01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.880\nbuying dicks off.\n\n01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.360\nI think she's an older lady, right?\n\n01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360\nYeah, definitely older.\n\n01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360\nSomeone's mom.\n\n01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.360\nYeah.\n\n01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360\nI have a wire saw.\n\n01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.360\nYeah.\n\n01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360\nThis is great.\n\n01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360\nYeah, man.\n\n01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360\nThere's two pages.\n\n01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360\nI put a lot of thought into these things.\n\n01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.720\nAll right, so what's going on with Darkstar?\n\n01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.200\nHe's being set on.\n\n01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.200\nIs he...\n\n01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.560\nHe's not digging it so much.\n\n01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.240\nCan I take my wire saw to his head?\n\n01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.240\nYou can try.\n\n01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:27.040\nAdmiral Darkstar, we're about to take a wire saw to your head.\n\n01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.160\nDo you have anything to say about that?\n\n01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.160\nYeah.\n\n01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160\nThat's good.\n\n01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.840\nWhat do you say about that?\n\n01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.440\nHe has nothing to say.\n\n01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.440\nAll right.\n\n01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.440\nYou're just saying nothing?\n\n01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440\nYeah.\n\n01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.440\nWho knows?\n\n01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.160\nHe's definitely not saying anything.\n\n01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.160\nWait a minute.\n\n01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.160\nDo it.\n\n01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.160\nYou're so...\n\n01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.920\nYour trademark is your speaking voice, Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.920\nSpeak.\n\n01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:53.920\nI think it's because I'm sitting on him.\n\n01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.920\nMaybe I should move.\n\n01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920\nYeah.\n\n01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920\nNo, don't move.\n\n01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:59.840\nIt's because he's being set on.\n\n01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.840\nOkay.\n\n01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.360\nThat's why he's not talking.\n\n01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.880\nI kiss him.\n\n01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.600\nWell, you'd have to move more rain.\n\n01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.600\nWell, no, I don't.\n\n01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.480\nI can bend down and kiss his face.\n\n01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.080\nHis face is being set on.\n\n01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.080\nOh, he's...\n\n01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080\nHe's going on his face.\n\n01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.080\nI'll take it.\n\n01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.080\nYeah.\n\n01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.080\nDidn't I say that?\n\n01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.680\nSo, how would I cut his...\n\n01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.080\nI guess sort of sideways, top of his head, cut it like that.\n\n01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.360\nI mean, I'd start at the neck.\n\n01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.160\nBut isn't the neck being set on?\n\n01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.720\nWell, the face is being set on.\n\n01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.040\nI mean, presumably the neck has a bit of a exposure.\n\n01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.640\nCan I get into a flanking position and be ready to fuck him?\n\n01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640\nYes.\n\n01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640\nAll right.\n\n01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.120\nI go to his neck and I start cutting his neck.\n\n01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.560\nYou start cutting his neck.\n\n01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560\nLet me see.\n\n01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.560\nOh, God.\n\n01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.320\nTime to get some head and I start sawing.\n\n01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.560\nI'm not happy with it.\n\n01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.560\nAnd I say, already am.\n\n01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.400\nRight now?\n\n01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.600\nYou hear a pain like screaming, muffled, coming through like armor and anus.\n\n01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.600\nThis is awful.\n\n01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.640\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.640\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640\nWe want to kill this guy, right?\n\n01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.040\nWe've already beaten him.\n\n01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.080\nWe're cutting his head off surgically.\n\n01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.280\nHis limbs are flailing around.\n\n01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.560\nIt's a little Taliban, sure.\n\n01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560\nI stop.\n\n01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.880\nI have my pants down around my ankles behind him and I look at Sharpie and go, wait, wait,\n\n01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.160\nis there a flag in the play?\n\n01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.160\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.200\nWell, why do we not like this guy?\n\n01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.720\nBecause he does stuff like this?\n\n01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:38.080\nI mean, like, what is the difference between him and us if this is how we beat him?\n\n01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.000\nHe has represented evil the entire time we've ever heard him say.\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.240\nHe just wanted some shards of power and had some UFOs and stuff.\n\n01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.240\nOkay.\n\n01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.960\nI keep my pants down around my ankles and I back off and I give the floor to Sharpie.\n\n01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:56.720\nI stop and I go, I'm sorry, and then Mulraine, could you get off his face?\n\n01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.720\nI just, okay.\n\n01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720\nThis is a bad idea.\n\n01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.720\nI get off his face.\n\n01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.720\nWho's going to tie his head off?\n\n01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:09.120\nAlso, Spencer, real quick, could you physically describe Admiral Darkstar right now?\n\n01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.400\nYeah, he looks like he's, you know, just wearing black armor.\n\n01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.160\nHe can't see any part of him.\n\n01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.160\nWhat size is he?\n\n01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160\nIs he a regular humanoid?\n\n01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.000\nHe's like six foot tall and he has a horned helmet on the black cape.\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.280\nEverything's all black and matte.\n\n01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.720\nAll right, so we all get off him and we give him some space because Sharpie wants to have\n\n01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.200\na little coffee clutch with him.\n\n01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.760\nI go, look, we can kill you if we want.\n\n01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.280\nWe were cutting your neck off, head off.\n\n01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.800\nWe could have done it before you had freedom.\n\n01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.120\nI mean, you say those things, I guess.\n\n01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.120\nWhat is he doing?\n\n01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.800\nHe's just staring at you guys.\n\n01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.600\nHe pulls himself to his feet.\n\n01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.600\nWhat?\n\n01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.600\nNo, he's sitting down.\n\n01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.160\nWhen I kick him back down, that happens.\n\n01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:05.960\nThat was not an invitation to be equals with us.\n\n01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.160\nThis is magnanimity.\n\n01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:12.960\nThis is, I mean, do you just want to die?\n\n01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.960\nYes or no?\n\n01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.960\nNo!\n\n01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.680\nSee, he doesn't want to die.\n\n01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:18.680\nThat's how he sounds?\n\n01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.680\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.680\nYes.\n\n01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.680\nYes, the best.\n\n01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.440\nHe sounds like Axl Rose.\n\n01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.840\nLet's just tie him up and take him with us on our next adventure.\n\n01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.840\nDo you know where you are?\n\n01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.840\nWhat?\n\n01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840\nThat's all right.\n\n01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840\nWhat?\n\n01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.840\nYou in my keep now.\n\n01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.960\nI make the rules.\n\n01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.800\nYou have to understand it doesn't look like that to us.\n\n01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.960\nHe does respond.\n\n01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.960\nIf you almost cut your head off, we totally could have.\n\n01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.960\nSo are we cool now?\n\n01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:00.960\nIf you cut my head off, I'll be more strong than you can imagine.\n\n01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:07.960\nIt's a good thing we didn't cut his head off.\n\n01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:12.960\nI love cutlerosis, so I'm bad.\n\n01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.040\nI've never just assassinated someone.\n\n01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.200\nWe've beaten him and we're just supposed to terminate his life.\n\n01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.200\nI go up to him and I rifle through his pockets.\n\n01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.920\nHe stops you.\n\n01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920\nStops you?\n\n01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920\nYeah.\n\n01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.600\nI grapple him and then try to wrestle him to the floor.\n\n01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.600\nAll right.\n\n01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.440\nWhat's your grapple bonus?\n\n01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.440\nGrapple bonus?\n\n01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.000\nI hope it's like 14 or something.\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nThat's a very good question.\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.240\nWhat's my grapple bonus?\n\n01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.240\nMy grapple?\n\n01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.920\nI'm going to call a critical fail a critical fail when I see one.\n\n01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:47.920\nOh, fuck hell.\n\n01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920\nYeah.\n\n01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.480\nSo you go to grab him and he does this weird judo move, like some sort of crazy nerd.\n\n01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.960\nAnd before you know it, you're on your back and he's like, I had a plus five grapple\n\n01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.960\nbonus.\n\n01:44:58.960 --> 01:44:59.960\nYeah.\n\n01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:00.960\nI know.\n\n01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:01.960\nThat's why I said you need like a 14 or something.\n\n01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:03.960\nYeah.\n\n01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.360\nSo now, now he's, he's over you and he's got your arm and like one of those poses when\n\n01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.800\nthe guy has your arm and it makes you not able to do stuff.\n\n01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.800\nOh yeah.\n\n01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:12.800\nThat's happening.\n\n01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.800\nOkay.\n\n01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.800\nSure.\n\n01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.440\nLike some kind of half Nelson or something?\n\n01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.440\nYeah.\n\n01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:25.240\nI do the, the WWF thing where I slap my shoulder like fake pain.\n\n01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:27.640\nI, I scorching Ray his face.\n\n01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.640\nOkay.\n\n01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.640\nWait.\n\n01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.280\nSo cutting his head off is not okay, but I had to wait like in the movies for him to\n\n01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.760\ntry to kill us.\n\n01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.760\nHe hasn't tried at all to attack us.\n\n01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760\nHe's just not very good.\n\n01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.880\nHe's tried a thousand ways to kill us over the, over the years.\n\n01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.120\nDealing 20 damage.\n\n01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.120\nNice.\n\n01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.520\nYou're scorching, you know, missile and it hits him in the face and his, his armor begins\n\n01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.200\nto glow red with heat.\n\n01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:56.120\nWhat do you, what do you, his armor starts to glow red with heat.\n\n01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.120\nYeah.\n\n01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.120\nCause he hit it with a scorching missile.\n\n01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.120\nOkay.\n\n01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.120\nSo that'll happen.\n\n01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.120\nAll right.\n\n01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.120\nWell, damage report.\n\n01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.120\nI said 20 damage.\n\n01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120\nOkay.\n\n01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.120\nYeah.\n\n01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120\nBut what is it?\n\n01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.120\nIs he dead?\n\n01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.120\nNo.\n\n01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.120\nAll right.\n\n01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120\nHe's Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120\nAll right.\n\n01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.120\nHe's not on the ground anymore.\n\n01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.680\nHe's got quark, uh, grappled to take his helmet off.\n\n01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.120\nYou could definitely ask him.\n\n01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.120\nWell, is it, is it more range turn?\n\n01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.320\nWhoever wants to ask a question, honestly, I don't, I don't want to ask him.\n\n01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.520\nI say we just tie his ass up and then we take his home.\n\n01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.520\nHe's up and about.\n\n01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.240\nNow he's got our friend hostage, which just kill him.\n\n01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.240\nI, I'm sorry.\n\n01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:38.400\nI caused an extra epilogue to killing him.\n\n01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.400\nI didn't feel comfortable sitting on a man's face and sawing his head off.\n\n01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.400\nThere's no, there's no dignity in that.\n\n01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.120\nI felt uncomfortable doing it.\n\n01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.720\nI go into the corner and start, uh, I take my shoe off.\n\n01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.720\nYou're being grappled.\n\n01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.220\nOh, I'm being grappled.\n\n01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:56.720\nWhat am I here for?\n\n01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.720\nOkay.\n\n01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:01.200\nYou go into the corner.\n\n01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.200\nOkay.\n\n01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:10.320\nWhile I'm being grappled with my right foot, I start, I start dangling my shoe.\n\n01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.960\nI dip it, I dangle it, couple, couple, couple of heel pops.\n\n01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:17.960\nPop that heel baby.\n\n01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960\nYeah.\n\n01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.960\nPop that thigh, heel pop it.\n\n01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.960\nDan.\n\n01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:21.960\nI guess.\n\n01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:22.960\nSorry.\n\n01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.960\nI thought I was going full character there.\n\n01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:35.960\nUm.\n\n01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960\nWhat do we do guys?\n\n01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960\nKill him.\n\n01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.960\nKill him.\n\n01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960\nKill him.\n\n01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:40.960\nAll right.\n\n01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:49.520\nI take out the wire saw and I go and I start sawing his neck off again and I go very loudly.\n\n01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.200\nI say, uh, this feels familiar.\n\n01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.320\nSo you start wire saw in his head and, uh, he's not doing the same thing as he did last\n\n01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.320\ntime.\n\n01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.600\nIn fact, you, you, you start, you get a few strokes in his helmet pops off and you see\n\n01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.640\nthere's no head inside.\n\n01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.800\nIt's all crazy.\n\n01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800\nYou guys.\n\n01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800\nHead.\n\n01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800\nIs that helmet?\n\n01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800\nWhat?\n\n01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:14.800\nWhat?\n\n01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:15.800\nIs there wires in there?\n\n01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.800\nNo.\n\n01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.800\nYeah.\n\n01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.800\nThere's confetti.\n\n01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.800\nIt's happy birthday.\n\n01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:26.600\nNo, inside you see billowing black smoke that pours into the room and swirls and begins\n\n01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:34.480\nswirling and continues this swirling into a black dark vortex of powerful magical energy.\n\n01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:44.280\nAnd you can hear a voice kind of, uh, kind of scream out, I told you, he did tell you.\n\n01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.280\nYeah.\n\n01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.720\nI can confirm that you become more powerful than we could possibly imagine.\n\n01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720\nSomething like that.\n\n01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.720\nI can't go that far to confirm.\n\n01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:52.720\nGod damn it.\n\n01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.720\nWe shouldn't.\n\n01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.720\nWe should have killed him.\n\n01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720\nWe shouldn't have.\n\n01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.720\nThis is like the second time you've taken off his head and something like this has happened.\n\n01:48:58.720 --> 01:48:59.720\nRight.\n\n01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:00.720\nWhat?\n\n01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.720\nYeah.\n\n01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.720\nI don't even remember the other one.\n\n01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:03.720\nThanks, Adam.\n\n01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.720\nHe knows.\n\n01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:05.720\nI think it was a tiring episode.\n\n01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:06.720\nYeah.\n\n01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.440\nI, I, I yell out, what do you want from us, Admiral Darkstar?\n\n01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.960\nYou hear no response, only the roaring vortex of magical power.\n\n01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:27.280\nDispel that shit, shut up, who has, all right, does somebody have to spell that shit on\n\n01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:29.280\ntheir character sheet?\n\n01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:36.960\nNo, it's, he might as well be calling out, achieve victory, black smoke around it.\n\n01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.960\nI cast achieve victory.\n\n01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:47.960\nYou achieve victory, because he's really just going away, right?\n\n01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.960\nI, I wave the smoke around like a spark.\n\n01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.960\nThe smoke continues to spin and it spins downward, kind of like a spiral funnel cloud.\n\n01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.960\nAnd it kind of, you see it go through the ground and then it disappears.\n\n01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.960\nYeah.\n\n01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.960\nSo it's kind of like the worst episodes of Lost.\n\n01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:02.960\nKind of.\n\n01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:10.600\nBut before you can react, you hear a rumbling followed by a cracking followed by an explosion\n\n01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.760\nof stones from the floor below.\n\n01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:21.960\nAs you see a metal clawed hand, maybe about seven feet long, seven feet in some dimension,\n\n01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.800\nsmash through the floor.\n\n01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:31.840\nIt's a metal claw and it grabs, it attempts to grab quark, it grabs quark and grabs him\n\n01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:38.240\nand begins pulling him towards this stone hole and it's like, it's, it's anxiety inducing.\n\n01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.760\nIt builds tension.\n\n01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760\nAlmost like a cliffhanger.\n\n01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760\nOh.\n\n01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760\nIt's a cliffhanger.\n\n01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.760\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.760\nThank you.\n\n01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.760\nThank you.\n\n01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:48.760\nThank you.\n\n01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760\nThank you.\n\n01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.760\nThank you.\n\n01:50:50.760 --> 01:51:03.760\nThank you, it wasn't all Harmontown, give it up for Ian.\n\n01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.760\nCamille, not Gianni.\n\n01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:10.760\nThank you, everyone.\n\n01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760\nBertie Stevens earlier on.\n\n01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.760\nThank you.\n\n01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.760\nAnd all of our lovely Harmonites and Harmonians.\n\n01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.760\nI'm Jeff James, your mayor.\n\n01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.760\nOh, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760\nHello.\n\n01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.760\nI have to go back to the community offices where the writers are waiting for me.\n\n01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:31.760\nBecause we're, we have to finish writing the episode that shoots tomorrow.\n\n01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:37.760\nSo if I'm, if I'm, if I shoot through like an aloof meteor to my car, don't judge me.\n\n01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:44.760\nWell, Special Clinton too, everybody.\n\n01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:49.760\nI meant to hit Xanadu, but my fingers are too fat and I hit a country song for no reason.\n\n01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:50.760\nSo pretend it's Xanadu.\n\n01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.760\nI love you all.\n\n01:51:51.760 --> 01:52:17.760\nI love you all. Good night.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[168200]}
