{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:26.000\nFrom the Jupiter Hotel, the Douglas Fur, Doug Fur, whatever the fuck this place is called,\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:33.000\nthe Portland, Oregon, one of the greatest cities on the planet Earth.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:41.000\nIt is my absolute pleasure to say that Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:49.000\nLet's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:58.000\nThank you. Thank you. I immediately started crying.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:02.000\nI walked out of the stage and started crying. Why? I think it's because I'm drunk.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:07.000\nI'm a servant. It's not because tonight's important.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:14.000\nPeople in the world with leukemia, why am I crying?\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nI'm crying because your donuts are great. You're a great city.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:26.000\nHow many of you are here that live in Portland?\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nSee, a lot of times, Jeff, when we go to other cities, we go like,\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nwell, who here is from Poughkeepsie?\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.000\nAnd then there's like eight people go like, I'm here.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nAnd then the rest of the people are like, I drove here from L.A.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nBecause they hate Poughkeepsie.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:46.000\nPeople love being in Portland. They fucking love it.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:51.000\nIt is a great town. I got asked, what's the guy's name? Andy?\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:57.000\nWho's running this thing? Yeah. He said, do you want to come do this festival?\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd I said, yes, can I be there for three days instead of one?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nI'd rather be in Portland than not be in Portland.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:10.000\nI scheduled extra days, too. And for Aaron's sake, I said, well,\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nI'll stay till Sunday and I'm not going to do any other shows\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\nother than Harmontown. Aaron will appreciate that.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnd then it was like gift of the UCB workshop magi that I said,\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:29.000\nI'm not doing any shows, except she's like, I'm doing nine shows a day.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:34.000\nIf you'd like to see Erin McGathy this weekend in Portland,\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\njust swing a cat. Try not to.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:44.000\nShe is in every fucking show. This side of Seattle, I don't know.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:47.000\nNo, you don't have to have a response to that.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nAll right, let's get on track. I don't want to have a sloppy show tonight.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:55.000\nYou've paid a lot of money. I am not drunk. I didn't do anything wrong.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:00.000\nYou're drunk as a fucking fiddler right now. So drunk.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nHe's lying.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:06.000\nI met you for breakfast. You were drunk when you showed up for breakfast.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nWell, I was hungover. We were all hungover.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:15.000\nWe all know what happened yesterday. We all got drunk.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:21.000\nSo then when you're hungover, you drink through it.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nYou don't go like, I'm hungover. I'm not going to drink ever again.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nThat's rookie bullshit.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:34.000\nThat will take you straight to AA. That's for quitters.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nIt's an old stand-up joke. AA is for quitters.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:41.000\nI'm wearing, we went to Mary's Trip Club today.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:47.000\nI made Dan and Aaron. I had breakfast at Mother's, which is too crowded now.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nAnd then I went to Huber's to have a Spanish coffee.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nBut Huber's fucking good. But I didn't have a Spanish coffee.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nI had her in Manhattan. And then three more.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:01.000\nWith a couple of people named Tina and Dirk.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:04.000\nGod, I hope they're listening at some point in the future.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nBecause they were hilarious. And then you guys rolled in.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:11.000\nAnd then I made Dan and Aaron go to Mary's Club.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:14.000\nWhich is, I think, a Portland institution.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nNot that I'm a strip club enthusiast, necessarily.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nBut you kind of have to go there, because it's so good.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nI think you have to be a strip club enthusiast to go to any strip club.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:29.000\nYou have to be into Legos to buy a Lego box, right?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nYou don't just go like, oh, that looks interesting.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nBlocks that connects.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:39.000\nYou can't walk in off the street into a strip club and be like, oh, cool.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nYou have to be like a fucking aficionado.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.000\nNo, you don't. You go there because the girls that work there, it's so small.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nAnd there's like weird theater seating.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nThere's like two rows of theater seats.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd you can buy a drink and pee at the same time.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nLike, it's so small.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nHe's selling that like it's like a big positive thing.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nIf you can drink and pee in the same place, that's not...\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nBut the girls all have ill-advised tattoos.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nAnd they get up there and there's a jukebox on stage.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nAnd when they go on stage, they put a couple of dollars in.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nAnd they play fucking Tom Waits and shit.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nLike, they're like, well, let's see you tonight at all the downtown trade.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd they're taking their clothes off.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd then their butt cheeks are doing weird yoga shit.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nYeah, and they flex there.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nThey do like the tiny Lister Jr. thing with their boobs.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nOr you flex the pecs.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nYou don't go there kind of sexy.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nWith the Mr. Universe thing with the boobs.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nBut they have boobs.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nSo they're like Jim Henson workshop kind of character.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nYup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nI'll tell you what it isn't.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nIt's not sexy.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nAnd here's the conversation that happened on the sidewalk\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nafter we went in there for a drink.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nThis is the classic conversation that a lot of people have.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nAaron turned to me and Jeff and said,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nSo do you guys have boners?\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nAnd I immediately went, which is the truth.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nI'm like, no, absolutely not.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nMy penis is retracted into my abdomen\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nbecause I was in a place of grief.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:11.000\nAnd then Aaron goes, oh, what?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou didn't think those girls were attractive?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nIt's a fucking minefield.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nI don't get it.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nAnd I don't know what my role is.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nI don't know how to be a feminist.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nI don't know how to be a masculinist in a strip club.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nI don't know what you do.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nWhen I walk into a strip club, what I typically find\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nis that it's dead silent.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nAnd that there's a woman on stage\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nand that she's doing this stuff.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nAnd she seems like a good person.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nThe odd thing about this place\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nis that the quarters are so close\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nand it was so quiet that you could really,\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nyou were really intimately acquainted\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nwith the performers.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nAnd what I mean by that is that a woman\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nwould finish doing booby wiggles\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nand then she would go over to a three-ring binder\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nand while leafing through it would say to the guy to her left,\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nHey, Glenn, what do you like?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nAnd he would go like, I don't know.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nThe traffic was so hard on the 110 today.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nAnd she'd be like, yeah, well, you should always take fountain.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nAnd this is LA Traffic Speak,\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nbut I'm just saying, she was like, talk it.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nI was like, did you see Hannibal last night?\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nIt was like, good.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nAnd I think that's, from a human perspective,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nthat's what's supposed to happen.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nBut from a regular perspective, it's weird\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nbecause now I don't understand.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nI don't understand my role.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nYou said, Jeff, you said,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nyou could just go in there and hang out.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:40.000\nI said, if I go up to the rail in a strip club\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nand I start just talking loudly about\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nhow I think Parks and Rec is cheating\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nbecause they can cut to people explaining jokes.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nIf I'm just like explaining, yeah,\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nthe thing is mockumentary is like it's overblown.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nI get it, Ricky Gervais did it for six episodes,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nbut it was part of the story.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nThen you adopt it into America.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nIt was a story telling for money.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nThere's a guy behind me who's going to have a right to go,\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nhey, fuck off.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nWhat are you doing in a strip club?\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd I'm going to go, I don't know.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nI don't know why I'm in a strip club.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nIt's not to get a boner.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nIt's not for her.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nIt's not for me.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nI don't know whose side I'm on.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nI don't know if she's empowered.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nI'm empowered.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nWe're all empowered.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nWhat the fuck's going on in here?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nLet's just take off my clothes and just roll around\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nand throw money in the air and eat tacos.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nI don't know what the fuck to do.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nDon't get it.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nWhy is there an orange garnish in your drink right now?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nYou have a sexy cocktail right now.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nThis is a Negroni.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nA Negroni.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nThis is my cheat day.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nI'm a cheat day.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nWait, so vodka is regular day.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:47.000\nYeah.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nThat's zero carbs, motherfucker.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nYou can have, you can have, you can have.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nWow.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nFind a carb in a glass of vodka.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nI defy you.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:02.000\nA Negroni, that's like the donut of drinks.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nSo you can have bourbon and campari.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nSo we left Mary's Club and I went to Powell's Books.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nBy the way, what was it?\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nI went to, for me, my first two stops,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nwell, first stop when I come to Portland,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\nPowell's Books, because it's the Disneyland of people that read.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nDan, books are things with pages with words on them\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nthat people read.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nI know.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nIt's like the internet, but smaller.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nWith lower speeds.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nSo I said, we got drunk at Huber's.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nI met some local lunatics and I said,\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nI really have to go to Huber's.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nI started out at Powell's.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nI popped in there, got a couple of books,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nand you went and found a bar.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd I got a text from you saying,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nI'm in a nearby bar called the Such-and-Such.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nI didn't say it's the coolest place in the world.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nIt's just a place, I got a glass of chamet.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nBut true to Portland style,\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nyou talk about southern hospitality.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nPortland hospitality.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nThe only person working in the place was a one-bar tender.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd she gave me, I guess, I thought it was chamet.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nI said, I'm feeling fancy.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI'm a lumberjack.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nI'd like to, maybe I'll build a new bar next door on a wood.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nEverything's wood here.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nThey're all into wood.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nI bet there hasn't been a tree here in years.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:24.000\nWhat there is is good people and good prices.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nSo drunk.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nSo drunk.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nAll right.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nEverybody gets a medal for noticing I'm drunk.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nWhat are you going to do with it?\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nWho are you going to complain to?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nSo I'm in the bookstore.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nAlso, I was drunk enough in the bookstore\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nto walk up to the person at Powell's.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou can walk up to the desk and say hello.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nI would like you to check if these books exist.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nAnd they go, I'd be happy to help you.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd I couldn't utter a word.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nYou're allowed to do that in Portland.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nYou can get that wasted.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nAnd the guy looked at me and said, hey, you're in a town\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nwhere you can come fucked up to a bookstore.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nHey, Matt.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nSeems like you've put a junk in high.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nSection 642.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nOh, by the way, did you see these books?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nSquiggle writing.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:15.000\nI'm making a mental note out loud right now to get all of the drugs\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nthat people gave me last night out of my bag before I fly away.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nIf anybody wants a bunch of edibles and weed,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nI have to get rid of them tonight.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nYeah, I'm over.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nI'm a pinata.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nCome up to me tonight.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nBecause all of you give me raised crispy treats.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nI can't eat them all.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nI can't bring them on the plane.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nSo just hit me and want to pop out.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nAlso, the beauty of this gig is we're staying upstairs.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nWe live here at the Jupiter Hotel in the Dugfur.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nJust seriously, just ask me if you want all of the shit\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nthat people gave me last night.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nDude, I was fucking dancing last night.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nAaron was in the other room.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nI fucking danced until four in the morning.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nBecause it's Portland.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nHe just feels like, you know, it's just Portland.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nAnd I was like, dance until four in the morning.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nLike, by myself.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nI wasn't grinding on anybody.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nI wasn't doing it to impress anybody.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nI was just like fucking dancing.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nI had to straw in my mouth.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nI'm like, a solo cup in my hand.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI'm like, fucking 41.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nI'm like, meep-mop-mop.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nMeep-mop-mop.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nMeep-mop-mop.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nMeep-mop.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nIt's just like sometimes, sometimes give my feet a rest.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nDon't move them anymore.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nLike doing vertical shit.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nLet's move in the hips.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nElevator goes up, down.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nFucking rocking it.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nFucking people coming up, like shaking their shit in my face.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nI'm like, yeah, I'll take that.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nI won't take that.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nI don't give a fuck.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nJust dance it.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nControl the floor.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nAnd there was a guy that kept coming up to me.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nI don't know if he had this authority, but he kept going like,\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nare you ready to freestyle?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nAre you ready to freestyle?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nEvery half hour, this guy would come up and he'd start dancing with me.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nAnd he'd go like, so you wanted freestyle yet?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd I felt like he was friends with the DJ.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nAnd I felt like there was a point where I could have easily gone up\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:58.000\nand I could have freestyled, wrapped at the thing.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nBut I turned my back on it.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nAnd I felt, yeah.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nBefore we get to your freestyle, let's go back to me leaving pals books.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nWe got a lot of...\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nSo I'm happily...\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nI have two new books.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nI don't need them.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nI've got too many books I haven't read anyway.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nI'm drunk.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nI'm leaving pals books.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nI have a text from Dennis saying, I'm at a bar nearby.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nSo I fucking roll out of there and I use the old iPhone to find out where you are.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nAnd I come into a place called...\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nIt was called Life a Rally.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nLife a Rally.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nLife a Rally.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nYeah.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nYou don't have to grumble.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nAll right, you're Portland.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nWe get it.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nIt was empty.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nGood places were full.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nOkay, so take it from there.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nBecause I walk in there.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nYou're there.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nYou have a chameleon in your hand.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nThere were two dudes as a preamble.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:54.000\nThere were two dudes that I felt like they were a gay couple\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\njust to put an image in your head of their mannerisms.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:02.000\nLike, there were two really fit dudes who were very happy.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:06.000\nAnd I'm like, but also they had a weird fratty edge to them.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nIt was a weird combination.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd the one guy...\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nI would not have...\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nIf I saw them from a distance, I would not have said gay couple.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nI would have thought fratty guys.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:19.000\nMaybe I'm homophobic or maybe I'm like homo-doolittle.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nLike, like maybe...\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nI don't care.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nI would love for everyone to be gay.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nI'm going to put my pitch in right now for this episode\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nto be called homo-doolittle.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nI mean, maybe I projected onto them.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nI bet they're gay because I was like, I wanted them to be happy\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nbecause I felt like they were having a good time together\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nand there was a lot of sexual frustration\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nand there was a lot of energy and drama coming from them.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:45.000\nAnd I was like, I hope those two go home tonight and fuck.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nI felt like they were gay.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd I...\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nAnd you know what?\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:54.000\nI wanted to give them each two votes in the upcoming election.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nToo late. Too late.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:58.000\nIn case you're wondering if I'm part of the problem.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nNo.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:02.000\nI would like to live in a society where every gay man\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:05.000\ngot three fucking votes.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nWhat happened before I walked in there?\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nBecause I want to live in gay world.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nDan, you're fine.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nDan, we...\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nI'm sorry, am I protesting too much?\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nI'm just saying, I'm cool with the gays.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nI'm fine.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nLike everything would be better if they were in charge.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nYou're straight.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:20.000\nWhat you're saying is you're straight.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nBut what I don't want is for them to beat me up.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:25.000\nWhat happened at this bar is...\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nThese were like bad...\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nThese were very, very, very rare.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nIncredibly rare.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nBad gay men.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:38.000\nI felt.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nI feel like genetically they're better than everyone.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nWhoa!\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nBut these two...\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nI would like to weed them out.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nAll right.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nOr make them straight.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nWhat would be a punishment for them?\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nJust tell the story.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nOkay.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nYou're right.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nYou're right.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nNo more editorializing.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nYou make your own decision.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nI don't know.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nThey might have been straight.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nIf they were, that explains a lot.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:10.000\nBecause if they were straight, then they were fucking intermoinal inside.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nI don't think they were, but I will hold judgment to it.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:18.000\nThe incredibly sweet bartender, I should say she's female,\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:22.000\nbecause it seems important we're talking, we're setting a stage here.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:27.000\nVery, very sweet female bartender who, as a footnote,\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nI ordered a drink from her and she said,\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\ndo you want something from the menu?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nWould you like somebody to eat?\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nAnd I said, well, I have kind of a...\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nDo you have a dessert menu?\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nLike, something sweet.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nShe said, we don't have dessert.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nI'm like, okay.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nFive seconds later, she comes up and she puts a handful of peppermint candies on the bar.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:49.000\nPortland, hashtag Portland.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nWe're here to fucking, like, we're thinking about you.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nWe want you, like, this doesn't happen anywhere ever.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nThat's the opposite of Logan's run.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:01.000\nSomebody was like, I thought when you said,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nlike, her job was done.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nThey don't have a dessert menu.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:09.000\nShe fucking took that shit to a bowl of candy, but I don't get it.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nI don't even get it.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nI love it.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nI love your city.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nAnd I'm sorry, I'm sitting there going like,\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\noh, Jesus Christ, what a good people.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:22.000\nI'm trying to make you understand, this woman's a hero.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nBecause then she went over to the other guys\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nand they were kind of dramatic and very fit.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nMaybe that's part of what I'm holding against them.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nThey looked crunchy and abby and six-packy and...\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nCrunchy?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nGunny, bicep-y.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nLike, they looked good.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nI kind of sleep with them, but...\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:48.000\nSo I think they were good.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:52.000\nShe went to them and they were being loud the whole time.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nIt was fine.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nThey were charismatic individuals in the corner.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nThey're having a good time.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nProbably talking about spot-checking each other.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.000\nBench press.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nShe said to one of them, do you guys want anything else?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nAnd the loud, like, kind of aggressive one,\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nwe will call, let's give them a name, Stripe.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nStripe.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nThe bad gremlin.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nHe said to her, she went,\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\ncan I get you guys anything else?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nHe went, I'm just having the greatest time looking at you.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nIs that rude?\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nYeah, it is.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nThat's weird.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nSo that was the mood he was in.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nLike, he was feeling his oats.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nWas that a phrase?\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:43.000\nNope.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nI mean, it is now.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nSo Jeff walks in with Moby Dick,\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nor whatever the fuck he bought from here.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:56.000\nProve we can still exist, bookstore.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nLike, it's a movement.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:04.000\nFlash mob, hashtag, like, books should still exist.com.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nWe get it.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nOh, it's fun.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nWith your thumb.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nOh, it cut me.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nGreat.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nInformation at a price.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nWho would have thought of it?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nYour anti-book?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nI don't know why I'm doing that.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nIt's a weird platform.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nIt's a weird, you know what?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nEven if most of the world feels that way,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:37.000\nyou know, no one will feel okay getting on your side of that.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nI mean, anti-book.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nJeff walks in with his fucking books.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nBut when was Mark Twain?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nLook it up.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nFucking Google him.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nYou bought a Mark Twain book?\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nYes, because I meet people and we talk about books,\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nand they go, oh, you should read this.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nAnd I write it down on my phone.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nYeah, a phone.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nMy iPhone.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nI have a little note thing.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nAnd I write down book titles.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd when I go to Powell's, or if I'm in Seattle,\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nI go to Elliott Bay.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nYeah.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nAnd like the good bookstores in the world\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nthat actually carry the shit that you want to find.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nIt's not like a Barnes & Noble piece of garbage.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nWhen you go to Portland, you can actually find\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nthe books that you wish you had.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd the end, I'm smart.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nAll right.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nRead a book, motherfucker.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nI know.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nRead a book.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nYou're a writer.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nYou're a writer.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nYeah, you know what?\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nRead a fucking book.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:30.000\nYeah, reading is for consumers.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nI'm a writer.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nConsumers of what?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.000\nThat's like a spider being into spiderwebs.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nLike a spider is like, I love spiderwebs.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nNo, motherfucker, you spun this shit.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nTo catch flies.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nIf a spider could read, a spider would read a book.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nA spider can't read.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nMotherfucker, I'm going to fight you.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nI'm going to fight you in Portland.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nSpiders can't read.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nWhat happened to this place?\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nWe've wasted a lot of time on this today.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nWhat happened to this place?\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nInexplicably.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nI roll in with books.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nTwo books.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nProvocative material.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:05.000\nSo Jeff's at the end of the bar.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nBy bar in quotes, because it's beachwood, it's bright.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nIt's fucking midday lit.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:16.000\nIt's a nice place.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\nIt's a touristy, downtown, dumpy bar.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:25.000\nAnd then one of these two incredibly sexy, probably gay guys,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:28.000\ngoes over, he senses that there's other people there.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:32.000\nHe goes up to Aaron and he goes like, what was his entree?\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nIt was like, I hope he's not with you.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nYou're so beautiful.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:41.000\nAnd then he said, yes, this is my side of the story.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nWe'll bring Aaron out in a second.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nI want to hear her side, but from my objective,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nglowering into my chameleon.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nI had just sat down.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nHe said, hello, sweetheart.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nHe did an extravagant kind of like, hello,\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nI'm that guy from the other part of the bar.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nI want your attention now too, which is fine.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nI love your style.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nYou're so beautiful.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nYou look great.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nBut in the midst of that introduction, he said,\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nI hope you're not with him.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nAnd did this kind of sassy to Jeff.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nI hope you're not with him.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nAnd Jeff said, go fuck yourself.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nFuck off.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nAnd then he goes, what?\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nAnd then he was like, I wasn't talking to you.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nHe's like, you weren't talking to me.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.000\nI said, he goes like, I hope you're not with him.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nI go, oh, you fuck off.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nHe came over and was like being like too much.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\nAnd I said, you go away.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nAnd he goes, oh, I hope you're not with him.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nAnd I said, I'm a stylist.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nI just think your hair is so cool.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nI go, your personality needs touching up.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nAnd he goes, who?\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:56.000\nAnd then his friend, his even sexier friend,\n\n22:56.000 --> 23:01.000\nwho I assume is gay because he's fucking hot,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:05.000\nstarted saying things like, I could hear them\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nbefore everybody would go there.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nHe goes, what did you just say?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nI go, hey, I wasn't talking to you.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nI said, well, you were.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nI said, your voice carries.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nHe goes, oh, my voice carries.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nHe did a thing where he was like, my voice carries.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nBut it felt flat.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nIt was like a flat C, flat.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.000\nMy voice carries.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:30.000\nI said something along the lines that, hey, fuck off.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nThe adults are having a conversation over here.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:38.000\nAnd then he enlisted the more muscular guy in the duo.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nAnd he goes, stop me before I do something stupid.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nAnd I go, oh.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nThat's what you heard.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nAnd then he said, later on in this altercation,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:50.000\nthis big five minute blossom of human interaction.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nAt one point, I heard this guy say,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nin a certain point, I'm going to start slicing faces.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nSlicing faces?\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nThat was after I left.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nWhat do you love?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nI had left at that point.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nThe guy that came at us with the, I'm a stylist\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nand I'm Mr. Wonderful.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, wait.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nI hope you're not with him.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nI go, you go away.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nYour personality could use some touching up.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nAnd then the other guy's like, I'm going to go away.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nAnd I go, oh.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nNow Mr. Wonderful over here wants to be involved\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nbecause he's stopping me before I do something stupid.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nI'm going to slice some faces.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:29.000\nSo I grab my Mark Twain and whatever.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nWhat was in the book I bought?\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nI forget.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nI picked my two books up and I fucking bone out\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nbecause I know where this is going.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nBecause where it's going is nowhere.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:40.000\nAnd then I read a fucking tweet from you\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nwhere the guy was threatened to slice faces.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nThat was during the whole thing though.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nI could hear him.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nAnd so I was engaging with him.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nHe would say stuff.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nSlice face.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nIt was a really young man, really.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nYou're going to beat people up.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nAnd he and I actually had an arc.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nAt the end of it, I had, because he...\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nThis is the guy that you refer to as so hot he must be gay.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nYeah.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nAll right.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nThis guy's actually the hero of the story kind of.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nBecause you want to fuck him.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nNo, because he...\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:09.000\nBecause he was so...\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nYou fucked this guy, right?\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nHe felt an obligation to beat everyone up\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:18.000\nwho had a problem with his friend who was causing trouble.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nSo when I actually engaged with him, it was like...\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nHe said, I'm sorry.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nI said, look, I'm sorry too.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nIt's weird to threaten to slice people's faces.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:33.000\nAnd he said, hey, he said, look, I'm with my friend.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nI feel like I have to stick up for my friend.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nAnd I'm like, there you go.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nThat's humanity.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nThat's it in the bottle.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nEveryone's got to stick up for their friend.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nThe fucking...\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nThat's why barflights happen.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nIt's like, dumb.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nIt's like two guys like...\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:48.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nWe spent too much time on this.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nThose guys are listening to this and going like,\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:53.000\nwe did it.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nBecause here's another fucking weird thing.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nAaron said, Aaron said...\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nI didn't hear this.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nAaron said that during the altercation,\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\none of them pointed at you and said,\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nI'm glad your show got canceled.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nPointed at me?\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nYou thought that you were me?\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nI assume.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nOr that I was Jeff Winger.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nOr they thought whose line is not coming back.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nDan, listen up, Barry the lead.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nYour show got canceled today.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:19.000\nYes, it did.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nIt did.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nIt did.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nBy gay people.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nYou guys are...\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nGay people canceled the show.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nGay...\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nBy...\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nYeah.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nWe should address that in due time.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:37.000\nWe spent too much time talking about some weird beachwood bar...\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:40.000\nI was in a plane yesterday and I landed\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nand the driver named Dan...\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nDan, are you here?\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nAre you here?\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nDan Kogan?\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:47.000\nDan!\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nIs he here?\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nAre you like Hodor from Game of Thrones?\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nHodor.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nHodor.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nDan!\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nHodor.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nIt's not his name.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nHodor.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nIt's just the sound he makes.\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nAnyway.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nDan!\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nDan, love.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:05.000\nI flew in before you did and our driver, Dan Kogan, said\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:09.000\nDan, I'm picking him up in an hour or two.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nDoes he know that it's...\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nDoes he know that it's show got canceled?\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nI go, I didn't know that.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nI said, I wonder when did that news drop?\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nHe goes, recently.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:23.000\nThere was a chance that you were on the plane when that news dropped.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nYeah, they called me.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:28.000\nI was on my way to LAX and somebody from Sony called me.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nAnd they told me.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:34.000\nListen, I...\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:42.000\nThe fans of that show have more reason to be upset than I do.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:47.000\nI can go try to create another show and also I got paid for every minute I cared about\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nthat show.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nAnd a lot of...\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:58.000\nI don't know what you're plotting, but capitalism...\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nThe trickle down...\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:05.000\nThe people that are most devastated are people that put unpaid labor into the show.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nIt's like, hashtagging this.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nI'm getting a tattoo of this.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nI love this show.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nThey didn't get compensated for it.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nThey had a relationship with the show.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nWere there community tattoos?\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nOh, sure.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nThere was community tattoos.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nDoes anybody here have a community-related tattoo?\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nYou don't have to be ashamed.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nI always have mixed feelings about the tattoo thing.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:29.000\nSomebody will show me a Rick and Morty tattoo and I'll go, I'm not sure.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nIt's the highest compliment, but at the same time, I don't know what to...\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nIt's a terrible idea.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nWell, it depends on what you feel.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nI don't know what...\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nIt's none of your business how somebody wants to...\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nIt's weird.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nIt's a permanent thing.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nAnd then you...\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nDumb.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nThis is not entertainment.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nThis is me.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nDan, your feelings aside...\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:54.000\nAnd also, you can't totally relate to the hardcore fan who loves community.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nBut now it's...\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:59.000\nThat's the end of the show that means a lot to people.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nAlso, it clearly means a lot to you.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:05.000\nThe fact that that's now done, how does that emotionally affect you?\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nIt'll take weeks to sink in.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.000\nBut there was somebody who handed out...\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nThere was literature being handed out in the line.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nKyle.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nKyle, right?\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nYes.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nKyle.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.000\nI gave it to you.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nEvery time we come to Portland, there's a high-concept gimmick...\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:24.000\nGraphic design-wise.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:27.000\nIt's a more intelligent...\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nEveryone here...\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nNo one lifts anything in Portland.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\nEveryone just goes to work at a draft table...\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:41.000\nAnd they eat coffee, and then they go home in a weirdly designed egg-shaped race car bed...\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:45.000\nThat folds up into God's consciousness for eight hours.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:52.000\nAnd it folds down, and they go back out and be open-minded for a living.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nI don't know.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:55.000\nI don't know what you people do.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nYou're delightful.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nYou should move here.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nYou should move here.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:04.000\nI'm gonna move here and have a bunch of babies.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nLumberjack babies.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:12.000\nAll my kids are gonna look like the lead singer of Spin Doctors.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nBoo!\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:18.000\nDon't you dare boo the fucking Spin Doctors, you fucking Portland asshole.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:21.000\nI think he booed your baby.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nHe hasn't even...\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:27.000\nHe's gonna be your last defense against Skynet.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:33.000\nHe's gonna have a microphone on one hand and an axe on the other.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:41.000\nDon't you dare boo Conor Harmon.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:44.000\nI feel a native Conor Harmon.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:49.000\nI remember when I was ten years old, as I've said before on the show, I was on...\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:52.000\nAs a kid, I was in the King and I, this play with your Brenner.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nAnd we toured the country, and then we did Broadway, and then he died.\n\n30:55.000 --> 31:00.000\nBut when I was ten, I don't know why that's funny, but I love that you...\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:07.000\nIf Jeff asked you to be part of his next Broadway production, as tempting as it is, just say no.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nYou gotta die.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nBut when I was ten, we did the...\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nIs it the fitzer, the Spencer, the flitzer?\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nSchnitzer.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nSchnitzer?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nThe schnitzer.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nHey, Scoot.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nAre you...\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nWhere's Scoot?\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nOh, there you go.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nOkay, thank you.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nSo anyway, as a kid, I...\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nThank you, Scoot.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:31.000\nWe played at the schnitzer, the fister, or the flitzer, or whatever the fuck.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:36.000\nAnd I was on tour with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proups and Chabes, and we toured with Who's Live,\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nlike a Who's Lying kind of thing.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:42.000\nAnd I walked in there, and I said, oh fuck, I think I played in this theater when I was ten.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:46.000\nAnd this is 20 years, or 25 years later.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:51.000\nAnd the doorman there, I said, I was here as a kid.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nAnd he goes, yeah.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nHe goes, your name's Jeff.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:56.000\nAnd it was the fucking doorman when I was a kid.\n\n31:56.000 --> 32:00.000\nHe goes, do you want me to walk you to your old dressing room?\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:03.000\nAnd he just started fucking me.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nBetter than you've ever been fucked.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nNot true.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nNew York style.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nIt's not true.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nEast Coast style.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.000\nNo, but he remembered the show.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nAnd there he fucking was, and he took me to my dressing room.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nNow I'm twice as tall as I was.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:22.000\nAnd so the dressing room is twice as small as I remember.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nAnd we fucking did that show there.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:28.000\nAnd like, fuck, what's the point of my story?\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nOh, I remember now.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:36.000\nSo I was, we would do matinees, and I would be, I had kind of like a page boy haircut\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nbecause I played like a little British kid.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:40.000\nAnd I had makeup on because it was a theater show.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nAnd I was ten.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:47.000\nAnd I went to a McDonald's with my brother, who did not have makeup on.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nBut we went in there to McDonald's here in Portland.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:55.000\nWhat's the park near where the fister or the footster or the Spencer is?\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nYeah, there was a McDonald's there.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.000\nAnd I fucking rolled in there at ten years old.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:04.000\nAnd the guy goes, what can I get you ladies?\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nBut he didn't have makeup on.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nI was like, we're boys.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:13.000\nAnd he goes, well, what can I get you?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI was like, you motherfucker.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:19.000\nIt's like, just because I'm wearing makeup at 10 a.m.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\ndoesn't mean I'm gay or a girl.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nI've never given Portland for that.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nI think it's why you and that guy got in a fight tonight.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nI didn't get in a fight. I left. You got in a fight.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nI didn't get in a fucking fight.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nI was hunched over a chameleon.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nAll right.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:35.000\nWere you going to freestyle tonight?\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nYeah.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nLet's give these people their money's worth.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nIn LA, you pay $10.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\n$10 is whatever.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nIt gets you a pair of socks.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nThese people paid probably more.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nThere's other people who paid VIP.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nI met some of them in the bar.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nThey got VIP bracelets.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:52.000\nThey paid more money to make sure that they could get in.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:53.000\nNot at the wait line.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:57.000\nCapitalism can go fuck itself, but it serves me tonight.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nNot that I'm taking a cut.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:02.000\nI don't give a fuck about your money.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:06.000\nBut what I do want to make sure of is that you're entertained.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nIs James Adomian here?\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nThere was a gasp.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nIs he here?\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nIs he here?\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nI heard he was here.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nJames, are you here?\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nNo. He's not here.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nAll right. It's fine.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nNo, because that was going to be a fucking goodie.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:24.000\nI wanted to do...\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nJames Adomian is here at the festival.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:31.000\nHe does the best Vincent Price impression I've ever heard in my life.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nI wanted to...\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:36.000\nI told him last night, come to the show, we'll do a rap,\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:41.000\nand then you do the Vincent Price bridge for the rap.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nSpiders Delight.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nSpiders Delight.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.000\nUki Uki sandwiches.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nWhy are spiders so delightful?\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nNo, it's a spiders delight.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nSpiders Delight is horror.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nIt's like what does the Addams family like?\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nThey like bad soup.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nSpiders Delight is like...\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:05.000\nIt's not a good delicious cupcake.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:08.000\nWrong beat.

right.\n\n42:09.680 --> 42:11.260\nSo what was it, just real quick,\n\n42:11.260 --> 42:14.460\nlet's agree to not spend more than nine minutes on this.\n\n42:14.460 --> 42:18.800\nWell, real quick, I just wanted to clarify something.\n\n42:18.800 --> 42:22.180\nWhen we walked out of the strip club,\n\n42:22.180 --> 42:24.080\nthere was a misunderstanding when you said\n\n42:24.080 --> 42:26.880\nthat your penis retracted.\n\n42:26.880 --> 42:29.000\nI instinctively, what I said was,\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:30.520\nI thought they were really pretty.\n\n42:30.520 --> 42:31.960\nI didn't say, you didn't thank them,\n\n42:31.960 --> 42:33.040\nand I'm not pretty.\n\n42:33.040 --> 42:34.600\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n42:34.600 --> 42:35.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n42:35.440 --> 42:36.280\nNo, no, it's okay, it's okay.\n\n42:36.280 --> 42:38.160\nAnd I know it was a misunderstanding.\n\n42:38.160 --> 42:39.000\nYou're right.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nNo, it's just a bit of a minefield for a guy,\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:44.720\nbecause you don't even know if your role as a feminist\n\n42:44.720 --> 42:46.640\ncoming out of a strip club is supposed to be like,\n\n42:46.640 --> 42:47.840\nbut I don't even have a boner.\n\n42:47.840 --> 42:49.240\nThere was nothing sexual about that,\n\n42:49.240 --> 42:51.000\nand then you can follow that road.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.400\nIt doesn't lead all the way to Rome.\n\n42:52.400 --> 42:53.800\nYeah, we're all confused.\n\n42:53.800 --> 42:56.040\nIt will bump up against objectification of women\n\n42:56.040 --> 42:56.880\nin a different way.\n\n42:56.880 --> 42:57.720\nWell, in the recent way, I asked.\n\n42:57.720 --> 42:59.400\nBecause you'll be going, oh, they were fucking ugly.\n\n42:59.400 --> 43:01.360\nAnd it's like, well, okay, so then you go like, oh, no,\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:02.560\nthey were hot, they made my dick hard.\n\n43:02.560 --> 43:03.400\nOkay, now they're hot,\n\n43:03.400 --> 43:07.320\nand I don't know what the bumper table,\n\n43:07.320 --> 43:08.840\nlike, why are we doing this?\n\n43:08.840 --> 43:09.680\nWhat are we doing?\n\n43:09.680 --> 43:12.720\nJeff is the only person who knew why we were doing that.\n\n43:12.720 --> 43:13.640\nHe doesn't know.\n\n43:13.640 --> 43:14.480\nHe doesn't know.\n\n43:14.480 --> 43:15.320\nI was taking it everywhere.\n\n43:15.320 --> 43:16.160\nDoes it mean, while we're sitting here\n\n43:16.160 --> 43:19.080\nwith the shirts from the place,\n\n43:19.080 --> 43:22.160\nJeff just takes us places and orders us to sit place?\n\n43:22.160 --> 43:24.200\nYou can't, you've been in Portland now\n\n43:24.200 --> 43:25.160\nseveral times in your life,\n\n43:25.160 --> 43:26.400\nbut you've never been to Mary's Club.\n\n43:26.400 --> 43:27.680\nYou have to have been there at least once,\n\n43:27.680 --> 43:29.440\nbecause it's kind of, it's special.\n\n43:29.440 --> 43:30.280\nIt's weird.\n\n43:30.280 --> 43:31.440\nIt's an interesting place to be in, yeah.\n\n43:31.440 --> 43:33.680\nIt was good, just me to sit at the stage,\n\n43:33.680 --> 43:35.960\nwhich I was happy eventually that he made me do,\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:39.240\nbut I was uncomfortable because I was going in\n\n43:39.240 --> 43:41.480\nbecause it was presented as a spectacle,\n\n43:41.480 --> 43:44.120\nand then I walked in and there's like this person\n\n43:44.120 --> 43:47.480\nwho was doing this dance that was great,\n\n43:47.480 --> 43:52.160\nand I didn't want her to feel like I was making fun of her,\n\n43:52.160 --> 43:53.720\nwhich is such a narcissistic way to walk.\n\n43:53.720 --> 43:54.640\nI mean, she's not like,\n\n43:54.640 --> 43:57.040\noh, I wonder what their relationship is with nudity.\n\n43:57.040 --> 43:58.240\nYeah, they've crossed the threshold.\n\n43:58.240 --> 43:59.080\nThey don't care.\n\n43:59.080 --> 44:02.200\nThey're heroes, they're martyrs, they're victims.\n\n44:02.200 --> 44:03.040\nI love that.\n\n44:03.040 --> 44:06.000\nWhen I had the dollars and I could give a dollar\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:07.640\nfor certain things that I liked,\n\n44:07.640 --> 44:10.320\nlike when she did the thing with her butt,\n\n44:10.320 --> 44:14.920\nlike the, I was like, I really like that, and then.\n\n44:14.920 --> 44:16.520\nThat's what I don't like, I don't like sitting at the,\n\n44:16.520 --> 44:17.840\nI don't know what I'm rewarding,\n\n44:17.840 --> 44:20.560\nbecause I've never been turned on\n\n44:20.560 --> 44:21.760\nby any performance in a strip club,\n\n44:21.760 --> 44:23.400\nand I'm not saying that that's the goal,\n\n44:23.400 --> 44:24.800\nbecause otherwise, it should be,\n\n44:24.800 --> 44:27.160\nif you wanted to, it should wear more sweaters.\n\n44:27.160 --> 44:32.160\nLike, I would like to watch a lady just in a sweater.\n\n44:32.920 --> 44:33.760\nThat's funny, yeah.\n\n44:33.760 --> 44:35.320\nLike, just rolling around in a beanbag.\n\n44:35.320 --> 44:36.160\nI would feel very jealous.\n\n44:36.160 --> 44:37.560\nLike, that would be pornographic to me,\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:40.240\nthat would be like, but it wouldn't be.\n\n44:40.240 --> 44:42.000\nI would feel very jealous if we went into a strip club\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.280\nand there was a woman fully clothed\n\n44:44.280 --> 44:47.240\nwith tights and a sweater, who just sat there and said,\n\n44:47.240 --> 44:49.280\nyou've been bad.\n\n44:49.280 --> 44:50.600\nYeah.\n\n44:50.600 --> 44:53.200\nI'd be like, we have to get out of here, I can't.\n\n44:53.200 --> 44:56.720\nThe theme of the bar, I'd be like, teacher's assistance.\n\n44:56.720 --> 44:59.040\nThat would be, and it would just be like girls sitting\n\n44:59.040 --> 45:02.360\nat a desk and going like, what else did you want?\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:03.600\nWhat memo did you want to send out?\n\n45:03.600 --> 45:06.760\nAnd I'd be like, tell Mr. Flamers that,\n\n45:09.080 --> 45:10.000\npush that meeting.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:10.840\nOkay, yes, sir.\n\n45:10.840 --> 45:13.600\nThat would, I would walk out of there with.\n\n45:13.600 --> 45:14.440\nWith a boner.\n\n45:14.440 --> 45:15.280\nFrankly, a boner.\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:16.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:16.120 --> 45:17.160\nAnd it would be gross.\n\n45:17.160 --> 45:18.480\nFrankly, a boner.\n\n45:18.480 --> 45:21.520\nWhen the women are fully naked\n\n45:21.520 --> 45:23.160\nand they get the dragon tattoo on their back\n\n45:23.160 --> 45:25.480\nand they're like, they're spinning her on the pole.\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:26.320\nThat's not sexy.\n\n45:26.320 --> 45:29.840\nIt's transcended sexuality, which is a good thing, I guess.\n\n45:29.840 --> 45:32.120\nBut you wanted to fuck those two gay guys\n\n45:32.120 --> 45:33.840\nat the bar there, right?\n\n45:33.840 --> 45:37.080\nProbably, but I want to tell you what happened.\n\n45:37.080 --> 45:39.680\nWell, you guys were in there getting these sweatshirts,\n\n45:39.680 --> 45:41.200\njust because this is another thing.\n\n45:41.200 --> 45:42.360\nWhat do you do about strip clubs?\n\n45:42.360 --> 45:43.600\nWhat do you do about sexuality?\n\n45:43.600 --> 45:45.920\nWhat do you do about panhandling?\n\n45:45.920 --> 45:48.160\nAll right, in LA, we have lots of panhandlers.\n\n45:48.160 --> 45:50.640\nSan Francisco, we've talked about the panhandlers.\n\n45:50.640 --> 45:53.200\nI think the San Francisco panhandler population\n\n45:53.200 --> 45:56.280\nhas been subjected to an undue amount of stress.\n\n45:56.280 --> 45:59.720\nPanhandler in San Francisco, he's living in an area\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:03.080\nwhere it's like it's Eternia in the He-Man universe.\n\n46:03.080 --> 46:05.600\nLike, everyone has to be in action figure.\n\n46:05.600 --> 46:07.960\nThey had some of the worst draconian mayors\n\n46:07.960 --> 46:09.520\nthere's no such thing as just a guy\n\n46:09.520 --> 46:11.280\nin an army jacket that needs a dollar.\n\n46:11.280 --> 46:15.280\nThat guy's been fucking brushed off to like down the coast.\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:17.560\nIn San Francisco, if someone's panhandling you,\n\n46:17.560 --> 46:19.920\nhe's got a fucking teacup on his head.\n\n46:19.920 --> 46:24.160\nHe's got an armor made of a furnace door.\n\n46:24.160 --> 46:27.320\nLike, he's got a gimmick.\n\n46:27.320 --> 46:29.040\nHe's got a spell he's going to cast.\n\n46:29.040 --> 46:31.360\nHe's got a magic trick to do.\n\n46:31.360 --> 46:33.600\nI used to live in San Francisco, and there was a panhandler\n\n46:33.600 --> 46:36.880\nwho every time you walked by him, he would propose marriage.\n\n46:36.880 --> 46:40.040\nBut in a very sincere way, and I always gave him money.\n\n46:40.040 --> 46:42.560\nI was always delighted by it, we had an agreement.\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:44.920\nSo here's what happened in Portland, outside that strip\n\n46:44.920 --> 46:49.680\nclub, well, Erin went back in to buy her t-shirt with you.\n\n46:49.680 --> 46:52.200\nThere's no moral to this story, I'm just sharing it.\n\n46:52.200 --> 46:54.840\nThere was a woman walking on the street.\n\n46:54.840 --> 46:58.840\nI would characterize her as, I'm pretty sure she,\n\n46:58.840 --> 47:02.440\nI think her poison was drink, I think.\n\n47:02.440 --> 47:05.200\nBut I don't know, I'm not a social worker, I don't know.\n\n47:05.200 --> 47:08.480\nIt's not my job to judge her, or appraise her,\n\n47:08.480 --> 47:10.040\nor know what she's into, or whatever.\n\n47:10.040 --> 47:12.440\nBut I felt like looking at her, I was like, yeah,\n\n47:12.440 --> 47:16.160\nshe's like me in 20 years.\n\n47:16.160 --> 47:19.280\nAnd she was like, hey, you have any money?\n\n47:19.280 --> 47:22.440\nAnd then Erin went in the thing and said, I got this.\n\n47:22.440 --> 47:24.600\nI gave her a 20, because it's all I had.\n\n47:24.600 --> 47:27.800\nAnd I was just, well, I'm a tourist too.\n\n47:27.800 --> 47:30.760\nAnd you literally said, I got this.\n\n47:30.760 --> 47:32.080\nI did.\n\n47:32.080 --> 47:32.920\nI did say that.\n\n47:32.920 --> 47:34.320\nI said, I got this.\n\n47:34.320 --> 47:36.800\nBecause she approached and she said, dude,\n\n47:36.800 --> 47:39.240\nand held up her sign, like she was my old friend,\n\n47:39.240 --> 47:40.720\nand she was like, you owe me $5.\n\n47:40.720 --> 47:42.800\nAnd I just, I was following Jeff into the club.\n\n47:42.800 --> 47:44.280\nAnd I said, I got this.\n\n47:44.280 --> 47:47.440\nAll right, that's, yes, that's what I did.\n\n47:47.440 --> 47:49.400\nYou got off easy, I bought you guys $90\n\n47:49.400 --> 47:50.800\nwith a Mary's Club swag.\n\n47:50.800 --> 47:53.840\nSo I gave her a $20 bill.\n\n47:53.840 --> 47:55.160\nAnd she gave me a hug.\n\n47:55.160 --> 47:56.680\nAnd we held each other.\n\n47:56.680 --> 47:59.440\nAnd she said, I wrote it down after she walked away.\n\n47:59.440 --> 48:01.760\nShe said, I don't normally hug people,\n\n48:01.760 --> 48:03.480\nbut you did me a favor.\n\n48:03.480 --> 48:04.520\nAnd then she broke the hug.\n\n48:04.520 --> 48:08.960\nAnd then she walked into a housing complex\n\n48:08.960 --> 48:10.040\nnext to the strip bar.\n\n48:10.040 --> 48:13.360\nShe said, and you know what I'm talking about.\n\n48:13.360 --> 48:14.080\nShe turned to me.\n\n48:14.080 --> 48:15.640\nAnd I was like, no, I don't.\n\n48:15.640 --> 48:17.480\nI don't know what you're talking about, quite.\n\n48:17.480 --> 48:19.720\nBut I feel like I may have killed you because I gave you $20\n\n48:19.720 --> 48:21.360\nand you're taking it.\n\n48:21.360 --> 48:23.240\nSo here's what happened next.\n\n48:23.240 --> 48:25.160\nThen two minutes later, because you guys\n\n48:25.160 --> 48:27.720\nwere in the strip club buying a t-shirt.\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:28.600\nLou Reed walks in.\n\n48:28.600 --> 48:31.560\nAnother couple, a couple walk by.\n\n48:31.560 --> 48:34.800\nIt was like a homeless couple, the self-identified homeless\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:35.680\ncouple.\n\n48:35.680 --> 48:38.720\nThis is why I'm back buying you guys hoodies\n\n48:38.720 --> 48:39.680\nwith a Mary's Club.\n\n48:39.680 --> 48:45.320\nSo then the woman had kind of, she had sores on her face,\n\n48:45.320 --> 48:48.560\nlike it was more of a meth-y thing,\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:51.800\nnot like an alcoholic thing, more of a speedy thing.\n\n48:51.800 --> 48:54.840\nAnd she said, I wrote all this down\n\n48:54.840 --> 48:57.000\nbecause I wanted to talk about it tonight.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:58.600\nShe said, can I get some money?\n\n48:58.600 --> 49:01.440\nAnd I was like, I did literally.\n\n49:01.440 --> 49:04.000\nI gave all my money to another person.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:04.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:11.360\nAnd she said, we're crackheads.\n\n49:11.360 --> 49:13.440\nWe're homeless.\n\n49:13.440 --> 49:16.320\nAnd she walked away with her male friend.\n\n49:16.320 --> 49:19.120\nShe said, be really choosier around here.\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:27.640\nThat's fucking interesting.\n\n49:27.640 --> 49:31.120\nBecause the first lady just wanted booze.\n\n49:31.120 --> 49:34.240\nShe needs crack.\n\n49:34.240 --> 49:35.440\nI don't know, it's weird.\n\n49:35.440 --> 49:37.520\nIt's like, when are you a good guy?\n\n49:37.520 --> 49:38.880\nWhen are you a bad guy?\n\n49:38.880 --> 49:42.360\nYou don't just panhandling in general.\n\n49:42.360 --> 49:45.160\nSpencer told me once, we should bring out Spencer in a second.\n\n49:45.160 --> 49:48.120\nSpencer Crittenton, he doesn't give to panhandlers,\n\n49:48.120 --> 49:49.000\nhe told me once.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:54.840\nWhat he does do, I don't have the balls to do this.\n\n49:54.840 --> 49:57.640\nWhen he sees the guys in LA, I don't know if this\n\n49:57.640 --> 49:58.960\nis like in every city.\n\n49:58.960 --> 50:01.920\nBut in LA, there's like, we have an infrastructure\n\n50:01.920 --> 50:06.640\nthat supports guys rolling down the street with a shopping\n\n50:06.640 --> 50:09.120\ncart full of tin cans.\n\n50:09.120 --> 50:10.640\nLike they go from door to door.\n\n50:10.640 --> 50:14.560\nThey're fucking working hard, way harder than any of us\n\n50:14.560 --> 50:18.920\nwork, getting very little shit to give to a corporation that\n\n50:18.920 --> 50:21.240\ngives them a couple pennies for their tin cans.\n\n50:21.240 --> 50:24.640\nAnd Spencer said, he doesn't give to panhandlers.\n\n50:24.640 --> 50:26.200\nWhen he sees those guys, those guys\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:27.320\naren't even asking for money.\n\n50:27.320 --> 50:31.720\nSpencer pulls over, runs out, offers them money.\n\n50:31.720 --> 50:32.880\nI love that.\n\n50:32.880 --> 50:35.520\nI mean, that seems like in Spencer's like,\n\n50:35.520 --> 50:37.000\nbut it's almost Darwinian too.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:37.880\nIt's creepy.\n\n50:37.880 --> 50:43.760\nLike, yeah, so the other people should, should they die?\n\n50:43.760 --> 50:44.760\nWhat are we saying?\n\n50:44.760 --> 50:49.160\nAre we, oh, he knows work ethic.\n\n50:49.160 --> 50:51.120\nGive him money so that we can keep the.\n\n50:51.120 --> 50:53.360\nI'm from LA, like you see a guy laying in the street\n\n50:53.360 --> 50:57.120\nin LA, a homeless person, and they're laying in LA.\n\n50:57.120 --> 50:58.480\nIt's a nice climate.\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:00.560\nBut you see somebody on the streets in Portland,\n\n51:00.560 --> 51:04.520\nlike it's cold out, like it's weird to be homeless here.\n\n51:04.520 --> 51:09.160\nIn Milwaukee every year, it's the second coldest city\n\n51:09.160 --> 51:11.640\nor the first coldest city, depending on who you ask.\n\n51:11.640 --> 51:15.080\nIf you ask somebody in Minneapolis, they'll tell you.\n\n51:15.080 --> 51:17.720\nIt's, they die.\n\n51:17.720 --> 51:18.880\nYeah.\n\n51:18.880 --> 51:23.080\nThere's a homeless population, and they die every winter.\n\n51:23.080 --> 51:26.760\nThey die off, like mosquitoes.\n\n51:26.760 --> 51:28.360\nIt's not, I'm not making a joke.\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:31.040\nI'm saying, like, that's the horrible thing.\n\n51:31.040 --> 51:32.560\nSo as human beings, they die off.\n\n51:32.560 --> 51:34.600\nThey're called homeless people, mosquitoes.\n\n51:34.600 --> 51:36.080\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n51:36.080 --> 51:39.240\nThat's, I'm saying that's the fucking horrible thing.\n\n51:41.120 --> 51:43.600\nThey die off.\n\n51:43.600 --> 51:44.440\nIt's the horrible thing.\n\n51:44.440 --> 51:46.040\nIt's like, it's a part of a biosphere.\n\n51:46.040 --> 51:47.800\nWhen you see somebody that's homeless and someone's\n\n51:47.800 --> 51:51.000\nsleeping on the, like I walked across the bridge\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.840\nfrom the southwest side to downtown,\n\n51:53.840 --> 51:56.240\nand it's just people like sleeping on the middle\n\n51:56.240 --> 52:00.720\nof the bridge on the thing, and you just walk by them.\n\n52:00.720 --> 52:01.560\nIt's so weird.\n\n52:01.560 --> 52:02.880\nBecause you get other shit to do.\n\n52:02.880 --> 52:03.720\nThat's the, it's weird.\n\n52:03.720 --> 52:04.560\nBut you don't.\n\n52:04.560 --> 52:05.400\nYou don't have anything to do.\n\n52:05.400 --> 52:06.560\nI know, you shouldn't have anything to do.\n\n52:06.560 --> 52:08.840\nYou should, like, if we, if we, if you were playing\n\n52:08.840 --> 52:11.720\na video game, and you had, like, people walking everywhere,\n\n52:11.720 --> 52:14.880\nand there were some of them that were, like, laying down,\n\n52:14.880 --> 52:17.640\nyou would dedicate all your energy until you had that\n\n52:17.640 --> 52:18.480\nmoving up.\n\n52:18.480 --> 52:20.920\nThat's the liberal perspective, is that a society\n\n52:20.920 --> 52:24.120\nshould be judged by how you treat your, your, your\n\n52:24.120 --> 52:24.960\nlowest individuals.\n\n52:24.960 --> 52:26.840\nI just think it's, it's, we live in a world where people\n\n52:26.840 --> 52:29.240\nthink that life is a competition,

I like it\n\n01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.980\nIt was good. It was a jelly doughnut. I don't really like jelly doughnuts\n\n01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.820\num, so\n\n01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.460\nI dropped my stuff out in the hotel then I got a register\n\n01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.700\nI got my wristband stuff and then went back to my room to take a dump and\n\n01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.700\num\n\n01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:51.820\nI was sitting on the toilet and I was glancing around as you do and um, I was I saw a waste paper basket and\n\n01:08:52.300 --> 01:09:01.020\nYou know hotel cleaners. They clean up things before the guests arrive and stuff so little was I mean large was my surprise when I saw there was\n\n01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.060\nApparently something in one of these waste paper baskets and I was like, uh, that's weird\n\n01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.900\nAnd then I feel like the story would only be enhanced by this. I mean probably not but whatever then\n\n01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860\nYou were right. I take it all back\n\n01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:23.980\nSo I slowly tip tip the waste paper basket towards me to allow myself to see into its depths\n\n01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.460\nAnd I see it looks like like a tissue paper and inside it's just all red\n\n01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:38.540\nAnd I'm like, okay, um, I guess that happens, you know, it's natural that happens put it somewhere\n\n01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.820\nIt's like I always say\n\n01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:46.300\nAnd so but I was really grossed out and I was like, did they just not clean my room? What's going on?\n\n01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.580\nAnd then I looked at it further and I was like, oh, that's just the jelly doughnut I threw away\n\n01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.140\nPortland is amazing\n\n01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.140\nYou\n\n01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.340\nWhat a roller coaster ride\n\n01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.100\nWe thought we found the one bad thing about portland\n\n01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.920\nIt's really just a place you can come to confront your own love of donuts\n\n01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:23.340\nWell, it's it's everything's so pristine, you know, if you see something in a waste paper basket and you don't remember throwing it in there\n\n01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:30.300\nIt's really terrifying.

It's got a little handle on it\n\n01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:23.660\nI open it and look into the contents. There's but but water in a hole\n\n01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.860\nI put my hand in the hole\n\n01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:34.460\nIt feels it fits your fist just exactly as if it was made for it. I go like, uh, this is uh, it's a good chamber pot\n\n01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:42.460\nI go to the door of this of this room and open it up. You open it up and you see it's it's covered in clutter\n\n01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:48.940\nIt's all just paper. There's nothing useful. Can I ask you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry tons of paper. Can I\n\n01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:55.900\nCan I ask you a sidebar question about my character? Yeah, sure. Do I have to poop?\n\n01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.940\nThat's really up to you, man. Is it? Are you kidding me?\n\n01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.860\nYeah\n\n01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.860\nThat's crazy. Okay. I have to poop\n\n01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:12.540\nYou have to poop. It's up to me. It's up to me. I I I tell these guys like it's up to me when I have to poop\n\n01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.260\nI want you to know that about me\n\n01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:20.380\nUh, you should try and see if you can run. There may be situations where that comes to our advantage\n\n01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.780\nThis probably isn't one, but I want you to know\n\n01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.340\nLike I am different from every human every every being on middle earth\n\n01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.060\nIt's up to me when I have to poop\n\n01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.220\nI'm like a dolphin like a dolphin's heartbeat is voluntary\n\n01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.020\nWhat is it right? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, dolphins\n\n01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.980\nThey get to remember to keep their heart beating. What they get to forget and die. No. Yeah\n\n01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:45.020\nYeah, any any if there's a dolphin in the audience let him\n\n01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:52.140\nI saw a dolphin. I saw a literal dolphin today on the fucking river. It came it was going\n\n01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.980\nNo, guys, what was it then? What was it, huh?\n\n01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.260\nWhatever that's just as magnificent\n\n01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.380\nWhat\n\n01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.780\nWhatever you thought it might have been a dolphin. It's a fucking gray\n\n01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:13.420\nDark shiny object coming in and out of the water for air every couple of minutes. The most incredible thing is that the audience was like, no\n\n01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:19.660\nWell, also no, his defiance is weird. Like why would he really it's a great dark shape coming out of that could have been\n\n01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.380\nCould have been your friend from college. No, it couldn't have\n\n01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.220\nIt had a very distinguished fin\n\n01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:35.020\nDid you go to college at sea worlds? Wait, so sea lions don't have dorsal fins. Well, I guess it might have been a dolphin then\n\n01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.460\nEveryone is way more upset about this than I am\n\n01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:50.700\nWell, it's weird to it's just an animal. You saw a dolphin just because you saw a gray thing. Isn't there a possibility?\n\n01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.420\nThis is fresh water, right? Not like a dolphin can't just be cruising down the river dolphins\n\n01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:57.420\nBut I think those are\n\n01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.700\nThose exist those definitively exist\n\n01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.100\nThere's no there are no river dolphins. Those are purposes South America someone's saying no\n\n01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:11.260\nWhere the river is so big it's like an ocean. I think we solved this in the first 10 seconds\n\n01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:16.300\nIt was a sea lion. Yeah, and I don't care. It was gorgeous. But with a fin with a dorsal fin\n\n01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:19.340\napparently\n\n01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.980\nThat's what I saw\n\n01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.580\nAll right, have you ever touched a dolphin? Uh, no\n\n01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.380\nSorry, no\n\n01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.700\nSharpie\n\n01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940\nJust so\n\n01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.020\nJust so I know\n\n01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:41.900\nYou said that there would be certain situations when you having to poop would be advantageous. Yeah for well later later\n\n01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.940\nI don't know could you just list some of them so I know no no\n\n01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.580\nNo, I sit down\n\n01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.580\nSpencer and I poop\n\n01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:56.860\nMm-hmm because you said it's up to me. Yeah, I poop bad. I'm telling now you can ask your questions\n\n01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.940\nWell, I'm pooping. It's not a big you gotta make eye contact with me\n\n01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:10.140\nYou guys I want you to lock eyes with me. I don't tell you anything you want to hear\n\n01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:17.580\nBut now but now you need to know that I'm pooping while you talk to me I'm pooping. All right\n\n01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.580\nAre you okay? Yeah\n\n01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.300\nYeah\n\n01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.420\nHow are you?\n\n01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.300\nGood\n\n01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:29.900\nSharpie, what do you what do you what do you want to achieve in this lifetime? I'd like to touch other people\n\n01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.340\nLike I want them to know that I was here\n\n01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.060\nWhat do you what do you want them to remember of you?\n\n01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:49.020\nYeah, honestly, I don't I don't I don't need them to think that I was good or bad\n\n01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.220\nI want them to I just want to be remembered. I want it to be specific\n\n01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:58.300\nI want I want to be I want them to I want to be irreplaceable. I want to be I want to be singular\n\n01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.140\nPlop\n\n01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:10.460\nI assume I mean it's either up to you or to me. I don't know that when it when it when it\n\n01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.700\nfalls\n\n01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:18.940\nSure, if you were to to die today. What do you think people would remember you most for Sharpie? Oh god\n\n01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:23.980\nI don't even I feel like they would I don't I feel like too many too few people would\n\n01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:30.220\nHave known that I wasn't around that's what terrifies me. Maybe that skeleton army show on the bridge. That was\n\n01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:36.140\nYeah, but I don't think those guys knew my name. I don't think, you know, I hold on a second\n\n01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.300\nI I would just like to\n\n01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.020\nI feel like none of us get to live forever\n\n01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.260\nThat's not the goal\n\n01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:53.180\nThat's not a real life. Don't take this personally, but I'm just gonna back away five feet or so\n\n01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.460\nDoes it stink you guys are you guys all in here?\n\n01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:00.140\nUh, what's my pooped in nine months?

This is my house. Oh, why is your house next to a bathroom?\n\n01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:58.460\nSo hard to fathom that I'm a bit weirded out by three people shitting in my bathroom\n\n01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:02.940\nNone of you are gnomes. Take all of you. One of you is a gnome. That's not true\n\n01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:08.940\nWell, I'll be your home invasion nightmares and then add to it the idea that the people home-invading\n\n01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.900\nDon't acknowledge that they're doing anything wrong\n\n01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.500\nAnd yet it would be scarier. It would be scarier. And yet you speak of the isle of paradise and the tarugana virtue\n\n01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.940\nLet's damn. I'm I'm so sorry.
