WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
From the Jupiter Hotel, the Douglas Fur, Doug Fur, whatever the fuck this place is called,

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
the Portland, Oregon, one of the greatest cities on the planet Earth.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
It is my absolute pleasure to say that Harmontown is now in session.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you. Thank you. I immediately started crying.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I walked out of the stage and started crying. Why? I think it's because I'm drunk.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm a servant. It's not because tonight's important.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
People in the world with leukemia, why am I crying?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm crying because your donuts are great. You're a great city.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
How many of you are here that live in Portland?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
See, a lot of times, Jeff, when we go to other cities, we go like,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
well, who here is from Poughkeepsie?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And then there's like eight people go like, I'm here.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
And then the rest of the people are like, I drove here from L.A.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Because they hate Poughkeepsie.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
People love being in Portland. They fucking love it.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
It is a great town. I got asked, what's the guy's name? Andy?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Who's running this thing? Yeah. He said, do you want to come do this festival?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And I said, yes, can I be there for three days instead of one?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I'd rather be in Portland than not be in Portland.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
I scheduled extra days, too. And for Aaron's sake, I said, well,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I'll stay till Sunday and I'm not going to do any other shows

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
other than Harmontown. Aaron will appreciate that.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
And then it was like gift of the UCB workshop magi that I said,

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm not doing any shows, except she's like, I'm doing nine shows a day.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
If you'd like to see Erin McGathy this weekend in Portland,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
just swing a cat. Try not to.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
She is in every fucking show. This side of Seattle, I don't know.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
No, you don't have to have a response to that.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
All right, let's get on track. I don't want to have a sloppy show tonight.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
You've paid a lot of money. I am not drunk. I didn't do anything wrong.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
You're drunk as a fucking fiddler right now. So drunk.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
He's lying.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I met you for breakfast. You were drunk when you showed up for breakfast.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, I was hungover. We were all hungover.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
We all know what happened yesterday. We all got drunk.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
So then when you're hungover, you drink through it.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
You don't go like, I'm hungover. I'm not going to drink ever again.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
That's rookie bullshit.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
That will take you straight to AA. That's for quitters.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
It's an old stand-up joke. AA is for quitters.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm wearing, we went to Mary's Trip Club today.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
I made Dan and Aaron. I had breakfast at Mother's, which is too crowded now.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And then I went to Huber's to have a Spanish coffee.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
But Huber's fucking good. But I didn't have a Spanish coffee.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I had her in Manhattan. And then three more.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
With a couple of people named Tina and Dirk.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
God, I hope they're listening at some point in the future.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Because they were hilarious. And then you guys rolled in.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
And then I made Dan and Aaron go to Mary's Club.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Which is, I think, a Portland institution.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Not that I'm a strip club enthusiast, necessarily.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
But you kind of have to go there, because it's so good.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I think you have to be a strip club enthusiast to go to any strip club.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
You have to be into Legos to buy a Lego box, right?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
You don't just go like, oh, that looks interesting.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Blocks that connects.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
You can't walk in off the street into a strip club and be like, oh, cool.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
You have to be like a fucking aficionado.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
No, you don't. You go there because the girls that work there, it's so small.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
And there's like weird theater seating.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
There's like two rows of theater seats.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And you can buy a drink and pee at the same time.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Like, it's so small.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
He's selling that like it's like a big positive thing.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
If you can drink and pee in the same place, that's not...

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
But the girls all have ill-advised tattoos.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
And they get up there and there's a jukebox on stage.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And when they go on stage, they put a couple of dollars in.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And they play fucking Tom Waits and shit.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Like, they're like, well, let's see you tonight at all the downtown trade.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And they're taking their clothes off.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And then their butt cheeks are doing weird yoga shit.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah, and they flex there.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
They do like the tiny Lister Jr. thing with their boobs.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Or you flex the pecs.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
You don't go there kind of sexy.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
With the Mr. Universe thing with the boobs.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
But they have boobs.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
So they're like Jim Henson workshop kind of character.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I'll tell you what it isn't.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
It's not sexy.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
And here's the conversation that happened on the sidewalk

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
after we went in there for a drink.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
This is the classic conversation that a lot of people have.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Aaron turned to me and Jeff and said,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
So do you guys have boners?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And I immediately went, which is the truth.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm like, no, absolutely not.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
My penis is retracted into my abdomen

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
because I was in a place of grief.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
And then Aaron goes, oh, what?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
You didn't think those girls were attractive?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't know.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It's a fucking minefield.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I don't get it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And I don't know what my role is.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't know how to be a feminist.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I don't know how to be a masculinist in a strip club.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I don't know what you do.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
When I walk into a strip club, what I typically find

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
is that it's dead silent.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And that there's a woman on stage

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and that she's doing this stuff.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And she seems like a good person.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
The odd thing about this place

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
is that the quarters are so close

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and it was so quiet that you could really,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
you were really intimately acquainted

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
with the performers.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And what I mean by that is that a woman

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
would finish doing booby wiggles

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
and then she would go over to a three-ring binder

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
and while leafing through it would say to the guy to her left,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Hey, Glenn, what do you like?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And he would go like, I don't know.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
The traffic was so hard on the 110 today.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And she'd be like, yeah, well, you should always take fountain.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And this is LA Traffic Speak,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
but I'm just saying, she was like, talk it.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I was like, did you see Hannibal last night?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It was like, good.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
And I think that's, from a human perspective,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
that's what's supposed to happen.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
But from a regular perspective, it's weird

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
because now I don't understand.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I don't understand my role.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
You said, Jeff, you said,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
you could just go in there and hang out.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
I said, if I go up to the rail in a strip club

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and I start just talking loudly about

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
how I think Parks and Rec is cheating

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
because they can cut to people explaining jokes.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
If I'm just like explaining, yeah,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
the thing is mockumentary is like it's overblown.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I get it, Ricky Gervais did it for six episodes,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
but it was part of the story.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Then you adopt it into America.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
It was a story telling for money.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
There's a guy behind me who's going to have a right to go,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
hey, fuck off.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
What are you doing in a strip club?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And I'm going to go, I don't know.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't know why I'm in a strip club.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It's not to get a boner.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It's not for her.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
It's not for me.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know whose side I'm on.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I don't know if she's empowered.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm empowered.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
We're all empowered.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
What the fuck's going on in here?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Let's just take off my clothes and just roll around

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
and throw money in the air and eat tacos.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I don't know what the fuck to do.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Don't get it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Why is there an orange garnish in your drink right now?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You have a sexy cocktail right now.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
This is a Negroni.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
A Negroni.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
This is my cheat day.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm a cheat day.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Wait, so vodka is regular day.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That's zero carbs, motherfucker.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You can have, you can have, you can have.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Wow.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Find a carb in a glass of vodka.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I defy you.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
A Negroni, that's like the donut of drinks.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
So you can have bourbon and campari.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
So we left Mary's Club and I went to Powell's Books.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
By the way, what was it?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I went to, for me, my first two stops,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
well, first stop when I come to Portland,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Powell's Books, because it's the Disneyland of people that read.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Dan, books are things with pages with words on them

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
that people read.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I know.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
It's like the internet, but smaller.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
With lower speeds.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
So I said, we got drunk at Huber's.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I met some local lunatics and I said,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I really have to go to Huber's.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I started out at Powell's.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I popped in there, got a couple of books,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and you went and found a bar.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And I got a text from you saying,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm in a nearby bar called the Such-and-Such.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I didn't say it's the coolest place in the world.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It's just a place, I got a glass of chamet.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
But true to Portland style,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
you talk about southern hospitality.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Portland hospitality.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
The only person working in the place was a one-bar tender.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And she gave me, I guess, I thought it was chamet.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I said, I'm feeling fancy.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I'm a lumberjack.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I'd like to, maybe I'll build a new bar next door on a wood.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Everything's wood here.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
They're all into wood.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
I bet there hasn't been a tree here in years.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
What there is is good people and good prices.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
So drunk.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So drunk.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
All right.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Everybody gets a medal for noticing I'm drunk.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
What are you going to do with it?

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Who are you going to complain to?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
So I'm in the bookstore.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Also, I was drunk enough in the bookstore

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
to walk up to the person at Powell's.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You can walk up to the desk and say hello.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
I would like you to check if these books exist.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And they go, I'd be happy to help you.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And I couldn't utter a word.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You're allowed to do that in Portland.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
You can get that wasted.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And the guy looked at me and said, hey, you're in a town

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
where you can come fucked up to a bookstore.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Hey, Matt.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Seems like you've put a junk in high.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Section 642.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Oh, by the way, did you see these books?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Squiggle writing.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm making a mental note out loud right now to get all of the drugs

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
that people gave me last night out of my bag before I fly away.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
If anybody wants a bunch of edibles and weed,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I have to get rid of them tonight.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah, I'm over.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
I'm a pinata.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Come up to me tonight.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Because all of you give me raised crispy treats.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I can't eat them all.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I can't bring them on the plane.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
So just hit me and want to pop out.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Also, the beauty of this gig is we're staying upstairs.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
We live here at the Jupiter Hotel in the Dugfur.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Just seriously, just ask me if you want all of the shit

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
that people gave me last night.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Dude, I was fucking dancing last night.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Aaron was in the other room.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I fucking danced until four in the morning.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Because it's Portland.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
He just feels like, you know, it's just Portland.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
And I was like, dance until four in the morning.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Like, by myself.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
I wasn't grinding on anybody.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I wasn't doing it to impress anybody.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I was just like fucking dancing.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I had to straw in my mouth.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'm like, a solo cup in my hand.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm like, fucking 41.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm like, meep-mop-mop.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Meep-mop-mop.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Meep-mop-mop.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Meep-mop.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
It's just like sometimes, sometimes give my feet a rest.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Don't move them anymore.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Like doing vertical shit.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Let's move in the hips.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Elevator goes up, down.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Fucking rocking it.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Fucking people coming up, like shaking their shit in my face.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm like, yeah, I'll take that.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I won't take that.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't give a fuck.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Just dance it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Control the floor.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And there was a guy that kept coming up to me.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't know if he had this authority, but he kept going like,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
are you ready to freestyle?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Are you ready to freestyle?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Every half hour, this guy would come up and he'd start dancing with me.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
And he'd go like, so you wanted freestyle yet?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And I felt like he was friends with the DJ.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
And I felt like there was a point where I could have easily gone up

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
and I could have freestyled, wrapped at the thing.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
But I turned my back on it.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And I felt, yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Before we get to your freestyle, let's go back to me leaving pals books.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
We got a lot of...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
So I'm happily...

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I have two new books.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't need them.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I've got too many books I haven't read anyway.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm drunk.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm leaving pals books.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I have a text from Dennis saying, I'm at a bar nearby.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
So I fucking roll out of there and I use the old iPhone to find out where you are.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
And I come into a place called...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It was called Life a Rally.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Life a Rally.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Life a Rally.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
You don't have to grumble.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
All right, you're Portland.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
We get it.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
It was empty.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
That's the thing.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Good places were full.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Okay, so take it from there.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Because I walk in there.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
You're there.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
You have a chameleon in your hand.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
There were two dudes as a preamble.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
There were two dudes that I felt like they were a gay couple

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
just to put an image in your head of their mannerisms.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Like, there were two really fit dudes who were very happy.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
And I'm like, but also they had a weird fratty edge to them.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It was a weird combination.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
And the one guy...

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I would not have...

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
If I saw them from a distance, I would not have said gay couple.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I would have thought fratty guys.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
Maybe I'm homophobic or maybe I'm like homo-doolittle.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Like, like maybe...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't care.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I would love for everyone to be gay.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm going to put my pitch in right now for this episode

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
to be called homo-doolittle.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I mean, maybe I projected onto them.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I bet they're gay because I was like, I wanted them to be happy

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
because I felt like they were having a good time together

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
and there was a lot of sexual frustration

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
and there was a lot of energy and drama coming from them.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And I was like, I hope those two go home tonight and fuck.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I felt like they were gay.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And I...

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
And you know what?

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I wanted to give them each two votes in the upcoming election.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Too late. Too late.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
In case you're wondering if I'm part of the problem.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
No.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I would like to live in a society where every gay man

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
got three fucking votes.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
What happened before I walked in there?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Because I want to live in gay world.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Dan, you're fine.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Dan, we...

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm sorry, am I protesting too much?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm just saying, I'm cool with the gays.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I'm fine.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Like everything would be better if they were in charge.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
You're straight.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
What you're saying is you're straight.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But what I don't want is for them to beat me up.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
What happened at this bar is...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
These were like bad...

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
These were very, very, very rare.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Incredibly rare.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Bad gay men.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
I felt.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I feel like genetically they're better than everyone.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Whoa!

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
But these two...

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I would like to weed them out.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
All right.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Or make them straight.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
What would be a punishment for them?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Just tell the story.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
You're right.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
You're right.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No more editorializing.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
You make your own decision.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I don't know.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
They might have been straight.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
If they were, that explains a lot.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Because if they were straight, then they were fucking intermoinal inside.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't think they were, but I will hold judgment to it.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
The incredibly sweet bartender, I should say she's female,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
because it seems important we're talking, we're setting a stage here.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
Very, very sweet female bartender who, as a footnote,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I ordered a drink from her and she said,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
do you want something from the menu?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Would you like somebody to eat?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And I said, well, I have kind of a...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Do you have a dessert menu?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Like, something sweet.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
She said, we don't have dessert.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
I'm like, okay.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Five seconds later, she comes up and she puts a handful of peppermint candies on the bar.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Portland, hashtag Portland.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
We're here to fucking, like, we're thinking about you.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
We want you, like, this doesn't happen anywhere ever.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
That's the opposite of Logan's run.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
Somebody was like, I thought when you said,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
like, her job was done.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
They don't have a dessert menu.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
She fucking took that shit to a bowl of candy, but I don't get it.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't even get it.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I love it.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I love your city.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
And I'm sorry, I'm sitting there going like,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
oh, Jesus Christ, what a good people.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm trying to make you understand, this woman's a hero.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Because then she went over to the other guys

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
and they were kind of dramatic and very fit.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Maybe that's part of what I'm holding against them.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
They looked crunchy and abby and six-packy and...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Crunchy?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Gunny, bicep-y.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Like, they looked good.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I kind of sleep with them, but...

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
So I think they were good.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
She went to them and they were being loud the whole time.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
It was fine.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
They were charismatic individuals in the corner.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
They're having a good time.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Probably talking about spot-checking each other.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Bench press.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
She said to one of them, do you guys want anything else?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
And the loud, like, kind of aggressive one,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
we will call, let's give them a name, Stripe.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Stripe.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
The bad gremlin.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
He said to her, she went,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
can I get you guys anything else?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
He went, I'm just having the greatest time looking at you.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Is that rude?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Yeah, it is.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
That's weird.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I don't know.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So that was the mood he was in.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Like, he was feeling his oats.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Was that a phrase?

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Nope.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I mean, it is now.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
So Jeff walks in with Moby Dick,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
or whatever the fuck he bought from here.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
Prove we can still exist, bookstore.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Like, it's a movement.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
Flash mob, hashtag, like, books should still exist.com.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
We get it.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh, it's fun.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
With your thumb.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Oh, it cut me.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Great.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Information at a price.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Who would have thought of it?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Your anti-book?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't know why I'm doing that.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
It's a weird platform.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It's a weird, you know what?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Even if most of the world feels that way,

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
you know, no one will feel okay getting on your side of that.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I mean, anti-book.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Jeff walks in with his fucking books.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
But when was Mark Twain?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Look it up.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Fucking Google him.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You bought a Mark Twain book?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Yes, because I meet people and we talk about books,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
and they go, oh, you should read this.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And I write it down on my phone.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Yeah, a phone.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
My iPhone.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
I have a little note thing.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
And I write down book titles.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And when I go to Powell's, or if I'm in Seattle,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I go to Elliott Bay.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And like the good bookstores in the world

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
that actually carry the shit that you want to find.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
It's not like a Barnes & Noble piece of garbage.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
When you go to Portland, you can actually find

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
the books that you wish you had.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And the end, I'm smart.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
All right.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Read a book, motherfucker.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I know.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Read a book.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
You're a writer.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
You're a writer.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, you know what?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Read a fucking book.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah, reading is for consumers.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I'm a writer.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Consumers of what?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
That's like a spider being into spiderwebs.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Like a spider is like, I love spiderwebs.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
No, motherfucker, you spun this shit.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
To catch flies.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
If a spider could read, a spider would read a book.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
A spider can't read.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Motherfucker, I'm going to fight you.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm going to fight you in Portland.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Spiders can't read.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
What happened to this place?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
We've wasted a lot of time on this today.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
What happened to this place?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Inexplicably.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I roll in with books.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Two books.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Provocative material.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
So Jeff's at the end of the bar.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
By bar in quotes, because it's beachwood, it's bright.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
It's fucking midday lit.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
It's a nice place.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
It's a touristy, downtown, dumpy bar.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
And then one of these two incredibly sexy, probably gay guys,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
goes over, he senses that there's other people there.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
He goes up to Aaron and he goes like, what was his entree?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
It was like, I hope he's not with you.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
You're so beautiful.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
And then he said, yes, this is my side of the story.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
We'll bring Aaron out in a second.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I want to hear her side, but from my objective,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
glowering into my chameleon.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I had just sat down.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
He said, hello, sweetheart.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
He did an extravagant kind of like, hello,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
I'm that guy from the other part of the bar.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I want your attention now too, which is fine.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
I love your style.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
You're so beautiful.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
You look great.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
But in the midst of that introduction, he said,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I hope you're not with him.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
And did this kind of sassy to Jeff.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I hope you're not with him.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And Jeff said, go fuck yourself.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Fuck off.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
And then he goes, what?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
And then he was like, I wasn't talking to you.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
He's like, you weren't talking to me.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
I said, he goes like, I hope you're not with him.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I go, oh, you fuck off.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
He came over and was like being like too much.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
And I said, you go away.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
And he goes, oh, I hope you're not with him.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
And I said, I'm a stylist.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I just think your hair is so cool.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
I go, your personality needs touching up.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
And he goes, who?

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And then his friend, his even sexier friend,

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
who I assume is gay because he's fucking hot,

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
started saying things like, I could hear them

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
before everybody would go there.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
He goes, what did you just say?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I go, hey, I wasn't talking to you.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I said, well, you were.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I said, your voice carries.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
He goes, oh, my voice carries.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
He did a thing where he was like, my voice carries.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
But it felt flat.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It was like a flat C, flat.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
My voice carries.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
I said something along the lines that, hey, fuck off.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The adults are having a conversation over here.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
And then he enlisted the more muscular guy in the duo.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
And he goes, stop me before I do something stupid.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
And I go, oh.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
That's what you heard.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
And then he said, later on in this altercation,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
this big five minute blossom of human interaction.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
At one point, I heard this guy say,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
in a certain point, I'm going to start slicing faces.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Slicing faces?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
That was after I left.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
What do you love?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I had left at that point.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
The guy that came at us with the, I'm a stylist

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
and I'm Mr. Wonderful.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And I'm like, oh, wait.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I hope you're not with him.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I go, you go away.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Your personality could use some touching up.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And then the other guy's like, I'm going to go away.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
And I go, oh.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Now Mr. Wonderful over here wants to be involved

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
because he's stopping me before I do something stupid.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm going to slice some faces.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
So I grab my Mark Twain and whatever.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
What was in the book I bought?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I forget.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I picked my two books up and I fucking bone out

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
because I know where this is going.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Because where it's going is nowhere.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And then I read a fucking tweet from you

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
where the guy was threatened to slice faces.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
That was during the whole thing though.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
I could hear him.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
And so I was engaging with him.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
He would say stuff.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Slice face.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It was a really young man, really.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
You're going to beat people up.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And he and I actually had an arc.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
At the end of it, I had, because he...

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
This is the guy that you refer to as so hot he must be gay.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
All right.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
This guy's actually the hero of the story kind of.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Because you want to fuck him.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
No, because he...

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Because he was so...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
You fucked this guy, right?

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
He felt an obligation to beat everyone up

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
who had a problem with his friend who was causing trouble.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
So when I actually engaged with him, it was like...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
He said, I'm sorry.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I said, look, I'm sorry too.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
It's weird to threaten to slice people's faces.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
And he said, hey, he said, look, I'm with my friend.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I feel like I have to stick up for my friend.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
And I'm like, there you go.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
That's humanity.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
That's it in the bottle.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Everyone's got to stick up for their friend.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
The fucking...

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
That's why barflights happen.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
It's like, dumb.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It's like two guys like...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
I don't know.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
We spent too much time on this.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Those guys are listening to this and going like,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
we did it.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Because here's another fucking weird thing.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Aaron said, Aaron said...

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I didn't hear this.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Aaron said that during the altercation,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
one of them pointed at you and said,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm glad your show got canceled.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Pointed at me?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
You thought that you were me?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I assume.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Or that I was Jeff Winger.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't know.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Or they thought whose line is not coming back.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Dan, listen up, Barry the lead.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Your show got canceled today.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yes, it did.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
It did.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
It did.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
By gay people.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
You guys are...

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Gay people canceled the show.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Gay...

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
By...

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
We should address that in due time.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm sorry.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
We spent too much time talking about some weird beachwood bar...

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
I was in a plane yesterday and I landed

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
and the driver named Dan...

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Dan, are you here?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Are you here?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Dan Kogan?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Dan!

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Is he here?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Are you like Hodor from Game of Thrones?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Hodor.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Hodor.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Dan!

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Hodor.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
It's not his name.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Hodor.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It's just the sound he makes.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Anyway.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Dan!

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Dan, love.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
I flew in before you did and our driver, Dan Kogan, said

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Dan, I'm picking him up in an hour or two.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Does he know that it's...

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Does he know that it's show got canceled?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I go, I didn't know that.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
I said, I wonder when did that news drop?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
He goes, recently.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
There was a chance that you were on the plane when that news dropped.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah, they called me.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
I was on my way to LAX and somebody from Sony called me.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
And they told me.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
Listen, I...

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
The fans of that show have more reason to be upset than I do.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I can go try to create another show and also I got paid for every minute I cared about

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
that show.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
And a lot of...

27:49.000 --> 27:58.000
I don't know what you're plotting, but capitalism...

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
The trickle down...

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
The people that are most devastated are people that put unpaid labor into the show.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
It's like, hashtagging this.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm getting a tattoo of this.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I love this show.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
They didn't get compensated for it.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
They had a relationship with the show.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Were there community tattoos?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Oh, sure.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
There was community tattoos.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Does anybody here have a community-related tattoo?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You don't have to be ashamed.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
I always have mixed feelings about the tattoo thing.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Somebody will show me a Rick and Morty tattoo and I'll go, I'm not sure.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
It's the highest compliment, but at the same time, I don't know what to...

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It's a terrible idea.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Well, it depends on what you feel.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
I don't know what...

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
It's none of your business how somebody wants to...

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
I don't know.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
It's weird.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
It's a permanent thing.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
And then you...

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Dumb.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
This is not entertainment.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
This is me.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Dan, your feelings aside...

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
And also, you can't totally relate to the hardcore fan who loves community.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
But now it's...

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
That's the end of the show that means a lot to people.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Also, it clearly means a lot to you.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
The fact that that's now done, how does that emotionally affect you?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
It'll take weeks to sink in.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
But there was somebody who handed out...

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
There was literature being handed out in the line.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Kyle.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Kyle, right?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Yes.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Kyle.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I gave it to you.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Every time we come to Portland, there's a high-concept gimmick...

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
Graphic design-wise.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
It's a more intelligent...

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Everyone here...

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
No one lifts anything in Portland.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Everyone just goes to work at a draft table...

29:33.000 --> 29:41.000
And they eat coffee, and then they go home in a weirdly designed egg-shaped race car bed...

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
That folds up into God's consciousness for eight hours.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
And it folds down, and they go back out and be open-minded for a living.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
I don't know.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't know.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
I don't know what you people do.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
You're delightful.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
You should move here.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
You should move here.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm gonna move here and have a bunch of babies.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Lumberjack babies.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
All my kids are gonna look like the lead singer of Spin Doctors.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Boo!

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
Don't you dare boo the fucking Spin Doctors, you fucking Portland asshole.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
I think he booed your baby.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
He hasn't even...

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
He's gonna be your last defense against Skynet.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
He's gonna have a microphone on one hand and an axe on the other.

30:33.000 --> 30:41.000
Don't you dare boo Conor Harmon.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
I feel a native Conor Harmon.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
I remember when I was ten years old, as I've said before on the show, I was on...

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
As a kid, I was in the King and I, this play with your Brenner.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
And we toured the country, and then we did Broadway, and then he died.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
But when I was ten, I don't know why that's funny, but I love that you...

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
If Jeff asked you to be part of his next Broadway production, as tempting as it is, just say no.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
You gotta die.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
But when I was ten, we did the...

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Is it the fitzer, the Spencer, the flitzer?

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Schnitzer.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Schnitzer?

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The schnitzer.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Hey, Scoot.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Are you...

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Where's Scoot?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Oh, there you go.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Okay, thank you.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
So anyway, as a kid, I...

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Thank you, Scoot.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
We played at the schnitzer, the fister, or the flitzer, or whatever the fuck.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
And I was on tour with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proups and Chabes, and we toured with Who's Live,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
like a Who's Lying kind of thing.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
And I walked in there, and I said, oh fuck, I think I played in this theater when I was ten.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
And this is 20 years, or 25 years later.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
And the doorman there, I said, I was here as a kid.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
And he goes, yeah.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
He goes, your name's Jeff.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And it was the fucking doorman when I was a kid.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
He goes, do you want me to walk you to your old dressing room?

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
And he just started fucking me.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Better than you've ever been fucked.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Not true.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
New York style.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
It's not true.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
East Coast style.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
No, but he remembered the show.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
And there he fucking was, and he took me to my dressing room.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
Now I'm twice as tall as I was.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
And so the dressing room is twice as small as I remember.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And we fucking did that show there.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
And like, fuck, what's the point of my story?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh, I remember now.

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
So I was, we would do matinees, and I would be, I had kind of like a page boy haircut

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
because I played like a little British kid.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
And I had makeup on because it was a theater show.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
And I was ten.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
And I went to a McDonald's with my brother, who did not have makeup on.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
But we went in there to McDonald's here in Portland.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
What's the park near where the fister or the footster or the Spencer is?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah, there was a McDonald's there.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
And I fucking rolled in there at ten years old.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
And the guy goes, what can I get you ladies?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
But he didn't have makeup on.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
I was like, we're boys.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
And he goes, well, what can I get you?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I was like, you motherfucker.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
It's like, just because I'm wearing makeup at 10 a.m.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
doesn't mean I'm gay or a girl.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I've never given Portland for that.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I think it's why you and that guy got in a fight tonight.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I didn't get in a fight. I left. You got in a fight.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I didn't get in a fucking fight.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
I was hunched over a chameleon.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
All right.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Were you going to freestyle tonight?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Let's give these people their money's worth.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
In LA, you pay $10.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
$10 is whatever.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
It gets you a pair of socks.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
These people paid probably more.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
There's other people who paid VIP.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I met some of them in the bar.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
They got VIP bracelets.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
They paid more money to make sure that they could get in.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Not at the wait line.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
It doesn't matter.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
Capitalism can go fuck itself, but it serves me tonight.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Not that I'm taking a cut.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
I don't give a fuck about your money.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
But what I do want to make sure of is that you're entertained.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Is James Adomian here?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
There was a gasp.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Is he here?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Is he here?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
I heard he was here.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
James, are you here?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
No. He's not here.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Oh, fuck.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
All right. It's fine.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
It doesn't matter.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
No, because that was going to be a fucking goodie.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
I wanted to do...

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
James Adomian is here at the festival.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
He does the best Vincent Price impression I've ever heard in my life.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
I wanted to...

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
I told him last night, come to the show, we'll do a rap,

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
and then you do the Vincent Price bridge for the rap.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Spiders Delight.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Spiders Delight.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
Uki Uki sandwiches.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Why are spiders so delightful?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
No, it's a spiders delight.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Spiders Delight is horror.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It's like what does the Addams family like?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
They like bad soup.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
Spiders Delight is like...

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
It's not a good delicious cupcake.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Wrong beat. Wrong beat.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Anybody? James Adomian?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Anybody got a 20 on James Adomian?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Nope.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Fuck that guy.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's Bridgetown for you.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
It's Bridgetown, dad.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Forget it.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Forget about it.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Kumail's off doing a different show.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Kumail, he was so funny last night.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
We made a lot of cool friends.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Paul Provenza.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Paul Provenza?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Oh shit.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Yeah.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Yo.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Yo.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
I'll do my own Vincent Price.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yo.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Yo.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Yo.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yo.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Yo.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Yo.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yo.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Rap.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Rap.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Rap.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Yo.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Rap.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Wait, Dan told me before the show that he was going to rap tonight.

35:51.000 --> 36:00.000
And that not only was he going to rap, but it was going to be great.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
That he wasn't going to do one of those tepid, you know, like slap dash.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Can you bail on it?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
No.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
You say a word that you can't rhyme and then you see the word together.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
You rhyme that word with that word and you bail on it.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
You felt like tonight you're going to deliver actual like subriomology.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Yeah.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
All right, here we go.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Yo.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Yo.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Yo.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
All right.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
You're holding the mic wrong.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
You don't have to hold the mic like that.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
All right.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I'm sorry.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Go ahead.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Come on, man.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yo.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Yo.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Yo.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Dan Harmon.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Yo.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Best rap ever.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Yo.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Sky to the ground, to the ground to the sky.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
I fucked your mama in each of her eyes.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
I made her blind so she had depth perception problems.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Yo.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Reception is...

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Ah, fuck.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I...

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
I...

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Okay.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Obviously we know what...

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
We know what I...

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
We know what I did wrong, though.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
You want to stick to monosyllabic words that end with a vowel.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Freeze down.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Dan, don't be fettered by Peter or...

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
All right.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I fucked up.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I fucked up.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Pour it in.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Yo.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Yo.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
Dan, I would say rap about your day.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Rap about...

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
What's on your mind?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
How do you know I wasn't going to?

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
Because you said yo for 16 measures.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Yo.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Yo.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Yo.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Yo.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Yo.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Yo.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Yo.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Yeah.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Okay.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
All right.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Okay.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Yo.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Pour it in.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
That's still just...

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
All right.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Sorry.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
That was my fault.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
All right.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm trying...

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I gotta wipe my head clean every time.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Just...

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Just feeling...

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Just feeling the beat.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
I'm in Portland.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
The land of trees and sky.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Why ain't we in Seattle?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Tell me why.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
Because it's too far north and too fucked up.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Yo.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Portland is what's up.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
It's a beautiful place full of trees.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
Fuck your mama so hard that she fell to her knees and she...

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
She begged for more.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
She said let's go camp and make your dick into a s'more.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
I said I'm out of chocolate and crackers, you know.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Don't know what you're doing, but I got financial backers.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Go to Kickstarter.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Try to get a new season.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Gonna fuck your mama so hard.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Don't got no reason to.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Whoa.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Fuck your mama and your dad.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
She said that wasn't bad.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
But you can do it better.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Put your daddy in a Superman sweater and he...

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Made him knit his own.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
It was a new form of a masculine.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
He was owned.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Santa chair, knitted a sweater.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Like, acted like he didn't care.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
But the truth is he was emasculated.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Just give me a...

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Just give me a second.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Fuck your good.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
It's all right. Thank you.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Thank you for your support. Thank you.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It's for a good cause. Thank you.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Yeah.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Yo.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yo.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Every right post a cancer is out.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Port land from the P to the O

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
to the R to the T.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
L.A. don't know.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I got to end to the D.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Fuck your mama on the side.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Fuck your mama so hard that her pussy got wide.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Drove a train from A to B through her.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Fuck your mama like my name was Ben.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Her got in my chariot.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Whippin' it next to me.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
Fuck your mama till she had her hysterectomy.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
No. Sorry about that.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
That was fucked up. Sorry.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Sorry.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Sometimes the science drops and you don't know.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You become a cyclops.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
You've got one eye and you're just looking at the beats.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Sorry. Turned your mama.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
That was fucked up.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Surgical to clinical.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
Uncool. It's not cool.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Sorry.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
All right. Here we go.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
One last verse.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Yo.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Yo.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Yo.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Yo.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Yo.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Yo.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Yo.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
Fuck your mama from the A to the B

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Fuck your mama from the C to the D

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Fuck your mama from the E to the D

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
The alphabet rhymes. See?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Fuck your mama all around.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Fuck your mama with my vision.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Fuck your mama with my sound.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I said fuck you.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
Oh. All right. All right.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Portland. Portland.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Portland rap.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
That's your money's worth.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
This is gravy.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Let's bring out Erin McGathy. Shall we?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Erin McGathy.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Hi.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Yo.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Yo.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Yo.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yo.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yo.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yo.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Yo.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Yo.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Yo.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Yo.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Yo.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Yo.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Yo.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Yo.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Yo.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Yo.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Yo.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Yo.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yo.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Yo.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Yo.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Yo.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Yo.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.840
Yo.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yo.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yo.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Yo.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Yo.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yo.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Yo.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Yo.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Yo.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Yo.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Yo.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Yo.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Yo.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Yo.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yo.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yo.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Yo.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh my goodness.

42:04.000 --> 42:04.840
No problem.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.840
It's a real quick, great.

42:08.840 --> 42:09.680
All right.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.260
So what was it, just real quick,

42:11.260 --> 42:14.460
let's agree to not spend more than nine minutes on this.

42:14.460 --> 42:18.800
Well, real quick, I just wanted to clarify something.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.180
When we walked out of the strip club,

42:22.180 --> 42:24.080
there was a misunderstanding when you said

42:24.080 --> 42:26.880
that your penis retracted.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.000
I instinctively, what I said was,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.520
I thought they were really pretty.

42:30.520 --> 42:31.960
I didn't say, you didn't thank them,

42:31.960 --> 42:33.040
and I'm not pretty.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.600
I'm sorry about that.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.440
I'm sorry.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.280
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.160
And I know it was a misunderstanding.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.000
You're right.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
No, it's just a bit of a minefield for a guy,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.720
because you don't even know if your role as a feminist

42:44.720 --> 42:46.640
coming out of a strip club is supposed to be like,

42:46.640 --> 42:47.840
but I don't even have a boner.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.240
There was nothing sexual about that,

42:49.240 --> 42:51.000
and then you can follow that road.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.400
It doesn't lead all the way to Rome.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.800
Yeah, we're all confused.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.040
It will bump up against objectification of women

42:56.040 --> 42:56.880
in a different way.

42:56.880 --> 42:57.720
Well, in the recent way, I asked.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.400
Because you'll be going, oh, they were fucking ugly.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.360
And it's like, well, okay, so then you go like, oh, no,

43:01.360 --> 43:02.560
they were hot, they made my dick hard.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.400
Okay, now they're hot,

43:03.400 --> 43:07.320
and I don't know what the bumper table,

43:07.320 --> 43:08.840
like, why are we doing this?

43:08.840 --> 43:09.680
What are we doing?

43:09.680 --> 43:12.720
Jeff is the only person who knew why we were doing that.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.640
He doesn't know.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.480
He doesn't know.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.320
I was taking it everywhere.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.160
Does it mean, while we're sitting here

43:16.160 --> 43:19.080
with the shirts from the place,

43:19.080 --> 43:22.160
Jeff just takes us places and orders us to sit place?

43:22.160 --> 43:24.200
You can't, you've been in Portland now

43:24.200 --> 43:25.160
several times in your life,

43:25.160 --> 43:26.400
but you've never been to Mary's Club.

43:26.400 --> 43:27.680
You have to have been there at least once,

43:27.680 --> 43:29.440
because it's kind of, it's special.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.280
It's weird.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.440
It's an interesting place to be in, yeah.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.680
It was good, just me to sit at the stage,

43:33.680 --> 43:35.960
which I was happy eventually that he made me do,

43:35.960 --> 43:39.240
but I was uncomfortable because I was going in

43:39.240 --> 43:41.480
because it was presented as a spectacle,

43:41.480 --> 43:44.120
and then I walked in and there's like this person

43:44.120 --> 43:47.480
who was doing this dance that was great,

43:47.480 --> 43:52.160
and I didn't want her to feel like I was making fun of her,

43:52.160 --> 43:53.720
which is such a narcissistic way to walk.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.640
I mean, she's not like,

43:54.640 --> 43:57.040
oh, I wonder what their relationship is with nudity.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.240
Yeah, they've crossed the threshold.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.080
They don't care.

43:59.080 --> 44:02.200
They're heroes, they're martyrs, they're victims.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.040
I love that.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.000
When I had the dollars and I could give a dollar

44:06.000 --> 44:07.640
for certain things that I liked,

44:07.640 --> 44:10.320
like when she did the thing with her butt,

44:10.320 --> 44:14.920
like the, I was like, I really like that, and then.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.520
That's what I don't like, I don't like sitting at the,

44:16.520 --> 44:17.840
I don't know what I'm rewarding,

44:17.840 --> 44:20.560
because I've never been turned on

44:20.560 --> 44:21.760
by any performance in a strip club,

44:21.760 --> 44:23.400
and I'm not saying that that's the goal,

44:23.400 --> 44:24.800
because otherwise, it should be,

44:24.800 --> 44:27.160
if you wanted to, it should wear more sweaters.

44:27.160 --> 44:32.160
Like, I would like to watch a lady just in a sweater.

44:32.920 --> 44:33.760
That's funny, yeah.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.320
Like, just rolling around in a beanbag.

44:35.320 --> 44:36.160
I would feel very jealous.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.560
Like, that would be pornographic to me,

44:37.560 --> 44:40.240
that would be like, but it wouldn't be.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.000
I would feel very jealous if we went into a strip club

44:42.000 --> 44:44.280
and there was a woman fully clothed

44:44.280 --> 44:47.240
with tights and a sweater, who just sat there and said,

44:47.240 --> 44:49.280
you've been bad.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.600
Yeah.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.200
I'd be like, we have to get out of here, I can't.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.720
The theme of the bar, I'd be like, teacher's assistance.

44:56.720 --> 44:59.040
That would be, and it would just be like girls sitting

44:59.040 --> 45:02.360
at a desk and going like, what else did you want?

45:02.360 --> 45:03.600
What memo did you want to send out?

45:03.600 --> 45:06.760
And I'd be like, tell Mr. Flamers that,

45:09.080 --> 45:10.000
push that meeting.

45:10.000 --> 45:10.840
Okay, yes, sir.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.600
That would, I would walk out of there with.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.440
With a boner.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.280
Frankly, a boner.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.160
And it would be gross.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.480
Frankly, a boner.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.520
When the women are fully naked

45:21.520 --> 45:23.160
and they get the dragon tattoo on their back

45:23.160 --> 45:25.480
and they're like, they're spinning her on the pole.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.320
That's not sexy.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.840
It's transcended sexuality, which is a good thing, I guess.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.120
But you wanted to fuck those two gay guys

45:32.120 --> 45:33.840
at the bar there, right?

45:33.840 --> 45:37.080
Probably, but I want to tell you what happened.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.680
Well, you guys were in there getting these sweatshirts,

45:39.680 --> 45:41.200
just because this is another thing.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.360
What do you do about strip clubs?

45:42.360 --> 45:43.600
What do you do about sexuality?

45:43.600 --> 45:45.920
What do you do about panhandling?

45:45.920 --> 45:48.160
All right, in LA, we have lots of panhandlers.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.640
San Francisco, we've talked about the panhandlers.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.200
I think the San Francisco panhandler population

45:53.200 --> 45:56.280
has been subjected to an undue amount of stress.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.720
Panhandler in San Francisco, he's living in an area

45:59.720 --> 46:03.080
where it's like it's Eternia in the He-Man universe.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.600
Like, everyone has to be in action figure.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.960
They had some of the worst draconian mayors

46:07.960 --> 46:09.520
there's no such thing as just a guy

46:09.520 --> 46:11.280
in an army jacket that needs a dollar.

46:11.280 --> 46:15.280
That guy's been fucking brushed off to like down the coast.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.560
In San Francisco, if someone's panhandling you,

46:17.560 --> 46:19.920
he's got a fucking teacup on his head.

46:19.920 --> 46:24.160
He's got an armor made of a furnace door.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.320
Like, he's got a gimmick.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.040
He's got a spell he's going to cast.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.360
He's got a magic trick to do.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.600
I used to live in San Francisco, and there was a panhandler

46:33.600 --> 46:36.880
who every time you walked by him, he would propose marriage.

46:36.880 --> 46:40.040
But in a very sincere way, and I always gave him money.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.560
I was always delighted by it, we had an agreement.

46:42.560 --> 46:44.920
So here's what happened in Portland, outside that strip

46:44.920 --> 46:49.680
club, well, Erin went back in to buy her t-shirt with you.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.200
There's no moral to this story, I'm just sharing it.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.840
There was a woman walking on the street.

46:54.840 --> 46:58.840
I would characterize her as, I'm pretty sure she,

46:58.840 --> 47:02.440
I think her poison was drink, I think.

47:02.440 --> 47:05.200
But I don't know, I'm not a social worker, I don't know.

47:05.200 --> 47:08.480
It's not my job to judge her, or appraise her,

47:08.480 --> 47:10.040
or know what she's into, or whatever.

47:10.040 --> 47:12.440
But I felt like looking at her, I was like, yeah,

47:12.440 --> 47:16.160
she's like me in 20 years.

47:16.160 --> 47:19.280
And she was like, hey, you have any money?

47:19.280 --> 47:22.440
And then Erin went in the thing and said, I got this.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.600
I gave her a 20, because it's all I had.

47:24.600 --> 47:27.800
And I was just, well, I'm a tourist too.

47:27.800 --> 47:30.760
And you literally said, I got this.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.080
I did.

47:32.080 --> 47:32.920
I did say that.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.320
I said, I got this.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.800
Because she approached and she said, dude,

47:36.800 --> 47:39.240
and held up her sign, like she was my old friend,

47:39.240 --> 47:40.720
and she was like, you owe me $5.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.800
And I just, I was following Jeff into the club.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.280
And I said, I got this.

47:44.280 --> 47:47.440
All right, that's, yes, that's what I did.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.400
You got off easy, I bought you guys $90

47:49.400 --> 47:50.800
with a Mary's Club swag.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.840
So I gave her a $20 bill.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.160
And she gave me a hug.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.680
And we held each other.

47:56.680 --> 47:59.440
And she said, I wrote it down after she walked away.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.760
She said, I don't normally hug people,

48:01.760 --> 48:03.480
but you did me a favor.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.520
And then she broke the hug.

48:04.520 --> 48:08.960
And then she walked into a housing complex

48:08.960 --> 48:10.040
next to the strip bar.

48:10.040 --> 48:13.360
She said, and you know what I'm talking about.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.080
She turned to me.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.640
And I was like, no, I don't.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.480
I don't know what you're talking about, quite.

48:17.480 --> 48:19.720
But I feel like I may have killed you because I gave you $20

48:19.720 --> 48:21.360
and you're taking it.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.240
So here's what happened next.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.160
Then two minutes later, because you guys

48:25.160 --> 48:27.720
were in the strip club buying a t-shirt.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.600
Lou Reed walks in.

48:28.600 --> 48:31.560
Another couple, a couple walk by.

48:31.560 --> 48:34.800
It was like a homeless couple, the self-identified homeless

48:34.800 --> 48:35.680
couple.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.720
This is why I'm back buying you guys hoodies

48:38.720 --> 48:39.680
with a Mary's Club.

48:39.680 --> 48:45.320
So then the woman had kind of, she had sores on her face,

48:45.320 --> 48:48.560
like it was more of a meth-y thing,

48:48.560 --> 48:51.800
not like an alcoholic thing, more of a speedy thing.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.840
And she said, I wrote all this down

48:54.840 --> 48:57.000
because I wanted to talk about it tonight.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.600
She said, can I get some money?

48:58.600 --> 49:01.440
And I was like, I did literally.

49:01.440 --> 49:04.000
I gave all my money to another person.

49:04.000 --> 49:04.760
I'm sorry.

49:04.760 --> 49:11.360
And she said, we're crackheads.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.440
We're homeless.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.320
And she walked away with her male friend.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.120
She said, be really choosier around here.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.640
That's fucking interesting.

49:27.640 --> 49:31.120
Because the first lady just wanted booze.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.240
She needs crack.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.440
I don't know, it's weird.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.520
It's like, when are you a good guy?

49:37.520 --> 49:38.880
When are you a bad guy?

49:38.880 --> 49:42.360
You don't just panhandling in general.

49:42.360 --> 49:45.160
Spencer told me once, we should bring out Spencer in a second.

49:45.160 --> 49:48.120
Spencer Crittenton, he doesn't give to panhandlers,

49:48.120 --> 49:49.000
he told me once.

49:49.000 --> 49:54.840
What he does do, I don't have the balls to do this.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.640
When he sees the guys in LA, I don't know if this

49:57.640 --> 49:58.960
is like in every city.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.920
But in LA, there's like, we have an infrastructure

50:01.920 --> 50:06.640
that supports guys rolling down the street with a shopping

50:06.640 --> 50:09.120
cart full of tin cans.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.640
Like they go from door to door.

50:10.640 --> 50:14.560
They're fucking working hard, way harder than any of us

50:14.560 --> 50:18.920
work, getting very little shit to give to a corporation that

50:18.920 --> 50:21.240
gives them a couple pennies for their tin cans.

50:21.240 --> 50:24.640
And Spencer said, he doesn't give to panhandlers.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.200
When he sees those guys, those guys

50:26.200 --> 50:27.320
aren't even asking for money.

50:27.320 --> 50:31.720
Spencer pulls over, runs out, offers them money.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.880
I love that.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.520
I mean, that seems like in Spencer's like,

50:35.520 --> 50:37.000
but it's almost Darwinian too.

50:37.000 --> 50:37.880
It's creepy.

50:37.880 --> 50:43.760
Like, yeah, so the other people should, should they die?

50:43.760 --> 50:44.760
What are we saying?

50:44.760 --> 50:49.160
Are we, oh, he knows work ethic.

50:49.160 --> 50:51.120
Give him money so that we can keep the.

50:51.120 --> 50:53.360
I'm from LA, like you see a guy laying in the street

50:53.360 --> 50:57.120
in LA, a homeless person, and they're laying in LA.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.480
It's a nice climate.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.560
But you see somebody on the streets in Portland,

51:00.560 --> 51:04.520
like it's cold out, like it's weird to be homeless here.

51:04.520 --> 51:09.160
In Milwaukee every year, it's the second coldest city

51:09.160 --> 51:11.640
or the first coldest city, depending on who you ask.

51:11.640 --> 51:15.080
If you ask somebody in Minneapolis, they'll tell you.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.720
It's, they die.

51:17.720 --> 51:18.880
Yeah.

51:18.880 --> 51:23.080
There's a homeless population, and they die every winter.

51:23.080 --> 51:26.760
They die off, like mosquitoes.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.360
It's not, I'm not making a joke.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.040
I'm saying, like, that's the horrible thing.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.560
So as human beings, they die off.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.600
They're called homeless people, mosquitoes.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:36.080 --> 51:39.240
That's, I'm saying that's the fucking horrible thing.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.600
They die off.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.440
It's the horrible thing.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.040
It's like, it's a part of a biosphere.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.800
When you see somebody that's homeless and someone's

51:47.800 --> 51:51.000
sleeping on the, like I walked across the bridge

51:51.000 --> 51:53.840
from the southwest side to downtown,

51:53.840 --> 51:56.240
and it's just people like sleeping on the middle

51:56.240 --> 52:00.720
of the bridge on the thing, and you just walk by them.

52:00.720 --> 52:01.560
It's so weird.

52:01.560 --> 52:02.880
Because you get other shit to do.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.720
That's the, it's weird.

52:03.720 --> 52:04.560
But you don't.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.400
You don't have anything to do.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.560
I know, you shouldn't have anything to do.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.840
You should, like, if we, if we, if you were playing

52:08.840 --> 52:11.720
a video game, and you had, like, people walking everywhere,

52:11.720 --> 52:14.880
and there were some of them that were, like, laying down,

52:14.880 --> 52:17.640
you would dedicate all your energy until you had that

52:17.640 --> 52:18.480
moving up.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.920
That's the liberal perspective, is that a society

52:20.920 --> 52:24.120
should be judged by how you treat your, your, your

52:24.120 --> 52:24.960
lowest individuals.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.840
I just think it's, it's, we live in a world where people

52:26.840 --> 52:29.240
think that life is a competition, and that when

52:29.240 --> 52:30.080
you see somebody.

52:30.080 --> 52:30.920
And that they're losing.

52:30.920 --> 52:33.720
And so for me to identify with you means I would have

52:33.720 --> 52:37.280
to lower myself in that, in that chess game.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.120
I hate it.

52:38.120 --> 52:38.960
This is the worst.

52:38.960 --> 52:39.800
Yeah, yeah.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.120
Yeah, I don't know.

52:41.120 --> 52:43.120
Let's lighten, let's lighten things up and bring

52:43.120 --> 52:44.240
Spencer out.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.080
Spencer!

52:45.080 --> 52:45.920
Spencer!

52:45.920 --> 52:46.760
Spencer!

52:46.760 --> 52:47.600
Spencer!

52:47.600 --> 52:48.600
Spencer!

52:48.600 --> 52:49.600
Spencer!

52:49.600 --> 52:50.600
Spencer!

52:50.600 --> 52:51.600
Spencer!

52:51.600 --> 52:52.600
Spencer!

52:52.600 --> 52:53.600
Spencer!

52:53.600 --> 52:54.600
Spencer!

52:54.600 --> 52:55.600
Spencer!

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
Spencer!

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
Spencer!

52:57.600 --> 52:58.600
Spencer!

52:58.600 --> 52:59.600
Spencer!

52:59.600 --> 53:00.600
Spencer!

53:00.600 --> 53:04.080
He's going, he's going under a pillar of a ling, homeless

53:04.080 --> 53:05.840
deaths, homeless deaths.

53:05.840 --> 53:06.840
What are you thinking?

53:06.840 --> 53:09.360
What do you, what do you, what do you make of this

53:09.360 --> 53:10.020
situation?

53:10.020 --> 53:13.960
With, with panhandling, the homeless, the...

53:13.960 --> 53:14.960
What, what, what?

53:14.960 --> 53:16.360
Well yeah, it is Darwinian.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.640
You encourage the people who are working and you

53:18.640 --> 53:21.000
let the others, you know, be cold.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.400
That's what you're saying.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.880
How do you feel about mental illness, and what

53:25.880 --> 53:27.000
do you?

53:27.000 --> 53:29.560
I'm against it.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.560
But you know

53:34.900 --> 53:40.260
What does it I mean one day, you know any day now they're gonna come up with a pill

53:40.660 --> 53:43.080
Yeah, and they're gonna go this cures

53:44.440 --> 53:49.740
Blankin flamin and and they're gonna it's gonna be like oh, that's great

53:49.920 --> 53:57.460
Tim used to talk to the fire hydrant now. He doesn't think that fire hydrants talk Lincoln Flamin is gets a friend. That's fantastic

53:57.460 --> 53:58.820
um

53:58.820 --> 54:01.140
But then they're gonna say they're gonna look at

54:01.980 --> 54:09.540
Spencer and Aaron and Jeff and me and they're gonna go by the way you could you wouldn't you wouldn't get hurt by taking this either

54:10.620 --> 54:16.780
You don't talk to fire hydrants. However, you you do cry when you're watching Tron

54:18.140 --> 54:20.140
That's weird

54:20.140 --> 54:25.740
Don't do that. You shouldn't cry when you're watching Tron. That's dumb. What part of Tron makes you cry?

54:29.420 --> 54:32.700
Well, I'm crying isn't a mental it's not a mental imbalance

54:33.540 --> 54:37.580
That's true the light cycle part doesn't yeah, it's a

54:38.140 --> 54:42.620
What's sad about that part? Just sometimes you get cut off and sometimes you cut other people off

54:43.580 --> 54:48.260
There's no way out of a light cycle race with I love the neutron

54:48.260 --> 54:59.900
In the new Tron, there's a guy even though you're in a computer. There's still a guy at the arena that goes

55:04.660 --> 55:09.260
There's still a guy in the computer. That's like the Tron arena guy

55:09.260 --> 55:13.420
I was like, whoa, who wants to killin folks?

55:14.780 --> 55:19.580
Wait, why is everything always why is there always an emcee in a post-apocalypse?

55:20.580 --> 55:23.900
Why why is there always a Richard Dawson and a running man?

55:25.900 --> 55:28.820
Who wants some violence and then the audience like yeah

55:29.660 --> 55:34.620
And then you try on as a scene like like the like Thunderdome with a guy like yeah, yeah

55:34.620 --> 55:40.220
He's like oh boy. I know why you came here. What are you talking to it? They're all computer programs

I fucked your mama and her pussy had a ridge. I looked down and said it. What is that?

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.220

Tears of zombie infants

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.900
Dug themselves out of holes

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.940

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
Vincent price

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.620
Bringing the morbidity

Into a popular music

You can all have your money back

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.100
And you you can talk to Squarespace about it

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:31.100
All right, I thought it was great. I just I suddenly play a bit of D&D for these people before we go

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:41.340
Let's get the character sheets dispensed. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about that

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.500
No, every young girl at some point thinks that her clitoris is a tiny hat

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500
Yeah

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.860
Dan

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.060
All right

01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:00.620
Now Spencer, it's it's been a real long time since I have any idea what we're doing

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.820
Yeah, yeah

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.100
But I mean usually you guys don't have an excuse

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.660
That one was a thinker apparently

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.660
All right, Spencer

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.940
Catch us up to date if you can if you will Spencer. What's the weirdest thing that's happened to you in portland?

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.980
Wait, it's cut the dungeon master music

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:30.540
So, okay when we got here, um Aaron, you know gave me a doughnut one of those doughnuts. I like it

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.980
It was good. It was a jelly doughnut. I don't really like jelly doughnuts

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.820
um, so

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.460
I dropped my stuff out in the hotel then I got a register

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.700
I got my wristband stuff and then went back to my room to take a dump and

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.700
um

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:51.820
I was sitting on the toilet and I was glancing around as you do and um, I was I saw a waste paper basket and

01:08:52.300 --> 01:09:01.020
You know hotel cleaners. They clean up things before the guests arrive and stuff so little was I mean large was my surprise when I saw there was

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.060
Apparently something in one of these waste paper baskets and I was like, uh, that's weird

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.900
And then I feel like the story would only be enhanced by this. I mean probably not but whatever then

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860
You were right. I take it all back

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:23.980
So I slowly tip tip the waste paper basket towards me to allow myself to see into its depths

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.460
And I see it looks like like a tissue paper and inside it's just all red

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:38.540
And I'm like, okay, um, I guess that happens, you know, it's natural that happens put it somewhere

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.820
It's like I always say

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:46.300
And so but I was really grossed out and I was like, did they just not clean my room? What's going on?

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:51.580
And then I looked at it further and I was like, oh, that's just the jelly doughnut I threw away

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.140
Portland is amazing

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.140
You

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.340
What a roller coaster ride

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.100
We thought we found the one bad thing about portland

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.920
It's really just a place you can come to confront your own love of donuts

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:23.340
Well, it's it's everything's so pristine, you know, if you see something in a waste paper basket and you don't remember throwing it in there

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:30.300
It's really terrifying. I gotta say whoever is in charge of cleaning our hotel room here at the bridgeport comedy festival the jupiter hotel

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.540
I'm so sorry for my fiance Aaron

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.780
What happened? I don't know. She's like it's like the trail. She leaves is

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.820
Baluchian

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.300
You admit that right like you like like there's crumbs everywhere and

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.540
Um, I just like to see everything I have at once

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:57.580
When Aaron moves it goes into a hotel room she she opens the suitcase and just like

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.220
It's like spores like

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:04.860
Like everything from inside her suitcase explodes to every edge of the room

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.620
I definitely have like a weird thing with hotel story. I'm like, I can do anything

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:15.100
Uh, do you hate the people that the no, no, I don't and I used to I used to work as a maid

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:18.380
Uh, but I always liked it with yeah, really?

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.620
Yeah, yeah for like two years during college. I worked as a maid

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:27.340
Um made it made in america was the name of the company. No, no get it. Yeah

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.460
Yeah, and I did some

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.620
I did some weird shit

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620
but uh, uh, but I think you both

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.660
She did some weird

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.060
But I uh, I don't you know just like clutter. I feel it wasn't a big deal

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:47.740
Like I think the gross thing are like if I was leaving nail clippings or like hair like that's that's harder

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.740
What about just checks mix everywhere?

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:54.300
Well, a bag of checks mix just systematically like laid out all over the floor

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.380
I was very drunk and I thought I was a hero for taking a bag of checks mix and

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.020
Trying to eat it. I literally

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.140
I got back

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.380
I was the last one at the after party last night

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.420
Literally the last one and I got back to the room and I was like, oh no

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.660
Like tomorrow is going to be a disaster

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:16.220
And so I got in bed and I got my ipad and I started playing this movie

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:20.620
That I started watching on the plane and I took the checks mix and I just put it on my

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.020
my bare chest

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.300
And I don't even think use my hands. It's just like

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:38.780
This is we're getting married. All right. All right. Spencer. That's the woman I'm gonna love Spencer. Uh, let's let's play some d&d

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:40.940
I just I just I just want to hear it

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.940
I don't pretend to be Audrey Hepburn

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.940
All right, what do you got?

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.460
Hey, what do you think about Portland? It's that's a great city. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of bridges a lot of bridges

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:03.100
Okay, whatever really easy a little bit this bit to cross funny for me to keep interrupting bodies of water. Is it there's what's funny

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:09.980
Last time on comedy our heroes had teamed up with Meredith the minotaur to escape the underworld

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:14.620
And soon came upon bill mardigans the city. That's everywhere

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:24.700
With the help of whizbulb and his bucket our heroes met with spizwad the curse breaker who demanded cigarettes in exchange for magical healing

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.820
So it was off to the cigarette museum despite Sharpies initial resistance

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:35.900
He quickly rose to the challenge teleporting inside the inside the closed museum

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:42.940
But as soon as he was inside he encountered a massive bust of butts a giant head made of cigarettes

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.260
Bill mardigan himself

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.940
The smoking cigarette deity was upset about the trespass

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:55.260
But Sharpies seemed to calm him down through level-headed discussion as quark and Chris de Burgh arrived the gang was worried

01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:01.500
They soon found themselves enjoying both the smoke of bill mardigans and the magical restorative effects it had

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:09.340
Lifting their skull curses, but with their curses lifted our heroes still sought the magical tarragon to exercise Chris de Burgh

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.220
But how would they get it inside of a bag?

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.100
I don't know probably not there

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.980
find out

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.060
That's where we were

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:29.820
Do you have any questions? Do you remember like you there's a giant head made of cigarettes. That's memorable, right? Yeah

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:35.420
Yeah, that's bad. I was very distracted by the by the lighting. Yeah, I'm I'm dynamically lit

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:43.420
I'm here a decently. I examine the the cigarette head. Uh, he's still chilling out. Um, he's he's kind of eyeing you

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.020
Smoke issues from his mouth and he's like what uh

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.700
Do you know where the tarragon of virtue is?

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.780
Oh, that's up in paradise somewhere, right? Do you know how to get there?

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.500
No, shit

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.820
You what are you looking for?

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.100
The tarragon of virtue. That's weird

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.700
Well, you're trying to get cigarettes. That's why we uh

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.100
I apologize. We we came in here to get cigarettes

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:17.660
Because the uh, there were these other guys that I can't remember. It was like six months ago

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.820
That's okay. Were you born this way?

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.980
Uh

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:29.100
That's a great question. No, I was not I built this city with my own two hands

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.900
And I oversaw it with the best of my ability

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:37.020
But soon I realized it was not enough that drive that powered me to empower this city

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:43.740
Granted me this form and immortality with which I could maintain and upkeep the workings of bill martigans

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.020
Are you into what are you into?

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:52.540
I like smoking and riddles you like hot you like hot tubs

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:56.140
No, that really puts me out

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.980
Well deserved fun

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.100
Why did he want uh cigarettes again?

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:11.500
The other guy it's like uh, who won a cigarette

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.900
DMs no, um, you guys were trying to get the skull curses lifted

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:21.580
But in meeting with bill martigan, he actually cured you of your skull curses. Oh, okay. All right. So we're fine

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:28.380
We're good to go actually from this point. We can do whatever we want. Yeah, I mean, we do want the uh, the tarragon of virtue to get, uh

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.260
Uh, Chris de Burghs curse left it. I think right sure

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.260
Hey smoke smoky bill martigan bill martigan in the name of the city

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:45.580
Have you ever wanted to travel the world with adventurers? No, I kind of just want to you know

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.220
Be god over my city

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:54.060
Well, I know you love riddles. Yes, if you answer this riddle collect correctly, we'll let you

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.700
Show us to the tarragon of virtue. I like those odds

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:01.980
It's gonna work

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.860
All right, what is uh

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.420
fine small

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.860
and

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.620
red

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.220
And blue

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.220
But never sleeps

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:22.940
Hmm red red, but blue and blue. Oh red red. It would a small red and blue and never sleeps

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.180
What can't you

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.740
Maybe

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:34.060
Bill martigan's rumblings are suddenly interrupted by a sharp high-pitched a siren. It sounds like

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.020
Oh my god, the most adorable emergency is happening

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:44.780
You you see the flashing of blue and red lights, which is coincidental

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.660
Bill martigan are

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:54.060
There are people coming. Oh shit. That's the fuzz. You better get out of here

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.380
But you you own this place. Yep, but they don't know I exist

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:07.340
Guys, let's jump back in the bucket and get out of here portable. Oh portal bucket portable martigan goes

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.860
Oh

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:13.580
Shit and all the cigarettes that composes his form are sucked, you know to their

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.500
butts or whatever

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:20.460
Suck into their fuzz. He falls he falls to the ground in a pile of ash and you hear his voice. Good luck

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:27.820
I put the ash in a little bag and I put it in my pocket you obtained bill martigan's ashes

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.220
Don't worry guys. I got it

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:39.100
I have a I have a portable if you get into a portable hole if you climb into one

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.900
Can you just fold it up from inside and just hang out? I don't think so

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:49.260
Someone on the outside could do that though, but we could jump back through the the the portal, right?

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:55.020
Yeah, you have a bucket with you Jeff that goes to this gnome bathroom. All right, finally

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.020
Let's all go to the to the weird weird bathroom

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.700
I jump into the bucket of bathrooms

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:09.980
You do that. What about you guys? Um, I also I also jump in through the bucket of bathroom

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:14.140
You find yourself in a nice bathroom. There's something you've never seen before

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.140
It's a weird chamber pot made of porcelain. It's got a little handle on it

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:23.660
I open it and look into the contents. There's but but water in a hole

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.860
I put my hand in the hole

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:34.460
It feels it fits your fist just exactly as if it was made for it. I go like, uh, this is uh, it's a good chamber pot

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:42.460
I go to the door of this of this room and open it up. You open it up and you see it's it's covered in clutter

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:48.940
It's all just paper. There's nothing useful. Can I ask you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry tons of paper. Can I

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:55.900
Can I ask you a sidebar question about my character? Yeah, sure. Do I have to poop?

01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.940
That's really up to you, man. Is it? Are you kidding me?

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.860
Yeah

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.860
That's crazy. Okay. I have to poop

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:12.540
You have to poop. It's up to me. It's up to me. I I I tell these guys like it's up to me when I have to poop

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.260
I want you to know that about me

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:20.380
Uh, you should try and see if you can run. There may be situations where that comes to our advantage

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.780
This probably isn't one, but I want you to know

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.340
Like I am different from every human every every being on middle earth

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.060
It's up to me when I have to poop

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.220
I'm like a dolphin like a dolphin's heartbeat is voluntary

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.020
What is it right? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, dolphins

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.980
They get to remember to keep their heart beating. What they get to forget and die. No. Yeah

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:45.020
Yeah, any any if there's a dolphin in the audience let him

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:52.140
I saw a dolphin. I saw a literal dolphin today on the fucking river. It came it was going

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.980
No, guys, what was it then? What was it, huh?

01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.260
Whatever that's just as magnificent

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.380
What

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.780
Whatever you thought it might have been a dolphin. It's a fucking gray

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:13.420
Dark shiny object coming in and out of the water for air every couple of minutes. The most incredible thing is that the audience was like, no

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:19.660
Well, also no, his defiance is weird. Like why would he really it's a great dark shape coming out of that could have been

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.380
Could have been your friend from college. No, it couldn't have

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.220
It had a very distinguished fin

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:35.020
Did you go to college at sea worlds? Wait, so sea lions don't have dorsal fins. Well, I guess it might have been a dolphin then

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.460
Everyone is way more upset about this than I am

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:50.700
Well, it's weird to it's just an animal. You saw a dolphin just because you saw a gray thing. Isn't there a possibility?

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.420
This is fresh water, right? Not like a dolphin can't just be cruising down the river dolphins

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:57.420
But I think those are

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.700
Those exist those definitively exist

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.100
There's no there are no river dolphins. Those are purposes South America someone's saying no

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:11.260
Where the river is so big it's like an ocean. I think we solved this in the first 10 seconds

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:16.300
It was a sea lion. Yeah, and I don't care. It was gorgeous. But with a fin with a dorsal fin

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:19.340
apparently

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.980
That's what I saw

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.580
All right, have you ever touched a dolphin? Uh, no

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.380
Sorry, no

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.700
Sharpie

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940
Just so

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.020
Just so I know

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:41.900
You said that there would be certain situations when you having to poop would be advantageous. Yeah for well later later

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.940
I don't know could you just list some of them so I know no no

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.580
No, I sit down

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.580
Spencer and I poop

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:56.860
Mm-hmm because you said it's up to me. Yeah, I poop bad. I'm telling now you can ask your questions

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.940
Well, I'm pooping. It's not a big you gotta make eye contact with me

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:10.140
You guys I want you to lock eyes with me. I don't tell you anything you want to hear

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:17.580
But now but now you need to know that I'm pooping while you talk to me I'm pooping. All right

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.580
Are you okay? Yeah

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.300
Yeah

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.420
How are you?

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.300
Good

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:29.900
Sharpie, what do you what do you what do you want to achieve in this lifetime? I'd like to touch other people

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.340
Like I want them to know that I was here

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.060
What do you what do you want them to remember of you?

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:49.020
Yeah, honestly, I don't I don't I don't need them to think that I was good or bad

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.220
I want them to I just want to be remembered. I want it to be specific

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:58.300
I want I want to be I want them to I want to be irreplaceable. I want to be I want to be singular

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.140

Have known that I wasn't around that's what terrifies me. Maybe that skeleton army show on the bridge. That was

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:36.140
Yeah, but I don't think those guys knew my name. I don't think, you know, I hold on a second

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.300
I I would just like to

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.020
I feel like none of us get to live forever

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.260
That's not the goal

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:53.180
That's not a real life. Don't take this personally, but I'm just gonna back away five feet or so

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.460
Does it stink you guys are you guys all in here?

01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:00.140
Uh, what's my pooped in nine months? So yeah

Those things happen all three of them

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:26.300
And as you walk into this room, you see a pile of papery bits start to move and shift

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.980
And you see a hand emerge and then a face. It's a it's another gnome, believe it or not

Am I supposed to say something?

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.540

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.940
I you know that grows on the isle of paradise. Why am I having this conversation? Who are you guys?

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:26.700
Well, you just get some guys who fell into a bucket of a portal. Oh, yeah

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.900
I don't

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.660
Fuck fliz damn. I gotta be honest with you. We were pretty drunk

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:42.940
I mean, that's normal. We do we we we don't always send this up right at my first thing or a shit

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.860
I'm watching other friends watching it. I just had to take a breather and get out of there

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:57.820
Yeah, I feel like we should fight or something fight. This is not normal. Hey

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:03.100
I'm gonna adequately explain yourselves. What? No. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:08.700
I I leave I leave Sharpie and walk into the room with the paper and the gnome, please damn

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.740
I guess I knew you were behind there in theory

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.540
Hey, listen. Hey buddy, uh

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:19.260
I'm taking a shit

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.900
Yeah, I can smell it. We have

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:24.940
Weird gross

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.940
We have no coral with you

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:32.060
You look you look like a nice gnome and do you know where the isle of paradise is?

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.740
I yeah

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.260
Yeah, yeah

01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:41.900
What are you afraid of? This is a very weird circumstance. Do you do you even own a home?

01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.100
Are you a realist?

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:51.100
What did we interrupt in this paper room? This is my house. Oh, why is your house next to a bathroom?

01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:58.460
So hard to fathom that I'm a bit weirded out by three people shitting in my bathroom

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:02.940
None of you are gnomes. Take all of you. One of you is a gnome. That's not true

01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:08.940
Well, I'll be your home invasion nightmares and then add to it the idea that the people home-invading

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.900
Don't acknowledge that they're doing anything wrong

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.500
And yet it would be scarier. It would be scarier. And yet you speak of the isle of paradise and the tarugana virtue

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.940
Let's damn. I'm I'm so sorry. We had a we had a

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:24.380
a

01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:31.020
Transporter bucket and that's why we're here and you seem so nice and I understand why you would be scared

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:36.300
Will you accept this and I produce from my bag a gods-eye made out of yarn?

01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.100

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.700

French we'd like to be your friend. You seem very nice and nervous and thank you

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:54.620
I thought about it and I guess whiz bulb just leaves his bucket anywhere. So

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.580
That could happen

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.540
You're out of uh

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.820
I'm not sure you're out of it because I don't know if you use it, but

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:07.100
I'm done pooping

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.180

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:16.140
Flays wait will you come with us on an adventure to the isle of paradise?

We did it

01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:41.820
Finally, we love you so much. You guys are the coolest in the world

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:58.300
I think everybody here at the Doug Furt make what I turned down, play some music for us, would you?

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.700
Thank you, Dan
