00:00.000 --> 00:25.960
Hello Meltdown. How are you tonight? Just as I expected. Guess what? Harmontown is

00:25.960 --> 00:37.400
session, but not just any Harmontown. This is our 50th episode. Wow. It seems like only

00:37.400 --> 00:43.600
yesterday for the very first time I announced the mayor of Harmontown. Welcome to the stage for the

00:43.600 --> 01:13.160
50th time. Dan Harmon. Your comptroller, Jeff Davis. Wow. 49, 49 times before now. I never thank

01:13.160 --> 01:17.840
you enough. Thank you. You thank me simply by being my friend, Dan. That's all I need from you.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.240
That's good. That's good to know. All right. Please, ma'am, would you please have a seat. It's my

01:24.240 --> 01:31.400
girlfriend. Always late. How many episodes in was your girlfriend, do you think? I have a terrible

01:31.400 --> 01:39.840
memory. Not for all 50 for sure. No way, right? Oh, so this is not 50 Harmontown. It's 50 podcast

01:39.840 --> 01:47.600
episodes. Yeah, we've been doing this for 17 years. Yeah. Yeah, there was a whole phantom zone. We

01:47.600 --> 01:52.320
still have like all these things. We kept we keep threatening to release like archives of the old

01:52.320 --> 01:58.480
recordings before we even thought this would be a podcast. Yeah, but we sound all young. And we'd be

01:58.480 --> 02:04.920
talking about Beetlejuice. We still talk about Beetlejuice. Back then, we were talking about it

02:04.920 --> 02:10.400
because it was just about to come out though. We got we got a lot of stuff to do. Hey, oh, here's

02:10.400 --> 02:18.120
item number one on the docket. I'm assuming I wouldn't ask this of any other audience. I feel like

02:18.120 --> 02:23.960
if there's 100 people here, the answer might be as a 2% chance of being yes. Does anyone have a

02:23.960 --> 02:32.760
five hour energy? Okay, all right. Does anyone have a 20-sided die? Yes. Okay, see, all right. It's

02:32.760 --> 02:38.920
still my crowd. Still my crowd. Yeah, I'm feeling a little sluggish, but I'm going to force a manic

02:38.920 --> 02:43.080
behavior. I listened to the episodes. Jeff, I like the ones where I'm manic. I don't like the

02:43.080 --> 02:47.240
depressive ones. Why don't we send somebody off to the liquor store down the road and get them?

02:47.240 --> 02:50.440
They'll miss the show. They come here and they want to see it, but that portion of the show is

02:50.440 --> 03:00.080
going to be shitty. The depressive portion. Yeah. Wow. Wait, come up here, Sarah. Come up here. A

03:00.080 --> 03:07.400
gentleman just came on stage, handed Dan what he referred to as an off-brand five hour energy. Is

03:07.400 --> 03:11.280
that why you didn't say yes when I asked for a five hour energy? I wasn't sure if I had in my bag,

03:11.280 --> 03:15.480
because I just flew and I wasn't sure if I had it in there. What's your name, Sarah? I'm Chris

03:15.480 --> 03:22.920
Dunford. Chris Dunford, all right. Fake name. Totally my real name. Justin Town to do some

03:22.920 --> 03:38.600
raping and using my ID from Denmark. This is Grape Kirkland energy shot. Should we do a commercial

03:38.600 --> 03:48.000
for it? Grape Kirkland energy shot. The number one energy drink among anonymous rapists. Hi. That's

03:48.000 --> 04:02.080
a fact. I'm not like Baldwin for what's it called? Grape Kirkland energy shot. For real? Yeah. Dan's

04:02.080 --> 04:06.560
trying it. Does it taste just as shit as five hour energy? Yeah, it tastes better. That means it's

04:06.560 --> 04:13.560
probably working less. It tastes good. Yeah, this only lasts at this point 20 minutes and then I'll

04:13.560 --> 04:21.040
drop dead. I keep compiling these. I've adopted these in place of Adderall. Street Adderall. And

04:21.040 --> 04:26.840
what was your name again? Barry Dunflings? Chris Dunford. Chris Dunford. And where do you hail

04:26.840 --> 04:35.800
from, Chris? I'm from Boston area. Yeah. Yeah. And what brings you out to Harmontown? Well,

04:35.800 --> 04:43.200
my grandma's 80th birthday this week. It sounds so fake. It sounds so fake. Not a trace of a Boston

04:43.200 --> 04:49.080
accent. Chris Dunford from Boston. It's my grandma's 80th birthday. I enjoy potatoes and

04:49.080 --> 04:56.840
skateboarding. I swear to God, I'm not working for area 51. I can neither confirm or deny that.

04:56.840 --> 05:06.280
So your grandmother passed away in Los Angeles? No, she's 80 today. She did the opposite of

05:06.280 --> 05:09.920
passed away. She lived for 80 years. Unless things have changed. Guys, I brought you a lot of

05:09.920 --> 05:14.200
Colombo. I was trying to catch him in a line. One more thing. What's your grandma's funeral?

05:14.200 --> 05:21.400
Oh, Tuesday. I don't know why I said, you know, Chris, one thing bothers me. If she's 80, why are

05:21.400 --> 05:28.720
you burying her? No, I'm not passing it. Although one thing alarms me. I think I drank one of

05:28.720 --> 05:33.240
these three hours ago. For real? Let's see what happens. But a different brand. Different brands.

05:33.240 --> 05:43.360
It's okay. Yeah, you can mix. So Chris, you're visiting from Boston to see your still alive

05:43.360 --> 05:49.640
80 year old grandmother. That is correct. Yes. That you plan on murdering soon. Right now,

05:49.640 --> 05:55.440
is she being killed by Ray Malend? And this is to establish your alibi? This is all about alibi

05:55.440 --> 05:58.960
establishment, isn't it? That would have been a really good idea, actually. But no, I don't believe

05:58.960 --> 06:01.760
so. I've been watching too much Colombo, you guys. What was the movie I just saw? It was a

06:01.760 --> 06:08.040
Kevin Costner movie, Mr. Collins. What was this? Mr. Brooks, yeah. Like, what if the way he looked

06:08.040 --> 06:11.320
right now was all an elaborate disguise? Like, underneath that, he's Seth Rogen, and he's gonna...

06:11.320 --> 06:19.040
Kevin Costner, like, at one point, to get his daughter out of a murder charge, he boards a

06:19.040 --> 06:23.840
plane, puts on a fake goatee, and has kind of a long mullet wig and a denim jacket, goes and

06:23.840 --> 06:29.120
hatchet murders someone, comes back. Spoilers. Yeah, I was about to say. Spoiler alert on that.

06:29.120 --> 06:36.320
Hey, here's another general spoiler. If Kevin Costner's in it, oh boy. Careful. Bull Doron,

06:36.320 --> 06:41.920
man. Bull Doron's a clown. Bull Doron was a clown. Tin Cup. Tin Cup is a goodie. Yeah. I just,

06:41.920 --> 06:46.440
I finally saw it. I finally saw it. Yeah. We had a little Kevin Costner marathon. It's a golf

06:46.440 --> 06:52.040
movie with Kevin Costner and Renee Rousseau. There's no way you're gonna like that movie. That's

06:52.040 --> 06:56.520
got everything. There's no way you're gonna watch it. No, no. Here's the thing. It's profound.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.280
It's all about... Don Johnson is an awesome bad guy in it. Don Johnson's agents in the audience.

07:01.280 --> 07:08.480
That's the third time he's said that tonight. He just finished saying it at a pizzeria down

07:08.480 --> 07:15.400
the street. Here's your pepperoni. You forgot about Don Johnson. Hey, look, I'm not paid to

07:15.400 --> 07:28.480
remember him. It's a profound sports movie. It's not a good movie in a strictest sense.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.600
Well, it's Kevin Costner's movie. I love the position you've been put in. You're sitting here

07:32.600 --> 07:40.600
nodding about Tin Cup. I just love the homogeneity of the people we bring on stage. Any one of you

07:40.600 --> 07:51.920
could be harmony. Chris, how was your trip to Los Angeles? Was it wicked retarded? Hold my wicked

07:51.920 --> 07:59.760
hand. Don't be retarded. Come in. My grandma's actually not from Boston. Oh, okay. I was born

07:59.760 --> 08:08.240
in LA, but... All right. Well, okay. Throw me out of the bus. Tin Cup's fucking good, Chris. Chris,

08:08.240 --> 08:20.280
is it Chris? It's a philosophically profound sports movie. It comes down to going for it or

08:20.280 --> 08:26.280
laying up. I really identified with the Kevin Costner character. He loves going for it. He's

08:26.280 --> 08:31.760
self-destructive. He's impulsive. I can't spoil the movie. You have to watch the whole thing.

08:31.760 --> 08:36.200
Right when it comes down to that last moment when he's in the US Open. Don't spoil it for real.

08:36.200 --> 08:41.080
I defy you, too, if you've never seen that movie, to write the end of that movie better than they

08:41.080 --> 08:45.520
write the end of that movie. I defy you to write a sports movie and try to get your way around the

08:45.520 --> 08:50.000
idea that in the third act of a sports movie, either the people that you love have to win or

08:50.000 --> 08:54.720
lose. And if they lose, it's a fucking bad movie because you love them, so why would they lose?

08:54.720 --> 08:58.800
Or they have to win, in which case it's a shitty movie because you knew they were going to win.

08:58.800 --> 09:07.160
There's only a couple movies that get around that, and obviously Teen Wolf is one. Are you

09:07.160 --> 09:15.480
saying Teen Wolf is mostly a basketball film? It definitely is. How many minutes of that movie

09:15.480 --> 09:20.400
are spent with anyone being a werewolf? Well, all the basketball minutes, and then some other ones,

09:20.400 --> 09:28.400
too. A lion's share of that movie is basketball. It doesn't matter. Who cares? It's hitting me.

09:28.400 --> 09:35.080
I saw a tweet today, a fun fact that Kirkland County's with of Grape Shot is hitting me.

09:35.080 --> 09:40.160
Somebody fun fact that on Twitter that Space Jam that we really got into last week is the number

09:40.160 --> 09:50.360
one basketball film of all time. By what metric? Money? By your precious money? I don't doubt it.

09:50.360 --> 10:00.080
It's certainly box office. When you pull together all the fucking duckets, like exchange, plush

10:00.080 --> 10:07.120
Bugs Bunny's holding basketballs on Universal City Walk. Who cares? It's vile. It's a vile

10:07.120 --> 10:20.280
practice. Make a good movie. Gene Hackman from Hoosiers is here tonight. I thought that was my,

10:20.280 --> 10:28.840
what's the guy from the Scrooge story? Jacob Marley? I thought I could only hear that clav.

10:28.840 --> 10:38.040
It's my dad in the back. Way to go, Harmon. Way to let Space Jam have it. This is what your

10:38.040 --> 10:51.040
careers come to. Sticking it to Space Jam. We got a lot to do. What's your name, Curtis?

10:51.040 --> 10:56.440
Armstrong? Look. Some like that. Carl. Carl. Carl's bad, Kevin? Chris Dunford. Chris Dunford.

10:56.440 --> 11:03.200
Thank you so much for giving me a shot of Kirkland's energy now infused with grape. It says

11:03.200 --> 11:14.920
down here 10%, 10% less MSG. 2% of all proceeds go to the defense of the perimeter of our compound

11:14.920 --> 11:26.320
by the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Huh. Chris Humford,

11:26.320 --> 11:31.760
Robin, everybody. Can I say one thing real quick? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Say whatever you

11:31.760 --> 11:35.240
want. Since she's in the audience, Genevieve, you got robbed. You should have been the King of the

11:35.240 --> 11:39.560
Nerd. Oh yeah. That's foreshadowing. Genevieve, you got robbed. Remember that phrase. Sorry about

11:39.560 --> 11:50.640
that. Chris Humford. Thank you, brother. Well, that was a good segue. I think Chris made an

11:50.640 --> 11:53.640
appropriate segue. The reason he said that is because there's someone in the audience that I

11:53.640 --> 11:57.800
invited down to the show. But I don't want to do what I usually do, which is we bring up a guest

11:57.800 --> 12:02.160
and then I spend so much time talking that people get uncomfortable because the person's

12:02.160 --> 12:08.200
sitting there. So let me just say a few things about why we're having her up here. Last night,

12:08.200 --> 12:11.920
and you promised when she gets up here, she's going to do all the talking. It's going to be a

12:11.920 --> 12:17.960
fucking cold ass interview, man. Cool as a cucumber, man. You're going to be like,

12:17.960 --> 12:29.720
is Carson's ghost leaving his... Well, you'll figure it out. You'll figure out how to express your

12:29.720 --> 12:36.280
wonderment. I don't think I should have had that five hours ago. Dan, you don't look so good.

12:36.280 --> 12:42.000
What are articles about it killing teenagers or something? Yeah, yeah. I'm going to die. It was

12:42.000 --> 12:48.760
invented by the Viet Cong. You know, all the things we thought would kill me. It'll be weird.

12:48.760 --> 12:56.320
An assassin with a fake name comes on stage and gives you some homemade shit with a fake

12:56.320 --> 13:05.880
label on a re... Kirkland. When he left, he's gone. The guy actually is not here anymore.

13:05.880 --> 13:12.680
Yeah, he's not here. And he has a fake name. Hold on a second. Whoa, dear Christ. Harmon accidentally

13:12.680 --> 13:23.400
took a shirt off and now is committed to the bit. What is going on? Dan, you know what? You look 50

13:23.400 --> 13:33.000
episodes thinner. Thank you. It's just a little hot from energy. I think it's increased blood flow

13:33.000 --> 13:43.800
in your capillary network. You might be in some need of medical assistance. I think I was before

13:43.800 --> 13:49.440
and I finally got it. This is what it feels like to be alive. I'm just waking up. I'm like Robert

13:49.440 --> 13:55.440
DeNiro in Awakening. I'm like, whoa, whoa, popsicles are interesting. Freaking out. Put me back. Put

13:55.440 --> 14:06.520
me back. Let's bring her up. You haven't said anything about it. You intend to use your

14:06.520 --> 14:22.280
cracky, fake, generic energy drink brain to fucking never let her get a word in. I'm teeing up a

14:22.280 --> 14:29.200
theatrical moment. I'm observing the, you know. All right. So last night, Erin McGathy, my girlfriend,

14:29.200 --> 14:38.760
and live-in lover. I don't know why she landed on this. She landed on this TBS series, this

14:38.760 --> 14:44.520
reality show called King of the Nerds. It's a reality show. It's very, very straight up the

14:44.520 --> 14:49.800
middle structurally. It exactly follows the template of every reality show. But finally,

14:49.800 --> 14:56.320
instead of like, who's the hottest? What's up with titties? Who wants to marry a midget? Suck a

14:56.320 --> 15:05.320
nut. Joe Middle Road. It's like all variations on the people that you hang out with at your

15:05.320 --> 15:11.600
tenure reunion. Like, what if they got to write a show? Well, there would be no writers. We'd do

15:11.600 --> 15:18.840
that thing. Remember the mall that went down? Oh, the mall. Friendliest mall. Eliminations. It was

15:18.840 --> 15:24.000
interesting because it's like, it's nerds. They literally, they called it King of the Nerds. They

15:24.000 --> 15:29.720
gathered what they claim to be like the best of the nerds of the country. They eliminate one,

15:29.720 --> 15:37.120
perhaps a standard reality show. Do they answer the question, what's up with titties? I'm ignoring

15:37.120 --> 15:45.120
that. A manic. A manic from the energy. You're fucking losing your cool. This is what we wanted.

15:45.120 --> 15:51.440
It's hosted and it was executive produced, so I think they probably took it out and pitched it,

15:51.440 --> 15:56.640
which makes me feel a lot better about it. Curtis Armstrong, a.k.a. Booger from Revenge of the

15:56.640 --> 16:02.040
Nerds and Robert Carradine, a.k.a. Lewis, was that his name? Yeah, from Revenge of the Nerds. The

16:02.040 --> 16:07.160
main nerd. It's hosted and executive produced by them and then they gather these nerds and they

16:07.160 --> 16:11.920
have nerd competitions and they eliminate nerds. So, but here's the interesting thing about it

16:11.920 --> 16:20.080
to me. So, I sit in bed with, last night with my girlfriend. She surfs through the ether sphere.

16:20.080 --> 16:28.160
She finds this show, King of the Nerds, we watch in the span of three and a half hours,

16:28.160 --> 16:32.120
we watch the entire eight episode run of the first season. We watch the entire thing. We got

16:32.120 --> 16:35.960
nothing to do. It's Sunday night. Fuck it. I sit there and play Minecraft while I'm watching it.

16:35.960 --> 16:41.040
We watch the whole thing and at the end of it, we're like, oh, I hope that girl wins. Like,

16:41.040 --> 16:49.280
oh, she didn't win. Spoilers. And then Erin goes, oh, she's following you on Twitter. I tweet her,

16:49.280 --> 16:53.520
hey, me and Erin think you should have won. Oh, thank you. Hey, if you're ever in LA by a drink,

16:53.520 --> 16:57.320
hey, I live in the valley. Hey, you want to be on my show? Okay, yeah, see you tomorrow night.

16:57.320 --> 17:05.080
In the span of 12 hours, this is either Rupert Murdoch's greatest nightmare or his master plan.

17:05.080 --> 17:11.800
I can't figure out which, but I know that reality has changed and I know that it has nothing to

17:11.800 --> 17:15.640
do with reality television, but the television is being made differently, consumed differently.

17:15.640 --> 17:22.840
It's interesting. My agent didn't call her agent. She's a fantasy author. She was one of the nerds.

17:22.840 --> 17:28.240
She made it all the way almost to the very end and really, really had an incredible, interesting

17:28.240 --> 17:34.280
hero's journey. You can buy her books and stuff. We'll let her plug them when she comes up here.

17:34.280 --> 17:44.480
This is my introduction of her. Roses are red. Guests are blue. Please welcome Genevieve Pearson.

17:44.480 --> 17:49.880
Hello.

17:49.880 --> 17:56.280
Hello.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.280
Sorry, I had an energy drink and then I had another one.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.280
I noticed that. That's like me on my seventh Diet Coke. Yeah.

18:04.280 --> 18:09.280
You just reached this tipping point where everything goes by in a blur.

18:09.280 --> 18:16.280
So, and help yourself to, yeah, help yourself to vodka.

18:16.280 --> 18:23.280
So, all right, there's a million questions I want to ask you. We'll probably have to get it down to like eight.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.280
I want to talk about...

18:25.280 --> 18:29.280
I don't see why we can't do a million. That seems logically feasible to me.

18:29.280 --> 18:34.280
What a nerd.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.280
An infinite dimension.

18:36.280 --> 18:40.280
To me, on the top of my line, I'm sure there's people in the audience who actually watched season one of this show

18:40.280 --> 18:46.280
and actually would have a million questions about, what's up with Alana? What's up with so-and-so?

18:46.280 --> 18:52.280
I think the most important thing to talk about, because I've never really talked to someone intimately

18:52.280 --> 18:56.280
that went through this whole sausage factory called Reality Television,

18:56.280 --> 19:00.280
which for now, it's going on 20 years. We've developed this thing.

19:00.280 --> 19:04.280
But I feel like I have to give you a specific question about it.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.280
I can't just go, hey, talk about...

19:06.280 --> 19:11.280
Take us from the mouth to the anus of this monster through eight episodes.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.280
But, okay, well, here's a specific question.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.280
How long does it take from...

19:15.280 --> 19:22.280
So, you show up, like, is it like boot camp where you bring luggage and you show up and...

19:22.280 --> 19:27.280
Yeah, so what happened with me is I found out I was in the top 16 and only 11 people are going to go on the show.

19:27.280 --> 19:32.280
But you have to show up for the final audition with everything as though you are going on the show.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.280
And so they spend a weekend in what I call, we all called, hotel jail.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.280
You don't see anybody. You don't interact with anyone.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.280
If you go around, you have to wear a blindfold because they don't want you to run into another contestant.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.280
You can't have any clue what's going on.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.280
Wait, what is the... I don't understand the reasoning for that.

19:48.280 --> 19:53.280
Because they don't want to spoil the surprise and they want everything to be genuine while you're doing your final audition.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.280
What's the surprise at that point when there's 16 people and five of them aren't going to be on the show?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.280
What could they possibly spoil?

19:59.280 --> 20:01.280
They...

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
That curtain is on.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.280
Armstrong is walking around the hallway.

20:04.280 --> 20:08.280
Well, they just don't want you to know who else is going to be on the show.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.280
Period.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.280
They want you coming in very blind.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.280
They want the genuine emotion that you have when you first meet somebody.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
Oh, okay.

20:15.280 --> 20:20.280
If you already met them and had formed an opinion, even if it was just happening in the hallway.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.280
That's what they're going for.

20:22.280 --> 20:29.280
That was the first weekend and then from there, you don't have any contact with anybody you know or love.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.280
Your husband, who we just met before the show, Paul.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.280
Paul?

20:33.280 --> 20:36.280
At a certain point, he goes into shadow lock.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.280
He's sequestered like a jury.

20:38.280 --> 20:44.280
He left me at the hotel and that's the last he heard from me until I was done with the entire show.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.280
Which is what span of time?

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
One full month.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.280
Wow.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.280
That's crazy.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.280
So one month with no contact with the outside world at all.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.280
No, you're not allowed to tweet text, email.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.280
No internet, no email, no nothing.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.280
Do they confiscate your...

21:01.280 --> 21:03.280
Yes, they confiscated all of our electronic devices.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.280
Just like living in the 20th century.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.280
They took my candle.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.280
They took my candle and I just about cried, I thought.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.280
They took your candle?

21:12.280 --> 21:14.280
There's no way to...

21:14.280 --> 21:16.280
No, they thought maybe I could hack it.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.280
You could hack it because you're a nerd, right?

21:18.280 --> 21:20.280
That makes sense.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.280
We're going to have to crack down on these N-words.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.280
Nerds, nerds.

21:26.280 --> 21:33.280
Just because it starts with N doesn't mean you can't say it.

21:33.280 --> 21:41.280
I love N-word Reagan, the first lady during the 80s.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.280
She was a nice one.

21:43.280 --> 21:47.280
And she's one of the nice ones, but by that I mean first ladies.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.280
How did you not win the show?

21:50.280 --> 21:53.280
I'm saying to her, how did you not win?

21:53.280 --> 21:56.280
Well, because at the end of it...

21:56.280 --> 21:58.280
And I'm sorry, this interview is going to involve spoilers.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.280
You can't just go watch...

22:00.280 --> 22:01.280
Are you allowed to do that?

22:01.280 --> 22:02.280
Can you talk about the show on a podcast?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.280
It's already aired.

22:04.280 --> 22:08.280
The reason is because they did it survivor style where it gets down to the last two people

22:08.280 --> 22:14.280
and the final decision is based on popular vote among the people that have all lost.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.280
They all come back and they all go, remember me, sucker?

22:17.280 --> 22:25.280
And then they, you know, it's come on, it's unfair because you went to three, like, nerd offs.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.280
Nerd offs, yeah.

22:26.280 --> 22:33.280
Which is like the, you know, that's like the dog pit where you send people that you hope get eliminated

22:33.280 --> 22:35.280
to rip out the throats.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.280
It's like the gladiator battle of the death.

22:37.280 --> 22:44.280
And so three times she was sent there and three times you watch her have to cope with areas outside her

22:44.280 --> 22:46.280
nerd expertise and kind of adapt.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.280
And it's very, very lovable.

22:48.280 --> 22:55.280
And there's a great, my favorite moment of the show of the first season is after the debate

22:55.280 --> 22:59.280
where you did a fantastic job of debating.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.280
They had a competition where they had to debate about comic book characters.

23:03.280 --> 23:13.280
And Genevieve shut down this guy that, you know, like he accidentally called Frank Miller John Miller

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
or something like that.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.280
You corrected him.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.280
First of all, it's Frank Miller.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.280
But your argument was more cogent.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.280
It was more deserving of win.

23:21.280 --> 23:27.280
Kevin Smith, who was one of the celebrity judges, goes like, first of all, you got to give props to a chick

23:27.280 --> 23:29.280
who can shut a guy down and call him Frank Miller.

23:29.280 --> 23:34.280
But at the same time, you know, you know, got to give it to him.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.280
He edged you out.

23:35.280 --> 23:43.280
At a distant point, like Genevieve, her face is in a pillow.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.280
Her head's not on camera.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.280
All you can see is her hair.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.280
Afterwards, by the way.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.280
And two fellow contestants sitting on her bed.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.280
And you just see Genevieve's head buried in a pillow.

23:53.280 --> 23:58.280
And it has to be subtitled because it's a sob ease.

23:58.280 --> 24:07.280
And the subtitles say, stupid Kevin Smith.

24:07.280 --> 24:13.280
And then sob, sob, and then I thought he was supposed to be cool.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.280
It's so great, so human.

24:16.280 --> 24:21.280
And it's so much more merciful to him than he was to you because, I mean, you can't follow up.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.280
You got to give props to a chick with not giving her the point.

24:25.280 --> 24:29.280
Because otherwise that's sexist because you just said, you saw her as a chick.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.280
She has to win.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.280
You have to, if you say, good job, Toots.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.280
And it's backed me on the ass.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.280
You can't follow it up with, but I love guys.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.280
Like, you can barely get away with it.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.280
Good job, Toots.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.280
You got moxie.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.280
You're hired.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.280
You know, you've got to, we've at least gotten there.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.280
Was he still wearing that douchey hockey jersey that he's always wearing?

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
Oh, yes he was.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
Yeah, so.

24:53.280 --> 24:59.280
Hey, hockey jersey.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.280
That's enigma.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.280
Return to innocence.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.280
That's been on your mind lately.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.280
I love that song.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.280
Okay, so a month.

25:11.280 --> 25:22.280
And how much do you get paid while you're working for a month off the grid while your husband may or may not get 9-11?

25:22.280 --> 25:25.280
And you wouldn't be allowed to know.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.280
We wouldn't.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
Because it's not on your Kindle.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.280
And even if it was, you're not even allowed to see it there.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.280
Yeah, we couldn't contact anyone.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.280
Okay, so I'm not, I have an NDA.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.280
I'll say that we got a per diem.

25:35.280 --> 25:41.280
And it was a meal per diem of $25 for three meals a day.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
So you could do the math.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.280
And that was the total.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.280
We didn't technically get paid.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.280
Okay.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.280
Because it was a game show, but we got a per diem.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.280
Wait, you didn't get paid.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.280
You're not allowed to say that?

25:53.280 --> 25:54.280
Well, it was a game show.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.280
So we're not being paid as actors.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.280
Oh, of course, paying it would be unethical.

25:58.280 --> 26:04.280
If they paid us as actors, if they paid us as people who are performers, then we would be admissible to SAG or another guilt.

26:04.280 --> 26:11.280
But you knew when you signed up that you were going to be on the show for a month and possibly only get meals paid for that entire time.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.280
Did it, was I aware?

26:13.280 --> 26:19.280
I honestly, I thought it was going to be like Survivor, where the longer you lasted, the more prize money you got.

26:19.280 --> 26:25.280
You didn't know that you could just be there for a full month, go right to the wire and then come home and then zip.

26:25.280 --> 26:30.280
I think they told us about two weeks beforehand what it was going to be.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.280
And at that point, it's like, oh, okay.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.280
Hey, guess what?

26:34.280 --> 26:36.280
Loving husband.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.280
Now I'm in the final 16.

26:38.280 --> 26:44.280
Oh, let's take the dignity option where we're just like, yeah, of course, you have to go through that.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.280
What's the grand prize?

26:45.280 --> 26:46.280
What did the winner take home?

26:46.280 --> 26:47.280
100,000.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.280
100,000 beans.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.280
Which, I mean, I'm biased.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.280
This is from my unique perspective, but what?

26:52.280 --> 26:54.280
That's a prize?

26:57.280 --> 26:58.280
100%.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.280
Return to innocence indeed.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.280
I mean, I gotta...

27:03.280 --> 27:09.280
I guess teak patio furniture is getting up there.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.280
Yeah, $100,000 is a lot of money.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.280
Will Phil agree that you want to put on your cupcakes?

27:13.280 --> 27:14.280
It doesn't come cheap.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.280
Oh, man.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.280
My electric bill.

27:19.280 --> 27:23.280
I should start a reality show where I just have people come over and just like, I don't know,

27:23.280 --> 27:29.280
bring flashlights and compete for the right to light my life.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.280
And then I give the winner $100,000 after a year of doing that.

27:32.280 --> 27:37.280
I'd make a profit on what I saved in light bulbs.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.280
What do you, Caesar Augustus?

27:39.280 --> 27:41.280
Not by choice, man.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.280
Not by choice.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.280
Yeah, no, it's become a choice.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.280
What am I supposed to do?

27:45.280 --> 27:48.280
You're choosing to make slaves out of people.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.280
Well, oh, no, I'm not really doing that.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.280
But no, but if you're paying them, then they're not technically saying.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.280
He's not going to pay these fuckers.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.280
He says it's going to be a game show.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
It's a prize.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
I'm giving a prize.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.280
I can't pay them, Genevieve.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.280
They're on a game show.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Oh, okay.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
My hands are tight.

28:01.280 --> 28:08.280
Actually, technically, so are theirs, but that's just part of the rules.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.280
What are you willing to do to be on TV?

28:10.280 --> 28:17.280
So, I don't want to be guilty of the crime of letting you go without, like, is there

28:17.280 --> 28:21.280
anybody in the audience who has a question, not specifically about the show, or just anybody,

28:21.280 --> 28:25.280
raise your hand if you're really burning, like, a question to ask Genevieve, like, whether

28:25.280 --> 28:28.280
it's about reality TV in general or the show.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.280
Someone's raising their hand back there.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
Erin McGathy to the stage.

28:31.280 --> 28:36.280
Erin McGathy is at the last minute as far as I'm concerned.

28:36.280 --> 28:40.280
So, everybody that watches reality shows knows that there's two components to it.

28:40.280 --> 28:45.280
Basically, there's this sort of pseudo coverage of everything that's happening, and then you're

28:45.280 --> 28:49.280
constantly cutting to these VH1 talking heads against a green screen.

28:49.280 --> 28:55.280
And they seem relevant, because if you guys were in costumes, then you're in the same

28:55.280 --> 29:01.280
costume, and that's probably not faked, because also emotionally, like, very often, people

29:01.280 --> 29:03.280
are crying in those talking heads.

29:03.280 --> 29:07.280
So, when do those happen, and how do they get you into that slaughterhouse?

29:07.280 --> 29:11.280
Well, so, what happens is, first of all, I don't know how other reality shows are.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.280
I felt a lot of ours was honest to the spirit of the drama.

29:14.280 --> 29:19.280
Honestly, they have to edit a lot out, and everything gets changed, but the spirit of

29:19.280 --> 29:23.280
what happened was pretty honest overall.

29:23.280 --> 29:29.280
However, for the talking heads, that was a sort of frustrating situation for me, because

29:29.280 --> 29:33.280
when I realize this, I'm a person who gets really focused on something, right?

29:33.280 --> 29:38.280
I'll be working, and I'll be focused in on this, and at some point, they realize that

29:38.280 --> 29:42.280
if we pull Genevieve out when she's really focused on something, we get really great

29:42.280 --> 29:46.280
off-cuff comments, because I'm so snappy, I want to get back to work.

29:46.280 --> 29:50.280
So, I start getting really snappish and kind of proud of you.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.280
Can we do a thing?

29:52.280 --> 29:58.280
Let me be you, and you be, like, is it like a producer with a clipboard that pulls you

29:58.280 --> 29:59.280
out?

29:59.280 --> 30:00.280
Can we do a talking to Genevieve?

30:00.280 --> 30:01.280
Yes, I can do this.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.280
Okay, all right, so I'm Genevieve.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.280
Okay, now do you want a moment in the show, or do you want me to do, like, we're here

30:05.280 --> 30:06.280
in Genevieve?

30:06.280 --> 30:11.280
You're catching me at a moment when I'm Genevieve, and I'm writing a fantasy novel.

30:11.280 --> 30:16.280
Dan and Aaron, you guys do a scene, like, you're in the kitchen talking about stuff,

30:16.280 --> 30:19.280
and then Genevieve will pull you out as a producer, Dan.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.280
Okay.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.280
Okay.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.280
When it happens, they pull you right out.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.280
No, well, yes, for the most part, something happens.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.280
Like, let's say you have a drama, and you have a fight with somebody.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.280
Okay.

30:28.280 --> 30:31.280
After that fight, the second it's resolved, there's somebody there going, come on.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.280
Okay, okay, okay.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.280
We're going to go talk about this right now.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.280
All right, so we'll start from, I'm doing dishes, washing a dish.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.280
Well, are we going to do a real scene?

30:37.280 --> 30:38.280
Yeah.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.280
I'm Genevieve.

30:39.280 --> 30:40.280
Yeah, that's fine.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.280
You guys, Jesus Christ.

30:41.280 --> 30:46.280
Dan and Aaron, just for the sake of this experiment, just try to manufacture a conflict between

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
the two of you.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
Just manufacture a conflict.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
Yes.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.280
Yeah.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
Just strictly for entertainment purposes.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.280
She broke a dish.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.280
Go.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.280
Oh, I broke it.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.280
Okay, that's good.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.280
Okay.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.280
Was it broken?

30:57.280 --> 31:00.280
This is my special Batman dish that I brought.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.280
I'm sorry.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.280
I just, I'm sorry.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.280
Well, were you going to wait for me to find out that it was broken?

31:07.280 --> 31:08.280
When did you know it was broken?

31:08.280 --> 31:09.280
No, I don't know.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.280
I just didn't want you to get upset with me.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.280
Okay.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.280
CG dick.

31:13.280 --> 31:19.280
Well, Patrick, I only brought one dish.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.280
We're being Dan and Aaron.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.280
What?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.280
Well, Jeff is giving a certain direction.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.280
He just labeled you Patrick though.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.280
Okay, fine.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.280
Fine.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.280
I'm Aaron.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.280
I'm your girlfriend.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.280
Jeff just, here's what happened, Dan.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.280
So now we can talk about this.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
What the fuck is going on?

31:36.280 --> 31:37.280
Jeff wanted us to...

31:37.280 --> 31:42.280
Genevieve, just pull them out of their real lives and give them a fucking...

31:42.280 --> 31:43.280
Okay.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.280
This is me giving him the hand signal.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.280
Oh, okay.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.280
All right.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.280
And now you never talk again.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.280
Okay.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.280
Hey.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.280
Wow.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Hey, Dan.

31:52.280 --> 31:58.280
How are you feeling right now?

31:58.280 --> 32:02.280
I'm frustrated just because of the broken dish thing.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.280
Also, I didn't understand what the fuck anyone was doing.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.280
Okay.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.280
Well, will you tell me what happened?

32:08.280 --> 32:13.280
Well, I had agreed at the forefront that we were going to do like a reenactment.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
Wait, wait, wait.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.280
Let me stop you there.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.280
Can you say it in the present tense, please?

32:16.280 --> 32:18.280
All right, right, right, right.

32:18.280 --> 32:23.280
I'm agreeing to do a thing that's like a reenactment of a reality show.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.280
I want to play Genevieve.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.280
And then other people are piping up with their comedy.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.280
And it's just a little frustrating because no one's listening.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.280
There's not a lot of listening going on.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.280
I'm supposedly on stage with professional improvisers.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.280
Okay.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.280
So you're telling me nobody's listening.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.280
Can you say that in a more concise way?

32:41.280 --> 32:42.280
Nobody's listening.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.280
Nobody's listening.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.280
Nobody's listening.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.280
I don't know.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.280
Nobody's listening.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.280
Hello, hello.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.280
Nobody's listening.

32:48.280 --> 32:49.280
Okay, okay.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
That's great.

32:50.280 --> 32:53.280
Now, can I take you back to this morning?

32:53.280 --> 32:58.280
When you and Aaron, I'm going to remind you that you and Aaron were having breakfast.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.280
Yeah.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.280
And she took your eggs.

33:00.280 --> 33:04.280
I saw her reach over and grab something off of your plate.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.280
Now, how did you feel that?

33:05.280 --> 33:06.280
You saw that?

33:06.280 --> 33:07.280
How did you feel?

33:07.280 --> 33:08.280
I mean, I thought it was weird.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.280
Wait, wait, wait.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.280
I didn't mind at the time.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.280
I didn't mind.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.280
Wait, wait, wait.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.280
Can you say the question while you're answering?

33:13.280 --> 33:19.280
When Aaron took my eggs, I didn't think it was a big deal.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.280
So that didn't bother you?

33:22.280 --> 33:27.280
Well, I mean, I guess it could have bothered me.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.280
You don't think that?

33:28.280 --> 33:32.280
When Aaron took my eggs, it seemed like it could have bothered me.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.280
Okay.

33:33.280 --> 33:37.280
So you don't think maybe it was indicative of the fact that she doesn't respect you as

33:37.280 --> 33:39.280
a partner?

33:39.280 --> 33:42.280
Sure, I guess so.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.280
Oh, sorry, sorry.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.280
Yeah.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.280
Okay.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.280
All right.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.280
I'm sorry.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.280
I'm sorry.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.280
Yeah, just restate the whole thing.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.280
When Aaron took my eggs, I felt like it was indicative of her not respecting me as a partner.

33:53.280 --> 33:58.280
We'll be right back.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.280
Very nice.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.280
Wow.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
All right.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.280
Well, Genevieve, you're a fantasy author.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.280
I want to be able to plug your stuff because...

34:06.280 --> 34:11.280
I have a series of books called The Song of the Silver Tongue series on Amazon, Genevieve

34:11.280 --> 34:18.280
and right now I have a Kickstarter for HobbyCon 2014 in Pasadena, California.

34:18.280 --> 34:21.280
So if you have a hobby or craft you want to show off...

34:21.280 --> 34:22.280
HobbyCon.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.280
It's like an all-inclusive hobby convention.

34:24.280 --> 34:27.280
It's like a grassroots pre-GenCon...

34:27.280 --> 34:28.280
Yeah, it's awesome.

34:28.280 --> 34:34.280
It's for anybody who's a nerd or a doer if you like to knit or paint more hammers, 40K.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.280
Anybody who likes to do stuff, this is like your Olympics.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.280
All right.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.280
HobbyCon and look for Genevieve Pearson.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.280
Google the name.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.280
She's got two books she's very proud of and one that she's fine with.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.280
Yeah.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.280
And she should have won.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.280
Thank you Genevieve.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.280
Thanks for coming down.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.280
Thank you so much for having me.

34:56.280 --> 35:11.280
All right, let's work it out now on stage.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.280
I don't want to...

35:12.280 --> 35:15.280
It's not a big deal.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.280
Jeff suggested that we played ourselves and simulated a fight in Genevieve.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.280
I didn't say that.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.280
I said that.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.280
I was saying, I used you guys' names to set up the thing.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.280
Oh, I see.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.280
I thought, well, then I misunderstood.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.280
I'm sorry.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.280
A lot of mixed signals.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
Look, I'm not here to make friends.

35:30.280 --> 35:41.280
I'm here to win.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.280
That's another theme in reality shows.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.280
Every single person alternating, but when they're on top of the game, they're like,

35:47.280 --> 35:48.280
it's not business.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.280
It's personal or...

35:49.280 --> 35:50.280
I'm sorry.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
That's what I would do.

35:51.280 --> 35:56.280
I'd be like, I don't care about winning, who said they didn't like me?

35:56.280 --> 36:00.280
So Genevieve, when you were up here right now pretending to be a producer and you got

36:00.280 --> 36:04.280
in the middle of that conflict, how did you feel about that?

36:04.280 --> 36:09.280
I'm feeling a lot of stress right now because I don't like having to mediate between a couple.

36:09.280 --> 36:13.280
Okay, can you make that more succinct?

36:13.280 --> 36:19.280
I'm feeling a lot of stress having to mediate between Dan and Aaron right now because I'm

36:19.280 --> 36:25.280
in a healthy relationship and I just feel really bad.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.280
That was good.

36:26.280 --> 36:33.280
Can you say it again, be a little more succinct and also add something racist into it?

36:33.280 --> 36:40.280
Well, I can tell that Aaron has a fiery Irish temper and that's why she is having such a hard time.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.280
We'll be right back.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.280
Genevieve Pearson.

36:43.280 --> 36:47.280
Wow, we got to the bottom of the...

36:47.280 --> 36:52.280
That's what I was hoping we could talk about is the reality show source code.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.280
Let's make it an open source project.

36:54.280 --> 36:58.280
You at home can make your own reality show now with that source code.

36:58.280 --> 37:03.280
All right, let's bring to the stage Kumeil Nanjiani.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.280
Hi.

37:04.280 --> 37:13.280
Hi.

37:13.280 --> 37:17.280
That is the most rock and roll face anyone's ever made to this song.

37:17.280 --> 37:23.280
Kumeil Nanjiani.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
I love that song.

37:25.280 --> 37:29.280
I'm going to call out your name next time I'm making love.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.280
Is it to me?

37:31.280 --> 37:32.280
No.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.280
I like the sound.

37:34.280 --> 37:38.280
Kumeil Nanjiani.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.280
That's actually what I do.

37:40.280 --> 37:43.280
I say, you've been Nanjiani.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.280
You know what's weird is who else does that?

37:45.280 --> 37:46.280
Ben Stein.

37:46.280 --> 37:50.280
And it's not Ben Stein.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.280
Also weird, I yell out Kumeil.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.280
What were you like?

37:55.280 --> 37:59.280
Kumeil Nanjiani.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.280
Enigma, 1995.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.280
You know all that reality talk is interesting because I just watched it.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.280
I'd never seen it, the first season of Real World.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.280
They were re-hearing it.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.280
And I just watched it and it's sort of the first reality show.

38:13.280 --> 38:19.280
And it's so interesting to watch a reality show where the people don't have like reality show personalities yet.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.280
Where they weren't raised on reality.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.280
Yeah, and they're just sort of being themselves and it was a very positive thing.

38:24.280 --> 38:28.280
You watch them discover the flint rock of eliminating the black guy.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.280
Exactly.

38:30.280 --> 38:36.280
Like you watch them go like, oh, Kuan is very antagonistic.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.280
You notice that too?

38:38.280 --> 38:41.280
And then afterwards you watch them institutionally.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.280
What if you did a show where they had to eliminate the black guy?

38:44.280 --> 38:46.280
It's totally amazing because it's exactly that.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.280
It's stuff that happens sort of organically when there's still cameras.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.280
But then later they're like, alright, we gotta do this.

38:52.280 --> 38:58.280
At the end of the season, they just decide to grab all the cameras and start interviewing the interviewers.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.280
And it's a very real organic moment.

39:00.280 --> 39:03.280
But I bet at some point they were like, alright, okay.

39:03.280 --> 39:09.280
What you guys do now is you have to pretend that we don't know when you come and steal the cameras from us.

39:09.280 --> 39:14.280
I'm like the forest gump of reality TV because in the 90s, I remember,

39:14.280 --> 39:19.280
I remember being in Milwaukee in the 90s when they were starting to talk about how they're going to make this show.

39:19.280 --> 39:24.280
They're making this show for MTV, which was still a channel where they showed music videos.

39:24.280 --> 39:28.280
It was like they had some butt-head and they had some other stuff, but it was still largely like,

39:28.280 --> 39:31.280
we were all making jokes like, put some music videos on.

39:31.280 --> 39:35.280
But the joke was because they were still supposed to make music television.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.280
And they were working on this thing and it was called The Real World.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.280
And the whole idea was that these kids were living in this house and there was going to be cameras everywhere.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.280
And it was ironic. It was ironic.

39:44.280 --> 39:48.280
Everyone that had heard about the idea was like, what does that mean?

39:48.280 --> 39:53.280
If there's cameras everywhere, then they're like, no, what they're doing is they're going to have the cameras everywhere

39:53.280 --> 39:57.280
and they're not even going to have film in them right away and they're just going to get used to it.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.280
They're going to get so used to it.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.280
And it was like this whole thing, it was introduced like this Kubrickian experiment.

40:01.280 --> 40:04.280
It's such a crazy thing that it was crazy back then and now we're like, yeah.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.280
It was crazy.

40:05.280 --> 40:11.280
And so then there was a point, so flash forward to me in Los Angeles, Thanksgiving.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.280
I just moved.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
Schrab was there.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.280
I was there.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.280
I'm sitting at Thanksgiving because we had no family in LA.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.280
I'm sitting at my agent's house for Thanksgiving.

40:18.280 --> 40:21.280
I'm sitting next to this weird little Australian guy.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.280
And I go, so what are you working on?

40:23.280 --> 40:26.280
He goes like, oh, I'm working on a reality show.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.280
It's been big in Europe.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.280
Might shrimp with a Barbie, whatever.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.280
I think it was Australia or something.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.280
I don't know, whatever.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.280
It sounds like it might have been death.

40:35.280 --> 40:42.280
I'm almost reasonably certain, like piecing together the evidence.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.280
I haven't specified.

40:43.280 --> 40:47.280
I choose to believe it was Mark Burnett that I was talking to.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.280
Is he Australian?

40:48.280 --> 40:49.280
I don't know.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.280
But it seems like the easiest thing to find out.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.280
I don't want to because I don't want to know.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.280
Yes, he is.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.280
Okay.

40:56.280 --> 41:01.280
So sometimes people go, I think you were sitting next to Mark Burnett because I was at my agent's house.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.280
That's amazing.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.280
She was a hot shot.

41:03.280 --> 41:07.280
I was sitting next to this guy with this accent and he was telling me about the show, the reality show.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.280
And he goes like, yeah, it's huge in Europe.

41:10.280 --> 41:15.280
They put everybody on an island and then they eliminate, this was the elimination thing was becoming like a thing.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.280
And I was like, what the fuck?

41:17.280 --> 41:18.280
That sounds insane.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.280
But wouldn't they just eliminate, how would that work?

41:20.280 --> 41:27.280
And he goes, no, but they eliminate the strong people first and then the middle of the road people kind of take over.

41:27.280 --> 41:31.280
But more than that, they're also like eating each other alive and they're having sex with each other.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.280
And I was like, that's going to be a hit.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.280
I said it, I said it.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.280
Give me my money.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.280
You said that's going to be a hit?

41:36.280 --> 41:37.280
Yeah.

41:37.280 --> 41:42.280
You totally are though because wait, wait, turn it off.

41:42.280 --> 41:46.280
Then I'm sitting in my apartment.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.280
My girlfriend at the time calls me.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.280
She was a studio executive.

41:49.280 --> 41:52.280
She calls me and she would use to call me after a day at work.

41:52.280 --> 41:59.280
She would call me from the office because people would pitch her shows and she would go, oh, hey, like, what am I, like, I got to talk to my writer boyfriend.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.280
I got to get some release from this insane industry.

42:02.280 --> 42:07.280
On the heels of survivor, the world is exploding, everything's changing.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.280
I remember talking to her from my one bedroom apartment.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.280
That was your tipping point for the world changing with survivor?

42:13.280 --> 42:16.280
I thought you were going to say 9-11.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.280
I mean, did 9-11 not happen yet?

42:18.280 --> 42:19.280
Oh, right.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.280
Okay, we're 9-11.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.280
It's survivor times.

42:21.280 --> 42:25.280
You realize Alcana did what they did because of reality TV?

42:25.280 --> 42:26.280
I guess that's right.

42:26.280 --> 42:32.280
Do you know that they said, like, oh, I know how we, obviously, we can look...

42:32.280 --> 42:37.280
I hope this story ends with you meeting an 8-year-old Kim Kardashian.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.280
Where she's like, oh, I'm never going to be anything.

42:39.280 --> 42:43.280
You're like, you can be whatever you want to be.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.280
And then you gave her the confidence to be horrible.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.280
My girlfriend called me up.

42:47.280 --> 42:53.280
My girlfriend called me up and she said, she would call me up every once in a while and she'd go, I just heard a pitch for this show.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.280
Buckle up.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.280
You ready for this?

42:55.280 --> 43:04.280
These people, they're on an alien planet and, you know, one of the guys is in a wheelchair and the gravity is weird.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.280
So every once in a while he can walk.

43:06.280 --> 43:09.280
And I'd go, later lost would have a character like that.

43:09.280 --> 43:14.280
But she calls me up and she goes like, so listen to this.

43:14.280 --> 43:17.280
So this is a pitch I just heard for a reality show.

43:17.280 --> 43:27.280
A man who's rich, he doesn't have a wife, but he's rich.

43:27.280 --> 43:34.280
So all the women compete to be his wife because he needs a wife so bad.

43:34.280 --> 43:41.280
And I'm like 20 whatever-year-old Dan Harmon going like, I'm saying in response to hearing this concept.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.280
I'm going, fuck you.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.280
No fucking way.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.280
I can't go there.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.280
It's impossible.

43:48.280 --> 43:49.280
Marriage?

43:49.280 --> 43:51.280
The institution of marriage?

43:51.280 --> 43:54.280
This is before who wants to fuck a midget.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.280
Literally, for me.

43:56.280 --> 44:03.280
Everything just exploded like a mushroom cloud to the point where one day you were allowed to be like frazzled by any of it.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.280
And then the next day everyone had beaten you to the punch.

44:06.280 --> 44:12.280
It's pretty impressive because I just read a thing today that said how marriage, people are getting married less and less.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.280
Almost 50% of kids, something's happening.

44:15.280 --> 44:19.280
Nothing. It's fine. I tipped my calf.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.280
It's not being clumsy.

44:21.280 --> 44:24.280
It said 50% of kids born or born out of wedlock.

44:24.280 --> 44:28.280
And I think part of the reason people aren't getting married, the sanctity of marriage, whatever that means.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.280
Because they want to be romantic.

44:30.280 --> 44:36.280
But I think because of things like bachelor and stuff, because it has cheapened that thing so much.

44:36.280 --> 44:44.280
It makes it feel like you're kind of a sucker. We're moving into a weird Logan's Run universe where we have three life cycles or something.

44:44.280 --> 44:48.280
Where you go like, oh, who's your first wife? Who's your second wife? Who's your third wife?

44:48.280 --> 44:54.280
Yeah, when I got married, I got married pretty young and I told my friends and they literally were like, why?

44:54.280 --> 44:56.280
That was literally their reaction.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.280
How old were you when you got married?

44:58.280 --> 45:01.280
I got married. I got married.

45:01.280 --> 45:03.280
I know you guys have several weddings.

45:03.280 --> 45:06.280
Yeah, we've had several weddings.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.280
Oh, because you're from Pakistan? Is that a thing?

45:08.280 --> 45:09.280
Because they love weddings.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.280
Okay.

45:11.280 --> 45:16.280
Somehow, even though it's racist, you are accurate.

45:16.280 --> 45:21.280
Hi!

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
Well, because you're...

45:22.280 --> 45:24.280
I'm assuming your gods have eight heads.

45:24.280 --> 45:29.280
So eight weddings, one for each head.

45:29.280 --> 45:34.280
I, Kumar of the North Plains, am sanctifying this marriage.

45:34.280 --> 45:36.280
Okay, now we have to go to the Western Territory.

45:36.280 --> 45:40.280
I, Aesop.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.280
I lower my sword.

45:43.280 --> 45:50.280
One wedding for each stereotype, so we have to do one for the cab driving god and one for the sun god.

45:50.280 --> 45:53.280
I, Shaloub of the cab.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.280
I declare this wedding...

45:55.280 --> 45:58.280
Good reference. Holy shit.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.280
It changed. Amazing.

46:00.280 --> 46:02.280
Shaloub of the checker gods.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.280
Oh, yeah.

46:04.280 --> 46:09.280
I, of the Big Bang Theory, the 30...

46:09.280 --> 46:11.280
Basinga!

46:11.280 --> 46:14.280
The Fisher Stevens god.

46:14.280 --> 46:18.280
This short circuit is complete.

46:18.280 --> 46:22.280
By the circuits of Johnny Fine.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.280
Oh, my God.

46:25.280 --> 46:30.280
No, this is why, because we first got married in secret,

46:30.280 --> 46:34.280
like, just me and her and a couple of our friends at a...

46:34.280 --> 46:37.280
like, you know, where you go to just stand in line.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.280
You literally stand in line.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.280
At City Hall?

46:39.280 --> 46:40.280
At City Hall.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.280
And you get married, and it was, like, actually a really beautiful, wonderful experience,

46:44.280 --> 46:47.280
because all these people in line, and some of them are pregnant, some of them are super old.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.280
They're all kind of, like...

46:48.280 --> 46:51.280
They all kind of had these things, like, everybody clearly on the street,

46:51.280 --> 46:55.280
and the guy who married us, the magistrate guy, I don't know what you call him,

46:55.280 --> 46:58.280
it was probably, like, the 30th wedding he turned,

46:58.280 --> 47:03.280
but he was so, like, warm, and he seemed genuinely happy and joyous,

47:03.280 --> 47:04.280
and it was such a wonderful...

47:04.280 --> 47:08.280
And then after that, we went home and watched four weddings at a funeral, you know, like,

47:08.280 --> 47:10.280
it was a good day, you know?

47:10.280 --> 47:13.280
I'm sorry, I couldn't get over the insensitivity.

47:13.280 --> 47:15.280
You don't know if he's called the magistrate.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.280
Like, can't you be a little more politically correct?

47:17.280 --> 47:22.280
No, I thought that would be funny.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.280
After the eight-headed guy thing.

47:24.280 --> 47:27.280
So we did that, and then we had a Muslim wedding,

47:27.280 --> 47:32.280
and then we had how many, and then we've had three weddings,

47:32.280 --> 47:35.280
and then the third one actually was not even...

47:35.280 --> 47:38.280
But then you have to have a funeral.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.280
Well, that'll come.

47:40.280 --> 47:43.280
Thanks for the reality check, bro.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.280
I'm jealous. I love weddings.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.280
Well, what's interesting was...

47:48.280 --> 47:50.280
So many weddings.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.280
I'm gonna convert to Muslim.

47:52.280 --> 47:55.280
To Muslim. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, to Islam. I'm a little drunk.

47:55.280 --> 47:58.280
I don't know, that's kind of a sinking ship right now.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.280
Not many people.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.280
Once Mike Tyson got on there, we were like, alright, we're out.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.280
What was your third wedding?

48:05.280 --> 48:07.280
The third wedding, actually, so we were married,

48:07.280 --> 48:10.280
but we hadn't told anybody, and then one weekend,

48:10.280 --> 48:12.280
we just moved in New York, we just told our friends,

48:12.280 --> 48:16.280
like, hey, we're gonna go get married this weekend, and what we did was,

48:16.280 --> 48:19.280
we stayed at home, and we turned off our phones, and we...

48:19.280 --> 48:21.280
Let's get Emily Andrews.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.280
Emily!

48:23.280 --> 48:25.280
Emily Gordon, everybody.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.280
Hi!

48:32.280 --> 48:36.280
First off, we've never told anybody that we were married in secret.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.280
It could not matter less now.

48:38.280 --> 48:40.280
It could, that's a good point.

48:40.280 --> 48:43.280
It's been a long time, and you know what, no secrets anymore.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.280
No secrets, you guys. We were married for like a year and a half

48:46.280 --> 48:48.280
before anybody... Before he told anybody.

48:48.280 --> 48:50.280
Yeah.

48:50.280 --> 48:52.280
I highly recommend it, because you don't get people being like,

48:52.280 --> 48:55.280
oh, you guys are newlyweds, isn't that weird for you?

48:55.280 --> 48:58.280
Well, people still do that, and you're like, fuck you.

48:58.280 --> 49:00.280
You don't know how dumb that is.

49:00.280 --> 49:03.280
Which, honestly, for us, we've been living together for so long,

49:03.280 --> 49:06.280
that getting married wasn't really a big difference.

49:06.280 --> 49:09.280
Yeah, that's the real truth, is that once you live with someone...

49:09.280 --> 49:12.280
How old was that, 20 or 29?

49:12.280 --> 49:15.280
I think that should be the new definition of marriage.

49:15.280 --> 49:18.280
Grant, this is very L.A. of me to say, because we live out here

49:18.280 --> 49:21.280
in this culture where people come out here to pursue their dreams.

49:21.280 --> 49:24.280
Dreams don't come true, so people get married out here

49:24.280 --> 49:27.280
when they're 40 and they have kids when they're 50.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.280
That's exactly right.

49:29.280 --> 49:33.280
As such, I married Schrab and Kate,

49:33.280 --> 49:37.280
and they had been together for so long,

49:37.280 --> 49:40.280
and living together for so long before it,

49:40.280 --> 49:44.280
that your first question is, what's the point of getting married?

49:44.280 --> 49:47.280
And then your second question is, what could be more romantic

49:47.280 --> 49:50.280
than the decision to get married by two people

49:50.280 --> 49:53.280
who don't have anything to gain or lose by getting married?

49:53.280 --> 49:56.280
And I think that we have to move forward into a society...

49:56.280 --> 49:58.280
Oh, we have to.

49:58.280 --> 50:01.280
It's a high-stakes game.

50:01.280 --> 50:05.280
We also probably have to stop making lasers that destroy the earth,

50:05.280 --> 50:07.280
but we'll get around to this.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.280
No, look it up.

50:09.280 --> 50:13.280
We have to move into a world where marriage

50:13.280 --> 50:16.280
is no longer looked at as moving across a threshold,

50:16.280 --> 50:18.280
like a thing that has to be done where you're like,

50:18.280 --> 50:20.280
I wonder what it's going to be like after that,

50:20.280 --> 50:23.280
because the answer is, it's going to be the same.

50:23.280 --> 50:28.280
So if more of this for 30 years isn't your cup of tea,

50:28.280 --> 50:30.280
don't marry this person.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.280
For us, for me, it was a very romantic thing

50:32.280 --> 50:35.280
because it's literally just saying to the world,

50:35.280 --> 50:37.280
like, I'm going to be with this person forever.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.280
And it was a very romantic.

50:39.280 --> 50:42.280
And even though we've been married three times,

50:42.280 --> 50:44.280
I never actually got to propose to you,

50:44.280 --> 50:46.280
so I never got to.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
Are you crying something?

50:48.280 --> 50:50.280
No, no, no.

50:56.280 --> 50:58.280
Emily, will you marry me?

50:58.280 --> 51:02.280
I will.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.280
Faith.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.280
We did it.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.280
Forgiveness.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.280
It took us 50 episodes.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.280
Destiny.

51:10.280 --> 51:11.280
Piveness.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.280
Emily Gordon, everybody.

51:13.280 --> 51:16.280
Destiny.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.280
Devotion.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.280
Fourth wedding.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.280
Fourth wedding.

51:23.280 --> 51:28.280
The right way to put it, I thought, was when I asked Schrabb,

51:28.280 --> 51:30.280
why is he marrying Kate?

51:30.280 --> 51:36.280
He said, to paraphrase him, I ran out of ways

51:36.280 --> 51:39.280
to make it clear how much I love this person,

51:39.280 --> 51:42.280
which is, I think that's the right way to go.

51:42.280 --> 51:48.280
Don't marry him until it's absolutely the only thing left.

51:48.280 --> 51:59.280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

51:59.280 --> 52:02.280
Forgiveness.

52:02.280 --> 52:04.280
Vacuum.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.280
Poobase.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.280
All right, let's, come on.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.280
We got a time pause.

52:11.280 --> 52:13.280
Let's keep this train going.

52:13.280 --> 52:18.280
Spencer after the stage.

52:18.280 --> 52:22.280
You don't usually see a proposal after the wedding,

52:22.280 --> 52:25.280
but you never see a proposal after three weddings.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.280
Yeah.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.280
Spencer Crinton, everybody.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.280
Welcome to the stage.

52:33.280 --> 52:37.280
Hey, hey, hey.

52:37.280 --> 52:40.280
Oh, shit.

52:40.280 --> 52:45.280
What?

52:45.280 --> 52:49.280
Spencer, what's new in your life since we saw you last?

52:49.280 --> 52:53.280
I told you guys, I've been listening to that song,

52:53.280 --> 52:56.280
Stepping Out by Joe Jackson.

52:56.280 --> 52:59.280
And I was unable to download it in time for showtime tonight.

52:59.280 --> 53:02.280
Yeah, but I really appreciate the thought.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.280
How does that one go?

53:03.280 --> 53:05.280
Can you sing a bit for us?

53:05.280 --> 53:15.280
Yeah.

53:15.280 --> 53:18.280
Bring.

53:18.280 --> 53:19.280
Are there words?

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.280
How do the words go?

53:22.280 --> 53:29.280
Now, the mist across the window blocks the light,

53:29.280 --> 53:37.280
but nothing hides the color of the lights that shine.

53:37.280 --> 53:44.280
If that shit is not on Tumblr in the next hour,

53:44.280 --> 53:46.280
I'm going to be very disappointed.

53:46.280 --> 53:50.280
I want full animated, fully recreated music video.

53:50.280 --> 53:54.280
I want to hear a mashup between Enigma's Return to Innocence

53:54.280 --> 53:57.280
and Joe Jackson's Stepping Out.

53:57.280 --> 54:03.280
Do you guys remember that we listened to that

54:03.280 --> 54:09.280
and other Enigma songs on the way to Medieval Times on repeat?

54:09.280 --> 54:11.280
Yeah.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.280
It's down, I'm sorry.

54:12.280 --> 54:14.280
What is the deal with Enigma?

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
Like, is it one guy?

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
Is it 100?

54:16.280 --> 54:17.280
It could be anything.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
It's at least two guys.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.280
It's one guy, one cave, 40 mics.

54:20.280 --> 54:24.280
It sounds like it could be either white or they...

54:24.280 --> 54:27.280
You could put Enigma and Enya in a line-up

54:27.280 --> 54:29.280
and I wouldn't know what was going on.

54:29.280 --> 54:32.280
Also, they had that song that's ubiquitous,

54:32.280 --> 54:34.280
like, whenever anybody, like...

54:34.280 --> 54:36.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.280
The sadness...

54:38.280 --> 54:39.280
I tried to do an impression of it.

54:39.280 --> 54:42.280
Yeah, it was Sadness Part One.

54:42.280 --> 54:45.280
Sadness Part One, which is the cockiest name to a song ever.

54:45.280 --> 54:47.280
There will be more.

54:47.280 --> 54:50.280
Anytime, anyone who was doing anything,

54:50.280 --> 54:54.280
involving gauze, candles, duvetine, and S&M,

54:54.280 --> 54:56.280
like, in any HBO show.

54:56.280 --> 54:58.280
It's like Chris de Burgh's song,

54:58.280 --> 55:00.280
a lady in red,

55:00.280 --> 55:02.280
The Beginning.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.280
Whenever I hear Enigma, I picture those moles

55:04.280 --> 55:06.280
who have never seen light

55:06.280 --> 55:08.280
in the Battle of Feet.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.280
They have no idea.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.280
They're blind moles.

55:12.280 --> 55:15.280
I picture a kid eating mango for the first time.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.280
What a beautiful...

55:19.280 --> 55:22.280
I picture my mom's pussy, but...

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
But in a good way?

55:23.280 --> 55:25.280
Full disclosure, like, I picture that also,

55:25.280 --> 55:27.280
like, when I hear a variety of songs,

55:27.280 --> 55:31.280
like, especially, like, the Rocky theme.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.280
His mom's pussy is a staircase.

55:35.280 --> 55:39.280
It's specifically, yeah, it's a marble staircase.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.280
In Philadelphia.

55:41.280 --> 55:43.280
Spencer!

55:43.280 --> 55:44.280
Hey, guys.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.280
Alright, well, let's get these out.

55:46.280 --> 55:47.280
What, are you gonna say something?

55:47.280 --> 55:49.280
I was just gonna say, I actually...

55:49.280 --> 55:51.280
This is terrible, and I...

55:51.280 --> 55:53.280
I am terrible.

55:53.280 --> 55:55.280
You picture my mom's pussy when blah, blah, blah, yeah?

55:55.280 --> 55:57.280
Yeah, yeah, no, but...

55:57.280 --> 55:59.280
Do you actually know what your mom's pussy looks like?

55:59.280 --> 56:01.280
A marble staircase, right?

56:01.280 --> 56:03.280
If anybody should.

56:03.280 --> 56:05.280
That's what he said, I thought.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.280
That is what he said.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.280
Okay, listening skills.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.280
See, I'm listening to you, Dan.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.280
Thanks.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.280
I was just... I didn't write an intro sequence,

56:14.280 --> 56:16.280
so, I mean, I wrote...

56:16.280 --> 56:18.280
Yeah, I can try.

56:18.280 --> 56:21.280
I didn't... I mean, I distinctly remember

56:21.280 --> 56:23.280
you holding a dragon's dick open

56:23.280 --> 56:25.280
so that arrows can be shot.

56:25.280 --> 56:28.280
Well, then after that, I've already chopped the dick off,

56:28.280 --> 56:31.280
and I kind of called dibs on it, and it's in my bag.

56:31.280 --> 56:34.280
Yeah, yeah, I remember that, yeah, definitely.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.280
I remember that...

56:36.280 --> 56:38.280
Why don't you just freestyle one?

56:38.280 --> 56:40.280
For better or for worse?

56:40.280 --> 56:42.280
No right or wrong answers.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.280
Do you want to get the character she's passed out as we do this?

56:44.280 --> 56:46.280
I mean, yeah, yeah.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.280
Were you just listening to that song in lieu of...

56:48.280 --> 56:50.280
I know this is on Orthodox,

56:50.280 --> 56:54.280
but can I have Genevieve be my advisor on this?

56:54.280 --> 56:57.280
Similar to a nerd war?

56:57.280 --> 56:59.280
Yeah, or nerd off.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.280
Nerd off.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.280
Nerd off.

57:03.280 --> 57:05.280
You guys haven't seen King and the Nerds.

57:05.280 --> 57:07.280
Check it out.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.280
So, I am a lady with arrows.

57:10.280 --> 57:14.280
Can I bring Celeste up to help me out right now, please?

57:14.280 --> 57:18.280
She's off spending a hundred grand on...

57:18.280 --> 57:20.280
Alright, Suspenser.

57:20.280 --> 57:22.280
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.280
You're spilling.

57:24.280 --> 57:26.280
She just keeps doing it.

57:26.280 --> 57:28.280
She's like a Ronan Martin's laughing character.

57:28.280 --> 57:32.280
How many people are going to get that reference here?

57:32.280 --> 57:35.280
Yeah, okay, super nerdy.

57:35.280 --> 57:40.280
Fun fact, do that this morning with a cup of water as I woke up.

57:40.280 --> 57:43.280
When it keeps falling out of your cup, that's God saying,

57:43.280 --> 57:45.280
stop drinking.

57:45.280 --> 57:47.280
Does it need it?

57:47.280 --> 57:49.280
It counts with water, though, too.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.280
It's like stop drinking water.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.280
It's just a general sign.

57:53.280 --> 57:56.280
Yeah, but nobody spills two glasses of water.

57:56.280 --> 58:00.280
A doctor told me when I was eight years old that I had a problem with my ears

58:00.280 --> 58:02.280
that made me cry.

58:02.280 --> 58:05.280
Did he really say that?

58:05.280 --> 58:10.280
Yeah, I had a doctor who diagnosed me with a severe ear imbalance,

58:10.280 --> 58:12.280
which meant that I couldn't measure space.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.280
How convenient.

58:14.280 --> 58:16.280
Yeah, exactly.

58:16.280 --> 58:20.280
And then my mother told me later that she told him to tell me that.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.280
Oh!

58:22.280 --> 58:24.280
You did it!

58:24.280 --> 58:28.280
On that jerk note, let's enter the cave of Dungeons & Dragons.

58:28.280 --> 58:30.280
Oh, my God.

58:30.280 --> 58:33.280
On a rare, unwritten freestyle moment,

58:33.280 --> 58:35.280
50 episodes anniversary of...

58:35.280 --> 58:38.280
That's not anniversary, it's just 50 episodes of that.

58:38.280 --> 58:43.280
Last time, our heroes were scouring the depths of the ruins of Merchul

58:43.280 --> 58:47.280
on the far away plain of Twyla, the twilight forest.

58:47.280 --> 58:51.280
After opening a large chambered door, they entered a treasure room

58:51.280 --> 58:54.280
that appeared to house several treasures.

58:54.280 --> 59:00.280
And perhaps the fabled soul of growth that they had been seeking so earnestly.

59:00.280 --> 59:03.280
It was just then they heard a voice echo throughout the chamber

59:03.280 --> 59:08.280
that they saw a dragon come into view and immediately began combating it.

59:08.280 --> 59:12.280
After a time, they had thought they had gotten the upper hand on the dragon

59:12.280 --> 59:17.280
after paralyzing its dick and doing other things to its dick.

59:17.280 --> 59:20.280
Together, the group shot arrows at the dragon,

59:20.280 --> 59:24.280
and commanded magical scorpions.

59:24.280 --> 59:28.280
Sharpie tried to get it to fall over laughing, but that didn't go so well.

59:28.280 --> 59:32.280
Grasping its dick firmly, Quark tried to get more into fire arrows

59:32.280 --> 59:36.280
directly into the beast's urethra, but that failed as well.

59:36.280 --> 59:43.280
Grasping a bear track, Chris de Burgh managed to snap off the tip of the dick

59:43.280 --> 59:46.280
with his trusty trapsman skills.

59:46.280 --> 59:52.280
After which, Sharpie cast jump on himself, leaping cinematically onto the back of the beast.

59:52.280 --> 59:56.280
Throwing his flaming sword towards the wizard, Sharpie reared back

59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.280
and stabbed it directly into the beast's back, killing it in the last blow.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:11.280
The group stood around to survey the corpse and the treasures they had unlocked.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:19.280
Wow! You don't ever need to write one.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.280
I think I still will. I didn't feel comfortable with that.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.280
They call that crossing the Harmon threshold. You just find out, I don't need to do anything.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.280
Well, that was my, like, not wanting to write.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:40.280
Yeah, but you graduated pretty soon. You'll be taking baths instead of showers.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.280
Alright, so once again, reminders of our immediate surroundings, please.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.280
So you were in that room, there was like a big staircase that led up to where all the treasure was,

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.280
but there was a huge crack. That's where the dragon came out of,

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.280
and you were before the dragon, you were going to climb up there with rope.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.280
But now he's dead, so like, you don't have anything threatening you,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.280
and so you can look around or whatever.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.280
There's two statues, right?

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.280
There was this two giant statues, yeah, this point, no, there was three actually,

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.280
and one of the arms fell off because you tried to climb the statues silently, Mulraine,

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.280
and it knocked off its arm because, yeah, because it was made of vodka.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.280
She spilled the arm.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.280
It's like chunking goodies, just anything.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280
Hold this map.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.280
I am like chunking, sweetie. True. Whose turn is that?

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280
At this point, we're not in combat time, so you guys can just do whatever you want.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.280
I start a party. Yeah.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280
I mean, you guys just killed a dragon.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.280
Dragon dick party!

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.280
It's my dragon dick, there's a $10 cover.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.280
This is Per Genevieve's recommendation, which is so good.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.280
Can I cut off the dragon's horn?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.280
Yeah, yeah, definitely. It actually has two horns.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.280
Can I cut off both of them?

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.280
I put my swords on my legs and on my arms, and I do like a slide.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
Is that a thing?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.280
She spills the knives to the floor.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.280
Oh, the way that you're looking at me, Dan. I'm sorry.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.280
You put swords at night on your arms?

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280
They're double-bladed.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.280
On my legs, and I get at the forehead, and I slide down, like, spread eagle.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.280
Don't try to cut off the dick, I already did it.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.280
No, I don't get it.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.280
Yeah, yes.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280
Like a scissors?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.280
Like a cutting kick.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280
Why are you trying to saw it off?

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.280
I mean, women are different because women have more strength in their legs

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.280
than they do on their arms, so it's more at the top of my mind than my arms.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280
So I put blades, can I put my, how many swords do I have?

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280
A thousand?

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.280
You have a long sword.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.280
You have one long sword.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.280
Okay.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.280
But you tied to your foot.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.280
Do you want my rope? I have rope.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.280
I've got, like, three swords.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280
I tie all of my swords to Mulraine, so she's good.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.280
I tie a dragon's dick to her thigh.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.280
It's like Jet Poet Society, everyone's just giving her swords.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:17.280
Okay, so Spencer, my idea is that I have a sword tied to my left calf,

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.280
and a sword tied to my right calf.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.280
Where's the dick?

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.280
The dick is on my head, like a top hat.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.280
Like an Abraham, like a top hat.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.280
Like a bachelorette party?

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280
Like a Dr. Seuss, like a rave hat.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.280
Yes, like the shortest marriage bachelorette party ever.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.280
I have a giant dick attached to my head, and I put out my legs,

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:45.280
and I slide down to cut the horns off at the same time.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.280
It feels like there's a more efficient way to achieve this.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280
Hey, hey, hey, Chris, Chris.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.280
But it's one move, but it's not about efficiency.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.280
I'm trying to do it, I'm trying to do it in one move.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280
This is about having a party.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.280
No, it's not. I'm trying to do it in one move.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280
Is there a difference?

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280
Get both of the horns in one move?

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280
Yeah.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.280
Okay, see, now this makes slightly more sense.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.280
I hear you, I hear you.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.280
Do you think I want to get them at the same time?

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280
And my arms are just strong if I put them on my legs.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280
Aren't the pines like different turns?

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280
What's up?

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280
I mean, like I said, you're not really in combat time.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280
You guys can do whatever.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.280
Yeah, so the whatever you want to do is be awesome.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280
Yes, you're tight.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.280
I want to go with Chris de Burgh.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.280
I want to transcribe as much of this blood spellbook as possible.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280
You want to study this book?

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280
Yeah.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.280
All right.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.280
Or Genevieve suggested a sword cartwheel, if that's a possibility.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.280
A sword cartwheel.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.280
Either way, either way, legs, cartwheels, ropes.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.280
I mean, it's true to my own spirit if I just slide down with the two.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.280
Huddling together, Chris de Burgh and Sharpie pour over the book,

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.280
trying to study while Mulraine ties blades to her legs.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.280
Hey, what's she trying to do?

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280
It doesn't matter.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280
Read, read.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.280
All right.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280
So I read the book.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.280
Okay.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.280
You guys are reading the book.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.280
I get naked while this is happening.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.280
Walk up to the top of the steps of my lute and lay down and kind of like a Greek,

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.280
like urn pose, like just nude on my side.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.280
And watching them read the book and watching Mulraine tie soristers,

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.280
I just start like serenading the whole thing.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.280
Well, actually, your serenade is so powerful that everyone stops what they're doing

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.280
and is paying attention to your sermon.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280
Wow, what is this?

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.280
It's not a sermon.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:28.280
Oh, the dragon's dick is severed.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.280
Okay, guys, go ahead.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280
No, I'm sorry.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280
Do what you were doing.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280
Did you ask what they were saying?

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.280
Did you ask what they were saying?

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.280
I was just quietly being nude and playing my lute.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.280
You're not being quiet and playing the lute.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.280
There's no...

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:48.280
Okay, I play the lady in red a song that nobody will notice.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.280
Mulraine climbs to the top of the dragon and doing the maneuver she had mentioned earlier,

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.280
which is still not fully understanding.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280
Manages to not...

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.280
It's very awkward and strange.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280
Arms are used for doing things.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.280
Legs are used for moving people around.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.280
No, legs are...

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.280
I take the dragon dick back.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280
Legs are strong.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280
Legs are strong.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280
They can be strong, but they're not...

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280
Ladies, legs are strong.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280
They don't handle swords.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280
Thank you.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.280
They don't...

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.280
All swords attached to her thighs.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.280
I take the dragon dick back.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.280
I take the dragon dick back from the head,

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280
because I think it's going to get injured.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280
Well, that happens.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.280
But, I mean, you jump on and you do your thing,

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280
and that knocks the horns off.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.280
Yeah, fuck you.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280
You realized that...

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280
Or, I mean, you didn't realize.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.280
You always knew that dragon horns are quite magical.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280
Fuck you, dragon.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.280
It's fine, fuck everybody.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.280
I don't care.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280
I do, yeah, that's true.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.280
I don't know.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.280
I do feel like after this experience,

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.280
I have to go home and think about physics a little bit more.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280
Yeah, I honestly...

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280
That was the first thing I thought about.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Yeah, I like the physics stuff in my head.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.280
I mean, wolves' jaws are strong.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:06.280
You don't use them to, you know, lift up a manhole cover.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.280
Well, I just know that my legs are stronger than my arms,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.280
and I wanted to cut off both of the dragon's horns.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280
And that is what I...

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280
That's what I did.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280
Are we still reading the blood book?

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.280
Yeah, you guys are reading.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.280
It's actually going to take some hours.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.280
I mean, but yeah.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.280
But you're working on it.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280
Well, it's like we have hours.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280
We take those hours.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280
Yeah, definitely.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.280
I mean, it seems like that dragon thing took hours, right?

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280
It didn't take hours.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280
In combat time, that probably...

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280
I mean, in actual, like, time-time,

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.280
it probably maybe took, like,

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.280
probably not even 10 minutes.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.280
I just wanted to do it, and you wanted to find out

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280
the logistics of it.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280
It's not my fault.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280
Nothing matters.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280
Producers.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280
I'm not here to make friends!

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.280
Woo!

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280
Just kidding.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.280
I'm only here to make friends.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.280
But yeah, so you guys are studying.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.280
You're up there.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.280
I mean, you're in a room full of treasure.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280
Okay.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280
I examine the treasure.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280
I...

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280
Because they're all fucking about doing book reading

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
and dragon slicing,

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.280
I go try to get my grubby little fingers in the...

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.280
Are you still naked?

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280
I'm still naked.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280
It's important.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.280
You know, it's weird,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.280
and D&D people often get naked.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280
Yeah.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280
Like, not even for any reason,

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280
other than to not have clothes.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.280
But anyway, you open a treasure chest.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.280
I feel like the overlap of people who play D&D

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.280
and who get to get naked around other people

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.280
is maybe not as huge.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.280
That's true.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.280
It's, uh, it's wishful-filled.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280
So, in the nude, I...

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280
And no one laughed at me.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280
Is the unspoken...

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280
Wishful-fillment.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.280
Yeah, that's the unspoken part after everything.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.280
Let's all literally get naked right now, everybody.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.280
I'm in.

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.280
Whoa!

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.280
Alright, so I examine the treasure.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280
You examine the treasure.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280
I said you're opening a treasure chest.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.280
The small chest opens with a soft click.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.280
On the soft plush interior,

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.280
you see four identical silver rings.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.280
A small inscription reads,

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.280
Ring of Armor.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280
Hmm.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280
I put it on.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.280
You feel as if you have, you know,

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.280
you're stronger at walking attacks.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.280
That's one of them?

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280
One of them says Ring of Armor?

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280
They all say, oh, I mean,

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.280
one inscription on the entire box.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.280
I first of all, before I put that on,

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.280
I read all of the names off.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.280
So, Ring of Armor.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280
Ring of Armor.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.280
The other one?

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.280
They're all the same.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280
Oh, they're all Ring of Armor?

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.280
They're all Rings of Armor.

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280
I take one Ring of Armor and I put it on,

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.280
and I look down at the two guys reading books,

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280
and Mulraine, Slice and Dragon,

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.280
horns off with their calves.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.280
And I grab everybody,

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.280
and I throw them in a perfect throw.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.280
They all, and I go, hey, everybody,

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.280
stick a finger in the air.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.280
And then I do a little pirouette,

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.280
and I cascade them down,

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280
and they perfectly land down

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280
on each of their fingers.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.280
Yeah, one of them does.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.280
The other two.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280
It's not what I said, Spencer.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280
I said it first.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280
Fuck you, dude.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280
Why don't you just hand them to us?

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280
Now we have to go around looking for a ring.

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.280
Why don't you just saw off a dragon's horn?

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280
I'm not making a big thing about it.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280
Oh, God.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280
Because I could do it in one swipe.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280
I know, I was inspired by you, Mulraine.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280
I saw her doing it fancy.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.280
I think I heard it going here.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.280
I think it's around here.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.280
Okay, so, so one lands on who?

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.280
The coomail gets it.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.280
The other two falls on me.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280
Who's coomail?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280
That's awesome.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.280
No one's ever done that to me.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.280
Extra points.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280
Yeah.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.280
You gained 300 experience.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280
Wow.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.280
That's true.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.280
You can take that to the bank.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280
What's a bank?

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.280
I've never heard of that.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280
Sharpie, sharpie gets one.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.280
Just don't mean a money changer.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.280
Can we bend over just to pick up the ring?

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280
Dwarves are celebrated bankers.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280
Yeah, yeah, you do.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280
All right, so we bend over and I pick up the ring.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.280
People have rings now.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.280
I pretend that I caught it with my finger.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.280
Thank you, Mulraine.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.280
I guess I could just read off other treasures if you want to just look for treasure.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280
We're still reading the book, right?

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.280
That's true, yeah, other than you caught the ring.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:57.280
Okay, I fashion a cart and pretend it's sharpie a drop and I just start running around our

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280
super market sweep.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.280
I just start super market sweeping it around the treasure chamber.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280
Okay.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.280
I tied two carts to my legs.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.280
It's going to slow you down though.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280
Sorry, thank you.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280
You find a magical liar of building.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280
I put that in the cart.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.280
The magical liar of building?

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280
A building, like a small liar.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.280
Like a musical instrument.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280
Yeah.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.280
Okay, what's in my bag of holding?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.280
Most of your stuff.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280
Dungeon snap.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280
No, that's just how it works.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.280
They hold a lot of stuff, so it's just most of your stuff's in it.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.280
Well, do you have any idea how much more shit I can put in it?

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280
A fair amount.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.280
I'd say it's less than half full.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.280
All right, well, I hand that off before I resume blood magic research.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.280
I give it to Peabody over there and say, hey, fill this up.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.280
Who's Peabody?

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.280
My friend.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.280
My lifelong friend.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280
Quark.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.280
Quark.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.280
I'm Peabody?

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280
Huh.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280
It's my nickname.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280
You're Peabody?

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280
Yeah.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.280
I also attempt to call him Peabody in order to affect more...

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280
Hey, Peabody.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280
What is it, snickerdoodles?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.280
That's not...

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.280
Call me Chris de Burgh.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280
In full.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.280
What is it, Chris de Burgh?

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.280
Peabody also do what you're doing for a quart.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.280
Only my friends can call me Peabody.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.280
And you know what?

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280
Okay, Peabody.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.280
You're my friend.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280
I knew it.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280
All right, so I do what he said.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280
That was heartwarming.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280
It really was.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280
I'm happy.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.280
You also find the goggles of minute seeing.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.280
Like binoculars?

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280
Well, no.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.280
I mean, they're like little goggles that strap on your head.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.280
They just see sand.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.280
I mean, you don't know what they just see until you put them on.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.280
I'm small. Can I have those?

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280
I don't want those.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.280
I don't want to crawl to the halls and do minute seeing.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.280
Yeah, I don't want that shit.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.280
Okay.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280
All right.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.280
Can I inspect magic on the dragon's horns?

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.280
Yeah, they're intensely magical and you feel as if they can be used to power up spells

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.280
or maybe make magical items or potions.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.280
Can I use that on the magic penis to see if it has anything?

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280
Wait, use what?

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.280
Whatever she used on the horns to find out how good they are?

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.280
Oh, yeah, you didn't detect magic.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.280
You just know that.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.280
I'm sorry.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280
Yeah, you can't detect magic, but yeah.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280
Sorry.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:28.280
So you can do that on the penis and that is also magical and less so than the horn,

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.280
but still magical.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.280
Fuck!

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.280
So it's less magical plus I have to hold a penis.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280
Yeah.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280
And it's pretty hefty.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.280
This is a heavy penis.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280
Yeah, it's a burden.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.280
So as far as the spells go, I don't know what spells are available for these horns.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.280
Can I use them to make everybody in the party like me a lot?

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280
Well, you don't know.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.280
You aren't actually like a proper wizard by today.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280
You're not a proper wizard.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.280
Truth.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.280
Dungeon Master.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.280
So how do I figure out what they're doing?

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.280
I just said what I am.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.280
That's not an insult.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.280
But it's exciting.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.280
No, it was awesome.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.280
Okay, thanks guys.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.280
Well, I was doing a bet.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280
I'm sorry guys.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280
I don't know what I can do with these horns.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.280
You'd have to talk to a wise sage or someone who knows much about dragons.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Is that me?

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280
No.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.280
Hey, it's not me.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.280
Would it be Sharpie or he's not a sage.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.280
He's a mage.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.280
Nah, you are a mage.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280
I mean, you know that.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.280
I mean, I only know how to kill him.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.280
Well, can I present the horns to Sharpie and maybe he'll have some ideas?

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.280
Yeah, definitely.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.280
Sharpie, you actually know.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280
Oh, oh, I should mention this.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280
You all level up.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:51.280
Yeah, I can't.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.280
I didn't have a cute up.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.280
But yeah, now that you're leveled up, you know, brew potion.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280
That's a feat you have now.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:06.280
So you know that dragons horns can be used to make potions more, you know, powerful.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.280
So like its effect would be heightened.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.280
Okay.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.280
So I present the horns to Sharpie.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.280
Hey, we're trying to read here.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.280
I'm just being a dick.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:31.280
I go around Charles Charles Berg, Christopher, sorry, and I present my horns to Sharpie

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.280
and I say, I don't, I don't know what to do.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.280
Do you know?

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280
No.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.280
I don't know what to do.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.280
I'm such a dumb little archer.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.280
I have no idea.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.280
What the fuck is going on?

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.280
I immediately get an erection.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.280
What is happening?

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.280
Is that weird?

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.280
So weird perversion of, you know, women think that men like dumb women.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:10.280
No, speaking of Celeste's thing at the end of King of the Nerds.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.280
Check it out guys.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:17.280
Anyway, I'm doing a parody, but I, oh do do do.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280
Total turn on.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280
Okay.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280
All right.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280
Hey bro, you, bro.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280
I redo that.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280
I redo that.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280
Sharpie.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280
Yes.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.280
I have in my possession two dragons horns.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.280
Put them in one of the bags.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.280
All right.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.280
First of all, don't tell me what to do.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280
Okay.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.280
Second of all, I'll put them in one of the, what did you say?

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.280
Bags.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280
Why?

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280
Are you able to measure them?

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280
Why is they contain things?

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280
What the fuck?

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.280
But I want you to tell me, I want you to tell me what they can do.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.280
I hear that you can tell me what they can do.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280
They make potions more strong.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.280
I pretend to read the book and not listen to the fight.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280
All right.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280
Hold on.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.280
Can I talk to your producer?

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280
I'm flummoxed by something.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:07.280
I want to stand atop the nearest mound of treasure and address my people.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.280
You ascend a pile of 25,000 gold pieces.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.280
Does anyone remember how we got here?

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
I remember.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280
Yes.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280
My dad needed something.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:25.280
We wanted to get treasure and fortune.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280
We got it, I think.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.280
No, we wanted to figure out what that soul thing was.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.280
What was that thing?

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280
The soul of growth.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.280
You were looking for the soul of growth.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280
Yeah, that's true.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280
The soul of growth.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.280
There was shards for a while.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.280
What have we become?

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280
Look at us.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.280
It's like a Stephen King novel.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.280
We are the monsters.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.280
We are the dragons.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.280
We've lost our minds.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.280
I thought everybody was going cool until that you poochie poochie poochie poochie.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.280
That was weird by any definition.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280
Yeah.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.280
It's not weird because Sharpie and I have had a romantic relationship and maybe that's

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280
our language.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.280
Maybe that's how we express sexuality to each other.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280
It's not weird.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.280
Sharpie didn't seem to be on board.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.280
I'm fine with it.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.280
You're right.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.280
I'm just trying.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.280
Let me try something else.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.280
Hey, I'm quirk.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:28.280
Are you interested in these horns?

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.280
Isn't he on top of the treasure pile now?

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.280
He's on top of the treasure pile.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280
He's up there.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.280
Can we take all this treasure and bone the fuck out?

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280
Yeah.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.280
That's always been an option.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.280
Let's get this loot and press forward.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.280
The solo growth is not going to grow itself or soul.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280
What the hell did we do?

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280
We wanted the solo growth.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.280
What was the solo growth of the dragon?

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.280
I left you guys because you guys were digging about in the woods and I said I'm going to

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.280
go try to become a better person and I sought out after this thing.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.280
Is this the place where the infinite fish landed?

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280
Yeah.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.280
We're not even on goddamn earth.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:09.280
What are we doing with our lives?

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.280
We got eaten by a fish.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.280
I have a script due.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.280
That's long since gone.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.280
We got dragon horns.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.280
We got all the money we can carry.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280
Now you guys can read that book.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.280
We can cast some spells.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.280
It's been a good day.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.280
It's been an okay day.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:39.280
Who's got swords all over her legs?

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.280
Let's take stock.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.280
Let's find the most likely exit and get down to biz.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.280
The exit of the solo growth.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:54.280
Then we have to exit the world that the infinite fish vomited and assigned to.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:59.280
I just wanted to know what was in the horns.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.280
If they make magic stronger, magic potion stronger.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.280
That's a bigger fish.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.280
Let's just leave this area.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.280
Stop freaking out.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.280
I'm sorry.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.280
I'm having adventure phobia.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280
I'm starting to feel like I'm...

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.280
I pretend like I'm asleep.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.280
Stop that.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.280
I strike out in the direction...

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.280
There's a light source, right?

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.280
I'm either one who knows where the soul of growth is.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.280
It's supposed to be in these ruins.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.280
Guys, yeah?

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.280
Haven't we explored all the ruins yet?

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.280
No.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.280
He's still treasure chopping.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.280
Why do you pretend this is a wedding and go for it?

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.280
Where do we go?

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.280
We've got to go back up because we've fallen down, right?

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.280
I sent the staircase to look for a doorway.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.280
You don't see a doorway.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.280
However, you do see a massive sarcophagus surrounded by more treasure than you haven't picked up yet.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.280
I opened the sarcophagus.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.280
Texas.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.280
Jesus Christ.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280
There could be a giant fucking mummy in there.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280
We just killed the dragon.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.280
We got horns.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.280
We got potions.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:24.280
None of that means that we want to fight a mummy now.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.280
Okay, I examine the writing.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.280
Is there any writing?

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.280
I should mention you're illiterate.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.280
But yeah, there's no writing.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.280
Ah, Jeff's nightmare.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.280
Welcome to Jeff's nightmare.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.280
Oh, it says no mummy here.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.280
Say the word Jeff.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280
Jeff.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.280
Who's Jeff?

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.280
No, no shit.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:58.280
I pointedly clear my throat and pull out a pair of prop glasses that I keep on me and put them on.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.280
And I examine the coffin.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280
Again, no writing.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.280
What?

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.280
Do coffins normally have writing on them?

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.280
We're not coffin experts.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280
Do you serve a coffin guy?

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.280
I wouldn't know.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.280
Hieroglyphs are technically writing.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280
What does this thing mean on it?

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.280
Woodstone obsidian?

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.280
I'd say obsidian.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.280
Are there any other doorways in this room that we're in?

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.280
No.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280
There was the one you came in.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280
All right, well, let's open this.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.280
I opened the coffin, the sarcophagus.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.280
Opening the sarcophagus, you see a bizarre sight.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.280
Resting in the coffin is a skeleton wrapped in plants.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.280
God damn it.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.280
Thin tendrils are wrapped around the body,

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.280
covering it in ivy leaves and small blossoms and flowers,

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.280
in all manner of strange foreign plants cover its body.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.280
On the breast of the skeleton is a perfectly spherical amber orb.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280
You can see that inside the orb is a strange plant

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.280
that is changing states between seeds, seedlings,

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.280
tree and flower.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.280
The inside of the orb is always shifting,

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.280
and if you touch it, you get the sense of vitality.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.280
The salt of growth.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.280
I literally got chills down my spine.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.280
Just unironically excited.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280
Oh, stick or doodle.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.280
Okay, that's not, it's not catching on.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.280
Nobody's on board.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.280
Okay, that's another whiff.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.280
I say Sharpie.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.280
You're kind of the Hannibal of this A-Team.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.280
Why don't you go up there and play the right song

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:32.280
when I pick it up?

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280
I pick it up.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280
You pick it up.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.280
You feel nature's magnificence filling you.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:46.280
It's obviously a powerful artifact.

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.280
You get the sense that it's the soul of growth or something.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.280
It swirls like well water in my head.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.280
But if I focus, I can feel it.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.280
A million thoughts of a million people calling out.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.280
Hi.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.280
Hi.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.280
D&D Cliffhanger.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.280
Hi.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.280
Thank you, Genevieve.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.280
Thank you, Erin McGathy.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.280
Kumail Nanjiani.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.280
Spencer Crittin.

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280
One more time.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.280
We did it.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:29.280
We found the soul of growth.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.280
Yeah, we don't want to go down the road of picking and choosing,

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.280
but I'm going to say worst D&D chapter ever.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.280
No, that was a shitfest.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.280
Just by any metric.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.280
If you measure it by how much we got done, zero.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.280
Nothing.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.280
We hung out.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.280
We went shopping.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.280
Nothing happened.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.280
It was like watching, I imagine,

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.280
like watching Desperate Housewives or whatever you call it,

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.280
like the Real Housewives of Orange County or whatever.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.280
Usually people say we look for treasure

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.280
and I say the names of the treasure

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.280
and people don't interrupt me

01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.280
and I finish explaining all the treasure.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.280
Oh, baby, I'm not, that's not a critique on you.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280
I know, no, I don't think it is.

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280
It's a critique on us.

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.280
If you want more things to happen.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.280
Oh, no, no, baby, baby.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.280
That's not, that's not, everyone knows

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.280
that you're good at what you do.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280
I'm trying to help.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.280
No, well, John, I mean, we're unhelpable.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280
We're the worst.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280
Sometimes we're just...

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280
That was madness.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280
I still enjoy it, just to be clear for everyone.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280
I love this.

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.280
I think it's okay.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.280
Like my friend Neil Goldman used to say on Community,

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.280
like, ah, a bad piece of pizza is still pizza.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280
Not so good to say.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.280
You know, you read the Onion A.V. review,

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280
and you go, eh, whatever.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.280
Still an episode of Community.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.280
Yeah, I mean, after playing D&D a million times,

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280
I'm still intimidated.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.280
I'm going to do something wrong in some way,

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280
but it was still...

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.280
Well, I assume you're over that anxiety now.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.280
I think we've all leapt headlong over that.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.280
Well, no, I still feel like I'm going to fuck shit up.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.280
Even when I do something bold, like open a sarcophagus,

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280
everybody freaks out and tells me I'm a bad person.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280
That's just me.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280
I'm a chicken.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.280
I just want to look at things.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280
Can I speak to that?

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.280
Is that you're from an age in which D&D was very much about torturing

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.280
players by the Dungeon Masters.

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.280
Like, you'd walk into the room and the door would eat you,

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.280
and if you kill the door, then the floor will try and strangle you.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.280
And if you do that, there's a treasure chest,

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.280
and if you open that, it'll bite your face off.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280
Like, that's literally how it goes.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.280
So it makes a lot of sense that your, like, style is very cautious.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.280
Well, you're acting like it's like a generational thing.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280
It is.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280
No, no.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.280
For 25 years, after the spin doctors, we started like...

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.280
You walk up to an owl bear, and you're like,

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.280
fuck you, what are you, an owl or a bear?

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.280
A lot of those monsters, like, there's a thing that was a tree stump

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.280
with a rabbit on it, but if you approached it, it would eat you.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.280
Yeah, like, those got phased out because they weren't fun.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280
They were just tortures.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280
That's interesting.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.280
I didn't know that.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.280
So, like, Gary Gygax loved that shit.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.280
So, but, I mean, as the game evolved, it got involved.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.280
You know, I talked to him on the phone.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280
No.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.280
Is he dead?

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.280
I think, yeah, he's dead.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280
He's...

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280
Yeah.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280
I talked to him on the phone once.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280
Yeah, I...

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280
Rob Schrab made a comic book called Skud the Disposable Assassin.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.280
When I was...

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.280
It's great.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:16.280
When I was your age, young man, we had a...

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.280
We did an issue, the comic book, that was, like, a special, like, Skud went to D&D World

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.280
for an issue, and we wanted to have the cover be, like...

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280
And I had...

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280
I talked to...

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280
We were looking for a specific artist.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.280
The guy was his name.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280
Teasley?

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280
Beasley?

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280
Easley.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280
Yeah.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280
We wanted to...

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.280
The old school, like, first edition Dungeon Masters guide.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.280
Like, we wanted that style of oil painting for the cover of the thing.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.280
And the only guy that had that guy's number was Gary Gygax, and I had to talk to him on

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.280
the phone and just talk to him for a little bit, and then I think he died a week later.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.280
I don't know.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.280
Also, you know who else died?

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.280
Kenwa Akibe.

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.280
Author.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.280
Oh.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280
He's dead.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.280
He's another guy that I've been bringing up lately.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.280
Who should I bring up tonight, like, randomly?

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.280
I think half of the members of Enigma are gonna...

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280
Are in trouble.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.280
There's gonna be a weird, private jet crash.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280
Alright, so Harmon, 50...
