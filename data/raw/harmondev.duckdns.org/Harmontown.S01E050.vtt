{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.960\nHello Meltdown. How are you tonight? Just as I expected. Guess what? Harmontown is\n\n00:25.960 --> 00:37.400\nsession, but not just any Harmontown. This is our 50th episode. Wow. It seems like only\n\n00:37.400 --> 00:43.600\nyesterday for the very first time I announced the mayor of Harmontown. Welcome to the stage for the\n\n00:43.600 --> 01:13.160\n50th time. Dan Harmon. Your comptroller, Jeff Davis. Wow. 49, 49 times before now. I never thank\n\n01:13.160 --> 01:17.840\nyou enough. Thank you. You thank me simply by being my friend, Dan. That's all I need from you.\n\n01:17.840 --> 01:24.240\nThat's good. That's good to know. All right. Please, ma'am, would you please have a seat. It's my\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:31.400\ngirlfriend. Always late. How many episodes in was your girlfriend, do you think? I have a terrible\n\n01:31.400 --> 01:39.840\nmemory. Not for all 50 for sure. No way, right? Oh, so this is not 50 Harmontown. It's 50 podcast\n\n01:39.840 --> 01:47.600\nepisodes. Yeah, we've been doing this for 17 years. Yeah. Yeah, there was a whole phantom zone. We\n\n01:47.600 --> 01:52.320\nstill have like all these things. We kept we keep threatening to release like archives of the old\n\n01:52.320 --> 01:58.480\nrecordings before we even thought this would be a podcast. Yeah, but we sound all young. And we'd be\n\n01:58.480 --> 02:04.920\ntalking about Beetlejuice. We still talk about Beetlejuice. Back then, we were talking about it\n\n02:04.920 --> 02:10.400\nbecause it was just about to come out though. We got we got a lot of stuff to do. Hey, oh, here's\n\n02:10.400 --> 02:18.120\nitem number one on the docket. I'm assuming I wouldn't ask this of any other audience. I feel like\n\n02:18.120 --> 02:23.960\nif there's 100 people here, the answer might be as a 2% chance of being yes. Does anyone have a\n\n02:23.960 --> 02:32.760\nfive hour energy? Okay, all right. Does anyone have a 20-sided die? Yes. Okay, see, all right. It's\n\n02:32.760 --> 02:38.920\nstill my crowd. Still my crowd. Yeah, I'm feeling a little sluggish, but I'm going to force a manic\n\n02:38.920 --> 02:43.080\nbehavior. I listened to the episodes. Jeff, I like the ones where I'm manic. I don't like the\n\n02:43.080 --> 02:47.240\ndepressive ones. Why don't we send somebody off to the liquor store down the road and get them?\n\n02:47.240 --> 02:50.440\nThey'll miss the show. They come here and they want to see it, but that portion of the show is\n\n02:50.440 --> 03:00.080\ngoing to be shitty. The depressive portion. Yeah. Wow. Wait, come up here, Sarah. Come up here. A\n\n03:00.080 --> 03:07.400\ngentleman just came on stage, handed Dan what he referred to as an off-brand five hour energy. Is\n\n03:07.400 --> 03:11.280\nthat why you didn't say yes when I asked for a five hour energy? I wasn't sure if I had in my bag,\n\n03:11.280 --> 03:15.480\nbecause I just flew and I wasn't sure if I had it in there. What's your name, Sarah? I'm Chris\n\n03:15.480 --> 03:22.920\nDunford. Chris Dunford, all right. Fake name. Totally my real name. Justin Town to do some\n\n03:22.920 --> 03:38.600\nraping and using my ID from Denmark. This is Grape Kirkland energy shot. Should we do a commercial\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:48.000\nfor it? Grape Kirkland energy shot. The number one energy drink among anonymous rapists. Hi. That's\n\n03:48.000 --> 04:02.080\na fact. I'm not like Baldwin for what's it called? Grape Kirkland energy shot. For real? Yeah. Dan's\n\n04:02.080 --> 04:06.560\ntrying it. Does it taste just as shit as five hour energy? Yeah, it tastes better. That means it's\n\n04:06.560 --> 04:13.560\nprobably working less. It tastes good. Yeah, this only lasts at this point 20 minutes and then I'll\n\n04:13.560 --> 04:21.040\ndrop dead. I keep compiling these. I've adopted these in place of Adderall. Street Adderall. And\n\n04:21.040 --> 04:26.840\nwhat was your name again? Barry Dunflings? Chris Dunford. Chris Dunford. And where do you hail\n\n04:26.840 --> 04:35.800\nfrom, Chris? I'm from Boston area. Yeah. Yeah. And what brings you out to Harmontown? Well,\n\n04:35.800 --> 04:43.200\nmy grandma's 80th birthday this week. It sounds so fake. It sounds so fake. Not a trace of a Boston\n\n04:43.200 --> 04:49.080\naccent. Chris Dunford from Boston. It's my grandma's 80th birthday. I enjoy potatoes and\n\n04:49.080 --> 04:56.840\nskateboarding. I swear to God, I'm not working for area 51. I can neither confirm or deny that.\n\n04:56.840 --> 05:06.280\nSo your grandmother passed away in Los Angeles? No, she's 80 today. She did the opposite of\n\n05:06.280 --> 05:09.920\npassed away. She lived for 80 years. Unless things have changed. Guys, I brought you a lot of\n\n05:09.920 --> 05:14.200\nColombo. I was trying to catch him in a line. One more thing. What's your grandma's funeral?\n\n05:14.200 --> 05:21.400\nOh, Tuesday. I don't know why I said, you know, Chris, one thing bothers me. If she's 80, why are\n\n05:21.400 --> 05:28.720\nyou burying her? No, I'm not passing it. Although one thing alarms me. I think I drank one of\n\n05:28.720 --> 05:33.240\nthese three hours ago. For real? Let's see what happens. But a different brand. Different brands.\n\n05:33.240 --> 05:43.360\nIt's okay. Yeah, you can mix. So Chris, you're visiting from Boston to see your still alive\n\n05:43.360 --> 05:49.640\n80 year old grandmother. That is correct. Yes. That you plan on murdering soon. Right now,\n\n05:49.640 --> 05:55.440\nis she being killed by Ray Malend? And this is to establish your alibi? This is all about alibi\n\n05:55.440 --> 05:58.960\nestablishment, isn't it? That would have been a really good idea, actually. But no, I don't believe\n\n05:58.960 --> 06:01.760\nso. I've been watching too much Colombo, you guys. What was the movie I just saw? It was a\n\n06:01.760 --> 06:08.040\nKevin Costner movie, Mr. Collins. What was this? Mr. Brooks, yeah. Like, what if the way he looked\n\n06:08.040 --> 06:11.320\nright now was all an elaborate disguise? Like, underneath that, he's Seth Rogen, and he's gonna...\n\n06:11.320 --> 06:19.040\nKevin Costner, like, at one point, to get his daughter out of a murder charge, he boards a\n\n06:19.040 --> 06:23.840\nplane, puts on a fake goatee, and has kind of a long mullet wig and a denim jacket, goes and\n\n06:23.840 --> 06:29.120\nhatchet murders someone, comes back. Spoilers. Yeah, I was about to say. Spoiler alert on that.\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:36.320\nHey, here's another general spoiler. If Kevin Costner's in it, oh boy. Careful. Bull Doron,\n\n06:36.320 --> 06:41.920\nman. Bull Doron's a clown. Bull Doron was a clown. Tin Cup. Tin Cup is a goodie. Yeah. I just,\n\n06:41.920 --> 06:46.440\nI finally saw it. I finally saw it. Yeah. We had a little Kevin Costner marathon. It's a golf\n\n06:46.440 --> 06:52.040\nmovie with Kevin Costner and Renee Rousseau. There's no way you're gonna like that movie. That's\n\n06:52.040 --> 06:56.520\ngot everything. There's no way you're gonna watch it. No, no. Here's the thing. It's profound.\n\n06:56.520 --> 07:01.280\nIt's all about... Don Johnson is an awesome bad guy in it. Don Johnson's agents in the audience.\n\n07:01.280 --> 07:08.480\nThat's the third time he's said that tonight. He just finished saying it at a pizzeria down\n\n07:08.480 --> 07:15.400\nthe street. Here's your pepperoni. You forgot about Don Johnson. Hey, look, I'm not paid to\n\n07:15.400 --> 07:28.480\nremember him. It's a profound sports movie. It's not a good movie in a strictest sense.\n\n07:28.480 --> 07:32.600\nWell, it's Kevin Costner's movie. I love the position you've been put in. You're sitting here\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:40.600\nnodding about Tin Cup. I just love the homogeneity of the people we bring on stage. Any one of you\n\n07:40.600 --> 07:51.920\ncould be harmony. Chris, how was your trip to Los Angeles? Was it wicked retarded? Hold my wicked\n\n07:51.920 --> 07:59.760\nhand. Don't be retarded. Come in. My grandma's actually not from Boston. Oh, okay. I was born\n\n07:59.760 --> 08:08.240\nin LA, but... All right. Well, okay. Throw me out of the bus. Tin Cup's fucking good, Chris. Chris,\n\n08:08.240 --> 08:20.280\nis it Chris? It's a philosophically profound sports movie. It comes down to going for it or\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:26.280\nlaying up. I really identified with the Kevin Costner character. He loves going for it. He's\n\n08:26.280 --> 08:31.760\nself-destructive. He's impulsive. I can't spoil the movie. You have to watch the whole thing.\n\n08:31.760 --> 08:36.200\nRight when it comes down to that last moment when he's in the US Open. Don't spoil it for real.\n\n08:36.200 --> 08:41.080\nI defy you, too, if you've never seen that movie, to write the end of that movie better than they\n\n08:41.080 --> 08:45.520\nwrite the end of that movie. I defy you to write a sports movie and try to get your way around the\n\n08:45.520 --> 08:50.000\nidea that in the third act of a sports movie, either the people that you love have to win or\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.720\nlose. And if they lose, it's a fucking bad movie because you love them, so why would they lose?\n\n08:54.720 --> 08:58.800\nOr they have to win, in which case it's a shitty movie because you knew they were going to win.\n\n08:58.800 --> 09:07.160\nThere's only a couple movies that get around that, and obviously Teen Wolf is one. Are you\n\n09:07.160 --> 09:15.480\nsaying Teen Wolf is mostly a basketball film? It definitely is. How many minutes of that movie\n\n09:15.480 --> 09:20.400\nare spent with anyone being a werewolf? Well, all the basketball minutes, and then some other ones,\n\n09:20.400 --> 09:28.400\ntoo. A lion's share of that movie is basketball. It doesn't matter. Who cares? It's hitting me.\n\n09:28.400 --> 09:35.080\nI saw a tweet today, a fun fact that Kirkland County's with of Grape Shot is hitting me.\n\n09:35.080 --> 09:40.160\nSomebody fun fact that on Twitter that Space Jam that we really got into last week is the number\n\n09:40.160 --> 09:50.360\none basketball film of all time. By what metric? Money? By your precious money? I don't doubt it.\n\n09:50.360 --> 10:00.080\nIt's certainly box office. When you pull together all the fucking duckets, like exchange, plush\n\n10:00.080 --> 10:07.120\nBugs Bunny's holding basketballs on Universal City Walk. Who cares? It's vile. It's a vile\n\n10:07.120 --> 10:20.280\npractice. Make a good movie. Gene Hackman from Hoosiers is here tonight. I thought that was my,\n\n10:20.280 --> 10:28.840\nwhat's the guy from the Scrooge story? Jacob Marley? I thought I could only hear that clav.\n\n10:28.840 --> 10:38.040\nIt's my dad in the back. Way to go, Harmon. Way to let Space Jam have it. This is what your\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:51.040\ncareers come to. Sticking it to Space Jam. We got a lot to do. What's your name, Curtis?\n\n10:51.040 --> 10:56.440\nArmstrong? Look. Some like that. Carl. Carl. Carl's bad, Kevin? Chris Dunford. Chris Dunford.\n\n10:56.440 --> 11:03.200\nThank you so much for giving me a shot of Kirkland's energy now infused with grape. It says\n\n11:03.200 --> 11:14.920\ndown here 10%, 10% less MSG. 2% of all proceeds go to the defense of the perimeter of our compound\n\n11:14.920 --> 11:26.320\nby the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Huh. Chris Humford,\n\n11:26.320 --> 11:31.760\nRobin, everybody. Can I say one thing real quick? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Say whatever you\n\n11:31.760 --> 11:35.240\nwant. Since she's in the audience, Genevieve, you got robbed. You should have been the King of the\n\n11:35.240 --> 11:39.560\nNerd. Oh yeah. That's foreshadowing. Genevieve, you got robbed. Remember that phrase. Sorry about\n\n11:39.560 --> 11:50.640\nthat. Chris Humford. Thank you, brother. Well, that was a good segue. I think Chris made an\n\n11:50.640 --> 11:53.640\nappropriate segue. The reason he said that is because there's someone in the audience that I\n\n11:53.640 --> 11:57.800\ninvited down to the show. But I don't want to do what I usually do, which is we bring up a guest\n\n11:57.800 --> 12:02.160\nand then I spend so much time talking that people get uncomfortable because the person's\n\n12:02.160 --> 12:08.200\nsitting there. So let me just say a few things about why we're having her up here. Last night,\n\n12:08.200 --> 12:11.920\nand you promised when she gets up here, she's going to do all the talking. It's going to be a\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:17.960\nfucking cold ass interview, man. Cool as a cucumber, man. You're going to be like,\n\n12:17.960 --> 12:29.720\nis Carson's ghost leaving his... Well, you'll figure it out. You'll figure out how to express your\n\n12:29.720 --> 12:36.280\nwonderment. I don't think I should have had that five hours ago. Dan, you don't look so good.\n\n12:36.280 --> 12:42.000\nWhat are articles about it killing teenagers or something? Yeah, yeah. I'm going to die. It was\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:48.760\ninvented by the Viet Cong. You know, all the things we thought would kill me. It'll be weird.\n\n12:48.760 --> 12:56.320\nAn assassin with a fake name comes on stage and gives you some homemade shit with a fake\n\n12:56.320 --> 13:05.880\nlabel on a re... Kirkland. When he left, he's gone. The guy actually is not here anymore.\n\n13:05.880 --> 13:12.680\nYeah, he's not here. And he has a fake name. Hold on a second. Whoa, dear Christ. Harmon accidentally\n\n13:12.680 --> 13:23.400\ntook a shirt off and now is committed to the bit. What is going on? Dan, you know what? You look 50\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:33.000\nepisodes thinner. Thank you. It's just a little hot from energy. I think it's increased blood flow\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:43.800\nin your capillary network. You might be in some need of medical assistance. I think I was before\n\n13:43.800 --> 13:49.440\nand I finally got it. This is what it feels like to be alive. I'm just waking up. I'm like Robert\n\n13:49.440 --> 13:55.440\nDeNiro in Awakening. I'm like, whoa, whoa, popsicles are interesting. Freaking out. Put me back. Put\n\n13:55.440 --> 14:06.520\nme back. Let's bring her up. You haven't said anything about it. You intend to use your\n\n14:06.520 --> 14:22.280\ncracky, fake, generic energy drink brain to fucking never let her get a word in. I'm teeing up a\n\n14:22.280 --> 14:29.200\ntheatrical moment. I'm observing the, you know. All right. So last night, Erin McGathy, my girlfriend,\n\n14:29.200 --> 14:38.760\nand live-in lover. I don't know why she landed on this. She landed on this TBS series, this\n\n14:38.760 --> 14:44.520\nreality show called King of the Nerds. It's a reality show. It's very, very straight up the\n\n14:44.520 --> 14:49.800\nmiddle structurally. It exactly follows the template of every reality show. But finally,\n\n14:49.800 --> 14:56.320\ninstead of like, who's the hottest? What's up with titties? Who wants to marry a midget? Suck a\n\n14:56.320 --> 15:05.320\nnut. Joe Middle Road. It's like all variations on the people that you hang out with at your\n\n15:05.320 --> 15:11.600\ntenure reunion. Like, what if they got to write a show? Well, there would be no writers. We'd do\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:18.840\nthat thing. Remember the mall that went down? Oh, the mall. Friendliest mall. Eliminations. It was\n\n15:18.840 --> 15:24.000\ninteresting because it's like, it's nerds. They literally, they called it King of the Nerds. They\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:29.720\ngathered what they claim to be like the best of the nerds of the country. They eliminate one,\n\n15:29.720 --> 15:37.120\nperhaps a standard reality show. Do they answer the question, what's up with titties? I'm ignoring\n\n15:37.120 --> 15:45.120\nthat. A manic. A manic from the energy. You're fucking losing your cool. This is what we wanted.\n\n15:45.120 --> 15:51.440\nIt's hosted and it was executive produced, so I think they probably took it out and pitched it,\n\n15:51.440 --> 15:56.640\nwhich makes me feel a lot better about it. Curtis Armstrong, a.k.a. Booger from Revenge of the\n\n15:56.640 --> 16:02.040\nNerds and Robert Carradine, a.k.a. Lewis, was that his name? Yeah, from Revenge of the Nerds. The\n\n16:02.040 --> 16:07.160\nmain nerd. It's hosted and executive produced by them and then they gather these nerds and they\n\n16:07.160 --> 16:11.920\nhave nerd competitions and they eliminate nerds. So, but here's the interesting thing about it\n\n16:11.920 --> 16:20.080\nto me. So, I sit in bed with, last night with my girlfriend. She surfs through the ether sphere.\n\n16:20.080 --> 16:28.160\nShe finds this show, King of the Nerds, we watch in the span of three and a half hours,\n\n16:28.160 --> 16:32.120\nwe watch the entire eight episode run of the first season. We watch the entire thing. We got\n\n16:32.120 --> 16:35.960\nnothing to do. It's Sunday night. Fuck it. I sit there and play Minecraft while I'm watching it.\n\n16:35.960 --> 16:41.040\nWe watch the whole thing and at the end of it, we're like, oh, I hope that girl wins. Like,\n\n16:41.040 --> 16:49.280\noh, she didn't win. Spoilers. And then Erin goes, oh, she's following you on Twitter. I tweet her,\n\n16:49.280 --> 16:53.520\nhey, me and Erin think you should have won. Oh, thank you. Hey, if you're ever in LA by a drink,\n\n16:53.520 --> 16:57.320\nhey, I live in the valley. Hey, you want to be on my show? Okay, yeah, see you tomorrow night.\n\n16:57.320 --> 17:05.080\nIn the span of 12 hours, this is either Rupert Murdoch's greatest nightmare or his master plan.\n\n17:05.080 --> 17:11.800\nI can't figure out which, but I know that reality has changed and I know that it has nothing to\n\n17:11.800 --> 17:15.640\ndo with reality television, but the television is being made differently, consumed differently.\n\n17:15.640 --> 17:22.840\nIt's interesting. My agent didn't call her agent. She's a fantasy author. She was one of the nerds.\n\n17:22.840 --> 17:28.240\nShe made it all the way almost to the very end and really, really had an incredible, interesting\n\n17:28.240 --> 17:34.280\nhero's journey. You can buy her books and stuff. We'll let her plug them when she comes up here.\n\n17:34.280 --> 17:44.480\nThis is my introduction of her. Roses are red. Guests are blue. Please welcome Genevieve Pearson.\n\n17:44.480 --> 17:49.880\nHello.\n\n17:49.880 --> 17:56.280\nHello.\n\n17:56.280 --> 18:00.280\nSorry, I had an energy drink and then I had another one.\n\n18:00.280 --> 18:04.280\nI noticed that. That's like me on my seventh Diet Coke. Yeah.\n\n18:04.280 --> 18:09.280\nYou just reached this tipping point where everything goes by in a blur.\n\n18:09.280 --> 18:16.280\nSo, and help yourself to, yeah, help yourself to vodka.\n\n18:16.280 --> 18:23.280\nSo, all right, there's a million questions I want to ask you. We'll probably have to get it down to like eight.\n\n18:23.280 --> 18:25.280\nI want to talk about...\n\n18:25.280 --> 18:29.280\nI don't see why we can't do a million. That seems logically feasible to me.\n\n18:29.280 --> 18:34.280\nWhat a nerd.\n\n18:34.280 --> 18:36.280\nAn infinite dimension.\n\n18:36.280 --> 18:40.280\nTo me, on the top of my line, I'm sure there's people in the audience who actually watched season one of this show\n\n18:40.280 --> 18:46.280\nand actually would have a million questions about, what's up with Alana? What's up with so-and-so?\n\n18:46.280 --> 18:52.280\nI think the most important thing to talk about, because I've never really talked to someone intimately\n\n18:52.280 --> 18:56.280\nthat went through this whole sausage factory called Reality Television,\n\n18:56.280 --> 19:00.280\nwhich for now, it's going on 20 years. We've developed this thing.\n\n19:00.280 --> 19:04.280\nBut I feel like I have to give you a specific question about it.\n\n19:04.280 --> 19:06.280\nI can't just go, hey, talk about...\n\n19:06.280 --> 19:11.280\nTake us from the mouth to the anus of this monster through eight episodes.\n\n19:11.280 --> 19:13.280\nBut, okay, well, here's a specific question.\n\n19:13.280 --> 19:15.280\nHow long does it take from...\n\n19:15.280 --> 19:22.280\nSo, you show up, like, is it like boot camp where you bring luggage and you show up and...\n\n19:22.280 --> 19:27.280\nYeah, so what happened with me is I found out I was in the top 16 and only 11 people are going to go on the show.\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:32.280\nBut you have to show up for the final audition with everything as though you are going on the show.\n\n19:32.280 --> 19:36.280\nAnd so they spend a weekend in what I call, we all called, hotel jail.\n\n19:36.280 --> 19:39.280\nYou don't see anybody. You don't interact with anyone.\n\n19:39.280 --> 19:43.280\nIf you go around, you have to wear a blindfold because they don't want you to run into another contestant.\n\n19:43.280 --> 19:45.280\nYou can't have any clue what's going on.\n\n19:45.280 --> 19:48.280\nWait, what is the... I don't understand the reasoning for that.\n\n19:48.280 --> 19:53.280\nBecause they don't want to spoil the surprise and they want everything to be genuine while you're doing your final audition.\n\n19:53.280 --> 19:57.280\nWhat's the surprise at that point when there's 16 people and five of them aren't going to be on the show?\n\n19:57.280 --> 19:59.280\nWhat could they possibly spoil?\n\n19:59.280 --> 20:01.280\nThey...\n\n20:01.280 --> 20:02.280\nThat curtain is on.\n\n20:02.280 --> 20:04.280\nArmstrong is walking around the hallway.\n\n20:04.280 --> 20:08.280\nWell, they just don't want you to know who else is going to be on the show.\n\n20:08.280 --> 20:09.280\nPeriod.\n\n20:09.280 --> 20:11.280\nThey want you coming in very blind.\n\n20:11.280 --> 20:14.280\nThey want the genuine emotion that you have when you first meet somebody.\n\n20:14.280 --> 20:15.280\nOh, okay.\n\n20:15.280 --> 20:20.280\nIf you already met them and had formed an opinion, even if it was just happening in the hallway.\n\n20:20.280 --> 20:22.280\nThat's what they're going for.\n\n20:22.280 --> 20:29.280\nThat was the first weekend and then from there, you don't have any contact with anybody you know or love.\n\n20:29.280 --> 20:32.280\nYour husband, who we just met before the show, Paul.\n\n20:32.280 --> 20:33.280\nPaul?\n\n20:33.280 --> 20:36.280\nAt a certain point, he goes into shadow lock.\n\n20:36.280 --> 20:38.280\nHe's sequestered like a jury.\n\n20:38.280 --> 20:44.280\nHe left me at the hotel and that's the last he heard from me until I was done with the entire show.\n\n20:44.280 --> 20:46.280\nWhich is what span of time?\n\n20:46.280 --> 20:47.280\nOne full month.\n\n20:47.280 --> 20:48.280\nWow.\n\n20:48.280 --> 20:49.280\nThat's crazy.\n\n20:49.280 --> 20:53.280\nSo one month with no contact with the outside world at all.\n\n20:53.280 --> 20:56.280\nNo, you're not allowed to tweet text, email.\n\n20:56.280 --> 20:59.280\nNo internet, no email, no nothing.\n\n20:59.280 --> 21:01.280\nDo they confiscate your...\n\n21:01.280 --> 21:03.280\nYes, they confiscated all of our electronic devices.\n\n21:03.280 --> 21:04.280\nJust like living in the 20th century.\n\n21:04.280 --> 21:07.280\nThey took my candle.\n\n21:07.280 --> 21:10.280\nThey took my candle and I just about cried, I thought.\n\n21:10.280 --> 21:12.280\nThey took your candle?\n\n21:12.280 --> 21:14.280\nThere's no way to...\n\n21:14.280 --> 21:16.280\nNo, they thought maybe I could hack it.\n\n21:16.280 --> 21:18.280\nYou could hack it because you're a nerd, right?\n\n21:18.280 --> 21:20.280\nThat makes sense.\n\n21:20.280 --> 21:23.280\nWe're going to have to crack down on these N-words.\n\n21:23.280 --> 21:26.280\nNerds, nerds.\n\n21:26.280 --> 21:33.280\nJust because it starts with N doesn't mean you can't say it.\n\n21:33.280 --> 21:41.280\nI love N-word Reagan, the first lady during the 80s.\n\n21:41.280 --> 21:43.280\nShe was a nice one.\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:47.280\nAnd she's one of the nice ones, but by that I mean first ladies.\n\n21:47.280 --> 21:50.280\nHow did you not win the show?\n\n21:50.280 --> 21:53.280\nI'm saying to her, how did you not win?\n\n21:53.280 --> 21:56.280\nWell, because at the end of it...\n\n21:56.280 --> 21:58.280\nAnd I'm sorry, this interview is going to involve spoilers.\n\n21:58.280 --> 22:00.280\nYou can't just go watch...\n\n22:00.280 --> 22:01.280\nAre you allowed to do that?\n\n22:01.280 --> 22:02.280\nCan you talk about the show on a podcast?\n\n22:02.280 --> 22:04.280\nIt's already aired.\n\n22:04.280 --> 22:08.280\nThe reason is because they did it survivor style where it gets down to the last two people\n\n22:08.280 --> 22:14.280\nand the final decision is based on popular vote among the people that have all lost.\n\n22:14.280 --> 22:17.280\nThey all come back and they all go, remember me, sucker?\n\n22:17.280 --> 22:25.280\nAnd then they, you know, it's come on, it's unfair because you went to three, like, nerd offs.\n\n22:25.280 --> 22:26.280\nNerd offs, yeah.\n\n22:26.280 --> 22:33.280\nWhich is like the, you know, that's like the dog pit where you send people that you hope get eliminated\n\n22:33.280 --> 22:35.280\nto rip out the throats.\n\n22:35.280 --> 22:37.280\nIt's like the gladiator battle of the death.\n\n22:37.280 --> 22:44.280\nAnd so three times she was sent there and three times you watch her have to cope with areas outside her\n\n22:44.280 --> 22:46.280\nnerd expertise and kind of adapt.\n\n22:46.280 --> 22:48.280\nAnd it's very, very lovable.\n\n22:48.280 --> 22:55.280\nAnd there's a great, my favorite moment of the show of the first season is after the debate\n\n22:55.280 --> 22:59.280\nwhere you did a fantastic job of debating.\n\n22:59.280 --> 23:03.280\nThey had a competition where they had to debate about comic book characters.\n\n23:03.280 --> 23:13.280\nAnd Genevieve shut down this guy that, you know, like he accidentally called Frank Miller John Miller\n\n23:13.280 --> 23:14.280\nor something like that.\n\n23:14.280 --> 23:15.280\nYou corrected him.\n\n23:15.280 --> 23:16.280\nFirst of all, it's Frank Miller.\n\n23:16.280 --> 23:19.280\nBut your argument was more cogent.\n\n23:19.280 --> 23:21.280\nIt was more deserving of win.\n\n23:21.280 --> 23:27.280\nKevin Smith, who was one of the celebrity judges, goes like, first of all, you got to give props to a chick\n\n23:27.280 --> 23:29.280\nwho can shut a guy down and call him Frank Miller.\n\n23:29.280 --> 23:34.280\nBut at the same time, you know, you know, got to give it to him.\n\n23:34.280 --> 23:35.280\nHe edged you out.\n\n23:35.280 --> 23:43.280\nAt a distant point, like Genevieve, her face is in a pillow.\n\n23:43.280 --> 23:45.280\nHer head's not on camera.\n\n23:45.280 --> 23:46.280\nAll you can see is her hair.\n\n23:46.280 --> 23:47.280\nAfterwards, by the way.\n\n23:47.280 --> 23:50.280\nAnd two fellow contestants sitting on her bed.\n\n23:50.280 --> 23:53.280\nAnd you just see Genevieve's head buried in a pillow.\n\n23:53.280 --> 23:58.280\nAnd it has to be subtitled because it's a sob ease.\n\n23:58.280 --> 24:07.280\nAnd the subtitles say, stupid Kevin Smith.\n\n24:07.280 --> 24:13.280\nAnd then sob, sob, and then I thought he was supposed to be cool.\n\n24:13.280 --> 24:16.280\nIt's so great, so human.\n\n24:16.280 --> 24:21.280\nAnd it's so much more merciful to him than he was to you because, I mean, you can't follow up.\n\n24:21.280 --> 24:25.280\nYou got to give props to a chick with not giving her the point.\n\n24:25.280 --> 24:29.280\nBecause otherwise that's sexist because you just said, you saw her as a chick.\n\n24:29.280 --> 24:31.280\nShe has to win.\n\n24:31.280 --> 24:34.280\nYou have to, if you say, good job, Toots.\n\n24:34.280 --> 24:37.280\nAnd it's backed me on the ass.\n\n24:37.280 --> 24:40.280\nYou can't follow it up with, but I love guys.\n\n24:40.280 --> 24:43.280\nLike, you can barely get away with it.\n\n24:43.280 --> 24:44.280\nGood job, Toots.\n\n24:44.280 --> 24:45.280\nYou got moxie.\n\n24:45.280 --> 24:46.280\nYou're hired.\n\n24:46.280 --> 24:49.280\nYou know, you've got to, we've at least gotten there.\n\n24:49.280 --> 24:51.280\nWas he still wearing that douchey hockey jersey that he's always wearing?\n\n24:51.280 --> 24:52.280\nOh, yes he was.\n\n24:52.280 --> 24:53.280\nYeah, so.\n\n24:53.280 --> 24:59.280\nHey, hockey jersey.\n\n24:59.280 --> 25:01.280\nThat's enigma.\n\n25:01.280 --> 25:04.280\nReturn to innocence.\n\n25:04.280 --> 25:06.280\nThat's been on your mind lately.\n\n25:06.280 --> 25:09.280\nI love that song.\n\n25:09.280 --> 25:11.280\nOkay, so a month.\n\n25:11.280 --> 25:22.280\nAnd how much do you get paid while you're working for a month off the grid while your husband may or may not get 9-11?\n\n25:22.280 --> 25:25.280\nAnd you wouldn't be allowed to know.\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:26.280\nWe wouldn't.\n\n25:26.280 --> 25:27.280\nBecause it's not on your Kindle.\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:29.280\nAnd even if it was, you're not even allowed to see it there.\n\n25:29.280 --> 25:31.280\nYeah, we couldn't contact anyone.\n\n25:31.280 --> 25:33.280\nOkay, so I'm not, I have an NDA.\n\n25:33.280 --> 25:35.280\nI'll say that we got a per diem.\n\n25:35.280 --> 25:41.280\nAnd it was a meal per diem of $25 for three meals a day.\n\n25:41.280 --> 25:42.280\nSo you could do the math.\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:43.280\nAnd that was the total.\n\n25:43.280 --> 25:45.280\nWe didn't technically get paid.\n\n25:45.280 --> 25:46.280\nOkay.\n\n25:46.280 --> 25:48.280\nBecause it was a game show, but we got a per diem.\n\n25:48.280 --> 25:51.280\nWait, you didn't get paid.\n\n25:51.280 --> 25:53.280\nYou're not allowed to say that?\n\n25:53.280 --> 25:54.280\nWell, it was a game show.\n\n25:54.280 --> 25:56.280\nSo we're not being paid as actors.\n\n25:56.280 --> 25:58.280\nOh, of course, paying it would be unethical.\n\n25:58.280 --> 26:04.280\nIf they paid us as actors, if they paid us as people who are performers, then we would be admissible to SAG or another guilt.\n\n26:04.280 --> 26:11.280\nBut you knew when you signed up that you were going to be on the show for a month and possibly only get meals paid for that entire time.\n\n26:11.280 --> 26:13.280\nDid it, was I aware?\n\n26:13.280 --> 26:19.280\nI honestly, I thought it was going to be like Survivor, where the longer you lasted, the more prize money you got.\n\n26:19.280 --> 26:25.280\nYou didn't know that you could just be there for a full month, go right to the wire and then come home and then zip.\n\n26:25.280 --> 26:30.280\nI think they told us about two weeks beforehand what it was going to be.\n\n26:30.280 --> 26:32.280\nAnd at that point, it's like, oh, okay.\n\n26:32.280 --> 26:34.280\nHey, guess what?\n\n26:34.280 --> 26:36.280\nLoving husband.\n\n26:36.280 --> 26:38.280\nNow I'm in the final 16.\n\n26:38.280 --> 26:44.280\nOh, let's take the dignity option where we're just like, yeah, of course, you have to go through that.\n\n26:44.280 --> 26:45.280\nWhat's the grand prize?\n\n26:45.280 --> 26:46.280\nWhat did the winner take home?\n\n26:46.280 --> 26:47.280\n100,000.\n\n26:47.280 --> 26:48.280\n100,000 beans.\n\n26:48.280 --> 26:50.280\nWhich, I mean, I'm biased.\n\n26:50.280 --> 26:52.280\nThis is from my unique perspective, but what?\n\n26:52.280 --> 26:54.280\nThat's a prize?\n\n26:57.280 --> 26:58.280\n100%.\n\n26:58.280 --> 27:01.280\nReturn to innocence indeed.\n\n27:01.280 --> 27:03.280\nI mean, I gotta...\n\n27:03.280 --> 27:09.280\nI guess teak patio furniture is getting up there.\n\n27:09.280 --> 27:11.280\nYeah, $100,000 is a lot of money.\n\n27:11.280 --> 27:13.280\nWill Phil agree that you want to put on your cupcakes?\n\n27:13.280 --> 27:14.280\nIt doesn't come cheap.\n\n27:14.280 --> 27:15.280\nOh, man.\n\n27:15.280 --> 27:19.280\nMy electric bill.\n\n27:19.280 --> 27:23.280\nI should start a reality show where I just have people come over and just like, I don't know,\n\n27:23.280 --> 27:29.280\nbring flashlights and compete for the right to light my life.\n\n27:29.280 --> 27:32.280\nAnd then I give the winner $100,000 after a year of doing that.\n\n27:32.280 --> 27:37.280\nI'd make a profit on what I saved in light bulbs.\n\n27:37.280 --> 27:39.280\nWhat do you, Caesar Augustus?\n\n27:39.280 --> 27:41.280\nNot by choice, man.\n\n27:41.280 --> 27:42.280\nNot by choice.\n\n27:42.280 --> 27:44.280\nYeah, no, it's become a choice.\n\n27:44.280 --> 27:45.280\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\n27:45.280 --> 27:48.280\nYou're choosing to make slaves out of people.\n\n27:48.280 --> 27:49.280\nWell, oh, no, I'm not really doing that.\n\n27:49.280 --> 27:51.280\nBut no, but if you're paying them, then they're not technically saying.\n\n27:51.280 --> 27:53.280\nHe's not going to pay these fuckers.\n\n27:53.280 --> 27:55.280\nHe says it's going to be a game show.\n\n27:55.280 --> 27:56.280\nIt's a prize.\n\n27:56.280 --> 27:57.280\nI'm giving a prize.\n\n27:57.280 --> 27:58.280\nI can't pay them, Genevieve.\n\n27:58.280 --> 27:59.280\nThey're on a game show.\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:00.280\nOh, okay.\n\n28:00.280 --> 28:01.280\nMy hands are tight.\n\n28:01.280 --> 28:08.280\nActually, technically, so are theirs, but that's just part of the rules.\n\n28:08.280 --> 28:10.280\nWhat are you willing to do to be on TV?\n\n28:10.280 --> 28:17.280\nSo, I don't want to be guilty of the crime of letting you go without, like, is there\n\n28:17.280 --> 28:21.280\nanybody in the audience who has a question, not specifically about the show, or just anybody,\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:25.280\nraise your hand if you're really burning, like, a question to ask Genevieve, like, whether\n\n28:25.280 --> 28:28.280\nit's about reality TV in general or the show.\n\n28:28.280 --> 28:30.280\nSomeone's raising their hand back there.\n\n28:30.280 --> 28:31.280\nErin McGathy to the stage.\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:36.280\nErin McGathy is at the last minute as far as I'm concerned.\n\n28:36.280 --> 28:40.280\nSo, everybody that watches reality shows knows that there's two components to it.\n\n28:40.280 --> 28:45.280\nBasically, there's this sort of pseudo coverage of everything that's happening, and then you're\n\n28:45.280 --> 28:49.280\nconstantly cutting to these VH1 talking heads against a green screen.\n\n28:49.280 --> 28:55.280\nAnd they seem relevant, because if you guys were in costumes, then you're in the same\n\n28:55.280 --> 29:01.280\ncostume, and that's probably not faked, because also emotionally, like, very often, people\n\n29:01.280 --> 29:03.280\nare crying in those talking heads.\n\n29:03.280 --> 29:07.280\nSo, when do those happen, and how do they get you into that slaughterhouse?\n\n29:07.280 --> 29:11.280\nWell, so, what happens is, first of all, I don't know how other reality shows are.\n\n29:11.280 --> 29:14.280\nI felt a lot of ours was honest to the spirit of the drama.\n\n29:14.280 --> 29:19.280\nHonestly, they have to edit a lot out, and everything gets changed, but the spirit of\n\n29:19.280 --> 29:23.280\nwhat happened was pretty honest overall.\n\n29:23.280 --> 29:29.280\nHowever, for the talking heads, that was a sort of frustrating situation for me, because\n\n29:29.280 --> 29:33.280\nwhen I realize this, I'm a person who gets really focused on something, right?\n\n29:33.280 --> 29:38.280\nI'll be working, and I'll be focused in on this, and at some point, they realize that\n\n29:38.280 --> 29:42.280\nif we pull Genevieve out when she's really focused on something, we get really great\n\n29:42.280 --> 29:46.280\noff-cuff comments, because I'm so snappy, I want to get back to work.\n\n29:46.280 --> 29:50.280\nSo, I start getting really snappish and kind of proud of you.\n\n29:50.280 --> 29:52.280\nCan we do a thing?\n\n29:52.280 --> 29:58.280\nLet me be you, and you be, like, is it like a producer with a clipboard that pulls you\n\n29:58.280 --> 29:59.280\nout?\n\n29:59.280 --> 30:00.280\nCan we do a talking to Genevieve?\n\n30:00.280 --> 30:01.280\nYes, I can do this.\n\n30:01.280 --> 30:02.280\nOkay, all right, so I'm Genevieve.\n\n30:02.280 --> 30:05.280\nOkay, now do you want a moment in the show, or do you want me to do, like, we're here\n\n30:05.280 --> 30:06.280\nin Genevieve?\n\n30:06.280 --> 30:11.280\nYou're catching me at a moment when I'm Genevieve, and I'm writing a fantasy novel.\n\n30:11.280 --> 30:16.280\nDan and Aaron, you guys do a scene, like, you're in the kitchen talking about stuff,\n\n30:16.280 --> 30:19.280\nand then Genevieve will pull you out as a producer, Dan.\n\n30:19.280 --> 30:20.280\nOkay.\n\n30:20.280 --> 30:21.280\nOkay.\n\n30:21.280 --> 30:22.280\nWhen it happens, they pull you right out.\n\n30:22.280 --> 30:24.280\nNo, well, yes, for the most part, something happens.\n\n30:24.280 --> 30:27.280\nLike, let's say you have a drama, and you have a fight with somebody.\n\n30:27.280 --> 30:28.280\nOkay.\n\n30:28.280 --> 30:31.280\nAfter that fight, the second it's resolved, there's somebody there going, come on.\n\n30:31.280 --> 30:32.280\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\n30:32.280 --> 30:33.280\nWe're going to go talk about this right now.\n\n30:33.280 --> 30:35.280\nAll right, so we'll start from, I'm doing dishes, washing a dish.\n\n30:35.280 --> 30:37.280\nWell, are we going to do a real scene?\n\n30:37.280 --> 30:38.280\nYeah.\n\n30:38.280 --> 30:39.280\nI'm Genevieve.\n\n30:39.280 --> 30:40.280\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n30:40.280 --> 30:41.280\nYou guys, Jesus Christ.\n\n30:41.280 --> 30:46.280\nDan and Aaron, just for the sake of this experiment, just try to manufacture a conflict between\n\n30:46.280 --> 30:47.280\nthe two of you.\n\n30:47.280 --> 30:48.280\nJust manufacture a conflict.\n\n30:48.280 --> 30:49.280\nYes.\n\n30:49.280 --> 30:50.280\nYeah.\n\n30:50.280 --> 30:51.280\nJust strictly for entertainment purposes.\n\n30:51.280 --> 30:52.280\nShe broke a dish.\n\n30:52.280 --> 30:53.280\nGo.\n\n30:53.280 --> 30:54.280\nOh, I broke it.\n\n30:54.280 --> 30:55.280\nOkay, that's good.\n\n30:55.280 --> 30:56.280\nOkay.\n\n30:56.280 --> 30:57.280\nWas it broken?\n\n30:57.280 --> 31:00.280\nThis is my special Batman dish that I brought.\n\n31:00.280 --> 31:01.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:03.280\nI just, I'm sorry.\n\n31:03.280 --> 31:07.280\nWell, were you going to wait for me to find out that it was broken?\n\n31:07.280 --> 31:08.280\nWhen did you know it was broken?\n\n31:08.280 --> 31:09.280\nNo, I don't know.\n\n31:09.280 --> 31:11.280\nI just didn't want you to get upset with me.\n\n31:11.280 --> 31:12.280\nOkay.\n\n31:12.280 --> 31:13.280\nCG dick.\n\n31:13.280 --> 31:19.280\nWell, Patrick, I only brought one dish.\n\n31:19.280 --> 31:21.280\nWe're being Dan and Aaron.\n\n31:21.280 --> 31:22.280\nWhat?\n\n31:22.280 --> 31:24.280\nWell, Jeff is giving a certain direction.\n\n31:24.280 --> 31:27.280\nHe just labeled you Patrick though.\n\n31:27.280 --> 31:28.280\nOkay, fine.\n\n31:28.280 --> 31:29.280\nFine.\n\n31:29.280 --> 31:30.280\nI'm Aaron.\n\n31:30.280 --> 31:31.280\nI'm your girlfriend.\n\n31:31.280 --> 31:34.280\nJeff just, here's what happened, Dan.\n\n31:34.280 --> 31:35.280\nSo now we can talk about this.\n\n31:35.280 --> 31:36.280\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n31:36.280 --> 31:37.280\nJeff wanted us to...\n\n31:37.280 --> 31:42.280\nGenevieve, just pull them out of their real lives and give them a fucking...\n\n31:42.280 --> 31:43.280\nOkay.\n\n31:43.280 --> 31:45.280\nThis is me giving him the hand signal.\n\n31:45.280 --> 31:46.280\nOh, okay.\n\n31:46.280 --> 31:47.280\nAll right.\n\n31:47.280 --> 31:48.280\nAnd now you never talk again.\n\n31:48.280 --> 31:49.280\nOkay.\n\n31:49.280 --> 31:50.280\nHey.\n\n31:50.280 --> 31:51.280\nWow.\n\n31:51.280 --> 31:52.280\nHey, Dan.\n\n31:52.280 --> 31:58.280\nHow are you feeling right now?\n\n31:58.280 --> 32:02.280\nI'm frustrated just because of the broken dish thing.\n\n32:02.280 --> 32:05.280\nAlso, I didn't understand what the fuck anyone was doing.\n\n32:05.280 --> 32:06.280\nOkay.\n\n32:06.280 --> 32:08.280\nWell, will you tell me what happened?\n\n32:08.280 --> 32:13.280\nWell, I had agreed at the forefront that we were going to do like a reenactment.\n\n32:13.280 --> 32:14.280\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n32:14.280 --> 32:15.280\nLet me stop you there.\n\n32:15.280 --> 32:16.280\nCan you say it in the present tense, please?\n\n32:16.280 --> 32:18.280\nAll right, right, right, right.\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:23.280\nI'm agreeing to do a thing that's like a reenactment of a reality show.\n\n32:23.280 --> 32:24.280\nI want to play Genevieve.\n\n32:24.280 --> 32:27.280\nAnd then other people are piping up with their comedy.\n\n32:27.280 --> 32:30.280\nAnd it's just a little frustrating because no one's listening.\n\n32:30.280 --> 32:32.280\nThere's not a lot of listening going on.\n\n32:32.280 --> 32:35.280\nI'm supposedly on stage with professional improvisers.\n\n32:35.280 --> 32:36.280\nOkay.\n\n32:36.280 --> 32:39.280\nSo you're telling me nobody's listening.\n\n32:39.280 --> 32:41.280\nCan you say that in a more concise way?\n\n32:41.280 --> 32:42.280\nNobody's listening.\n\n32:42.280 --> 32:43.280\nNobody's listening.\n\n32:43.280 --> 32:44.280\nNobody's listening.\n\n32:44.280 --> 32:45.280\nI don't know.\n\n32:45.280 --> 32:46.280\nNobody's listening.\n\n32:46.280 --> 32:47.280\nHello, hello.\n\n32:47.280 --> 32:48.280\nNobody's listening.\n\n32:48.280 --> 32:49.280\nOkay, okay.\n\n32:49.280 --> 32:50.280\nThat's great.\n\n32:50.280 --> 32:53.280\nNow, can I take you back to this morning?\n\n32:53.280 --> 32:58.280\nWhen you and Aaron, I'm going to remind you that you and Aaron were having breakfast.\n\n32:58.280 --> 32:59.280\nYeah.\n\n32:59.280 --> 33:00.280\nAnd she took your eggs.\n\n33:00.280 --> 33:04.280\nI saw her reach over and grab something off of your plate.\n\n33:04.280 --> 33:05.280\nNow, how did you feel that?\n\n33:05.280 --> 33:06.280\nYou saw that?\n\n33:06.280 --> 33:07.280\nHow did you feel?\n\n33:07.280 --> 33:08.280\nI mean, I thought it was weird.\n\n33:08.280 --> 33:09.280\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n33:09.280 --> 33:10.280\nI didn't mind at the time.\n\n33:10.280 --> 33:11.280\nI didn't mind.\n\n33:11.280 --> 33:12.280\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n33:12.280 --> 33:13.280\nCan you say the question while you're answering?\n\n33:13.280 --> 33:19.280\nWhen Aaron took my eggs, I didn't think it was a big deal.\n\n33:19.280 --> 33:22.280\nSo that didn't bother you?\n\n33:22.280 --> 33:27.280\nWell, I mean, I guess it could have bothered me.\n\n33:27.280 --> 33:28.280\nYou don't think that?\n\n33:28.280 --> 33:32.280\nWhen Aaron took my eggs, it seemed like it could have bothered me.\n\n33:32.280 --> 33:33.280\nOkay.\n\n33:33.280 --> 33:37.280\nSo you don't think maybe it was indicative of the fact that she doesn't respect you as\n\n33:37.280 --> 33:39.280\na partner?\n\n33:39.280 --> 33:42.280\nSure, I guess so.\n\n33:42.280 --> 33:43.280\nOh, sorry, sorry.\n\n33:43.280 --> 33:44.280\nYeah.\n\n33:44.280 --> 33:45.280\nOkay.\n\n33:45.280 --> 33:46.280\nAll right.\n\n33:46.280 --> 33:47.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:48.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n33:48.280 --> 33:49.280\nYeah, just restate the whole thing.\n\n33:49.280 --> 33:53.280\nWhen Aaron took my eggs, I felt like it was indicative of her not respecting me as a partner.\n\n33:53.280 --> 33:58.280\nWe'll be right back.\n\n33:58.280 --> 34:00.280\nVery nice.\n\n34:00.280 --> 34:01.280\nWow.\n\n34:01.280 --> 34:02.280\nAll right.\n\n34:02.280 --> 34:04.280\nWell, Genevieve, you're a fantasy author.\n\n34:04.280 --> 34:06.280\nI want to be able to plug your stuff because...\n\n34:06.280 --> 34:11.280\nI have a series of books called The Song of the Silver Tongue series on Amazon, Genevieve\n\n34:11.280 --> 34:18.280\nand right now I have a Kickstarter for HobbyCon 2014 in Pasadena, California.\n\n34:18.280 --> 34:21.280\nSo if you have a hobby or craft you want to show off...\n\n34:21.280 --> 34:22.280\nHobbyCon.\n\n34:22.280 --> 34:24.280\nIt's like an all-inclusive hobby convention.\n\n34:24.280 --> 34:27.280\nIt's like a grassroots pre-GenCon...\n\n34:27.280 --> 34:28.280\nYeah, it's awesome.\n\n34:28.280 --> 34:34.280\nIt's for anybody who's a nerd or a doer if you like to knit or paint more hammers, 40K.\n\n34:34.280 --> 34:37.280\nAnybody who likes to do stuff, this is like your Olympics.\n\n34:37.280 --> 34:38.280\nAll right.\n\n34:38.280 --> 34:42.280\nHobbyCon and look for Genevieve Pearson.\n\n34:42.280 --> 34:44.280\nGoogle the name.\n\n34:44.280 --> 34:48.280\nShe's got two books she's very proud of and one that she's fine with.\n\n34:48.280 --> 34:49.280\nYeah.\n\n34:49.280 --> 34:51.280\nAnd she should have won.\n\n34:51.280 --> 34:53.280\nThank you Genevieve.\n\n34:53.280 --> 34:54.280\nThanks for coming down.\n\n34:54.280 --> 34:56.280\nThank you so much for having me.\n\n34:56.280 --> 35:11.280\nAll right, let's work it out now on stage.\n\n35:11.280 --> 35:12.280\nI don't want to...\n\n35:12.280 --> 35:15.280\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n35:15.280 --> 35:19.280\nJeff suggested that we played ourselves and simulated a fight in Genevieve.\n\n35:19.280 --> 35:20.280\nI didn't say that.\n\n35:20.280 --> 35:21.280\nI said that.\n\n35:21.280 --> 35:24.280\nI was saying, I used you guys' names to set up the thing.\n\n35:24.280 --> 35:25.280\nOh, I see.\n\n35:25.280 --> 35:27.280\nI thought, well, then I misunderstood.\n\n35:27.280 --> 35:28.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n35:28.280 --> 35:29.280\nA lot of mixed signals.\n\n35:29.280 --> 35:30.280\nLook, I'm not here to make friends.\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:41.280\nI'm here to win.\n\n35:41.280 --> 35:43.280\nThat's another theme in reality shows.\n\n35:43.280 --> 35:47.280\nEvery single person alternating, but when they're on top of the game, they're like,\n\n35:47.280 --> 35:48.280\nit's not business.\n\n35:48.280 --> 35:49.280\nIt's personal or...\n\n35:49.280 --> 35:50.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n35:50.280 --> 35:51.280\nThat's what I would do.\n\n35:51.280 --> 35:56.280\nI'd be like, I don't care about winning, who said they didn't like me?\n\n35:56.280 --> 36:00.280\nSo Genevieve, when you were up here right now pretending to be a producer and you got\n\n36:00.280 --> 36:04.280\nin the middle of that conflict, how did you feel about that?\n\n36:04.280 --> 36:09.280\nI'm feeling a lot of stress right now because I don't like having to mediate between a couple.\n\n36:09.280 --> 36:13.280\nOkay, can you make that more succinct?\n\n36:13.280 --> 36:19.280\nI'm feeling a lot of stress having to mediate between Dan and Aaron right now because I'm\n\n36:19.280 --> 36:25.280\nin a healthy relationship and I just feel really bad.\n\n36:25.280 --> 36:26.280\nThat was good.\n\n36:26.280 --> 36:33.280\nCan you say it again, be a little more succinct and also add something racist into it?\n\n36:33.280 --> 36:40.280\nWell, I can tell that Aaron has a fiery Irish temper and that's why she is having such a hard time.\n\n36:40.280 --> 36:42.280\nWe'll be right back.\n\n36:42.280 --> 36:43.280\nGenevieve Pearson.\n\n36:43.280 --> 36:47.280\nWow, we got to the bottom of the...\n\n36:47.280 --> 36:52.280\nThat's what I was hoping we could talk about is the reality show source code.\n\n36:52.280 --> 36:54.280\nLet's make it an open source project.\n\n36:54.280 --> 36:58.280\nYou at home can make your own reality show now with that source code.\n\n36:58.280 --> 37:03.280\nAll right, let's bring to the stage Kumeil Nanjiani.\n\n37:03.280 --> 37:04.280\nHi.\n\n37:04.280 --> 37:13.280\nHi.\n\n37:13.280 --> 37:17.280\nThat is the most rock and roll face anyone's ever made to this song.\n\n37:17.280 --> 37:23.280\nKumeil Nanjiani.\n\n37:23.280 --> 37:25.280\nI love that song.\n\n37:25.280 --> 37:29.280\nI'm going to call out your name next time I'm making love.\n\n37:29.280 --> 37:31.280\nIs it to me?\n\n37:31.280 --> 37:32.280\nNo.\n\n37:32.280 --> 37:34.280\nI like the sound.\n\n37:34.280 --> 37:38.280\nKumeil Nanjiani.\n\n37:38.280 --> 37:40.280\nThat's actually what I do.\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:43.280\nI say, you've been Nanjiani.\n\n37:43.280 --> 37:45.280\nYou know what's weird is who else does that?\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:46.280\nBen Stein.\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:50.280\nAnd it's not Ben Stein.\n\n37:50.280 --> 37:53.280\nAlso weird, I yell out Kumeil.\n\n37:53.280 --> 37:55.280\nWhat were you like?\n\n37:55.280 --> 37:59.280\nKumeil Nanjiani.\n\n37:59.280 --> 38:02.280\nEnigma, 1995.\n\n38:02.280 --> 38:05.280\nYou know all that reality talk is interesting because I just watched it.\n\n38:05.280 --> 38:08.280\nI'd never seen it, the first season of Real World.\n\n38:08.280 --> 38:10.280\nThey were re-hearing it.\n\n38:10.280 --> 38:13.280\nAnd I just watched it and it's sort of the first reality show.\n\n38:13.280 --> 38:19.280\nAnd it's so interesting to watch a reality show where the people don't have like reality show personalities yet.\n\n38:19.280 --> 38:21.280\nWhere they weren't raised on reality.\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:24.280\nYeah, and they're just sort of being themselves and it was a very positive thing.\n\n38:24.280 --> 38:28.280\nYou watch them discover the flint rock of eliminating the black guy.\n\n38:28.280 --> 38:30.280\nExactly.\n\n38:30.280 --> 38:36.280\nLike you watch them go like, oh, Kuan is very antagonistic.\n\n38:36.280 --> 38:38.280\nYou notice that too?\n\n38:38.280 --> 38:41.280\nAnd then afterwards you watch them institutionally.\n\n38:41.280 --> 38:44.280\nWhat if you did a show where they had to eliminate the black guy?\n\n38:44.280 --> 38:46.280\nIt's totally amazing because it's exactly that.\n\n38:46.280 --> 38:49.280\nIt's stuff that happens sort of organically when there's still cameras.\n\n38:49.280 --> 38:52.280\nBut then later they're like, alright, we gotta do this.\n\n38:52.280 --> 38:58.280\nAt the end of the season, they just decide to grab all the cameras and start interviewing the interviewers.\n\n38:58.280 --> 39:00.280\nAnd it's a very real organic moment.\n\n39:00.280 --> 39:03.280\nBut I bet at some point they were like, alright, okay.\n\n39:03.280 --> 39:09.280\nWhat you guys do now is you have to pretend that we don't know when you come and steal the cameras from us.\n\n39:09.280 --> 39:14.280\nI'm like the forest gump of reality TV because in the 90s, I remember,\n\n39:14.280 --> 39:19.280\nI remember being in Milwaukee in the 90s when they were starting to talk about how they're going to make this show.\n\n39:19.280 --> 39:24.280\nThey're making this show for MTV, which was still a channel where they showed music videos.\n\n39:24.280 --> 39:28.280\nIt was like they had some butt-head and they had some other stuff, but it was still largely like,\n\n39:28.280 --> 39:31.280\nwe were all making jokes like, put some music videos on.\n\n39:31.280 --> 39:35.280\nBut the joke was because they were still supposed to make music television.\n\n39:35.280 --> 39:38.280\nAnd they were working on this thing and it was called The Real World.\n\n39:38.280 --> 39:42.280\nAnd the whole idea was that these kids were living in this house and there was going to be cameras everywhere.\n\n39:42.280 --> 39:44.280\nAnd it was ironic. It was ironic.\n\n39:44.280 --> 39:48.280\nEveryone that had heard about the idea was like, what does that mean?\n\n39:48.280 --> 39:53.280\nIf there's cameras everywhere, then they're like, no, what they're doing is they're going to have the cameras everywhere\n\n39:53.280 --> 39:57.280\nand they're not even going to have film in them right away and they're just going to get used to it.\n\n39:57.280 --> 39:58.280\nThey're going to get so used to it.\n\n39:58.280 --> 40:01.280\nAnd it was like this whole thing, it was introduced like this Kubrickian experiment.\n\n40:01.280 --> 40:04.280\nIt's such a crazy thing that it was crazy back then and now we're like, yeah.\n\n40:04.280 --> 40:05.280\nIt was crazy.\n\n40:05.280 --> 40:11.280\nAnd so then there was a point, so flash forward to me in Los Angeles, Thanksgiving.\n\n40:11.280 --> 40:12.280\nI just moved.\n\n40:12.280 --> 40:13.280\nSchrab was there.\n\n40:13.280 --> 40:14.280\nI was there.\n\n40:14.280 --> 40:16.280\nI'm sitting at Thanksgiving because we had no family in LA.\n\n40:16.280 --> 40:18.280\nI'm sitting at my agent's house for Thanksgiving.\n\n40:18.280 --> 40:21.280\nI'm sitting next to this weird little Australian guy.\n\n40:21.280 --> 40:23.280\nAnd I go, so what are you working on?\n\n40:23.280 --> 40:26.280\nHe goes like, oh, I'm working on a reality show.\n\n40:26.280 --> 40:28.280\nIt's been big in Europe.\n\n40:28.280 --> 40:30.280\nMight shrimp with a Barbie, whatever.\n\n40:30.280 --> 40:32.280\nI think it was Australia or something.\n\n40:32.280 --> 40:33.280\nI don't know, whatever.\n\n40:33.280 --> 40:35.280\nIt sounds like it might have been death.\n\n40:35.280 --> 40:42.280\nI'm almost reasonably certain, like piecing together the evidence.\n\n40:42.280 --> 40:43.280\nI haven't specified.\n\n40:43.280 --> 40:47.280\nI choose to believe it was Mark Burnett that I was talking to.\n\n40:47.280 --> 40:48.280\nIs he Australian?\n\n40:48.280 --> 40:49.280\nI don't know.\n\n40:49.280 --> 40:52.280\nBut it seems like the easiest thing to find out.\n\n40:52.280 --> 40:54.280\nI don't want to because I don't want to know.\n\n40:54.280 --> 40:55.280\nYes, he is.\n\n40:55.280 --> 40:56.280\nOkay.\n\n40:56.280 --> 41:01.280\nSo sometimes people go, I think you were sitting next to Mark Burnett because I was at my agent's house.\n\n41:01.280 --> 41:02.280\nThat's amazing.\n\n41:02.280 --> 41:03.280\nShe was a hot shot.\n\n41:03.280 --> 41:07.280\nI was sitting next to this guy with this accent and he was telling me about the show, the reality show.\n\n41:07.280 --> 41:10.280\nAnd he goes like, yeah, it's huge in Europe.\n\n41:10.280 --> 41:15.280\nThey put everybody on an island and then they eliminate, this was the elimination thing was becoming like a thing.\n\n41:15.280 --> 41:17.280\nAnd I was like, what the fuck?\n\n41:17.280 --> 41:18.280\nThat sounds insane.\n\n41:18.280 --> 41:20.280\nBut wouldn't they just eliminate, how would that work?\n\n41:20.280 --> 41:27.280\nAnd he goes, no, but they eliminate the strong people first and then the middle of the road people kind of take over.\n\n41:27.280 --> 41:31.280\nBut more than that, they're also like eating each other alive and they're having sex with each other.\n\n41:31.280 --> 41:33.280\nAnd I was like, that's going to be a hit.\n\n41:33.280 --> 41:34.280\nI said it, I said it.\n\n41:34.280 --> 41:35.280\nGive me my money.\n\n41:35.280 --> 41:36.280\nYou said that's going to be a hit?\n\n41:36.280 --> 41:37.280\nYeah.\n\n41:37.280 --> 41:42.280\nYou totally are though because wait, wait, turn it off.\n\n41:42.280 --> 41:46.280\nThen I'm sitting in my apartment.\n\n41:46.280 --> 41:48.280\nMy girlfriend at the time calls me.\n\n41:48.280 --> 41:49.280\nShe was a studio executive.\n\n41:49.280 --> 41:52.280\nShe calls me and she would use to call me after a day at work.\n\n41:52.280 --> 41:59.280\nShe would call me from the office because people would pitch her shows and she would go, oh, hey, like, what am I, like, I got to talk to my writer boyfriend.\n\n41:59.280 --> 42:02.280\nI got to get some release from this insane industry.\n\n42:02.280 --> 42:07.280\nOn the heels of survivor, the world is exploding, everything's changing.\n\n42:07.280 --> 42:10.280\nI remember talking to her from my one bedroom apartment.\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:13.280\nThat was your tipping point for the world changing with survivor?\n\n42:13.280 --> 42:16.280\nI thought you were going to say 9-11.\n\n42:16.280 --> 42:18.280\nI mean, did 9-11 not happen yet?\n\n42:18.280 --> 42:19.280\nOh, right.\n\n42:19.280 --> 42:20.280\nOkay, we're 9-11.\n\n42:20.280 --> 42:21.280\nIt's survivor times.\n\n42:21.280 --> 42:25.280\nYou realize Alcana did what they did because of reality TV?\n\n42:25.280 --> 42:26.280\nI guess that's right.\n\n42:26.280 --> 42:32.280\nDo you know that they said, like, oh, I know how we, obviously, we can look...\n\n42:32.280 --> 42:37.280\nI hope this story ends with you meeting an 8-year-old Kim Kardashian.\n\n42:37.280 --> 42:39.280\nWhere she's like, oh, I'm never going to be anything.\n\n42:39.280 --> 42:43.280\nYou're like, you can be whatever you want to be.\n\n42:43.280 --> 42:45.280\nAnd then you gave her the confidence to be horrible.\n\n42:45.280 --> 42:47.280\nMy girlfriend called me up.\n\n42:47.280 --> 42:53.280\nMy girlfriend called me up and she said, she would call me up every once in a while and she'd go, I just heard a pitch for this show.\n\n42:53.280 --> 42:54.280\nBuckle up.\n\n42:54.280 --> 42:55.280\nYou ready for this?\n\n42:55.280 --> 43:04.280\nThese people, they're on an alien planet and, you know, one of the guys is in a wheelchair and the gravity is weird.\n\n43:04.280 --> 43:06.280\nSo every once in a while he can walk.\n\n43:06.280 --> 43:09.280\nAnd I'd go, later lost would have a character like that.\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:14.280\nBut she calls me up and she goes like, so listen to this.\n\n43:14.280 --> 43:17.280\nSo this is a pitch I just heard for a reality show.\n\n43:17.280 --> 43:27.280\nA man who's rich, he doesn't have a wife, but he's rich.\n\n43:27.280 --> 43:34.280\nSo all the women compete to be his wife because he needs a wife so bad.\n\n43:34.280 --> 43:41.280\nAnd I'm like 20 whatever-year-old Dan Harmon going like, I'm saying in response to hearing this concept.\n\n43:41.280 --> 43:43.280\nI'm going, fuck you.\n\n43:43.280 --> 43:45.280\nNo fucking way.\n\n43:45.280 --> 43:47.280\nI can't go there.\n\n43:47.280 --> 43:48.280\nIt's impossible.\n\n43:48.280 --> 43:49.280\nMarriage?\n\n43:49.280 --> 43:51.280\nThe institution of marriage?\n\n43:51.280 --> 43:54.280\nThis is before who wants to fuck a midget.\n\n43:54.280 --> 43:56.280\nLiterally, for me.\n\n43:56.280 --> 44:03.280\nEverything just exploded like a mushroom cloud to the point where one day you were allowed to be like frazzled by any of it.\n\n44:03.280 --> 44:06.280\nAnd then the next day everyone had beaten you to the punch.\n\n44:06.280 --> 44:12.280\nIt's pretty impressive because I just read a thing today that said how marriage, people are getting married less and less.\n\n44:12.280 --> 44:15.280\nAlmost 50% of kids, something's happening.\n\n44:15.280 --> 44:19.280\nNothing. It's fine. I tipped my calf.\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:21.280\nIt's not being clumsy.\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:24.280\nIt said 50% of kids born or born out of wedlock.\n\n44:24.280 --> 44:28.280\nAnd I think part of the reason people aren't getting married, the sanctity of marriage, whatever that means.\n\n44:28.280 --> 44:30.280\nBecause they want to be romantic.\n\n44:30.280 --> 44:36.280\nBut I think because of things like bachelor and stuff, because it has cheapened that thing so much.\n\n44:36.280 --> 44:44.280\nIt makes it feel like you're kind of a sucker. We're moving into a weird Logan's Run universe where we have three life cycles or something.\n\n44:44.280 --> 44:48.280\nWhere you go like, oh, who's your first wife? Who's your second wife? Who's your third wife?\n\n44:48.280 --> 44:54.280\nYeah, when I got married, I got married pretty young and I told my friends and they literally were like, why?\n\n44:54.280 --> 44:56.280\nThat was literally their reaction.\n\n44:56.280 --> 44:58.280\nHow old were you when you got married?\n\n44:58.280 --> 45:01.280\nI got married. I got married.\n\n45:01.280 --> 45:03.280\nI know you guys have several weddings.\n\n45:03.280 --> 45:06.280\nYeah, we've had several weddings.\n\n45:06.280 --> 45:08.280\nOh, because you're from Pakistan? Is that a thing?\n\n45:08.280 --> 45:09.280\nBecause they love weddings.\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:11.280\nOkay.\n\n45:11.280 --> 45:16.280\nSomehow, even though it's racist, you are accurate.\n\n45:16.280 --> 45:21.280\nHi!\n\n45:21.280 --> 45:22.280\nWell, because you're...\n\n45:22.280 --> 45:24.280\nI'm assuming your gods have eight heads.\n\n45:24.280 --> 45:29.280\nSo eight weddings, one for each head.\n\n45:29.280 --> 45:34.280\nI, Kumar of the North Plains, am sanctifying this marriage.\n\n45:34.280 --> 45:36.280\nOkay, now we have to go to the Western Territory.\n\n45:36.280 --> 45:40.280\nI, Aesop.\n\n45:40.280 --> 45:43.280\nI lower my sword.\n\n45:43.280 --> 45:50.280\nOne wedding for each stereotype, so we have to do one for the cab driving god and one for the sun god.\n\n45:50.280 --> 45:53.280\nI, Shaloub of the cab.\n\n45:53.280 --> 45:55.280\nI declare this wedding...\n\n45:55.280 --> 45:58.280\nGood reference. Holy shit.\n\n45:58.280 --> 46:00.280\nIt changed. Amazing.\n\n46:00.280 --> 46:02.280\nShaloub of the checker gods.\n\n46:02.280 --> 46:04.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:04.280 --> 46:09.280\nI, of the Big Bang Theory, the 30...\n\n46:09.280 --> 46:11.280\nBasinga!\n\n46:11.280 --> 46:14.280\nThe Fisher Stevens god.\n\n46:14.280 --> 46:18.280\nThis short circuit is complete.\n\n46:18.280 --> 46:22.280\nBy the circuits of Johnny Fine.\n\n46:22.280 --> 46:25.280\nOh, my God.\n\n46:25.280 --> 46:30.280\nNo, this is why, because we first got married in secret,\n\n46:30.280 --> 46:34.280\nlike, just me and her and a couple of our friends at a...\n\n46:34.280 --> 46:37.280\nlike, you know, where you go to just stand in line.\n\n46:37.280 --> 46:38.280\nYou literally stand in line.\n\n46:38.280 --> 46:39.280\nAt City Hall?\n\n46:39.280 --> 46:40.280\nAt City Hall.\n\n46:40.280 --> 46:44.280\nAnd you get married, and it was, like, actually a really beautiful, wonderful experience,\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:47.280\nbecause all these people in line, and some of them are pregnant, some of them are super old.\n\n46:47.280 --> 46:48.280\nThey're all kind of, like...\n\n46:48.280 --> 46:51.280\nThey all kind of had these things, like, everybody clearly on the street,\n\n46:51.280 --> 46:55.280\nand the guy who married us, the magistrate guy, I don't know what you call him,\n\n46:55.280 --> 46:58.280\nit was probably, like, the 30th wedding he turned,\n\n46:58.280 --> 47:03.280\nbut he was so, like, warm, and he seemed genuinely happy and joyous,\n\n47:03.280 --> 47:04.280\nand it was such a wonderful...\n\n47:04.280 --> 47:08.280\nAnd then after that, we went home and watched four weddings at a funeral, you know, like,\n\n47:08.280 --> 47:10.280\nit was a good day, you know?\n\n47:10.280 --> 47:13.280\nI'm sorry, I couldn't get over the insensitivity.\n\n47:13.280 --> 47:15.280\nYou don't know if he's called the magistrate.\n\n47:15.280 --> 47:17.280\nLike, can't you be a little more politically correct?\n\n47:17.280 --> 47:22.280\nNo, I thought that would be funny.\n\n47:22.280 --> 47:24.280\nAfter the eight-headed guy thing.\n\n47:24.280 --> 47:27.280\nSo we did that, and then we had a Muslim wedding,\n\n47:27.280 --> 47:32.280\nand then we had how many, and then we've had three weddings,\n\n47:32.280 --> 47:35.280\nand then the third one actually was not even...\n\n47:35.280 --> 47:38.280\nBut then you have to have a funeral.\n\n47:38.280 --> 47:40.280\nWell, that'll come.\n\n47:40.280 --> 47:43.280\nThanks for the reality check, bro.\n\n47:43.280 --> 47:46.280\nI'm jealous. I love weddings.\n\n47:46.280 --> 47:48.280\nWell, what's interesting was...\n\n47:48.280 --> 47:50.280\nSo many weddings.\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:52.280\nI'm gonna convert to Muslim.\n\n47:52.280 --> 47:55.280\nTo Muslim. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, to Islam. I'm a little drunk.\n\n47:55.280 --> 47:58.280\nI don't know, that's kind of a sinking ship right now.\n\n47:58.280 --> 48:00.280\nNot many people.\n\n48:00.280 --> 48:03.280\nOnce Mike Tyson got on there, we were like, alright, we're out.\n\n48:03.280 --> 48:05.280\nWhat was your third wedding?\n\n48:05.280 --> 48:07.280\nThe third wedding, actually, so we were married,\n\n48:07.280 --> 48:10.280\nbut we hadn't told anybody, and then one weekend,\n\n48:10.280 --> 48:12.280\nwe just moved in New York, we just told our friends,\n\n48:12.280 --> 48:16.280\nlike, hey, we're gonna go get married this weekend, and what we did was,\n\n48:16.280 --> 48:19.280\nwe stayed at home, and we turned off our phones, and we...\n\n48:19.280 --> 48:21.280\nLet's get Emily Andrews.\n\n48:21.280 --> 48:23.280\nEmily!\n\n48:23.280 --> 48:25.280\nEmily Gordon, everybody.\n\n48:25.280 --> 48:27.280\nHi!\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:36.280\nFirst off, we've never told anybody that we were married in secret.\n\n48:36.280 --> 48:38.280\nIt could not matter less now.\n\n48:38.280 --> 48:40.280\nIt could, that's a good point.\n\n48:40.280 --> 48:43.280\nIt's been a long time, and you know what, no secrets anymore.\n\n48:43.280 --> 48:46.280\nNo secrets, you guys. We were married for like a year and a half\n\n48:46.280 --> 48:48.280\nbefore anybody... Before he told anybody.\n\n48:48.280 --> 48:50.280\nYeah.\n\n48:50.280 --> 48:52.280\nI highly recommend it, because you don't get people being like,\n\n48:52.280 --> 48:55.280\noh, you guys are newlyweds, isn't that weird for you?\n\n48:55.280 --> 48:58.280\nWell, people still do that, and you're like, fuck you.\n\n48:58.280 --> 49:00.280\nYou don't know how dumb that is.\n\n49:00.280 --> 49:03.280\nWhich, honestly, for us, we've been living together for so long,\n\n49:03.280 --> 49:06.280\nthat getting married wasn't really a big difference.\n\n49:06.280 --> 49:09.280\nYeah, that's the real truth, is that once you live with someone...\n\n49:09.280 --> 49:12.280\nHow old was that, 20 or 29?\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:15.280\nI think that should be the new definition of marriage.\n\n49:15.280 --> 49:18.280\nGrant, this is very L.A. of me to say, because we live out here\n\n49:18.280 --> 49:21.280\nin this culture where people come out here to pursue their dreams.\n\n49:21.280 --> 49:24.280\nDreams don't come true, so people get married out here\n\n49:24.280 --> 49:27.280\nwhen they're 40 and they have kids when they're 50.\n\n49:27.280 --> 49:29.280\nThat's exactly right.\n\n49:29.280 --> 49:33.280\nAs such, I married Schrab and Kate,\n\n49:33.280 --> 49:37.280\nand they had been together for so long,\n\n49:37.280 --> 49:40.280\nand living together for so long before it,\n\n49:40.280 --> 49:44.280\nthat your first question is, what's the point of getting married?\n\n49:44.280 --> 49:47.280\nAnd then your second question is, what could be more romantic\n\n49:47.280 --> 49:50.280\nthan the decision to get married by two people\n\n49:50.280 --> 49:53.280\nwho don't have anything to gain or lose by getting married?\n\n49:53.280 --> 49:56.280\nAnd I think that we have to move forward into a society...\n\n49:56.280 --> 49:58.280\nOh, we have to.\n\n49:58.280 --> 50:01.280\nIt's a high-stakes game.\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:05.280\nWe also probably have to stop making lasers that destroy the earth,\n\n50:05.280 --> 50:07.280\nbut we'll get around to this.\n\n50:07.280 --> 50:09.280\nNo, look it up.\n\n50:09.280 --> 50:13.280\nWe have to move into a world where marriage\n\n50:13.280 --> 50:16.280\nis no longer looked at as moving across a threshold,\n\n50:16.280 --> 50:18.280\nlike a thing that has to be done where you're like,\n\n50:18.280 --> 50:20.280\nI wonder what it's going to be like after that,\n\n50:20.280 --> 50:23.280\nbecause the answer is, it's going to be the same.\n\n50:23.280 --> 50:28.280\nSo if more of this for 30 years isn't your cup of tea,\n\n50:28.280 --> 50:30.280\ndon't marry this person.\n\n50:30.280 --> 50:32.280\nFor us, for me, it was a very romantic thing\n\n50:32.280 --> 50:35.280\nbecause it's literally just saying to the world,\n\n50:35.280 --> 50:37.280\nlike, I'm going to be with this person forever.\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:39.280\nAnd it was a very romantic.\n\n50:39.280 --> 50:42.280\nAnd even though we've been married three times,\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:44.280\nI never actually got to propose to you,\n\n50:44.280 --> 50:46.280\nso I never got to.\n\n50:46.280 --> 50:48.280\nAre you crying something?\n\n50:48.280 --> 50:50.280\nNo, no, no.\n\n50:56.280 --> 50:58.280\nEmily, will you marry me?\n\n50:58.280 --> 51:02.280\nI will.\n\n51:02.280 --> 51:04.280\nFaith.\n\n51:04.280 --> 51:05.280\nWe did it.\n\n51:05.280 --> 51:07.280\nForgiveness.\n\n51:07.280 --> 51:08.280\nIt took us 50 episodes.\n\n51:08.280 --> 51:10.280\nDestiny.\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:11.280\nPiveness.\n\n51:11.280 --> 51:13.280\nEmily Gordon, everybody.\n\n51:13.280 --> 51:16.280\nDestiny.\n\n51:16.280 --> 51:18.280\nDevotion.\n\n51:18.280 --> 51:21.280\nFourth wedding.\n\n51:21.280 --> 51:23.280\nFourth wedding.\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:28.280\nThe right way to put it, I thought, was when I asked Schrabb,\n\n51:28.280 --> 51:30.280\nwhy is he marrying Kate?\n\n51:30.280 --> 51:36.280\nHe said, to paraphrase him, I ran out of ways\n\n51:36.280 --> 51:39.280\nto make it clear how much I love this person,\n\n51:39.280 --> 51:42.280\nwhich is, I think that's the right way to go.\n\n51:42.280 --> 51:48.280\nDon't marry him until it's absolutely the only thing left.\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:59.280\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n51:59.280 --> 52:02.280\nForgiveness.\n\n52:02.280 --> 52:04.280\nVacuum.\n\n52:04.280 --> 52:07.280\nPoobase.\n\n52:07.280 --> 52:09.280\nAll right, let's, come on.\n\n52:09.280 --> 52:11.280\nWe got a time pause.\n\n52:11.280 --> 52:13.280\nLet's keep this train going.\n\n52:13.280 --> 52:18.280\nSpencer after the stage.\n\n52:18.280 --> 52:22.280\nYou don't usually see a proposal after the wedding,\n\n52:22.280 --> 52:25.280\nbut you never see a proposal after three weddings.\n\n52:25.280 --> 52:27.280\nYeah.\n\n52:27.280 --> 52:29.280\nSpencer Crinton, everybody.\n\n52:29.280 --> 52:33.280\nWelcome to the stage.\n\n52:33.280 --> 52:37.280\nHey, hey, hey.\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:40.280\nOh, shit.\n\n52:40.280 --> 52:45.280\nWhat?\n\n52:45.280 --> 52:49.280\nSpencer, what's new in your life since we saw you last?\n\n52:49.280 --> 52:53.280\nI told you guys, I've been listening to that song,\n\n52:53.280 --> 52:56.280\nStepping Out by Joe Jackson.\n\n52:56.280 --> 52:59.280\nAnd I was unable to download it in time for showtime tonight.\n\n52:59.280 --> 53:02.280\nYeah, but I really appreciate the thought.\n\n53:02.280 --> 53:03.280\nHow does that one go?\n\n53:03.280 --> 53:05.280\nCan you sing a bit for us?\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:15.280\nYeah.\n\n53:15.280 --> 53:18.280\nBring.\n\n53:18.280 --> 53:19.280\nAre there words?\n\n53:19.280 --> 53:20.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n53:20.280 --> 53:22.280\nHow do the words go?\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:29.280\nNow, the mist across the window blocks the light,\n\n53:29.280 --> 53:37.280\nbut nothing hides the color of the lights that shine.\n\n53:37.280 --> 53:44.280\nIf that shit is not on Tumblr in the next hour,\n\n53:44.280 --> 53:46.280\nI'm going to be very disappointed.\n\n53:46.280 --> 53:50.280\nI want full animated, fully recreated music video.\n\n53:50.280 --> 53:54.280\nI want to hear a mashup between Enigma's Return to Innocence\n\n53:54.280 --> 53:57.280\nand Joe Jackson's Stepping Out.\n\n53:57.280 --> 54:03.280\nDo you guys remember that we listened to that\n\n54:03.280 --> 54:09.280\nand other Enigma songs on the way to Medieval Times on repeat?\n\n54:09.280 --> 54:11.280\nYeah.\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:12.280\nIt's down, I'm sorry.\n\n54:12.280 --> 54:14.280\nWhat is the deal with Enigma?\n\n54:14.280 --> 54:15.280\nLike, is it one guy?\n\n54:15.280 --> 54:16.280\nIs it 100?\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:17.280\nIt could be anything.\n\n54:17.280 --> 54:18.280\nIt's at least two guys.\n\n54:18.280 --> 54:20.280\nIt's one guy, one cave, 40 mics.\n\n54:20.280 --> 54:24.280\nIt sounds like it could be either white or they...\n\n54:24.280 --> 54:27.280\nYou could put Enigma and Enya in a line-up\n\n54:27.280 --> 54:29.280\nand I wouldn't know what was going on.\n\n54:29.280 --> 54:32.280\nAlso, they had that song that's ubiquitous,\n\n54:32.280 --> 54:34.280\nlike, whenever anybody, like...\n\n54:34.280 --> 54:36.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n54:36.280 --> 54:38.280\nThe sadness...\n\n54:38.280 --> 54:39.280\nI tried to do an impression of it.\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:42.280\nYeah, it was Sadness Part One.\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:45.280\nSadness Part One, which is the cockiest name to a song ever.\n\n54:45.280 --> 54:47.280\nThere will be more.\n\n54:47.280 --> 54:50.280\nAnytime, anyone who was doing anything,\n\n54:50.280 --> 54:54.280\ninvolving gauze, candles, duvetine, and S&M,\n\n54:54.280 --> 54:56.280\nlike, in any HBO show.\n\n54:56.280 --> 54:58.280\nIt's like Chris de Burgh's song,\n\n54:58.280 --> 55:00.280\na lady in red,\n\n55:00.280 --> 55:02.280\nThe Beginning.\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:04.280\nWhenever I hear Enigma, I picture those moles\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:06.280\nwho have never seen light\n\n55:06.280 --> 55:08.280\nin the Battle of Feet.\n\n55:08.280 --> 55:10.280\nThey have no idea.\n\n55:10.280 --> 55:12.280\nThey're blind moles.\n\n55:12.280 --> 55:15.280\nI picture a kid eating mango for the first time.\n\n55:17.280 --> 55:19.280\nWhat a beautiful...\n\n55:19.280 --> 55:22.280\nI picture my mom's pussy, but...\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:23.280\nBut in a good way?\n\n55:23.280 --> 55:25.280\nFull disclosure, like, I picture that also,\n\n55:25.280 --> 55:27.280\nlike, when I hear a variety of songs,\n\n55:27.280 --> 55:31.280\nlike, especially, like, the Rocky theme.\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:35.280\nHis mom's pussy is a staircase.\n\n55:35.280 --> 55:39.280\nIt's specifically, yeah, it's a marble staircase.\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:41.280\nIn Philadelphia.\n\n55:41.280 --> 55:43.280\nSpencer!\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:44.280\nHey, guys.\n\n55:44.280 --> 55:46.280\nAlright, well, let's get these out.\n\n55:46.280 --> 55:47.280\nWhat, are you gonna say something?\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:49.280\nI was just gonna say, I actually...\n\n55:49.280 --> 55:51.280\nThis is terrible, and I...\n\n55:51.280 --> 55:53.280\nI am terrible.\n\n55:53.280 --> 55:55.280\nYou picture my mom's pussy when blah, blah, blah, yeah?\n\n55:55.280 --> 55:57.280\nYeah, yeah, no, but...\n\n55:57.280 --> 55:59.280\nDo you actually know what your mom's pussy looks like?\n\n55:59.280 --> 56:01.280\nA marble staircase, right?\n\n56:01.280 --> 56:03.280\nIf anybody should.\n\n56:03.280 --> 56:05.280\nThat's what he said, I thought.\n\n56:05.280 --> 56:07.280\nThat is what he said.\n\n56:07.280 --> 56:09.280\nOkay, listening skills.\n\n56:09.280 --> 56:11.280\nSee, I'm listening to you, Dan.\n\n56:11.280 --> 56:12.280\nThanks.\n\n56:12.280 --> 56:14.280\nI was just... I didn't write an intro sequence,\n\n56:14.280 --> 56:16.280\nso, I mean, I wrote...\n\n56:16.280 --> 56:18.280\nYeah, I can try.\n\n56:18.280 --> 56:21.280\nI didn't... I mean, I distinctly remember\n\n56:21.280 --> 56:23.280\nyou holding a dragon's dick open\n\n56:23.280 --> 56:25.280\nso that arrows can be shot.\n\n56:25.280 --> 56:28.280\nWell, then after that, I've already chopped the dick off,\n\n56:28.280 --> 56:31.280\nand I kind of called dibs on it, and it's in my bag.\n\n56:31.280 --> 56:34.280\nYeah, yeah, I remember that, yeah, definitely.\n\n56:34.280 --> 56:36.280\nI remember that...\n\n56:36.280 --> 56:38.280\nWhy don't you just freestyle one?\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:40.280\nFor better or for worse?\n\n56:40.280 --> 56:42.280\nNo right or wrong answers.\n\n56:42.280 --> 56:44.280\nDo you want to get the character she's passed out as we do this?\n\n56:44.280 --> 56:46.280\nI mean, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:46.280 --> 56:48.280\nWere you just listening to that song in lieu of...\n\n56:48.280 --> 56:50.280\nI know this is on Orthodox,\n\n56:50.280 --> 56:54.280\nbut can I have Genevieve be my advisor on this?\n\n56:54.280 --> 56:57.280\nSimilar to a nerd war?\n\n56:57.280 --> 56:59.280\nYeah, or nerd off.\n\n56:59.280 --> 57:01.280\nNerd off.\n\n57:01.280 --> 57:03.280\nNerd off.\n\n57:03.280 --> 57:05.280\nYou guys haven't seen King and the Nerds.\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:07.280\nCheck it out.\n\n57:07.280 --> 57:10.280\nSo, I am a lady with arrows.\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:14.280\nCan I bring Celeste up to help me out right now, please?\n\n57:14.280 --> 57:18.280\nShe's off spending a hundred grand on...\n\n57:18.280 --> 57:20.280\nAlright, Suspenser.\n\n57:20.280 --> 57:22.280\nOh, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n57:22.280 --> 57:24.280\nYou're spilling.\n\n57:24.280 --> 57:26.280\nShe just keeps doing it.\n\n57:26.280 --> 57:28.280\nShe's like a Ronan Martin's laughing character.\n\n57:28.280 --> 57:32.280\nHow many people are going to get that reference here?\n\n57:32.280 --> 57:35.280\nYeah, okay, super nerdy.\n\n57:35.280 --> 57:40.280\nFun fact, do that this morning with a cup of water as I woke up.\n\n57:40.280 --> 57:43.280\nWhen it keeps falling out of your cup, that's God saying,\n\n57:43.280 --> 57:45.280\nstop drinking.\n\n57:45.280 --> 57:47.280\nDoes it need it?\n\n57:47.280 --> 57:49.280\nIt counts with water, though, too.\n\n57:49.280 --> 57:51.280\nIt's like stop drinking water.\n\n57:51.280 --> 57:53.280\nIt's just a general sign.\n\n57:53.280 --> 57:56.280\nYeah, but nobody spills two glasses of water.\n\n57:56.280 --> 58:00.280\nA doctor told me when I was eight years old that I had a problem with my ears\n\n58:00.280 --> 58:02.280\nthat made me cry.\n\n58:02.280 --> 58:05.280\nDid he really say that?\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:10.280\nYeah, I had a doctor who diagnosed me with a severe ear imbalance,\n\n58:10.280 --> 58:12.280\nwhich meant that I couldn't measure space.\n\n58:12.280 --> 58:14.280\nHow convenient.\n\n58:14.280 --> 58:16.280\nYeah, exactly.\n\n58:16.280 --> 58:20.280\nAnd then my mother told me later that she told him to tell me that.\n\n58:20.280 --> 58:22.280\nOh!\n\n58:22.280 --> 58:24.280\nYou did it!\n\n58:24.280 --> 58:28.280\nOn that jerk note, let's enter the cave of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n58:28.280 --> 58:30.280\nOh, my God.\n\n58:30.280 --> 58:33.280\nOn a rare, unwritten freestyle moment,\n\n58:33.280 --> 58:35.280\n50 episodes anniversary of...\n\n58:35.280 --> 58:38.280\nThat's not anniversary, it's just 50 episodes of that.\n\n58:38.280 --> 58:43.280\nLast time, our heroes were scouring the depths of the ruins of Merchul\n\n58:43.280 --> 58:47.280\non the far away plain of Twyla, the twilight forest.\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:51.280\nAfter opening a large chambered door, they entered a treasure room\n\n58:51.280 --> 58:54.280\nthat appeared to house several treasures.\n\n58:54.280 --> 59:00.280\nAnd perhaps the fabled soul of growth that they had been seeking so earnestly.\n\n59:00.280 --> 59:03.280\nIt was just then they heard a voice echo throughout the chamber\n\n59:03.280 --> 59:08.280\nthat they saw a dragon come into view and immediately began combating it.\n\n59:08.280 --> 59:12.280\nAfter a time, they had thought they had gotten the upper hand on the dragon\n\n59:12.280 --> 59:17.280\nafter paralyzing its dick and doing other things to its dick.\n\n59:17.280 --> 59:20.280\nTogether, the group shot arrows at the dragon,\n\n59:20.280 --> 59:24.280\nand commanded magical scorpions.\n\n59:24.280 --> 59:28.280\nSharpie tried to get it to fall over laughing, but that didn't go so well.\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:32.280\nGrasping its dick firmly, Quark tried to get more into fire arrows\n\n59:32.280 --> 59:36.280\ndirectly into the beast's urethra, but that failed as well.\n\n59:36.280 --> 59:43.280\nGrasping a bear track, Chris de Burgh managed to snap off the tip of the dick\n\n59:43.280 --> 59:46.280\nwith his trusty trapsman skills.\n\n59:46.280 --> 59:52.280\nAfter which, Sharpie cast jump on himself, leaping cinematically onto the back of the beast.\n\n59:52.280 --> 59:56.280\nThrowing his flaming sword towards the wizard, Sharpie reared back\n\n59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.280\nand stabbed it directly into the beast's back, killing it in the last blow.\n\n01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:11.280\nThe group stood around to survey the corpse and the treasures they had unlocked.\n\n01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:19.280\nWow! You don't ever need to write one.\n\n01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.280\nI think I still will. I didn't feel comfortable with that.\n\n01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.280\nThey call that crossing the Harmon threshold. You just find out, I don't need to do anything.\n\n01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.280\nWell, that was my, like, not wanting to write.\n\n01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:40.280\nYeah, but you graduated pretty soon. You'll be taking baths instead of showers.\n\n01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.280\nAlright, so once again, reminders of our immediate surroundings, please.\n\n01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.280\nSo you were in that room, there was like a big staircase that led up to where all the treasure was,\n\n01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.280\nbut there was a huge crack. That's where the dragon came out of,\n\n01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.280\nand you were before the dragon, you were going to climb up there with rope.\n\n01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.280\nBut now he's dead, so like, you don't have anything threatening you,\n\n01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.280\nand so you can look around or whatever.\n\n01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.280\nThere's two statues, right?\n\n01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.280\nThere was this two giant statues, yeah, this point, no, there was three actually,\n\n01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.280\nand one of the arms fell off because you tried to climb the statues silently, Mulraine,\n\n01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.280\nand it knocked off its arm because, yeah, because it was made of vodka.\n\n01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.280\nShe spilled the arm.\n\n01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.280\nIt's like chunking goodies, just anything.\n\n01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280\nHold this map.\n\n01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.280\nI am like chunking, sweetie. True. Whose turn is that?\n\n01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280\nAt this point, we're not in combat time, so you guys can just do whatever you want.\n\n01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.280\nI start a party. Yeah.\n\n01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280\nI mean, you guys just killed a dragon.\n\n01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.280\nDragon dick party!\n\n01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.280\nIt's my dragon dick, there's a $10 cover.\n\n01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.280\nThis is Per Genevieve's recommendation, which is so good.\n\n01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.280\nCan I cut off the dragon's horn?\n\n01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.280\nYeah, yeah, definitely. It actually has two horns.\n\n01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.280\nCan I cut off both of them?\n\n01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.280\nI put my swords on my legs and on my arms, and I do like a slide.\n\n01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280\nIs that a thing?\n\n01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.280\nShe spills the knives to the floor.\n\n01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.280\nOh, the way that you're looking at me, Dan. I'm sorry.\n\n01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.280\nYou put swords at night on your arms?\n\n01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280\nThey're double-bladed.\n\n01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.280\nOn my legs, and I get at the forehead, and I slide down, like, spread eagle.\n\n01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.280\nDon't try to cut off the dick, I already did it.\n\n01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.280\nNo, I don't get it.\n\n01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.280\nYeah, yes.\n\n01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280\nLike a scissors?\n\n01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.280\nLike a cutting kick.\n\n01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280\nWhy are you trying to saw it off?\n\n01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.280\nI mean, women are different because women have more strength in their legs\n\n01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.280\nthan they do on their arms, so it's more at the top of my mind than my arms.\n\n01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280\nSo I put blades, can I put my, how many swords do I have?\n\n01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280\nA thousand?\n\n01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.280\nYou have a long sword.\n\n01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.280\nYou have one long sword.\n\n01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.280\nOkay.\n\n01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.280\nBut you tied to your foot.\n\n01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.280\nDo you want my rope? I have rope.\n\n01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.280\nI've got, like, three swords.\n\n01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280\nI tie all of my swords to Mulraine, so she's good.\n\n01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.280\nI tie a dragon's dick to her thigh.\n\n01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.280\nIt's like Jet Poet Society, everyone's just giving her swords.\n\n01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:17.280\nOkay, so Spencer, my idea is that I have a sword tied to my left calf,\n\n01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.280\nand a sword tied to my right calf.\n\n01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.280\nWhere's the dick?\n\n01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.280\nThe dick is on my head, like a top hat.\n\n01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.280\nLike an Abraham, like a top hat.\n\n01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.280\nLike a bachelorette party?\n\n01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280\nLike a Dr. Seuss, like a rave hat.\n\n01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.280\nYes, like the shortest marriage bachelorette party ever.\n\n01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.280\nI have a giant dick attached to my head, and I put out my legs,\n\n01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:45.280\nand I slide down to cut the horns off at the same time.\n\n01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.280\nIt feels like there's a more efficient way to achieve this.\n\n01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280\nHey, hey, hey, Chris, Chris.\n\n01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.280\nBut it's one move, but it's not about efficiency.\n\n01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.280\nI'm trying to do it, I'm trying to do it in one move.\n\n01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280\nThis is about having a party.\n\n01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.280\nNo, it's not. I'm trying to do it in one move.\n\n01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280\nIs there a difference?\n\n01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280\nGet both of the horns in one move?\n\n01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280\nYeah.\n\n01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.280\nOkay, see, now this makes slightly more sense.\n\n01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.280\nI hear you, I hear you.\n\n01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.280\nDo you think I want to get them at the same time?\n\n01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280\nAnd my arms are just strong if I put them on my legs.\n\n01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280\nAren't the pines like different turns?\n\n01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280\nWhat's up?\n\n01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280\nI mean, like I said, you're not really in combat time.\n\n01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280\nYou guys can do whatever.\n\n01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.280\nYeah, so the whatever you want to do is be awesome.\n\n01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280\nYes, you're tight.\n\n01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.280\nI want to go with Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.280\nI want to transcribe as much of this blood spellbook as possible.\n\n01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280\nYou want to study this book?\n\n01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280\nYeah.\n\n01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.280\nAll right.\n\n01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.280\nOr Genevieve suggested a sword cartwheel, if that's a possibility.\n\n01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.280\nA sword cartwheel.\n\n01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.280\nEither way, either way, legs, cartwheels, ropes.\n\n01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.280\nI mean, it's true to my own spirit if I just slide down with the two.\n\n01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.280\nHuddling together, Chris de Burgh and Sharpie pour over the book,\n\n01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.280\ntrying to study while Mulraine ties blades to her legs.\n\n01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.280\nHey, what's she trying to do?\n\n01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280\nRead, read.\n\n01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.280\nAll right.\n\n01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280\nSo I read the book.\n\n01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.280\nOkay.\n\n01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.280\nYou guys are reading the book.\n\n01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.280\nI get naked while this is happening.\n\n01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.280\nWalk up to the top of the steps of my lute and lay down and kind of like a Greek,\n\n01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.280\nlike urn pose, like just nude on my side.\n\n01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.280\nAnd watching them read the book and watching Mulraine tie soristers,\n\n01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.280\nI just start like serenading the whole thing.\n\n01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.280\nWell, actually, your serenade is so powerful that everyone stops what they're doing\n\n01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.280\nand is paying attention to your sermon.\n\n01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280\nWow, what is this?\n\n01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.280\nIt's not a sermon.\n\n01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:28.280\nOh, the dragon's dick is severed.\n\n01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.280\nOkay, guys, go ahead.\n\n01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280\nDo what you were doing.\n\n01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280\nDid you ask what they were saying?\n\n01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.280\nDid you ask what they were saying?\n\n01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.280\nI was just quietly being nude and playing my lute.\n\n01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.280\nYou're not being quiet and playing the lute.\n\n01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.280\nThere's no...\n\n01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:48.280\nOkay, I play the lady in red a song that nobody will notice.\n\n01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.280\nMulraine climbs to the top of the dragon and doing the maneuver she had mentioned earlier,\n\n01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.280\nwhich is still not fully understanding.\n\n01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280\nManages to not...\n\n01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.280\nIt's very awkward and strange.\n\n01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280\nArms are used for doing things.\n\n01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.280\nLegs are used for moving people around.\n\n01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.280\nNo, legs are...\n\n01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.280\nI take the dragon dick back.\n\n01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280\nLegs are strong.\n\n01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280\nLegs are strong.\n\n01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280\nThey can be strong, but they're not...\n\n01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280\nLadies, legs are strong.\n\n01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280\nThey don't handle swords.\n\n01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280\nThank you.\n\n01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.280\nThey don't...\n\n01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.280\nAll swords attached to her thighs.\n\n01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.280\nI take the dragon dick back.\n\n01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.280\nI take the dragon dick back from the head,\n\n01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280\nbecause I think it's going to get injured.\n\n01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280\nWell, that happens.\n\n01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.280\nBut, I mean, you jump on and you do your thing,\n\n01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280\nand that knocks the horns off.\n\n01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.280\nYeah, fuck you.\n\n01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280\nYou realized that...\n\n01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280\nOr, I mean, you didn't realize.\n\n01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.280\nYou always knew that dragon horns are quite magical.\n\n01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280\nFuck you, dragon.\n\n01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.280\nIt's fine, fuck everybody.\n\n01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.280\nI don't care.\n\n01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280\nI do, yeah, that's true.\n\n01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.280\nI do feel like after this experience,\n\n01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.280\nI have to go home and think about physics a little bit more.\n\n01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280\nYeah, I honestly...\n\n01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280\nThat was the first thing I thought about.\n\n01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.280\nYeah, I like the physics stuff in my head.\n\n01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.280\nI mean, wolves' jaws are strong.\n\n01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:06.280\nYou don't use them to, you know, lift up a manhole cover.\n\n01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.280\nWell, I just know that my legs are stronger than my arms,\n\n01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.280\nand I wanted to cut off both of the dragon's horns.\n\n01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280\nAnd that is what I...\n\n01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280\nThat's what I did.\n\n01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280\nAre we still reading the blood book?\n\n01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.280\nYeah, you guys are reading.\n\n01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.280\nIt's actually going to take some hours.\n\n01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.280\nI mean, but yeah.\n\n01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.280\nBut you're working on it.\n\n01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280\nWell, it's like we have hours.\n\n01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280\nWe take those hours.\n\n01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.280\nI mean, it seems like that dragon thing took hours, right?\n\n01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280\nIt didn't take hours.\n\n01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280\nIn combat time, that probably...\n\n01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280\nI mean, in actual, like, time-time,\n\n01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.280\nit probably maybe took, like,\n\n01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.280\nprobably not even 10 minutes.\n\n01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.280\nI just wanted to do it, and you wanted to find out\n\n01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280\nthe logistics of it.\n\n01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280\nIt's not my fault.\n\n01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280\nNothing matters.\n\n01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280\nProducers.\n\n01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280\nI'm not here to make friends!\n\n01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.280\nWoo!\n\n01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280\nJust kidding.\n\n01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.280\nI'm only here to make friends.\n\n01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.280\nBut yeah, so you guys are studying.\n\n01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.280\nYou're up there.\n\n01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.280\nI mean, you're in a room full of treasure.\n\n01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280\nOkay.\n\n01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280\nI examine the treasure.\n\n01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280\nI...\n\n01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280\nBecause they're all fucking about doing book reading\n\n01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280\nand dragon slicing,\n\n01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.280\nI go try to get my grubby little fingers in the...\n\n01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.280\nAre you still naked?\n\n01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280\nI'm still naked.\n\n01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280\nIt's important.\n\n01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.280\nYou know, it's weird,\n\n01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.280\nand D&D people often get naked.\n\n01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280\nYeah.\n\n01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280\nLike, not even for any reason,\n\n01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280\nother than to not have clothes.\n\n01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.280\nBut anyway, you open a treasure chest.\n\n01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.280\nI feel like the overlap of people who play D&D\n\n01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.280\nand who get to get naked around other people\n\n01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.280\nis maybe not as huge.\n\n01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.280\nThat's true.\n\n01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.280\nIt's, uh, it's wishful-filled.\n\n01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280\nSo, in the nude, I...\n\n01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280\nAnd no one laughed at me.\n\n01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280\nIs the unspoken...\n\n01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280\nWishful-fillment.\n\n01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.280\nYeah, that's the unspoken part after everything.\n\n01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.280\nLet's all literally get naked right now, everybody.\n\n01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.280\nI'm in.\n\n01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.280\nWhoa!\n\n01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.280\nAlright, so I examine the treasure.\n\n01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280\nYou examine the treasure.\n\n01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280\nI said you're opening a treasure chest.\n\n01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.280\nThe small chest opens with a soft click.\n\n01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.280\nOn the soft plush interior,\n\n01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.280\nyou see four identical silver rings.\n\n01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.280\nA small inscription reads,\n\n01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.280\nRing of Armor.\n\n01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280\nHmm.\n\n01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280\nI put it on.\n\n01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.280\nYou feel as if you have, you know,\n\n01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.280\nyou're stronger at walking attacks.\n\n01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.280\nThat's one of them?\n\n01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280\nOne of them says Ring of Armor?\n\n01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280\nThey all say, oh, I mean,\n\n01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.280\none inscription on the entire box.\n\n01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.280\nI first of all, before I put that on,\n\n01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.280\nI read all of the names off.\n\n01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.280\nSo, Ring of Armor.\n\n01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280\nRing of Armor.\n\n01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.280\nThe other one?\n\n01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.280\nThey're all the same.\n\n01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280\nOh, they're all Ring of Armor?\n\n01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.280\nThey're all Rings of Armor.\n\n01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280\nI take one Ring of Armor and I put it on,\n\n01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.280\nand I look down at the two guys reading books,\n\n01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280\nand Mulraine, Slice and Dragon,\n\n01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.280\nhorns off with their calves.\n\n01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.280\nAnd I grab everybody,\n\n01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.280\nand I throw them in a perfect throw.\n\n01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.280\nThey all, and I go, hey, everybody,\n\n01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.280\nstick a finger in the air.\n\n01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.280\nAnd then I do a little pirouette,\n\n01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.280\nand I cascade them down,\n\n01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280\nand they perfectly land down\n\n01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280\non each of their fingers.\n\n01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.280\nYeah, one of them does.\n\n01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.280\nThe other two.\n\n01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280\nIt's not what I said, Spencer.\n\n01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280\nI said it first.\n\n01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280\nFuck you, dude.\n\n01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280\nWhy don't you just hand them to us?\n\n01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280\nNow we have to go around looking for a ring.\n\n01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.280\nWhy don't you just saw off a dragon's horn?\n\n01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280\nI'm not making a big thing about it.\n\n01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280\nOh, God.\n\n01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280\nBecause I could do it in one swipe.\n\n01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280\nI know, I was inspired by you, Mulraine.\n\n01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280\nI saw her doing it fancy.\n\n01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.280\nI think I heard it going here.\n\n01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.280\nI think it's around here.\n\n01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.280\nOkay, so, so one lands on who?\n\n01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.280\nThe coomail gets it.\n\n01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.280\nThe other two falls on me.\n\n01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280\nWho's coomail?\n\n01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.280\nNo one's ever done that to me.\n\n01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.280\nExtra points.\n\n01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280\nYeah.\n\n01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.280\nYou gained 300 experience.\n\n01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280\nWow.\n\n01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.280\nThat's true.\n\n01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.280\nYou can take that to the bank.\n\n01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280\nWhat's a bank?\n\n01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.280\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.280\nI've never heard of that.\n\n01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280\nSharpie, sharpie gets one.\n\n01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.280\nJust don't mean a money changer.\n\n01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.280\nCan we bend over just to pick up the ring?\n\n01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280\nDwarves are celebrated bankers.\n\n01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280\nYeah, yeah, you do.\n\n01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280\nAll right, so we bend over and I pick up the ring.\n\n01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.280\nPeople have rings now.\n\n01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.280\nI pretend that I caught it with my finger.\n\n01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.280\nThank you, Mulraine.\n\n01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.280\nI guess I could just read off other treasures if you want to just look for treasure.\n\n01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280\nWe're still reading the book, right?\n\n01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.280\nThat's true, yeah, other than you caught the ring.\n\n01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:57.280\nOkay, I fashion a cart and pretend it's sharpie a drop and I just start running around our\n\n01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280\nsuper market sweep.\n\n01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.280\nI just start super market sweeping it around the treasure chamber.\n\n01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280\nOkay.\n\n01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.280\nI tied two carts to my legs.\n\n01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.280\nIt's going to slow you down though.\n\n01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280\nSorry, thank you.\n\n01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280\nYou find a magical liar of building.\n\n01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280\nI put that in the cart.\n\n01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.280\nThe magical liar of building?\n\n01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280\nA building, like a small liar.\n\n01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.280\nLike a musical instrument.\n\n01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280\nYeah.\n\n01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.280\nOkay, what's in my bag of holding?\n\n01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.280\nMost of your stuff.\n\n01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280\nDungeon snap.\n\n01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280\nNo, that's just how it works.\n\n01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.280\nThey hold a lot of stuff, so it's just most of your stuff's in it.\n\n01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.280\nWell, do you have any idea how much more shit I can put in it?\n\n01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280\nA fair amount.\n\n01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.280\nI'd say it's less than half full.\n\n01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.280\nAll right, well, I hand that off before I resume blood magic research.\n\n01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.280\nI give it to Peabody over there and say, hey, fill this up.\n\n01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.280\nWho's Peabody?\n\n01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.280\nMy friend.\n\n01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.280\nMy lifelong friend.\n\n01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280\nQuark.\n\n01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.280\nQuark.\n\n01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.280\nI'm Peabody?\n\n01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280\nHuh.\n\n01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280\nIt's my nickname.\n\n01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280\nYou're Peabody?\n\n01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280\nYeah.\n\n01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.280\nI also attempt to call him Peabody in order to affect more...\n\n01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280\nHey, Peabody.\n\n01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280\nWhat is it, snickerdoodles?\n\n01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.280\nThat's not...\n\n01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.280\nCall me Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280\nIn full.\n\n01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.280\nWhat is it, Chris de Burgh?\n\n01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.280\nPeabody also do what you're doing for a quart.\n\n01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.280\nOnly my friends can call me Peabody.\n\n01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.280\nAnd you know what?\n\n01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280\nOkay, Peabody.\n\n01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.280\nYou're my friend.\n\n01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280\nI knew it.\n\n01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280\nAll right, so I do what he said.\n\n01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280\nThat was heartwarming.\n\n01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280\nIt really was.\n\n01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280\nI'm happy.\n\n01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.280\nYou also find the goggles of minute seeing.\n\n01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.280\nLike binoculars?\n\n01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280\nWell, no.\n\n01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.280\nI mean, they're like little goggles that strap on your head.\n\n01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.280\nThey just see sand.\n\n01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.280\nI mean, you don't know what they just see until you put them on.\n\n01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.280\nI'm small. Can I have those?\n\n01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280\nI don't want those.\n\n01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.280\nI don't want to crawl to the halls and do minute seeing.\n\n01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.280\nYeah, I don't want that shit.\n\n01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.280\nOkay.\n\n01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280\nAll right.\n\n01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.280\nCan I inspect magic on the dragon's horns?\n\n01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.280\nYeah, they're intensely magical and you feel as if they can be used to power up spells\n\n01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.280\nor maybe make magical items or potions.\n\n01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.280\nCan I use that on the magic penis to see if it has anything?\n\n01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280\nWait, use what?\n\n01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.280\nWhatever she used on the horns to find out how good they are?\n\n01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.280\nOh, yeah, you didn't detect magic.\n\n01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.280\nYou just know that.\n\n01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280\nYeah, you can't detect magic, but yeah.\n\n01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280\nSorry.\n\n01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:28.280\nSo you can do that on the penis and that is also magical and less so than the horn,\n\n01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.280\nbut still magical.\n\n01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.280\nFuck!\n\n01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.280\nSo it's less magical plus I have to hold a penis.\n\n01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280\nYeah.\n\n01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280\nAnd it's pretty hefty.\n\n01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.280\nThis is a heavy penis.\n\n01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280\nYeah, it's a burden.\n\n01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.280\nSo as far as the spells go, I don't know what spells are available for these horns.\n\n01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.280\nCan I use them to make everybody in the party like me a lot?\n\n01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280\nWell, you don't know.\n\n01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.280\nYou aren't actually like a proper wizard by today.\n\n01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280\nYou're not a proper wizard.\n\n01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.280\nTruth.\n\n01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.280\nDungeon Master.\n\n01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.280\nSo how do I figure out what they're doing?\n\n01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.280\nI just said what I am.\n\n01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.280\nThat's not an insult.\n\n01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.280\nBut it's exciting.\n\n01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.280\nNo, it was awesome.\n\n01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.280\nOkay, thanks guys.\n\n01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.280\nWell, I was doing a bet.\n\n01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280\nI'm sorry guys.\n\n01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280\nI don't know what I can do with these horns.\n\n01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.280\nYou'd have to talk to a wise sage or someone who knows much about dragons.\n\n01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280\nIs that me?\n\n01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280\nNo.\n\n01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.280\nHey, it's not me.\n\n01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.280\nWould it be Sharpie or he's not a sage.\n\n01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.280\nHe's a mage.\n\n01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.280\nNah, you are a mage.\n\n01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280\nI mean, you know that.\n\n01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.280\nI mean, I only know how to kill him.\n\n01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.280\nWell, can I present the horns to Sharpie and maybe he'll have some ideas?\n\n01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.280\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.280\nSharpie, you actually know.\n\n01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280\nOh, oh, I should mention this.\n\n01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280\nYou all level up.\n\n01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:51.280\nYeah, I can't.\n\n01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.280\nI didn't have a cute up.\n\n01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.280\nBut yeah, now that you're leveled up, you know, brew potion.\n\n01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280\nThat's a feat you have now.\n\n01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:06.280\nSo you know that dragons horns can be used to make potions more, you know, powerful.\n\n01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.280\nSo like its effect would be heightened.\n\n01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.280\nOkay.\n\n01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.280\nSo I present the horns to Sharpie.\n\n01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.280\nHey, we're trying to read here.\n\n01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.280\nI'm just being a dick.\n\n01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:31.280\nI go around Charles Charles Berg, Christopher, sorry, and I present my horns to Sharpie\n\n01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.280\nand I say, I don't, I don't know what to do.\n\n01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.280\nDo you know?\n\n01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280\nNo.\n\n01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.280\nI don't know what to do.\n\n01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.280\nI'm such a dumb little archer.\n\n01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.280\nI have no idea.\n\n01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.280\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.280\nI immediately get an erection.\n\n01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.280\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.280\nIs that weird?\n\n01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.280\nSo weird perversion of, you know, women think that men like dumb women.\n\n01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:10.280\nNo, speaking of Celeste's thing at the end of King of the Nerds.\n\n01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.280\nCheck it out guys.\n\n01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:17.280\nAnyway, I'm doing a parody, but I, oh do do do.\n\n01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280\nTotal turn on.\n\n01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280\nOkay.\n\n01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280\nAll right.\n\n01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280\nHey bro, you, bro.\n\n01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280\nI redo that.\n\n01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280\nI redo that.\n\n01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280\nSharpie.\n\n01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280\nYes.\n\n01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.280\nI have in my possession two dragons horns.\n\n01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.280\nPut them in one of the bags.\n\n01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.280\nAll right.\n\n01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.280\nFirst of all, don't tell me what to do.\n\n01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280\nOkay.\n\n01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.280\nSecond of all, I'll put them in one of the, what did you say?\n\n01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.280\nBags.\n\n01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280\nWhy?\n\n01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280\nAre you able to measure them?\n\n01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280\nWhy is they contain things?\n\n01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.280\nBut I want you to tell me, I want you to tell me what they can do.\n\n01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.280\nI hear that you can tell me what they can do.\n\n01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280\nThey make potions more strong.\n\n01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.280\nI pretend to read the book and not listen to the fight.\n\n01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280\nAll right.\n\n01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280\nHold on.\n\n01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.280\nCan I talk to your producer?\n\n01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280\nI'm flummoxed by something.\n\n01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:07.280\nI want to stand atop the nearest mound of treasure and address my people.\n\n01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.280\nYou ascend a pile of 25,000 gold pieces.\n\n01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.280\nDoes anyone remember how we got here?\n\n01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280\nI remember.\n\n01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280\nYes.\n\n01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280\nMy dad needed something.\n\n01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:25.280\nWe wanted to get treasure and fortune.\n\n01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280\nWe got it, I think.\n\n01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.280\nNo, we wanted to figure out what that soul thing was.\n\n01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.280\nWhat was that thing?\n\n01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280\nThe soul of growth.\n\n01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.280\nYou were looking for the soul of growth.\n\n01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280\nThe soul of growth.\n\n01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.280\nThere was shards for a while.\n\n01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.280\nWhat have we become?\n\n01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280\nLook at us.\n\n01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.280\nIt's like a Stephen King novel.\n\n01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.280\nWe are the monsters.\n\n01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.280\nWe are the dragons.\n\n01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.280\nWe've lost our minds.\n\n01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.280\nI thought everybody was going cool until that you poochie poochie poochie poochie.\n\n01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.280\nThat was weird by any definition.\n\n01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280\nYeah.\n\n01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.280\nIt's not weird because Sharpie and I have had a romantic relationship and maybe that's\n\n01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280\nour language.\n\n01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.280\nMaybe that's how we express sexuality to each other.\n\n01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280\nIt's not weird.\n\n01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.280\nSharpie didn't seem to be on board.\n\n01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.280\nI'm fine with it.\n\n01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.280\nYou're right.\n\n01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.280\nI'm just trying.\n\n01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.280\nLet me try something else.\n\n01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.280\nHey, I'm quirk.\n\n01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:28.280\nAre you interested in these horns?\n\n01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.280\nIsn't he on top of the treasure pile now?\n\n01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.280\nHe's on top of the treasure pile.\n\n01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280\nHe's up there.\n\n01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.280\nCan we take all this treasure and bone the fuck out?\n\n01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280\nYeah.\n\n01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.280\nThat's always been an option.\n\n01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.280\nLet's get this loot and press forward.\n\n01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.280\nThe solo growth is not going to grow itself or soul.\n\n01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280\nWhat the hell did we do?\n\n01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280\nWe wanted the solo growth.\n\n01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.280\nWhat was the solo growth of the dragon?\n\n01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.280\nI left you guys because you guys were digging about in the woods and I said I'm going to\n\n01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.280\ngo try to become a better person and I sought out after this thing.\n\n01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.280\nIs this the place where the infinite fish landed?\n\n01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.280\nYeah.\n\n01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.280\nWe're not even on goddamn earth.\n\n01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:09.280\nWhat are we doing with our lives?\n\n01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.280\nWe got eaten by a fish.\n\n01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.280\nI have a script due.\n\n01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.280\nThat's long since gone.\n\n01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.280\nWe got dragon horns.\n\n01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.280\nWe got all the money we can carry.\n\n01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280\nNow you guys can read that book.\n\n01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.280\nWe can cast some spells.\n\n01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.280\nIt's been a good day.\n\n01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.280\nIt's been an okay day.\n\n01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:39.280\nWho's got swords all over her legs?\n\n01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.280\nLet's take stock.\n\n01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.280\nLet's find the most likely exit and get down to biz.\n\n01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.280\nThe exit of the solo growth.\n\n01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:54.280\nThen we have to exit the world that the infinite fish vomited and assigned to.\n\n01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:59.280\nI just wanted to know what was in the horns.\n\n01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.280\nIf they make magic stronger, magic potion stronger.\n\n01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.280\nThat's a bigger fish.\n\n01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.280\nLet's just leave this area.\n\n01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.280\nStop freaking out.\n\n01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.280\nI'm having adventure phobia.\n\n01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.280\nI'm starting to feel like I'm...\n\n01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.280\nI pretend like I'm asleep.\n\n01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.280\nStop that.\n\n01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.280\nI strike out in the direction...\n\n01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.280\nThere's a light source, right?\n\n01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.280\nI'm either one who knows where the soul of growth is.\n\n01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.280\nIt's supposed to be in these ruins.\n\n01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.280\nGuys, yeah?\n\n01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.280\nHaven't we explored all the ruins yet?\n\n01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.280\nNo.\n\n01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.280\nHe's still treasure chopping.\n\n01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.280\nWhy do you pretend this is a wedding and go for it?\n\n01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.280\nWhere do we go?\n\n01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.280\nWe've got to go back up because we've fallen down, right?\n\n01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.280\nI sent the staircase to look for a doorway.\n\n01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.280\nYou don't see a doorway.\n\n01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.280\nHowever, you do see a massive sarcophagus surrounded by more treasure than you haven't picked up yet.\n\n01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.280\nI opened the sarcophagus.\n\n01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.280\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.280\nTexas.\n\n01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.280\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280\nThere could be a giant fucking mummy in there.\n\n01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280\nWe just killed the dragon.\n\n01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.280\nWe got horns.\n\n01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.280\nWe got potions.\n\n01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:24.280\nNone of that means that we want to fight a mummy now.\n\n01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.280\nOkay, I examine the writing.\n\n01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.280\nIs there any writing?\n\n01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.280\nI should mention you're illiterate.\n\n01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.280\nBut yeah, there's no writing.\n\n01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.280\nAh, Jeff's nightmare.\n\n01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.280\nWelcome to Jeff's nightmare.\n\n01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.280\nOh, it says no mummy here.\n\n01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.280\nSay the word Jeff.\n\n01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280\nJeff.\n\n01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.280\nWho's Jeff?\n\n01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.280\nNo, no shit.\n\n01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:58.280\nI pointedly clear my throat and pull out a pair of prop glasses that I keep on me and put them on.\n\n01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.280\nAnd I examine the coffin.\n\n01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280\nAgain, no writing.\n\n01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.280\nWhat?\n\n01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.280\nDo coffins normally have writing on them?\n\n01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.280\nWe're not coffin experts.\n\n01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280\nDo you serve a coffin guy?\n\n01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.280\nI wouldn't know.\n\n01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.280\nHieroglyphs are technically writing.\n\n01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280\nWhat does this thing mean on it?\n\n01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.280\nWoodstone obsidian?\n\n01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.280\nI'd say obsidian.\n\n01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.280\nAre there any other doorways in this room that we're in?\n\n01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.280\nNo.\n\n01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280\nThere was the one you came in.\n\n01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280\nAll right, well, let's open this.\n\n01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.280\nI opened the coffin, the sarcophagus.\n\n01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.280\nOpening the sarcophagus, you see a bizarre sight.\n\n01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.280\nResting in the coffin is a skeleton wrapped in plants.\n\n01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.280\nGod damn it.\n\n01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.280\nThin tendrils are wrapped around the body,\n\n01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.280\ncovering it in ivy leaves and small blossoms and flowers,\n\n01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.280\nin all manner of strange foreign plants cover its body.\n\n01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.280\nOn the breast of the skeleton is a perfectly spherical amber orb.\n\n01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280\nYou can see that inside the orb is a strange plant\n\n01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.280\nthat is changing states between seeds, seedlings,\n\n01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.280\ntree and flower.\n\n01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.280\nThe inside of the orb is always shifting,\n\n01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.280\nand if you touch it, you get the sense of vitality.\n\n01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.280\nThe salt of growth.\n\n01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.280\nI literally got chills down my spine.\n\n01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.280\nJust unironically excited.\n\n01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280\nOh, stick or doodle.\n\n01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.280\nOkay, that's not, it's not catching on.\n\n01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.280\nNobody's on board.\n\n01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.280\nOkay, that's another whiff.\n\n01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.280\nI say Sharpie.\n\n01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.280\nYou're kind of the Hannibal of this A-Team.\n\n01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.280\nWhy don't you go up there and play the right song\n\n01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:32.280\nwhen I pick it up?\n\n01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280\nI pick it up.\n\n01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280\nYou pick it up.\n\n01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.280\nYou feel nature's magnificence filling you.\n\n01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:46.280\nIt's obviously a powerful artifact.\n\n01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.280\nYou get the sense that it's the soul of growth or something.\n\n01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.280\nIt swirls like well water in my head.\n\n01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.280\nBut if I focus, I can feel it.\n\n01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.280\nA million thoughts of a million people calling out.\n\n01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.280\nHi.\n\n01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.280\nHi.\n\n01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.280\nD&D Cliffhanger.\n\n01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.280\nHi.\n\n01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.280\nThank you, Genevieve.\n\n01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.280\nThank you, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.280\nKumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.280\nSpencer Crittin.\n\n01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280\nOne more time.\n\n01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.280\nWe did it.\n\n01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:29.280\nWe found the soul of growth.\n\n01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.280\nYeah, we don't want to go down the road of picking and choosing,\n\n01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.280\nbut I'm going to say worst D&D chapter ever.\n\n01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.280\nNo, that was a shitfest.\n\n01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.280\nJust by any metric.\n\n01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.280\nIf you measure it by how much we got done, zero.\n\n01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.280\nNothing.\n\n01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.280\nWe hung out.\n\n01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.280\nWe went shopping.\n\n01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.280\nNothing happened.\n\n01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.280\nIt was like watching, I imagine,\n\n01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.280\nlike watching Desperate Housewives or whatever you call it,\n\n01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.280\nlike the Real Housewives of Orange County or whatever.\n\n01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.280\nUsually people say we look for treasure\n\n01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.280\nand I say the names of the treasure\n\n01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.280\nand people don't interrupt me\n\n01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.280\nand I finish explaining all the treasure.\n\n01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.280\nOh, baby, I'm not, that's not a critique on you.\n\n01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280\nI know, no, I don't think it is.\n\n01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280\nIt's a critique on us.\n\n01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.280\nIf you want more things to happen.\n\n01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.280\nOh, no, no, baby, baby.\n\n01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.280\nThat's not, that's not, everyone knows\n\n01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.280\nthat you're good at what you do.\n\n01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280\nI'm trying to help.\n\n01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.280\nNo, well, John, I mean, we're unhelpable.\n\n01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280\nWe're the worst.\n\n01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280\nSometimes we're just...\n\n01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280\nThat was madness.\n\n01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280\nI still enjoy it, just to be clear for everyone.\n\n01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280\nI love this.\n\n01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.280\nI think it's okay.\n\n01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.280\nLike my friend Neil Goldman used to say on Community,\n\n01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.280\nlike, ah, a bad piece of pizza is still pizza.\n\n01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280\nNot so good to say.\n\n01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.280\nYou know, you read the Onion A.V. review,\n\n01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280\nand you go, eh, whatever.\n\n01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.280\nStill an episode of Community.\n\n01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.280\nYeah, I mean, after playing D&D a million times,\n\n01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280\nI'm still intimidated.\n\n01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.280\nI'm going to do something wrong in some way,\n\n01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280\nbut it was still...\n\n01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.280\nWell, I assume you're over that anxiety now.\n\n01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.280\nI think we've all leapt headlong over that.\n\n01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.280\nWell, no, I still feel like I'm going to fuck shit up.\n\n01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.280\nEven when I do something bold, like open a sarcophagus,\n\n01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280\neverybody freaks out and tells me I'm a bad person.\n\n01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280\nThat's just me.\n\n01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280\nI'm a chicken.\n\n01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.280\nI just want to look at things.\n\n01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280\nCan I speak to that?\n\n01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.280\nIs that you're from an age in which D&D was very much about torturing\n\n01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.280\nplayers by the Dungeon Masters.\n\n01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.280\nLike, you'd walk into the room and the door would eat you,\n\n01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.280\nand if you kill the door, then the floor will try and strangle you.\n\n01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.280\nAnd if you do that, there's a treasure chest,\n\n01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.280\nand if you open that, it'll bite your face off.\n\n01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280\nLike, that's literally how it goes.\n\n01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.280\nSo it makes a lot of sense that your, like, style is very cautious.\n\n01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.280\nWell, you're acting like it's like a generational thing.\n\n01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280\nIt is.\n\n01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280\nNo, no.\n\n01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.280\nFor 25 years, after the spin doctors, we started like...\n\n01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.280\nYou walk up to an owl bear, and you're like,\n\n01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.280\nfuck you, what are you, an owl or a bear?\n\n01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.280\nA lot of those monsters, like, there's a thing that was a tree stump\n\n01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.280\nwith a rabbit on it, but if you approached it, it would eat you.\n\n01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.280\nYeah, like, those got phased out because they weren't fun.\n\n01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280\nThey were just tortures.\n\n01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280\nThat's interesting.\n\n01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.280\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.280\nSo, like, Gary Gygax loved that shit.\n\n01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.280\nSo, but, I mean, as the game evolved, it got involved.\n\n01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.280\nYou know, I talked to him on the phone.\n\n01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280\nNo.\n\n01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.280\nIs he dead?\n\n01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.280\nI think, yeah, he's dead.\n\n01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280\nHe's...\n\n01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280\nYeah.\n\n01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280\nI talked to him on the phone once.\n\n01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280\nYeah, I...\n\n01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280\nRob Schrab made a comic book called Skud the Disposable Assassin.\n\n01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.280\nWhen I was...\n\n01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.280\nIt's great.\n\n01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:16.280\nWhen I was your age, young man, we had a...\n\n01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.280\nWe did an issue, the comic book, that was, like, a special, like, Skud went to D&D World\n\n01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.280\nfor an issue, and we wanted to have the cover be, like...\n\n01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280\nAnd I had...\n\n01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280\nI talked to...\n\n01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280\nWe were looking for a specific artist.\n\n01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.280\nThe guy was his name.\n\n01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280\nTeasley?\n\n01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280\nBeasley?\n\n01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280\nEasley.\n\n01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280\nYeah.\n\n01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280\nWe wanted to...\n\n01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.280\nThe old school, like, first edition Dungeon Masters guide.\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.280\nLike, we wanted that style of oil painting for the cover of the thing.\n\n01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.280\nAnd the only guy that had that guy's number was Gary Gygax, and I had to talk to him on\n\n01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.280\nthe phone and just talk to him for a little bit, and then I think he died a week later.\n\n01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.280\nAlso, you know who else died?\n\n01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.280\nKenwa Akibe.\n\n01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.280\nAuthor.\n\n01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.280\nOh.\n\n01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280\nHe's dead.\n\n01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.280\nHe's another guy that I've been bringing up lately.\n\n01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.280\nWho should I bring up tonight, like, randomly?\n\n01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.280\nI think half of the members of Enigma are gonna...\n\n01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280\nAre in trouble.\n\n01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.280\nThere's gonna be a weird, private jet crash.\n\n01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280\nAlright, so Harmon, 50...\n\n01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.280\n50 podcast episodes of that.\n\n01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.280\n50 podcast rap.\n\n01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280\nOh, yeah?\n\n01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.280\nAlright.\n\n01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.280\nWhich...\n\n01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.280\nWhich beat do you want?\n\n01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.280\nLet's see, half-bounds...\n\n01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.280\nDo the...\n\n01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.280\nDo the...\n\n01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.280\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.280\nYo, break down 50 episodes.\n\n01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.280\nFuck your mama so hard,

01:28:42.280\nBroke her left leg.\n\n01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.280\nAnd her right leg, too.\n\n01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.280\nFucked your mama, and I came white blue.\n\n01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280\nStuck her to the wall.\n\n01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280\nMailed her to China.\n\n01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.280\nFucked your mama, and it couldn't be finer.\n\n01:28:50.280 -->
