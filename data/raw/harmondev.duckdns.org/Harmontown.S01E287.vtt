Good morning, everybody.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nGood morning, Daniel.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nHow'd you sleep?\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nDid you have any great dreams?\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.000\nGood, yeah.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nYou sounded like you were having a nightmare.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nAnd you were there.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nI was merely a fly who dreamt of being a man.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nAnd now the fly has awakened.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nOh, that's great.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nLet's see.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nWhat have we got here?\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnd then let's get back to bed.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nWe ordered french fries.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nNo, we didn't.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:33.000\nAll right, composite sketches in true crime shows.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:40.000\nI noticed that in all stories, true crime stories,\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nin which the composite sketch actually plays an active role,\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:49.000\nthe people are always like, and the sketch came through.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:53.000\nAnd when you look, and then we found him at the train station,\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:58.000\nhe looks exactly, you could, it's like they drew a photograph of him\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nand then they show it split screen and it's either,\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nit's like the most information you could get from a composite sketch\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nis the person's race.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nLike that's it.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nAll it is is just a racist drawing of either a white guy\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nor a black guy or a Hispanic guy.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nIt never looks anything like the guy.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:20.000\nIf it's a white guy, it looks like maybe the darkness of the hair is represented.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nBut they always do this big thing about how accurate the sketch was.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nIt's never accurate.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:31.000\nAnd police work doesn't seem to work.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nEyewitness accounts are garbage.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nSo the sketch by nature is going to be garbage.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nYeah, it's pretty crazy how people just get shit wrong.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nThe amount of like, what do you call them,\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nunjust, what are the technical terms,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:54.000\nthe wrongful convictions.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nChurch for the wind.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nThe wrongful convictions that are turned over, it's fucking crazy.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nLike when we came out with DNA and we opened that box and we're like,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\noh man, everyone in prison is like, it's like a crapshoot.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nIt is crazy, but there's a thing called the Innocence Project.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nI hope people know about it.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nIt is amazing.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nThere's a lot.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nWhat was the thing though?\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nThere was a little, there was like, who is it?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nThere was some case where the guy was like railing against the Innocence Project a little bit.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nBill Cosby.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nNo.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nNo.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nThat would be amazing if he just bothered to, he's like, well, I'm here.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nHe's just ragging them up.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:38.000\nSince my stock can't go down anymore, I may as well experience being a villain.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:42.000\nI'm trying to do old Cosby.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.000\nBut no, there was somebody, I can't remember who it was, but they were in the difficult\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.000\nposition of like, I don't know, some crazy case.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd then they were saying like, yeah, but the.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nYou must have quit.\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:00.000\nThe Innocence Project like wanted, they were claiming that the Innocence Project was like\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:04.000\npressuring them to, to fuck man.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nIt's like, it's not, it wasn't quite as simple as, because the Innocence Project isn't going\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nto want you to plea, plea out necessarily, but it was like something close to that where\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:17.000\nbasically because the guy wouldn't just do the thing that would make the Innocence Project\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nput another notch in their belt, they just, they just dropped them like a rock because\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nhe was sticking to his actual convictions.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nYeah.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nAnd I can't remember what the fuck it was, but anyways, whatever.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nI mean, Gandhi was an asshole too.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nYou can look it up.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nLike, like, like, like, it's a.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nLet's not look it up.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nLet's dive.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:39.000\nLet's have a deep dive tonight into what made Gandhi an asshole.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nI think, I think he was racist.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:47.000\nMaybe I like, like against like maybe some race that maybe when he was growing up beat\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nup his dad.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nTonight on Harmontown, but you know, the irony is he would eat.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nHe ate that race that tonight on harm.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nIt was ravenous for them.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.000\nNo, I.\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\nI love that.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nBut more importantly, we need to understand, I would urge us.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:09.000\nI don't care what we think anymore, but I like, we got to stop our hero worship.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nLike who care?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nGandhi, I'm sure he, you know, he probably like, he probably like owed somebody money.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou know, he probably cheated at cards.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd he loved eating that race.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nWho cares?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nYou know, he did something.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:21.000\nHe did one.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nHe did a good thing.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nYou know, somebody makes an album.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nIt's a good album.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:29.000\nThen you find out that they're a bad unicyclist like an all of a sudden fucking world falls\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\napart.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nLike, like.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nI just let's assume everyone sucks.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nAnd then we'll be like, we're just begrudgingly interacting with anyone.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nSo it's like, yeah, he made that movie.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nYeah, we actually, we've fallen from this world where everybody was, you know, things were\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nso much classier and more heroic and gilded.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nBut yeah, we all also know that every time we pop the hood on any one of these people\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:57.000\nfrom for that survives into the modern world, like they end up, it's like, Oh God, they\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nwere a horrible piece of shit.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:03.000\nThat's like the invitation there should probably be, you know, we got to stop expecting people\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nto be either gods or monsters, whatever.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nYou've heard the yammer.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:14.000\nMaybe the inspiration we can draw is that people are amazing even when they're just people.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nSo instead of us like judging the past, we could sort of be inspired by the fact that\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:23.000\ndespite the fact that Martin Luther King had mistresses and did all sorts of crazy sex\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nstuff and smoke marijuana that just came out.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd also as a co-kid that also just came out that we could still be inspired by him.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nYeah.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nI mean, that's that's always been a good classic example because it's like so it's it's like\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\na yeah, Martin Luther King cheated.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nLike he sees he was he was a philanderer.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nHe was like, he was not a perfect person.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nHe was like, and it's like, God damn, can yeah, like, like, I don't know.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:49.000\nIt's it's hard.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nNot bad for somebody who isn't perfect.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nThe problem is that we invented like all this technology that we can use to like it's\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\na black light.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:01.000\nLike we look at each other and then but like people are supposed to just be people.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\nThat's what you're saying.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:08.000\nI just think it's crazy because why does someone assume that because you're good at rallying\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:12.000\npeople to fight for the rights, you're an excellent husband.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nThat's the thing that's the disconnect that's happening.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\nAnd that's the putting on a pedestal behavior, which is unhealthy and usually comes with\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nnot viewing someone as a real person.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.000\nSo in a way is kind of maybe dehumanizing after its fashion because we because it's\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nhero worship because hero worship gives us and I'm as guilty as anybody like we you want\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:35.000\nto you want to live in a world where people become the focus, you know, like like individuals\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:42.000\nso that you can go, OK, well, if that person turned out to be racist or a woman beater\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nor whatever it's good, that's a that was a close call because I was going to have to\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nstop eating meat for a second there.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nAnd like like we focus on these people and then we go like but it's funny our capacity\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:58.000\nfor it doesn't always take the form of like cynicism like we we collectively but I think\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:05.000\nwe we do it like the wave like we one section of the Coliseum like rises up and says this\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:09.000\nguy was the guy of Comey 2012.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nRemember that guy?\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:17.000\nThat guy that made that video that that pretty much through no fault of his own just happened\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nto be viewed by 80 billion people.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd and then so then like while half of the world was like this is amazing.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:30.000\nIt automatically makes the other half of your body go like why is it amazing?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nLet's let's ask questions of the guy ends up in his street in the underwear in the underwear\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\njerking off in the San Diego street in his underwear.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nI think that is a very interesting point.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:46.000\nI wonder if there's science to that because you do get a sense that people tend to bifurcate\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\ninto like binaries.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.000\nIt's like if there's going to be a yes, then there's naturally going to be a no.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:56.000\nYeah, it's like and it's more about like like a gut instinct or like a sociological thing\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nmore than it is about the actual facts in a situation ever.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nYeah, I guess I always feel that way.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:07.000\nLike it's like, oh, I thought I liked so and so like you want to you want to get all in\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nfor some reason like it's easier.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:15.000\nWe should recognize it as a truly lethal instinct though this this this this this taste we have\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:24.000\nfor admiration of people because it's a it's a prelude to it's like a vampire bite.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nIt's like we're like hungry for their neck and we act like just because it's flattering\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:33.000\nin the first step that the that we're not doing what we're doing, which is like we're\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\ngoing to we're going to hurt that person.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:39.000\nThere's this new thing where everyone is swapping out now Donald Glover based on his performance\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nthis weekend for Kanye.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\nPoop de scoop.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nThey're saying on Twitter.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nWell, I don't even know what that I don't worry about it.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nIt's all bad.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:53.000\nSo it's this idea that like, oh, these people are interchangeable and Kanye failed us.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nAnd now we good.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nThank God that he showed right up Donald Glover is right here and we we have our rapper.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:03.000\nIt's a crazy thing and you're like, oh, these two are not related at all.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nOne person can be having a mental breakdown and the other person be having a great moment\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:11.000\nin history and they're not either one or in service to you at all.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:16.000\nSo it's crazy to watch us within 24 hours within a week.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nBe like, well, we're done with Kanye.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nWho's next?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nOh, how convenient.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:21.000\nHe's there.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nI mean, it's a total.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nYeah.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nWell, that's look at what we do with our movie remakes and stuff.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:32.000\nWe just go like, oh, breaking bad guy is bald now because he's not breaking bad.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nHe should be Lex Luthor.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nYeah, it's like the dumbest shit.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nAnd that's where that's where racism comes from, too, because you go you go like, oh,\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nif you recognize if you can connect baldness as a dot, you sure are going to connect a\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:49.000\nrapper and blackness and like specifically, you know, Donald is a fan of Kanye and like\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nclearly heavily influenced by him.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.000\nBut but like, yeah, it is it is like fucked up that your brain goes there and goes, but\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.000\nwe've always had that.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nIt's like, you could only have one Kevorkian at a time.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:02.000\nYou can only have one Dr. Ruth at a time, one Madonna, like Johnny Carson comes out.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nHe's going to make a there's only there's only five jokes you can tell.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd so who's the slut tarot card?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nIs it Madonna or is it Dolly Parton because of her giant tits or, you know, like through\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nthe decades?\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nDolly Parton.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nIt kind of you kind of pick one, you know, the concept of Godwin's law like Dolly Parton\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:27.000\nis really just saying like we do pick famous archetypes and just you run with those like\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nwhat's relevant.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nAnd so the bad one is Hitler.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nYou can see that.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nDolly Parton.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nShe's the good one.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nWhat is it?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nYou keep you always hated part.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nWhy?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nWhat's your beef with Dolly Parton?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nNo, I'm just saying she's sexier than Hitler.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nYeah, I'm going to disagree.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nIt's controversial.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nYeah, it is.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:51.000\nI think that it's important to understand this stuff because it's like what you're what\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nwe're talking about is like this oversimplification or something, this very late mental laziness.\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd like, I think we need to understand the aspects of our human mind that do that because\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nlike, for instance, I don't know, you tend to forget like you forget a phone number.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.000\nIf you know a phone number is in your phone because your brain makes a mental shortcut.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:13.000\nIt's like your brain's always defragging and trying to do things to save space and it's\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nmaking bad judgments and stereotypes to save space.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nAnd we need to understand that.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nBut I think the concept of even admitting that is like it makes certain people insecure\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nor not feeling control or have to deny it.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd it's like, no, it's very freeing to understand what's actually going on behind the engine.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:35.000\nWe just have to, you know, take that into account because we do have a car that needs to not break.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nRight.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nYeah, you could forgive yourself.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nRight.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nYou could go, oh, there I go again being human.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nI guess.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nChange the oil.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:49.000\nI fucked up like because I'm a fucking monkey with a fucking robot brain stuck into my head\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nby a God that really just is experimenting as he goes.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:58.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm wound up and I'm like not used to living in concrete instead of a jungle.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nAnd I fucked up.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nI'm a monster right in that moment.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nSo like.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nYeah.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:06.000\nYeah.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nBecause we also, here's the other thing, we don't know how to cope with happiness either\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nfor the same reason.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nLike we.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nI'm getting there.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nYeah.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nAre you learning how to cope with happiness?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nGetting there.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nYeah.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nI got the therapist, the therapist ordered, she didn't order me.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nShe told me that's the last thing.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nLike I got to, I have to learn how to process happiness.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nYou want to, you want to go to the Buddhist temple with me tomorrow?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nThat's not how you process happiness.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nYou fucking hippie.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nWow.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nSorry.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nHe's right.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nHe's right.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nHe's right.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nHe's right.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nHe's right.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nHe's right.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:42.000\nI saw Spencer going into egg slut one morning.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.000\nOh yeah.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd he yelled at me and I heard a yell that sounded like Rob Schrab.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nAnd I was like Rob Schrab, he doesn't be in Glendale.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nAnd I turned around.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nIt was like seven o'clock in the morning.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:58.000\nAnd it was some other car that I didn't recognize and I didn't see him.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nBut I was like, I'm certain that was a Rob Schrab noise.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nBut I don't see any Rob Schrab sources.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nI screamed egg slut.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nAnd shamed him.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nAs you were going.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nWhat did I think you said?\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nI texted you what I thought you said.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nYou said, I thought you said exit.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nExit.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nExit.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nYeah.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nI thought some like my first instinct was someone was telling me to leave.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nThat makes more sense than calling a business egg slut.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nYeah.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nSlut.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nYeah.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nI always knew you were such a slut.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.000\nHow much do you?\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nSuch a slut.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nAll these videos now, that Glover video.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nYou're such a slut, Spencer.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nYou're egg slut.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nI love eggs.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nI always knew.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nI always knew.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nI could always tell you you're such a little egg slut.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nSo loose with eggs.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nYou're so slutty with those eggs.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nEgg slut.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nNext to VL4.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nI want to know what Dan's thought was.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nWell, I just wonder.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nI have the old school question about it, which probably doesn't even apply anymore.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nBecause I think it's kind of.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nThese are real names of businesses.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nI'm just wondering.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nEgg slut.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nWondering.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nTexaco.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nYellow fever.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nBaskin Robbins.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nWhat is going on?\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:10.000\nWhat kind of pop goes the world bullshit are we living in?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nWhat?\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:16.000\nSpencer, my Dungeon Master is walking into egg slut as I'm on the way to LA Fitness to\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\ndo push ups.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nIn Glendale.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nIn Glendale.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nYeah.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nI was just wondering.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nAnd the world keeps on turning.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nIt keeps turning.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nOne day turns into the next day.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd now I'm talking about my Dungeon Master going into egg slut before I go into LA Fitness\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nto do push ups.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nIn Glendale.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nIt's the promos for push ups.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nGood thing George Carlin's dead.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nYou're the new George Carlin.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nI know.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:54.000\nThere can't be two old white guys doing this.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nYou think I'm white?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nYou were saying you'd watched a bunch of videos.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nI don't know what all these Donald Glover videos are.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:05.000\nI watched a childish video and I was just, I'm just, I'm just finding myself wondering\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nbecause I'm 45.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:14.000\nLike, wait, do you think, are the, are the, are the, are the wonors, wonors?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nNo.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nThat's all CG.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nOh yeah.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nI was wondering about that.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nYou don't think there is some compositing?\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:25.000\nWell, I'm sure there's, and he's like, nothing really went in front of the camera, but I\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nmean, there was one when they go with just before.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.000\nI mean, if you sit down and look at, if you look at something like Birdman, if you're\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nwatching for it, you could kind of say, oh, they probably did it there.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nIt's like a camera turn or something like that.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nI'd have to go through it.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nWell, I'm saying what this, but at this point, do you think if you go through it, because\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.000\nI remember that's where we were with the Collier Boy friend video.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nLike I was like watching and like, okay, okay, they changed there.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nThey changed there.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:56.500\nBut now I think we're at the point where they might have, you could, you don't, you don't\n\n17:56.500 --> 18:02.000\nhave to have a fucking waiter walk through frame in order to like fake a, a winner.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nRight.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nThat's true.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:08.000\nI mean, I'm sure they did as much of it as humanly possible, just knowing, knowing.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nKnowing those crazy guys.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nI do not think it was a winner.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nYeah.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:18.000\nBut they made it look effortless and they made it look seamless.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:24.000\nSo, you know, they deserve, they deserve, they deserve my thumbs up.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nI'm going to click on that.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nAdd it to the 10 million views.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nI just saw what I pulled it up.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nYeah.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nAnd that's just since yesterday.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nThat's, that's quite a Monday morning when nobody wants to work.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nThat's going to triple.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nI really got to watch that Atlanta show.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nYeah.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nDid you like the video that you watched?\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nYes, I did.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nI guess you're kind of compelled to be.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nYeah.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:53.000\nBut I like Atlanta for the same reason I thought those are very interesting music videos just\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nbecause it's like, I, I don't know.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nI can't.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nWho could make this?\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nIt's like, it's just like, it's, I want to see it because it's like, I couldn't do\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nit.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nIt's from outside your, your world.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nYeah.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nIt's from outside your tendencies.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nIt's from outside.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nYeah.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:11.000\nI mean, that's, that's the crazy thing about Glover is like when, when he was just the\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:19.000\nfunny kid on the set, like you still knew he had a 350 IQ and there was always something\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nfrightening underneath about it.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nLike because he was just so fucking smart.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:30.000\nAnd, and you could see that he would just, it was like, he was just, he was like a stem\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\ncell, but that's not, not the way Bob Dylan was where there's a lot of detractors of Bob\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.000\nDylan where they go like, oh, all he did was hang out and like learn, learn shit.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.000\nLike, I don't think, I don't think Glover's like that.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:49.000\nLike, it was just like, he was young, but he was like, he's just like, like, like, like\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:55.500\nhe's, he's, he could have done anything and now he's like at that century post and it's\n\n19:55.500 --> 19:59.000\nlike just from outside.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nThat's all you know is that it's lateral.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nLike it's, it's, it's, it's, it's crazy.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:08.000\nLike, like I haven't watched the fucking show yet, but, but I, but I watched that video\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:13.000\nand I read his, his profile piece in, in whatever magazine was.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd it was like, oh, that was always when you look backwards, you can see so clearly\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:25.000\nthe, the, the growth, but like looking forward, you would never know if you went back in time\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nand you were like, he's gonna, he's gonna do that.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nYou ever think you two will make up?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nI don't think we're fighting.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:37.000\nI'm trying to start something.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:42.000\nI remember him saying in his Instagram and he hoped he didn't, I didn't hate him or whatever.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nDid you ever reply to anything?\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nI've seen him since then.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nYeah.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:53.000\nWe had, we had, we had a little meet and greet like probably two years ago now.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nFor Deadpool cartoons.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nIt wasn't for Deadpool.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nA different cartoon?\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nNo.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nAre you sure?\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:07.000\nIt wasn't, we ended it, we, we, we, we, we, we were just catching up.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nYeah.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nYeah.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:13.000\nSee that, that Affinity War?\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nYou ever see that show?\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nYeah.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nYeah.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nAffinity War came out.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nYou talking about the Marvel movie?\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nPretty sure he's talking about the movie.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\nYeah.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nThe guys are in it.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:25.000\nLet's do Rob Schrab's top three Infinity War spoilers.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nOkay.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nThere's a segment.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nAll right.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nNumber one.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nInfinity War rap.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nWho gives me a beat?\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nWe all do.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nNumber four.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nWait.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nInfinity Wars.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nThe spoilers are here.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:48.000\nIt's time to hear what happened in Infinity Wars before you see it.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:55.000\nThe Infinity Gauntlet is, which is.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nShame on you.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nThat could be nice actually.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nA beat like that.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nYou get it.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nWell, okay.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nAm I, Brad?\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nWhat?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nI said the format is fucking up my shit.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nLet's start from scratch.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nBecause I like this segment.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nLet's take this back.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nHere's how we do it.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nGod.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:15.000\nWe'll do a beat.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nWe'll do a beat while I rap.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:22.000\nAnd then we'll, I'll rap for two measures.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nI think they're called measures, right?\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nBars.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nBars?\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nBars.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nThe show opens in three nights, people.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nI rap for two bars.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nI remember like the joke Jeff does.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nAnd then, and then, and then drop, drop the bottom out of that fucker.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nGo, go dry.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:41.000\nAnd then, and then Schrab will do an Infinity War spoiler.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:46.000\nAnd then after, after it's finished, bring that beat back, et cetera.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nSo it's kind of like a 10 list effect.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nThese are spoilers.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nThese are things that.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nThese are infinity.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nThese are Rob Schrab's Infinity War spoilers.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nCover your ears now.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nThey could also be fake spoilers.\n\n22:56.000 --> 23:02.000\nCover your ears now and don't spread the spoil after I spoil.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:06.000\nWell, what if we're here, you know, as part of a performance we have to give.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nWhat do you tell you?\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nOtherwise want to hear these spoilers.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nWhat's that?\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:13.000\nSomeone may not have heard these spoilers is what you're saying.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nThat's on stage right now.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:18.000\nSomebody might not have heard these spoilers and I'm about to spoil the spoilers.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:21.000\nSo don't retweet the spoilers.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nQuote the spoilers.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nSpoil.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:31.000\nGet hints about the spoilers because you're just going to spoil it for everybody else.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:38.000\nSo if you haven't seen Infinity Wars and you want to be.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nUnspoiled.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nUnspoiled.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nThank you.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nCover your ears now because it's about to get spoiling.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nOkay.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:51.000\nAnd also I'm going to say let's make this a 10 minute bit.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nOkay.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nAll right.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nThat way people can fast forward.\n\n23:55.000 --> 24:01.000\nI'm just going to say this that some of the spoilers are kind of dumb and don't really\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\npay off.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nWait, well, you're not really going to do actual spoilers.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:12.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nWhat?\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nI don't want real spoilers.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nMaybe one real spoiler, two fake spoilers.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:22.000\nI'm going to get four spoilers and three of them are going to be fake and one is going\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.000\nto be real.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:29.000\nAnd then at the end of my spoiling, you're going to pick which is the spoiler.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nI don't like.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nI don't like.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nOkay.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nNo.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nMoving on.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nBecause I don't want to deal in real spoilers.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nLet's hit the wrap.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nLet's do the four wraps, though.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nLet's just have silence between the wraps.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nI feel like so many wraps already.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nI thought you were going to do joke spoilers.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nWhat?\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nI thought you were going to do joke spoilers.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nYou didn't even see the fucking movie and what you're talking about.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nWell, so you were going to do it.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nSo can we see some, let's just, let's just do the spoilers.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nLet's do three spoilers.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nWhat you're getting angry at is that you like, you committed so much.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nYou convinced me.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nWell, you dick.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:03.000\nThree spoilers.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nDrop that beat.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:05.000\nDrop it.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nYeah.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nInfinity.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nInfinity

29:41.000\nGive me kind of what what situation was it though?\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:42.000\nWhat?\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nBecause when we were in Chicago.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:44.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:50.000\nWhen we were in Chicago, somebody handed me four pounds of edible weed gels.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nOh my God.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nDo you remember that?\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nDo not.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:59.000\nIt was after the show and the guy came up to me had no shoes on and a wet corduroy suit.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nOh, is that Levi?\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nThat sounds like Levi.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nIt was kind of wet.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nNo shoes.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nSounds like Levi.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nNo shoes.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nWas that raining outside?\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nNo shoes.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nThat part, no.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:10.000\nIt wasn't raining.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nThat's why I was like.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.000\nOh, that's cool to get to the show.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nAnd he had to be a ton of pot.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nIs that a thing?\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nDo people hand you pot?\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:25.000\nI mean, Spencer's Spencer's kind of like a what we in Minecraft would call a vacuum hopper.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:32.000\nOr what you normies would call a lightning rod.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:37.000\nHaving a guy on the show that's a little more like like it's like it's like I assume people\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:42.000\ndo most of the tongue related stuff when they went to kiss concerts to Gene Simmons, even\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nthough they all had tongues.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:49.000\nThe show's just for you now.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nThey all had tongues.\n\n30:51.000 --> 31:01.000\nThat was a strange time when kiss was around and Gene Simmons was like the guy that liked\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:02.000\nsticking his tongue out.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nThat was like his thing.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:10.000\nAnd like he would stick his tongue out and my mom would go terrible.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:14.000\nI was like, well, it's almost pointless to say it.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nBut it just it's still it still makes the mind real.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:22.000\nLike when you just look at what what our parents were frightened of and us.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:26.000\nI mean, I was a kid and I was like, boy, George, uncomfortable.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:31.000\nYou know, like, I was like, my brother was into all this cool music, like boy, George\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nand Prince and all that stuff.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nWe've talked about that before.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:37.000\nI was like, I was like, I'll just stay with my Phil Collins because I just I'm not that\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:43.000\nconfident in my and exploring these boundaries that these top 40 singers are exploring.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:48.000\nBut like and then and then the things that your parents were were like, you got to go\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:51.000\nto a special camp.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:54.000\nIf you had a poster of it on your wall, it's just dudes in makeup.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:58.000\nJust like guys that just wanted to look pretty.\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nIt's kind of amazing.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nI mean, we all you say Phil Collins.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nCan I just have what era Phil Collins?\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nSususudio.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nYeah.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nNo jacket required.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nI've been over this.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:12.000\nI mean, the real thing is that my brother had tasted music.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nI did not.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nThat was great.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:20.000\nThere was a Genesis eight track in the basement next to the eight track player.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nThere was it was like one of five eight tracks.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:27.000\nLike I just and I just so I just listened to the same thing over and over again.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:31.000\nAnd then so then as I hit puberty and it was like time to get my first album, you know,\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:34.000\nbecause I was like getting hormones in my body.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:38.000\nI was like, I'm going to get an album for my birthday, not a toy truck.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:41.000\nI was like, I don't I don't have any favorite bands.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:44.000\nSo just sort of tracking fucking Phil Collins.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nSo you didn't like Phil Collins?\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:55.000\nYou were just now just acknowledging that probably not a lot of people that are music\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nmusicies.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:01.000\nThey're probably not like, you know, now I'm so old, it doesn't matter now.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:06.000\nNow it's like being into like a fucking Mel Tormey or something.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nIt's like it could be it could be as cool as it is.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nIt could be anything.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nYou know who I like?\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:17.000\nYou know who I discovered late in life that I've been a fan of my entire life because\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:22.000\nlike I was listening to YouTube and it just like, you know, just kind of randomly goes\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:25.000\nover to the something that has the same tags or whatever.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:30.000\nI was listening to some, I don't know, some 80 song and it just took me to a Billy Ocean\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nplaylist.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:36.000\nAnd I knew every lyric and I was super happy.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:46.000\nAnd by the time the 16 songs were done, I was like, I guess I'm a big fan of Billy Ocean.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nHe's an ocean of hits.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nHe really is.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nHe really is, Dan.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nI'm not even kidding about that.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:56.000\nHe has a lot more hits than a lot of people think.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:57.000\nHe has two hits.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nNo.\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nNo.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nCount them off.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nDon't do it.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nDon't do it.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:03.000\nDon't do it.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:06.000\nBilly Ocean's hits.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nNumber 10.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nCarabin Queen.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nNo.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:10.000\nShe's wearing the same thing.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:11.000\nWhat's number one?\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nYou got.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:14.000\nGet out of my dream school.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nGet out of my dream school.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:21.000\nGet out of my dream school.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nNumber seven.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nBecause that's it.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:24.000\nThere you go.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.000\nLove a boy.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nOkay.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nAll right.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nNumber six.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nSix.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nSix.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nBilly Ocean's ocean of hits.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nNumber six.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:35.000\nThere'll be sad songs to make you cry.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nLove songs holding true.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nNot a hit.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nNot a hit.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:46.000\nYou know what I'm doing.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:50.000\nBut he lasted longer than Ricky Martin at this point for sure.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nHe's got a lot of hits.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nHe's got a lot of hits.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nIf you like his music, there's a lot of hits.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nDid you watch the videos as well, though?\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nIs that part of my...\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nYou gotta watch the videos.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nYou gotta watch the videos.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nSomething tells me.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:06.000\nBecause inexplicably, fucking a lover boy is a sci-fi video where he rides a horse to\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\na cave and inside the cave is a fucking Star Wars canteen.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nYeah.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nFuck you, Billy Ocean.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:12.000\nI love you.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nHe's dressed like Han Solo.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nHe's got the white shirt and black vest.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nIt's just like, let me be.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nI don't care.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nI want to be your lover boy, but I also want to be Han Solo.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nI want to be a cave.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nI need to get off tattooing.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nCody was wearing a neoprene jacket.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:28.000\nAnd she was talking about how she's like, I love my neoprene jacket.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nAnd I call her my bean.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:35.000\nAnd then I was like, neoprene bean.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nNow she's wearing neoprene.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nAnd she's like, what are you...\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nThat's really catchy.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nI'm like, Billy Ocean.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nWhy do they call it neoprene again?\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nWhy is it neoprene?\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nBecause it's not your mom's preen.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nNeoprene.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nWhat is the texture of the neoprene?\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nIs it soft?\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nIt's like scuba suit.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nIt's like a scuba suit.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nSlightly spongy sort of skin.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:04.000\nIt's what Robert Redford had to wear in order to keep from the heat detectors from picking\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:05.000\nneakers.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nAnd sneak eakers.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:10.000\nDid you have a little hiccup in the middle of that?\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nYeah.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:14.000\nWell, it was the same suit.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.000\nNeoprene me.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\nNeoprene me.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nBut yeah.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nWarrant's eakers.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:22.000\nIf there's anything that's three syllables and then a fourth syllable that's separated,\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI always think of Billy Ocean.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nIf someone goes, can I get some of those Styrofoam eggs?\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nI go, Styrofoam eggs.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:32.000\nGet out the exit, boobah.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nThere's another thing like that.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nWhat is it?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nWhat is the song?\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nI can't remember.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nGirls on film or boys on film?\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nGirls on film.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nAny three syllables.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nNo.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nGirls on film.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:45.000\nIt's another thing where it's like.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:48.000\nBilly Idol's Eyes Without a Face.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nHis lawyer without a case.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nBaseball without a face.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:56.000\nWhat was the song Billy Ocean did for the Jewel of the Nile?\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:57.000\nOh, Jewel of the Nile.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nWhat was it?\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.000\nOh, right.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:00.000\nRemember that one?\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:01.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nGo and get tough.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nGet going.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.000\nGo and get rough.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nTough, get rough.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nIn a head.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nIn a head.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nI'll climb any mountain.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nI'll do anything.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nI'll do anything.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nOoh, can I touch you?\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:14.000\nCan I touch you?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nWow.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nYeah, you did.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:17.000\nDo the things that lovers do.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nYou spent time there.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nOh, my ass cheeks.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nUh-oh.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:21.000\nStuck together.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nWhy?\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:25.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:26.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:27.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:28.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:29.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:32.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:36.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:37.000\nPeanut butter.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:38.000\nPeanut

Yeah, do one thing for me because what did he do?\n\n50:36.880 --> 50:42.960\nOh, I didn't I haven't been keeping so Kanye West has been in the press lately doing different things\n\n50:42.960 --> 50:46.160\nHe stopped by TMZ where he announced that slavery was a choice\n\n50:46.160 --> 50:49.760\nthe 400 years of oppression was a choice and\n\n50:50.840 --> 50:56.380\nHas a fire dismanagement has gotten on and off trip Twitter in a sporadic way\n\n50:56.960 --> 51:04.280\nCame out and wore a MAGA hat. Right. I saw yeah, and it's been getting sort of progressively worse as we've been going on\n\n51:04.280 --> 51:06.280\nSo some people\n\n51:06.360 --> 51:13.040\nAre mad but what I see is a little bit of spectrum ish or a little bit of some people are saying drug use\n\n51:13.040 --> 51:17.760\nMeds on and off meds. Yeah, because we talk about that on the show every once in a while\n\n51:17.760 --> 51:21.920\nI was wondering. Do you see any of that? Well, sure for\n\n51:22.320 --> 51:24.440\nIn what Kanye is doing. Yeah, of course\n\n51:24.440 --> 51:28.880\nI mean it was the alternative would be to go. No, I think Kanye is being completely\n\n51:29.400 --> 51:36.320\nRational and was born without any like neurological. Yeah, I think it's that\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:43.040\nHe's always been a weirdo. He's always been a weirdo. He's always been pretty. I mean, yeah\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:49.960\nI mean, he's he's always a big personality. I always I would like like I'm always like how many fucking albums\n\n51:49.960 --> 51:51.960\nDo you need to go platinum before?\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:59.480\nLike how you know, is there a little bit of a you know, how much shit did we put up with from from from old white guys?\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:05.240\nLike not to go there repeatedly, but like I was like Kanye had like so many\n\n52:05.240 --> 52:13.240\nLike hits under his belt. Yeah before he he was like famous for being crazy for for basically just saying\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:20.080\nIn most of the context that it was happening in unless you can I guess like him storming the stage at the\n\n52:20.600 --> 52:23.480\nVMAs, but the VMAs are fucking fake awards\n\n52:23.520 --> 52:27.200\nLike like there's not even you're not even really getting an award for anything\n\n52:27.200 --> 52:30.880\nSo to come up on stage. Isn't that where he did the Taylor Swift thing? You get a moon, man\n\n52:30.880 --> 52:35.400\nBut but other than that it was just like that's MTV. He's like he's like I don't want these\n\n52:35.920 --> 52:39.120\nI don't want these floor tiles on the floor for my thing\n\n52:39.120 --> 52:45.320\nYou know like like being a perfectionist and I was always like kind of in his corner because the first place people go is oh\n\n52:45.320 --> 52:53.240\nYou're crazy. You're manic depressive. You're you know, they diagnose you and but who cares like like it's a capitalist society\n\n52:53.400 --> 52:54.640\nso\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:59.800\nLike I got the cure to my schizophrenia right here. It's called. I'm a billionaire\n\n52:59.800 --> 53:05.120\nYeah, but and I do think that we we don't we like like Frank\n\n53:05.120 --> 53:12.560\nI don't know this is white guilt talking, but I feel like we we unevenly apply that rule to black men like we we let them\n\n53:13.400 --> 53:20.680\nGo crazy from getting rich and then we we really break out the medical clipboards like in a way that we don't with like\n\n53:20.840 --> 53:22.960\nYeah, white guys that get rich and go crazy\n\n53:22.960 --> 53:29.840\nI think we love all all dismantling of celebrity, but it is this one's interesting because um\n\n53:30.280 --> 53:34.160\nThere is that feeling of like yes, we kind of all knew that he was crazy\n\n53:34.160 --> 53:39.680\nI don't know why this is different. You describe it that stuff the difference that I'm hearing is that it sounds sad\n\n53:39.920 --> 53:47.400\nlike the slavery thing and the you know, it's like that that that explains a lot because I came into all\n\n53:47.400 --> 53:51.400\nI saw was him tweeting pictures of his is like, you know, does this look like the sunken place?\n\n53:51.400 --> 53:56.920\nAnd I was I was like that's a little sad, but it's it's it's also like it wasn't so sad that I wasn't like\n\n53:57.760 --> 54:03.720\nLaughing at it because it was like, yeah, yeah, of course it does it does look like a corridor of the Sunken place\n\n54:06.200 --> 54:10.360\nYou should be proud of because I mean like like you bought it\n\n54:10.360 --> 54:15.800\nYou like like you bought the sunken place that's like you weren't in prison there by Catherine Keener like so so good for you\n\n54:15.800 --> 54:17.200\nbut but like\n\n54:17.200 --> 54:24.120\nAnyways, but I didn't know that that was the backstory. I didn't hear about that TRL or whatever thing like he took over TMZ\n\n54:24.120 --> 54:25.880\nWhich you know, he classically hates TMZ\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:29.320\nHe likes to strike out at them punches their photographers breaks their cameras\n\n54:29.320 --> 54:35.280\nBut he went to TMZ and at some point was addressing the entire room instead of just being interviewed\n\n54:35.360 --> 54:42.960\nSo he stood up and sort of gave in held court and then later on they sort of had boob like footage of him doing the same thing and getting to\n\n54:43.240 --> 54:46.760\nWhat do you mean? He took over would you mean like he went into their offices?\n\n54:46.760 --> 54:51.360\nThey will let you usually they'll have a celebrity sit down between two people Harvey and\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:58.680\nDredd dude and they'll talk right so he was supposed to be facing forward talking to those twos on the either side of them\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:04.600\nAnd he at one point gets up and turns around and tells this story about why he got liposuction how he got addicted to opiates\n\n55:04.640 --> 55:06.320\nDo you see any of that shit?\n\n55:06.320 --> 55:11.200\nSo he stands up and he's like I had to go get liposuction because I don't want you guys to call me fat like you did Rob Kardashian\n\n55:11.200 --> 55:15.000\nAnd I was trying to go to the Grammys and I was in the red carpet and you guys call me fat\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:18.480\nSo then they gave me opiates, and I was taking a bunch of day\n\n55:18.480 --> 55:23.880\nAnd then when I went to the hospital because I took too many they gave me seven and released me is where he started\n\n55:23.920 --> 55:30.840\nSo like he's having a moment right? Yeah, that is but we did spit. I just noticed that people sort of suspended their\n\n55:31.880 --> 55:36.880\nJudgment yeah, they were like they're like well. This is serious. He's like it's like Gary Busey, you know like well\n\n55:36.960 --> 55:38.960\nLike like where you go?\n\n55:39.680 --> 55:43.120\nWe kind of felt that way about Charlie Sheen, but we were just like let him go\n\n55:43.120 --> 55:51.080\nYou know like like but yeah, also there's this thing. There's this crazy thing with Sheen Charlie Sheen people were like fuck yeah\n\n55:51.600 --> 55:56.600\nRight it was like it was a Trump effect where they were sort of like this is a rallying cry for guys\n\n55:56.600 --> 56:02.440\nWho've wanted to live this way for a long time in cells basically which is also a crazy new thing\n\n56:02.440 --> 56:07.640\nBecause he also well I want to examine this like what we experienced when we hear what we picture Kanye\n\n56:07.640 --> 56:13.640\nSaying this stuff because it's part of it is it's vulnerable. He's saying\n\n56:14.360 --> 56:16.360\nHe's like clearly\n\n56:16.480 --> 56:18.480\nIt's like there's a difference between a guy\n\n56:19.200 --> 56:21.200\ngoing alpha and like\n\n56:22.200 --> 56:25.760\nBeing there's a difference between he's clearly out of his mind and\n\n56:26.640 --> 56:28.640\nHe's clearly out of his mind\n\n56:29.280 --> 56:34.960\nLike oh he had how come he didn't know that saying that saying I could lift a thousand pounds\n\n56:34.960 --> 56:40.080\nWould make him seem weak, but then someone saying like yeah\n\n56:40.080 --> 56:41.400\nI've been really weak lately\n\n56:41.400 --> 56:47.280\nYeah, in a way that is then you then you immediately go well then I'm on your side if you're being\n\n56:47.880 --> 56:51.000\nTruthful, and I don't want you to get hurt. So get off of the TV\n\n56:51.160 --> 56:56.440\nThere's also this rap braggado show that makes it difficult to figure out when somebody's being crazy\n\n56:56.440 --> 57:02.880\nYou just never want a rapper to I mean in air quotes. You never want a rapper to I think this is amazing\n\n57:02.880 --> 57:06.680\nBut like it's just not the part of the word lipo section\n\n57:07.120 --> 57:10.480\nThat's probably been that's probably the first time that's really been introduced\n\n57:13.200 --> 57:15.200\nI got a chemical pill\n\n57:16.320 --> 57:20.400\nI'm over here trying to get this light bow for my life. Oh\n\n57:21.440 --> 57:23.880\nIt's an interesting it's an interesting thing to watch\n\n57:25.840 --> 57:32.800\nBecause people are taking there's this very fine line where you say are we shitting on this dude because we shit on people\n\n57:32.800 --> 57:38.480\nAt this point are we getting out a little bit of racism in that we've never really had the backs of black dudes\n\n57:38.480 --> 57:44.360\nSo now that one's going crazy who happens to be rich and has been very vocal about how we fucked the system to get rich\n\n57:45.040 --> 57:52.320\nAre we are we doing this thing? I used to watch Jerry Springer and all these talk shows where there'd be a black mother on stage\n\n57:52.440 --> 57:54.800\nShe'd be being shit on by a white audience\n\n57:55.360 --> 58:01.440\nFor being a bad mother and yet there was a section of it where you were like now what wait a minute, right like what?\n\n58:01.440 --> 58:07.320\nSome of you all are just being straight up awful about this shit, right and some of that is what I've seen\n\n58:07.320 --> 58:10.920\nI've seen some people who are taking a pot shot at a black millionaire\n\n58:10.920 --> 58:16.440\nI've seen some people who have no no respect for the fact that we're watching somebody with a\n\n58:16.880 --> 58:20.720\nMental illness. Yeah, like it's a crazy crazy thing to watch\n\n58:21.320 --> 58:23.520\nAre you fucking with this incel shit at all?\n\n58:24.600 --> 58:27.840\nYeah, man, I'm gonna do my third session next week\n\n58:27.840 --> 58:34.560\nI mean, I we knew we we kind of hate to claim this but we sort of\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:41.080\nWe started we sort of discovered the incel movement on this stage because Cody Cody Cody found it\n\n58:41.080 --> 58:48.080\nWell going down a rabbit hole and she was remember that that the Gaspacho blog guy. He was he was incel\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:54.280\nHe was the guy but I don't know the origin Cody Cody found a blog by this guy that\n\n58:54.280 --> 58:57.360\nAmong other things he had this blog entry where he\n\n58:58.400 --> 59:00.960\nHe was behind two women in a restaurant\n\n59:01.520 --> 59:04.640\nAnd and he overheard them saying one of them said\n\n59:05.080 --> 59:11.280\nOh good, they have Gaspacho and the other one said what's Gaspacho and the other one said it's like cold tomato soup or something\n\n59:11.280 --> 59:17.280\nAnd the other one said that's gross and then and he said and that's the moment when I knew I was gonna try Gaspacho\n\n59:18.280 --> 59:23.560\nAnd then he tries it and he's like and I loved it and that's the thing and it was like it's just amazing\n\n59:23.560 --> 59:31.000\nThat's that's the in cell thing. It was like he was like so are these gamer gate dudes? Yeah, same batch it all okay\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:37.160\nSo crazy because they I don't think you're backed up enough what what I kind of know what you're talking\n\n59:37.480 --> 59:40.320\nIn cell community means a voluntary cell\n\n59:40.320 --> 59:47.480\nBut it's a men's right activists and people who who hate women and and have radical beliefs that are predicated on the fact\n\n59:47.480 --> 59:51.280\nThat they're not getting late, so it all dates back to I mean all\n\n59:51.280 --> 59:58.480\nAll internet culture comes back to like something awful and this like in video game cultural circles and\n\n59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.360\n4chan and it kind of spawned a bunch of stuff, but it's just like racism and white supremacy was always kind of just\n\n01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.800\nunder the surface of that so I mean\n\n01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.200\n4chan kind of popped up a bunch of times they made operations against\n\n01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.200\nScientology and stuff, but they weren't really overtly races for a long time\n\n01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:23.320\nBut racist factions of them started gaining more steam and then when the gamer gate thing blew up that kind of coincided with\n\n01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.440\nThe pickup artists movement and the men's rights activists movement, which is also\n\n01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.800\nYou know centered in male bodybuilding culture and all this online culture and so that kind of\n\n01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:38.920\nCoalesced with this online gaming culture movement and Gamergate and they just from there\n\n01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.920\nIt's basically everyone on that spectrum is just a different shade of some form of Nazi\n\n01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.840\nIt usually comes out of misogyny, but it ends up like expressing itself as some form of Nazism\n\n01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.560\nBut it's it's generally under Gamergate\n\n01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:59.280\nBut then people like Gaspacho man is probably like he felt empowered because he had some Gamergate related blog where he was like\n\n01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.800\nHere's this girl playing a video game on Twitch and so isn't this the problem with video games?\n\n01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:09.600\nAnd so like it's all this like misogyny stuff that comes out of this this like 4chan culture\n\n01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.200\nBut it shows up in all these avenues, but there was in cells during Gamergate and before Gamergate\n\n01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.960\nAnd they were just made fun of the same way, you know, like losers were made fun of that's also part of it is like in the\n\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.200\nCulture you're making fun of people for being losers\n\n01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.160\nAnd you're also doing that to like hide the fact that you're an anonymous loser as well\n\n01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.600\nAnd so they're kind of self-hating about it\n\n01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.920\nBut in cell has like been around forever, but they've just been you could attach a decade to the birth of it\n\n01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:43.440\nWhat would you say like 2011 maybe later? It's only it's new yeah reasonable all this shit goes back\n\n01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.960\nThere's a really interesting article about the two thousand okay five\n\n01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:53.880\nI mean if you really want to like oral history trace the roots from that that end up blooming into things like Gamergate and all that stuff like the\n\n01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.800\nthe kind of inextricably braided\n\n01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.440\nflower stem of\n\n01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.600\nYou know\n\n01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.000\nMen's men male male rage for lack of I'm trying to think of the classiest phrase so the\n\n01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.160\nlike like male male fucking\n\n01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.880\nalpha energy\n\n01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.280\nBeing bound to video game and internet and hacking culture\n\n01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:25.200\nLike I can't remember what a publication did a really a pretty pretty in-depth like backward look at the whole thing\n\n01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.160\nWhat was the guy called? It was like angry uncle though. What was that?\n\n01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.680\nThere was like a there was like a zine at one point. I was I mean as you would imagine with any of this stuff\n\n01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.440\nThere's like a culture that you can trace back that all starts somewhere\n\n01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.240\nBut it's not as if that means that there was a Ben Franklin that started it\n\n01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:47.000\nBut it's always it's always been in all those cultures. That's things something awful always had racism 4chan always had racist memes and stuff\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.160\nAnd it just like it was just circulating and do you think it coincides with science?\n\n01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.960\nIt seems as if these dudes are not that these dudes are\n\n01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.960\nIntelligent and that's a section of the left because I don't even know if they're left\n\n01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.440\nThey feel like they feel like they have distance themselves from any sort of political party as well. Yeah, I think the yeah, but is the bond\n\n01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.360\nScience I think it's anger\n\n01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.280\nI think it's it's nerds that grew up watching cartoons that were like you bump into someone and they dropped their papers\n\n01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.840\nAnd then three days later you're having sex with them\n\n01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.880\nAnd you're a loser because you failed to do that and they're like I did everything right\n\n01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.680\nI'm bumping into all these women holding papers and they're like well. No, you're a fucking idiot if you believe that\n\n01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.200\nBut they are fucking idiots who do believe that because we are sending that signal, but it's like I think they're all these people that for so long\n\n01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.080\nThey're like I'm a nice guy. Why don't people date me?\n\n01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.360\nAnd it's like because you say things like that and but we don't actually sit to explain it to them\n\n01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.400\nBut it's like so there's all these people that for so long think they're doing it right\n\n01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:51.680\nBut it's like no you're a jerk and you're a racist and you're a misogynist and no one's explained to you subtly\n\n01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.200\nwhat that means because you probably don't have a support network because you know then that's how people get radicalized is because\n\n01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:05.200\nYou don't have a support network and other people are like actually it's because it's sort of it's it's it's sort of like it's this syndrome where it's like\n\n01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:12.640\nIt's a first world empire and people get comfortable and then there's this shift if you if you if you stop if you do start doing anything\n\n01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.520\nOther than constantly ascending as an empire\n\n01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.760\nI think what happens what we're observing is that if things level off and then start to get to a point where oh\n\n01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:29.400\nThis is the third time I heard Time magazine mentioned that whites will be a minority by the year whatever and that oh\n\n01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.520\nCollege isn't working like doesn't matter for job placement\n\n01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.880\nAnd they say the dream starts to fall apart a dream that if you're 16 years old\n\n01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.240\nYou never knew you were buying into but you subconsciously were so then you turn 16\n\n01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:50.440\nAnd it's like that that that judge Reinhold monologue in fast times where they go the party's over and he's like he does his monologue\n\n01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.840\nAnd goes like I'm waiting for the fucking party to start. It's like you like these\n\n01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.360\nyou can you can be a you could be a white kid and\n\n01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.600\nBe familiar with these phrases and these concepts that have something to do with\n\n01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.000\nProgress and the world is getting softer or or\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:15.280\nProgressive or what's your own or it's crumbling and and it's melting and then you like you you just you you just get this\n\n01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.840\nHigh out of going yeah, but everything's bullshit\n\n01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.960\nThat's why movies like the Matrix or and Fight Club and and Star Wars and whatever\n\n01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.520\nThere's all the stories are about you fucking waking up and realizing that everything's bullshit\n\n01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.840\nYou you got a you got to figure this shit out\n\n01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.280\nAnd that's how you become a hero everyone wants to be a hero\n\n01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.200\nAnd so you're it's one thing to be like in a cradle being fed titty milk from a lamb\n\n01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.480\nThat's whose feet never touched the ground and you can complain about it\n\n01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480\nI remember you and I talked about that we were like\n\n01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.560\nGeneration Xers like go like all we knew is that we hated Pepsi that was it was that easy to be a rebel\n\n01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.560\nIt was just like fuck Pepsi\n\n01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:59.400\nAnd and then it's like all right, but yeah now I think it gets to a point because I guess somewhere in our heads\n\n01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.960\nMaybe we were like yeah fuck Pepsi, but then then I'll have a Pepsi later like I mean and by that\n\n01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.960\nI mean I'll have a billion-dollar corporation later\n\n01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:14.960\nLike like I'll like like yeah fuck this shit because we watch the big chill and we watch the breakfast club and we go\n\n01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.480\nOh, I get it. I understand how society works\n\n01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:24.640\nIt goes up a staircase especially if you're a white dude like you you you can complain and be hip the whole way\n\n01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.800\nI think that's where this concept of virtue signaling comes in is that these guys think they're calling out\n\n01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.320\nWhich is like the only reason you would ever\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.640\nSay that shit was bad\n\n01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:41.920\nWell, you're walking up this stairway to heaven is if you were trying to impress people on the way up if you're gonna like here\n\n01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920\nI go to heaven it's lame\n\n01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.320\nWhich is the equivalent that's that's what they I think that's what they mean by virtue signaling is that you're going like\n\n01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.880\nLike I'm part of the liberal hive mind that guarantees that\n\n01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.520\nI'll always have dirty money coming in from\n\n01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.720\nPodesta's pedophile ring and drone strikes and\n\n01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.880\nBut I'm also gonna make everyone like me and have have\n\n01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:15.600\nSex with all the women because I'm lying to them about how I thought Oprah's speech at the Oscars was just fine\n\n01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.760\nThe opposite of a dog whistle\n\n01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.280\nYes, the opposite of a dog. So are these cats gonna\n\n01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.720\nDo you think they will link up and\n\n01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.920\nMilitarize do you think they're gonna hook up with the Trump supporters? Yeah, I think they think they're better\n\n01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.400\nI think they think they're better than the Trump people\n\n01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.400\nYeah, Trump fans. I think they're on a different level where they are more aligned with\n\n01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.440\nSay an evil Bill Gates versus a Donald Trump, but a billionaire nonetheless\n\n01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:49.080\nBut you stop being one of these guys the minute you you admit that you want anything\n\n01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960\nso that\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.240\nThat that simultaneously is good news and terrible news because that's a lot like\n\n01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.280\nAny terrorists sell? Yeah, because you basically like the first guy to say\n\n01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.160\nJesus these ISIS meetings are so great. I almost don't want to blow anything up anymore\n\n01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:15.080\nYou're out of Isis like like you you you got to just be mad and show up like like and like\n\n01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.800\nFucking great point defeats the purpose if you if showing up makes you\n\n01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.320\nExpress the actual feelings of contentment that you were seeking in the first place\n\n01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.720\nThat's a crazy if I can for just a second\n\n01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.000\nThat's a crazy point because the truth is we know that people lash out because they're lonely\n\n01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.720\nBut when they get together and they have a drive to explode things that yes\n\n01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.760\nThey have to get to that final episode. That's what I think fascism is like it's catalyzed by by like\n\n01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.200\nPrivilege people that exploit that phenomenon like there's a certain amount of lower-class discontent\n\n01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.760\nThat will recycle itself like a compost bin because poor people will just get sad\n\n01:08:53.240 --> 01:09:01.760\nBecause they're poor and then their porous will make them like invent new music and and and and be more religious and and be\n\n01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.480\nJust generally happier and make rich people go like Jesus these poor people are fucking ecstatic\n\n01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.480\nI like I should lighten up a little bit. Maybe give something to charity or whatever this like like that system\n\n01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.160\nYeah, that system breaks down when\n\n01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:27.120\nWhen when shit gets bad enough for long enough that somebody out there usually a 70 year old mummy or like several million of them\n\n01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:33.800\nLike they go oh the poor people are doing that thing where they're bummed out about being poor again\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.320\nI think I'll fucking poor instead of instead of building a wall between me and them and letting them be poor and listening to their wonderful music\n\n01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:47.520\nI think I'll I think I'll start exploiting their their sadness and their anger because if I go like this\n\n01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.360\nThey start going like that. Yeah, and then like either money comes in or there's like an agenda like I want that\n\n01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.480\nI want that regime taken down and then it's like\n\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:06.960\nIt's an orchestra conducted by fucking dangerously stupid selfish sociopaths who are just like I think I think I think this guy over here\n\n01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.280\nIt says that poor people shouldn't be as angry. What do you guys think and they're like?\n\n01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.320\nAnd and and and this guy is it has the IQ of a fucking handball or he wouldn't have been born rich\n\n01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.960\nAnd so then that's the days that we're in I feel like\n\n01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.000\nLike like I dread that we're in a right-wing slide into a genuine fascist regime\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.480\nnot and I also feel like a lot of us are reacting to it by\n\n01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.920\nby going oh, but\n\n01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:45.280\nOprah will get elected next and that'll be even worse and like I don't even want to argue about that in your wildest dreams\n\n01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.360\nLike I'm not if I really thought that was gonna happen. I wouldn't be so fucking\n\n01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.520\nterrified right now because I also we keep trying to hire someone to clean up the mess when in reality\n\n01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.880\nIt's probably we were going like this when we were stable. This was every eight years\n\n01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:07.840\nDo we just change our minds as a country about whether or not we should have but it's just fucking like 60 years of fucking steady\n\n01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.400\nThis is called stability and then moving in either direction\n\n01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.360\nLike all at once is called us, you know a movement\n\n01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.000\nAre we able to fight these dudes or will they burn themselves out or what is the for it?\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.120\nWhat do you what is the forecast for these dudes and do you know any?\n\n01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.320\nI don't know like it's just all these people are like they're so far gone. They just got to be told like\n\n01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.760\nYou know, this isn't this isn't gonna do what you want, but they don't want to hear that like so\n\n01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760\nI think most of them will just\n\n01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:46.720\nYou know not go anywhere the same way most, you know racist people just yell at people at most and don't end up killing people\n\n01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:53.200\nBut still it generates and bubbles up killers, you know, like this ain't like I think it'll still continue to be dangerous\n\n01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.040\nBut I don't think it'll be more or less dangerous than it ever has been like or not ever\n\n01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.960\nI mean, obviously we've crossed the point and it's gotten much dangerous more dangerous recently\n\n01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.600\nBut beyond that, I don't think there's anything my most optimistic hope\n\n01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.560\nIs that and this is like still a nightmare the optimistic version of the future\n\n01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.000\nWhich is why I can't wait to retire because it's just no no no world for me anymore is that\n\n01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040\nIs that this is gonna get bad enough\n\n01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:26.320\nBut the the people are still gonna have enough of a toehold and there's enough of a blue wave\n\n01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.720\nWhatever however you want to characterize the the pendulum going back the other way\n\n01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.240\nBut that the pendulum will have no choice but to go\n\n01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.800\nWe no longer have a sense of humor about this this this this and that and it's gonna make it even worse\n\n01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.560\nIt's it's it's good. It's like it's like if you graph it\n\n01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:51.200\nIt's just moving towards a super volcano explosion because we're not gonna we're not gonna learn from this fucking experience\n\n01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.240\nIf we learn anything to lighten up and take people less seriously. Yeah, we're gonna\n\n01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:02.000\nWe're gonna be like I don't I don't give a fuck what you have to say about due process or\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.280\nUh, uh, how you have a story too\n\n01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:12.800\nYou said this word and this word is connected to this word and that school of thought and you're fucking toast forever\n\n01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.920\nWrong tweet at the wrong time mother fucker done\n\n01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.960\nAnd like like like that society will progress along those lines because we won't have a sense of humor about\n\n01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.280\nLike why would we why would we they're fucking nazis?\n\n01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.720\nI feel like we got tricked into respecting people's opinions\n\n01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:37.440\nI feel like the idea of oh respect everyone's opinions like wait why why wait why why would we do that?\n\n01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:44.240\nWe're just gonna respect everyone's opinions our opinions like assholes and everyone has one and they all stink\n\n01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.560\nThat's what we respect is that everybody has this smelly bullshit\n\n01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.160\nNo, opinions are terrible and they need to be terribly well defended before we should\n\n01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560\nAccept them as anything\n\n01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.080\nAnything that sucks though is it's not just opinions you're you're thinking of all of society being people in toga's talking about\n\n01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.800\nHow the world should run in between these ionic columns\n\n01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.880\nLike what about fantasy? What about the fact that vice just ran their second article?\n\n01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.880\num within a month about how uh, some rick and morty fans, uh, uh, have too much\n\n01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.800\nIncessed on their minds or those are people who have their opinions overly respected\n\n01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:28.240\nUh, the the the the vice magazine or the yeah the vice magazine writers who got away with that\n\n01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.400\nAre you?\n\n01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.840\nOkay, it's not that much of a stretch because we all know that fucking pornhub is nothing but incest\n\n01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:44.080\nI just feel like I just feel like we're insane along with like as we go as we gild up for fighting nazis\n\n01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.160\nWe we also are like\n\n01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.000\nWe are um, we're not learning the lesson here\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.480\nAnd I'm not saying it's an easy lesson to learn\n\n01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.040\nI don't I'm not\n\n01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.880\nLecturing anybody or saying that I have the solution or that I'm not exactly along with everybody that's doing everything\n\n01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:08.960\nBut like let them finish we're becoming intolerant like as we fight intolerance. We it is a steady slide because\n\n01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.600\nlike\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.520\nlike\n\n01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.160\nLike I'm ready to retire because like I I read that vice magazine article\n\n01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.320\nit was like they dug up quotes from me about kink shaming and\n\n01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.520\nincest porn or whatever and they were like here's what Dan Harmon had to say and it was kind of like the\n\n01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.360\narticle was a little bit it was responsibly written like I didn't feel like the person was trying to\n\n01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.600\nCome at it was trying to take me down. Yeah, because I feel like if they could have they I mean if they wanted to they\n\n01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.120\nThey they easily could have they included like\n\n01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.680\ngiant passages of me talking so that I was clear and contextual and they\n\n01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.240\nIt it felt like a responsibly written thing\n\n01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.600\nBut at the same time I couldn't help but feel like the kid that wrote the article\n\n01:15:52.160 --> 01:16:01.440\nIs born of a new world where he he was basically only able to entertain the idea of freedom of fantasy and taboo online as\n\n01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.160\nAs in the same category as the least likable taboos themselves where the hippest thing you could do is go\n\n01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:14.080\nWell, some people believe that instead of what it was 15 years ago, which is the hippest thing you could do would be to go\n\n01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:14.960\nSo\n\n01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.960\nSome people are turned on by that\n\n01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.480\nand and and and it's just increasingly becoming like\n\n01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.560\nit's like because\n\n01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560\nlike like that we're gonna\n\n01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.320\nWe we we we we can read each other's minds now and everything that we say and so now we're just like\n\n01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:39.120\nIt's not resulting in us loving each other anymore. It's resulting in us like like getting off on\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.760\non\n\n01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.520\nlearning what a\n\n01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.840\nPerfect person is by virtue of pointing out every\n\n01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400\nEverything that everyone else is doing like we're not\n\n01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:58.240\nLooking within and we're not like admitting anything to ourselves. We're not like we're not we're not we're not relaxing anymore\n\n01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.560\nlike the thing that would fucking\n\n01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.360\nThat you want to be able to weaponize and point at this right wing movement like a fucking cannon is\n\n01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:15.360\nIs is levity is is is awareness and a high IQ and humor because they are in a full state of panic\n\n01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.560\nYeah, I mean because that's the thing that yeah those guys like you can you think they control us\n\n01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.640\nI mean you wouldn't believe\n\n01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.080\nHow much we control them if we were like fucking\n\n01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.920\nActually cool with each other and ourselves if you if you\n\n01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:40.160\nIf you it takes not being fucking triggered by words frankly you cannot fucking stand as I've said a thousand times at a protest against nazis\n\n01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.600\nand here's someone\n\n01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.880\nUh say something mean to his wife at the fucking nazi protest and be like\n\n01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.040\nYou know like like hey stop the stop protesting the nazis\n\n01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.040\nThis guy is like being really mean to this this lady and and then someone else shims in and goes\n\n01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.480\nDid you just call him a he because that's my friend and he's a trans\n\n01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.960\nUh a gender that and every like we're\n\n01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760\nTrying to prove that we're like\n\n01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.280\nFighting for good by fighting each other and there's a there's nazis over there\n\n01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.400\nI just want to like it's 9 11\n\n01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.840\nIt's just like wait what what was\n\n01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.840\nOh, what if we start a fire it's like a reenactment of every night right now\n\n01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280\nDon't break the bulb\n\n01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.080\nDon't break\n\n01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.640\nShob please you two cents\n\n01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.680\nI'm too sensitive.

Do you have an incel version of that?\n\n01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.960\nDo you guys have people that you fight against like we fight against\n\n01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:00.640\nFor race or sexism in the in the vegetarian world are there targets the thing that I was surprised at when I\n\n01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.960\nI'm so sorry. We're out of time\n\n01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.560\nUh, that's so good. I didn't have a punchline anyway\n\n01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.720\nNo, no, no the the the the thing that I was the most surprised of when I went vegan publicly\n\n01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.120\nWas the amount of hate that I got which I was like what why would you\n\n01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.040\nThe minute I would say something was that all sides\n\n01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:32.800\nYeah, pretty much. You know, I got I mean, I don't know what democrat liberal gay. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure\n\n01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.520\nFor sure. Sure. Mostly dudes. Okay, mostly dudes like if I said something like I\n\n01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.320\nWhy is hunting still a thing and uh, well, you know, I'm anti zoo\n\n01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.920\nYou know, I'm anti puppy farm and that kind of stuff and um, you know, I I I say, you know, like\n\n01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.880\nTo consider an option instead of having bacon on your ice cream\n\n01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:59.440\nUh, and and and there's just lots and lots of hate. Don't tell me what to do and I don't like being\n\n01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.120\nYou know, just like just like they felt like they were being attacked\n\n01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.760\nBecause I said this is this is important to me. I used to\n\n01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.160\nNot think this way. I had a click inside my head that\n\n01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.480\nMade me understand like what I was eating had a history to it that wasn't just like\n\n01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.240\nJust showed up. Yeah, there was there was suffering behind it\n\n01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.680\nAnd I didn't want to be responsible for that and I and and I got a lot of\n\n01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.120\nAnger towards me just wanting me to shut up. Do you notice that when people stand up for rights?\n\n01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.720\nThere is this I didn't notice this in the past maybe because I wasn't there\n\n01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.480\nBut there is this thing people immediately think about what they're gonna have to do without\n\n01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.720\nYeah, exactly. I mean when I say something that\n\n01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:50.560\nHits too close to home like yeah, you know, you put bacon on your ice cream. Did something have to live in pain and fear and die\n\n01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.120\nhorribly for you to have that little bit of\n\n01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.400\nOn your ice cream. How was it worth?\n\n01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.640\nDon't we also though\n\n01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:03.200\nIsn't that just shaming someone though? Wouldn't someone then feel attacked?\n\n01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.400\nWhat would are you had to kill something to eat dessert like that is\n\n01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.160\nIs attacking someone well, tell me how to not shame somebody\n\n01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200\nI mean to consider\n\n01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.760\nTo consider like where\n\n01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.960\nWhere it came from. I mean that is the trick the trick really\n\n01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.160\nWhat is the trick? You know, I mean I I haven't done it right because I get people angry\n\n01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:30.000\nAnd I don't want to shame anybody because that's the quickest way to have somebody\n\n01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.720\nShut you down or yell at you or turn you off or ignore you or whatever\n\n01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.000\nI just I used to think one way and then I was when I realized\n\n01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.320\nwhat I was\n\n01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320\ndoing and becoming a part of I\n\n01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.440\nIt just it was a it was a big turn for me. So I\n\n01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.720\nWas it imagery or did you see processing?\n\n01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.880\nIt was a friend of mine died and I started looking at life and death\n\n01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.520\ndifferently and\n\n01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920\nI got my dog\n\n01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.960\nWho I adore and I remember like I I started\n\n01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600\nposting puppy pictures\n\n01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.680\nIronically on Twitter\n\n01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:18.960\nBut then I started admitting I actually really like this and then I started putting all kinds of animals on there\n\n01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.960\nand then somebody said\n\n01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.040\nyou're obviously vegetarian\n\n01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120\nyou love animals and\n\n01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:31.040\nAnd somebody says he's not vegetarian. He still eats me Rob. Why don't you know calling me out on it?\n\n01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.040\nAnd I was like, well\n\n01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.240\nYeah\n\n01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.960\nI say I love animals. Why am I being a part of this and it just made me do a lot of research and\n\n01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:46.080\nand and then something just clicked inside of me and then I just I could not be a part of it anymore and\n\n01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.560\nIt's just something that I I feel if\n\n01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.960\nBecause I've had this experience when I you know wrote about it or posted something about it\n\n01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:00.400\nThere there's like a bunch of people that have written me and said, you know\n\n01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.600\nI never thought of it that way until I started seeing your post\n\n01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.040\nI started reconsidering a lot of stuff and I\n\n01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.320\nI'm now vegetarian or I'm now vegan or or whatever and I'm thinking differently and I felt like I accomplished something\n\n01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.600\nSo that I guess that's the right way to do it, but I don't want to shame\n\n01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:25.120\nAnybody, I mean, I don't want anybody to be feel bad. I mean like I used to eat meat for\n\n01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:29.440\n45 years my parents still eat me, you know Kate still eats fish\n\n01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.520\nI\n\n01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.760\nShaming anybody is is not going to do anything. No one's gonna stop\n\n01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.200\nI wonder if there's a part of us that has a response to discipline because what I heard you say was that you\n\n01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:47.760\nTook an idea on and then put it right to use immediately. Well, we have a response to change. Yeah, like\n\n01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.360\nlike\n\n01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:57.600\nWilly-nilly change so we the same amount of energy that you feel going into a force field when because I want to get\n\n01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:03.920\nA little bit underneath this because yeah, we could talk about the social dynamics of like catching more flies with honey and like\n\n01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.560\nOh, the way you should do it is to prepare a nice\n\n01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.120\nPasta dish on instagram and tell people how happy you are while you're eating and lead by example\n\n01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.800\nbut\n\n01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.120\nGet underneath that because then the Malcolm X of veganism would say fuck that\n\n01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.520\nI'm not going to play nice just because of blah blah blah\n\n01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.720\nI I think way down underneath it is basically we don't like people\n\n01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.920\nwhen the other people when they're\n\n01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.080\nActivated and it's not because we want them to fail. It's because we\n\n01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.320\nWe're all like these sperm cells like headed for what we perceive is the same egg. Maybe or we\n\n01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.960\nUh, we just or maybe it's just more simple than that like a primate\n\n01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.600\nSurvival jealousy needs to keep what happened yesterday going today\n\n01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.680\nThat's part of your job as a primate and the other half of your job is to want to be a hero\n\n01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:56.960\nso\n\n01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.440\nso if someone's popping off next to you about how\n\n01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.880\nAnything should be different\n\n01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.760\nYou're hearing it's not that you have ill will for that person\n\n01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.240\nIt's just that it's like well first of all you're fucking with half my job\n\n01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.440\nWhich is to make sure yesterday happens again today\n\n01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:14.960\num\n\n01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.760\nA thousand examples of that make you a hero by the way like being a good person\n\n01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.960\nYou know the\n\n01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.440\nYou know the certain traditions that actually are that we praise people for honoring\n\n01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.560\nAnd like knowing the alphabet and stuff like that\n\n01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.600\nBut then you're also fucking with the other half of my job because to the extent that I wanted to like bring\n\n01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160\nChange I wanted to bring it to other people\n\n01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.800\nI don't want to fucking be told that it's time to change it that makes me feel like\n\n01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.200\nIt it feels like sin to us, which I kind of admire about our species\n\n01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.240\nHow do you how do you do what I want to do?\n\n01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.880\nWhich is not\n\n01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:59.200\nMake anybody feel bad. I just want somebody to I just my very boring answer is the is that you don't have\n\n01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.280\nYou shouldn't do anything differently\n\n01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.800\nThe only thing for for your own personal satisfaction\n\n01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.960\nUh would be to not take it personally the way the reaction that it causes because before I would tell you\n\n01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.120\nI would have to be your vegan\n\n01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.960\nIf evangelical coach to come up to a level where I was like\n\n01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:23.520\nYou know the best way to do it to keep people from throwing tomatoes at you is to blah blah blah, and it would that would really be about\n\n01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:30.160\nI'm I'm fine with the tomatoes. I'm I'm more concerned about like Spencer who who felt like I was\n\n01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.400\nJust shaming somebody because of the ice cream bacon analogy. I mean like I I don't want\n\n01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.560\nSpencer's just just pointing out that an activist by definition is always gonna. It's always gonna cause shame\n\n01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.960\nI don't know. That's necessarily true. Well, I think that it's hard to argue for not eating animals\n\n01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.960\nIf your argument is because it hurts animals because that's telling you someone that they're not being compassionate enough\n\n01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.640\nI think there's other reasons that you can argue for it that don't involve that and I'm not saying you have to\n\n01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.960\nI'm just saying that like like there are more than one ways to advocate that aren't inherently attacking someone\n\n01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.320\nBut a very common one is a way that assumes everyone thinks the same way as you do\n\n01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.760\nAnd that way you say something that then could unintentionally attack someone who doesn't assume the same things as you are\n\n01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.720\nMy sister who is amazing activists, right? What she always likes to do is trade\n\n01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:29.280\nSo what you're if you're trying to get something out about why someone should be a vegan you're supposed to say\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.560\nYour high blood pressure will no longer be an issue. It's to give them the power of choice\n\n01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880\nInstead of saying because I get that\n\n01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.760\nYeah, look people see through that shit immediately. Yeah, if you do that with race they get even angrier because they're like\n\n01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.960\nWell, I don't want to dole out concessions. My my feeling about that is that's one tactic is like, okay. Well\n\n01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.960\nI'm saying\n\n01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.440\nit would be\n\n01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.000\nIf we were all empathetic if we were empathetic to all life, maybe we would be\n\n01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360\nempathetic to each other\n\n01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.400\nThat's true\n\n01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.160\nAnd I and I think you know if we're going well, I stopped eating meat\n\n01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.040\nI don't care that the animal is\n\n01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.080\nGoes through whatever but I stopped doing it because I'm thinner now\n\n01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:24.000\nIt seems like not a very noble noble. Here's how my therapist defines trust\n\n01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.040\nSays does the pert do you believe that the person has your best interests at heart?\n\n01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.680\nIt doesn't even have to mean that they're like they would take a bullet for you or anything\n\n01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.600\nIt's like do you do you think that they have your best interests at heart?\n\n01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.360\nWhich like okay, so I don't trust those guys that are have a six pack on the back of my car\n\n01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.880\nLike as I come out of the 7-Eleven parking lot like I don't trust them. Like I I have a few\n\n01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.800\nThey're behaving in a way that makes me think that they don't have my best interests at heart\n\n01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:59.440\nSo they can say everything they want about about why I don't trust them, but they're strangers and I don't believe it yet\n\n01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.160\nI want to know like why why can't I\n\n01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.440\nSay you shouldn't eat meat because animals feel pain and fear death\n\n01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.920\nI don't see because the person doesn't trust that you have their best interest at heart because\n\n01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:15.920\nWhat he's saying is that the inherent implication is that they don't have compassion\n\n01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.240\nSo they're saying if I let this person into the parking lot of my 7-Eleven's life\n\n01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.640\nLike I could get mugged. I could end up exposing myself like if if I say, okay, I'm interested in being\n\n01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.920\nUm more open-minded about this topic\n\n01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:39.920\nAre you gonna enter the lobby of my life and then just start moving fucking plants around because you might be a shitty decorator\n\n01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.200\nYou could be the rightest person in the world about how my lobby needs to be unlocked\n\n01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:51.440\nBut you may suck at decorating lobbies or you may be the best fucking lobby decorator for somewhat\n\n01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.800\nThey're a completely different building and like in any case like like I have to stay me\n\n01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:04.720\nAnd and grow I can't just like fucking let you in like a fucking virus and reprogram my nucleus\n\n01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.840\nOr I'm a bad person that could end up hurting other people\n\n01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:16.720\nSo so I need to trust you and and and like so when it's and then we have these like social cues that we can use to\n\n01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:22.080\nLet people know that they can trust us. It's it's a that's I think to me\n\n01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.960\nThat's job number one in all interaction is\n\n01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680\nlike try to let the person know\n\n01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.800\nThat as far as you're concerned like you you you don't\n\n01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840\nYou're not out to hurt them\n\n01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.080\nBut it's hard because if you just say that that's what a serial killer says like Ted Bundy war\n\n01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:45.120\nI don't know. I get I get a lot of like every I get a lot of like you think you're you're better than me\n\n01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.400\nBecause you are like that. I was like no no\n\n01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.320\nNo, because well, that's why I said that is because you were you were bringing up that people give you a lot of pushback\n\n01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.600\nAnd so if people are giving a lot of pushback, I you know, I experience it myself\n\n01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.760\nI'm sure I've tweeted stuff back at you and that's what I was experiencing in those\n\n01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:09.600\nCircumstances where it's like, yeah, this is what you're doing. You're throwing a lamb into a wood chipper\n\n01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.680\nIt's like, well, no, I'm hiring someone to do that for me. It's not the same\n\n01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.360\nBut you know, it's so that's me pushing back at an argument right you made and so that's fine\n\n01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:25.120\nIf you want pushback, but you were saying that it's bad that that happens to you and so that's I was saying I was surprised\n\n01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.280\nright, yeah that that\n\n01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.880\nwhich I\n\n01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.920\nI mean, I was like wow. I didn't realize that this\n\n01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.200\nwas\n\n01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.920\nIt was not just me saying you should stop doing this. It was just me saying\n\n01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:44.160\nI'm vegan it would be like just being at a restaurant with a bunch of people and then I'm saying I'm vegan\n\n01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.360\nAnd then I would pull up my wallet and they go, but you got a little other wallet\n\n01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.680\nThey everybody jumps on that and I mean like actually it's not leather\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.040\nIt's\n\n01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.880\nPleather it's it's not I I made sure to get it like\n\n01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.160\nBecause I don't want to be a hypocrite. That's what we know about\n\n01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:06.640\nIs that's why I stopped with dairy because it's if I'm going to go vegetarian and I do a little bit of research\n\n01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.160\nYou should really go vegan all the way\n\n01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.880\nBut it was the hardest thing about it. I'm sorry. The hard thing about it was\n\n01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:19.520\nWhich I think a lot of people go through it's like I don't think I can live without a hamburger\n\n01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600\nI don't think I can live without cheese\n\n01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.240\nthat was the thing that that\n\n01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.960\nI was like really I can't\n\n01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:31.520\nThat's not really a good excuse and then it took like maybe like three weeks for me to\n\n01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.040\nBreak out of that habit or whatever. I'm sorry. Go ahead. This is why I think it's related to discipline\n\n01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:42.960\nBecause your ability to take on a new idea and execute it has something to do with your discipline\n\n01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:48.400\nWhen you bring it up to people, I think they immediately feel called out on their personal discipline\n\n01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:54.720\nSo it's a it's a difficult place to start. I also think I think like I said, I think people want to know\n\n01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.720\nWhat is the benefit to even?\n\n01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.840\nentertaining the ideas that you're giving me\n\n01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.160\nSo I think that is the game sometimes, you know, I am it's interesting\n\n01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.320\nI'm on this the reason one of the reasons I'm fascinated by this is I'm on the facebook a lot\n\n01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:13.040\nI'm in a facebook group that is los felices echo park silver lake. It's the neighborhood\n\n01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:19.120\ngroup right about that and and people will get on and do exactly what we just did where somebody will say\n\n01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.280\nI don't like when people ride their bikes on the sidewalk and you get pushback\n\n01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:29.840\nAnd it's the most interesting. It's it's any any point of view almost, you know, any point we go like like when the\n\n01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.080\nLike you see it all the time now with like the woman thing like when somebody goes like\n\n01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.760\nSo this is a profile of a woman who says when she was 13\n\n01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.320\nJohnny Depp I'm making this up. Don't sue me. I like like I'm riffing one. Johnny Depp\n\n01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:54.400\nI've picked her up as a hitchhiker and say a a fingered her and and then he made her be his personal assistant\n\n01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.080\nHe never thanked her and she got pregnant. He talked her into an abortion\n\n01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.520\nAnd it's like it's like this whole like like the part of your brain that goes from that's hot goss\n\n01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.160\nto like\n\n01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.000\nI gotta police this\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nIt it I think it's linked somehow\n\n01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.920\nLike like and I started putting road flares on it where I'm like wait if this\n\n01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:23.200\nWoman who's 40 saying when she was 13 Johnny Depp did this or whatever like if I don't police it\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nIf I don't pipe up and go\n\n01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.840\nGive me a break. First of all, I believe you second of all like\n\n01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.120\nWhy are you hitchhiking if you didn't want that? You know, it's like\n\n01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.480\nIt's it's like we it's almost like\n\n01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.960\nYeah, we hate women\n\n01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.280\nBut also like there's a there could be a deeper problem here that's actually like just becomes racism sexism\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.680\nclosed-mindedness dog\n\n01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.120\ndogmatism\n\n01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.080\nIf I can like just just general bad humanity\n\n01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:56.800\nYeah, that hasn't been tested at this many rpms because there's been no internet\n\n01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.160\nThere's a little conditioning going on\n\n01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:05.200\nWe just like we need to like we need to medically evolve a little bit to get we the same way that we realized carbs and\n\n01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:11.680\nGlutons or whatever we go through phases.

Right? Right because the bad guys certainly are afraid of that and you know what?\n\n01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400\nThat's why they're bad guys because\n\n01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.960\nThey're right because when they're what they're afraid of is if everybody starts saying\n\n01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.480\nI want the pants to be evenly distributed. They will lose some of their pants. They have a valid fear\n\n01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.560\nThat makes them the death star\n\n01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.560\nWe have an irrational fear of it when we when we're dealing on a human level\n\n01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.760\nLike we we get like we just don't want to like we think that if we don't get mad when you get cut off in traffic\n\n01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.560\nThat everyone's going to start cutting you off in traffic and there's just no science to back that up\n\n01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.800\nIn fact, what's going to happen when you fly into a fucking right?\n\n01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.800\nIt's actually no you finished that idea because I think you're gonna cause more you're gonna get more of that\n\n01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.280\nlose your general like\n\n01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.040\nFucking\n\n01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.680\nAppreciation of good driving.

We know everything about that shooting\n\n01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.360\nWe know everything about that genocide. We were there. We have pictures of it\n\n01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.000\nAnd we get to watch the survivors argue with the other survivors and the one the survivor\n\n01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.400\nThen turns out to be a bigot later and\n\n01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.400\nMeanwhile this basketball player that that nailed a free throw and he was a meme for 20 minutes\n\n01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.560\nNow he turned out that dogfights in his basement and it's just like every big Bill Cosby's\n\n01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760\nLike it's like the camera is everywhere.

We just gotta like\n\n01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.240\nWe gotta not\n\n01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.360\nLet it give us a bad trip like like it's it's okay. This is overwhelming.

I think that I think I was I was realizing this\n\n01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.400\nI was watching some movie that had something to do with good versus flash garden\n\n01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:05.520\nAnd uh, I was like, I think part of it might be because I I get really disillusioned when I think about like how\n\n01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520\nUm, oh\n\n01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:14.480\nEvil's more powerful than good like it's it out numbers it and all this stuff, but it's like that's actually only a reaction to\n\n01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.400\nthe\n\n01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:24.000\nUh false impression that anybody ever wanted me to think that good and evil were like this fucking rocky versus drago even matched\n\n01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.760\nLike\n\n01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:32.960\nWhich is a fantasy if you if you thought about good as being about one fifth as powerful as evil in almost any context\n\n01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.360\nLike one fifth the size one fifth the the advantage\n\n01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:43.360\nLike like like because if it's good, it's good and it's not evenly matched with the amount of like\n\n01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.520\nLike like my therapist says that like negative shit like\n\n01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.840\nAffects your brain five times more than positive shit. Somebody says\n\n01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:59.520\nYeah, somebody says I like that shirt and it's like it just burns off like fucking flambé and a fancy restaurant\n\n01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.560\nWe evolved to you know have to survive danger. So it's like. Oh, is that a grizzly bear?\n\n01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.720\nProbably not like you know, you can't say probably not you have to say\n\n01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.640\nOh god, that's definitely a rock that might one percent chance be of grizzly bear and then you know, you know\n\n01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:20.240\nYeah, we're not the we're not the progeny of of the chimps that that plate that we're like, you know\n\n01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.960\nI hate to be a we need to give ourselves a break here\n\n01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.800\nHate to be a smurf, but we are also pre-wired to seek out joy\n\n01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.480\nthat's\n\n01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.920\nWe are wire to speak to seek out joy. We are but I'll tell you one thing we get a huge amount of joy from is\n\n01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:40.320\nBeing the first person to call it when there's something to be alarmed about like like we have a lot a lot of our joy\n\n01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.560\nIs like tied into like alarmism?\n\n01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.000\nWe amplify negative outcomes like if you say hey\n\n01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.480\nI'll flip you a coin and if I flip a coin you win two dollars\n\n01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.280\nAnd if you lose the flip you give me 50 cents\n\n01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.200\nIt's like you could do that all day and then on average you will win a ton of money, but people will not see it that way\n\n01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.640\nPeople will be like no I could lose some serious money. It's like people have a psychological tendency to think that risks are way worse\n\n01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.760\nLike we definitely still do seek incentives and fine. Yeah, but to your point. I think I mean what you're saying is\n\n01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.480\nbut that\n\n01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.840\nWe're not going from giraffes don't have\n\n01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:27.520\na 50% good 50% bad perception like they they're just thinking about leaves and shit and they're\n\n01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080\nThey they're the worst like\n\n01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:38.160\nWe graduated to having a concept of good and bad and we're just we just keep finding out that\n\n01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.120\nWe perceive good a lot less\n\n01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.160\nLike but we should still look at it as a gigantic leap from the hippopotamus which doesn't\n\n01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.400\nGive a fuck who's good and who's bad and what's good and what's bad\n\n01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:58.160\nLike the the hippo has no taste bud in its mouth for that and we have a thousand. We just have eight thousand more that taste bad\n\n01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.240\nSometimes we get addicted to the fine tuning of our existence\n\n01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.920\nYou know\n\n01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.920\nGotta change those couches\n\n01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:15.360\nIs all dirty and we're an alarmist primate species that learn to adapt like a mild amount of pack\n\n01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:22.240\nIf we see a couch because we're really out hunted by by a biological killing machine couch hunters\n\n01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.400\nWhat the biological killing machines?\n\n01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.280\nWhat what\n\n01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:35.840\nTuned by man defined and hunt couches and murder does this get you less high as you smoke more or as you get more high\n\n01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.920\nIt gets you less high\n\n01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.360\nThat's the thing about we now less high than you have been you push through\n\n01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.840\nSo you can get so high that you're no longer really high. Yeah, that's what I like\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.880\nAnd then I like to push through that into being that high again\n\n01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:55.600\nAnd that's like 300 percent. I like how it hangs in the air. It's very fun. I don't know if the cameras picked that up\n\n01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.000\nBut it's cool. You know what you'd really like hanging in the air\n\n01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.800\nUh-oh blue apron. Oh shit\n\n01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:05.840\nTell us imagine if a box of food could hang in the air outside your door every day\n\n01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.720\nOkay, I'm currently eating seshwan chops with fried pork nuts\n\n01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:14.560\nseshwan chops pork nuts\n\n01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.080\nMmm\n\n01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.920\nIt's so sad watching your own brain die like like like like like like you just like the simple things\n\n01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.080\nOr you just like can't riff can't riff food. Oh, come on. I can't riff no food\n\n01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.560\nAnd then and then just all the like the celebrities names you just you just slowly forgetting them\n\n01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.960\nThat's like burning from the edges. Uh, like like a map in a fucking western like it's just like coming in like oh\n\n01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.040\nOh, how do I do when you when that happens to you? Do you sit there and try to\n\n01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.120\nYou don't you don't look it up right or ask anybody because you think that you can jump start your fucking dead synapse\n\n01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.120\nThat that were made you not remember jeff bridge's name and the garrick\n\n01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.560\nDo you think there's bulletin jeff bridge's name lu garrick is lu garrick\n\n01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:01.680\nDid you know that\n\n01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360\nThat brain she died\n\n01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.760\nThat's brain\n\n01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.280\nShe died\n\n01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.960\nThat's why that's why we have to acquire wisdom because that's all we can offer these new kids\n\n01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.000\nWe can't we're not going to be smarter and funnier than them. We're gonna we but only the only thing we can do is be like\n\n01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.280\nKid\n\n01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.440\nTake it easy. Don't eat that berry\n\n01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:28.400\nOr do and just don't freak out when you look like you have three hands. Yeah, you don't have three hands\n\n01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.240\nLike calm down\n\n01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.520\nYou're you there's no way you have an opinion about this. You're 16. Give me some gum\n\n01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:39.200\nDid you say that brain she died that brain she died?\n\n01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.880\nYeah, does that make sense like in a context that i'm not getting\n\n01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.320\nWell, it's sort of like it doesn't not make sense. I was being like kind of nautical\n\n01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.880\nI guess with a skosher jamaican\n\n01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:55.600\nI got that then. Okay, that day. I was going to say Bob Marley, but with Robert Robert Shaw on high seas\n\n01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.400\nI thought it was like one of those do androids dream of electric shrimp or whatever\n\n01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.000\nLike yeah, I was just trying to get primal, you know, I was like that I was I was like I was like forget it\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.960\nBut you know like words that brain she died, you know, I was like I did note\n\n01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.880\nYeah, no, that was good. I was like, you know, that's the ultimate. Fuck you is for guys to\n\n01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.520\nUh, feminize their own brains. Yeah, the like the way we do ships and\n\n01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:23.680\neverything that we're like, oh, it's a she because it's\n\n01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.200\nLike\n\n01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.480\nIt's like our ultimate doff of the cap like look at her look at this boat. She's a beauty. We're like, we're like, yeah\n\n01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.720\nYou know, like you're about to take a test. Let's see if the old girl still got it. Yeah\n\n01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.400\nBecause if you made it a dude, you'd be in pie. Let's climb on that big fat cock and go fight some russians\n\n01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400\nIt's but you're Bill Bill\n\n01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.840\nCome on. What are you doing? Look at those balls. Let's just people come on. Look at all those guys carrying balls and\n\n01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.480\nBill's having a little bit of an episode when you clean your gun\n\n01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:02.320\nI want you to think of it like it's your your husband. Okay. All right. All right. Let's just uh,\n\n01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.720\nAnyway, let's bring the singer out again\n\n01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:10.080\nHey, yeah, everything. Let's get out here and sing a little bit. Bill. What the fuck the investors are here\n\n01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:16.000\nBut that'd be kind of cool. Like, like, you know, your own brain. You're like, oh man, my brain. She's not running good today\n\n01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.560\nYeah, I like I can't I can't tell\n\n01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.440\nThat's fun. It's polarizing. That's what it is. Oh, it's polarizing. Well, you would take better care of it\n\n01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.040\nIf it were shirts, what's your reaction? I got a emotional level to men\n\n01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.840\nUsing the female pronouns to refer to their own brains\n\n01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:45.760\nSo that so going from battleships to brains and calling on women wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be like a slippery slope anyway\n\n01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.240\nIt would just be more of the same at least we'd be talking about our brains\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.400\nHey, you're talking about it. It's very do you know what I'm saying?\n\n01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:02.560\nIt's very crazy thing is if we started calling women he and she or he he and him because because we were like that's it\n\n01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.560\nWe're taking it. You know, like we're like like only battleships are women now\n\n01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:13.520\nLike like that last parade was out of bounds you guys. I don't like how many of you showed up and I don't like what you burnt\n\n01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.600\nFrom now on you're a bunch of hymns. That's what you are if I want to talk to a woman. I'll talk to this gun\n\n01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.000\nI'm gonna clean her. I believe we've pushed through\n\n01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.040\nWe've finally pushed through\n\n01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.160\nLike we just revealed\n\n01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.040\nYeah, Schrab\n\n01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.120\nWhen does solo come out and how long does it usually take for a movie and when are you and I gonna go see it together\n\n01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.600\nI'll go see solo with you for sure. Are you serious?\n\n01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.560\nSee a movie together\n\n01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.160\nI make these exceptions for these some of these star wars movies not the recent one\n\n01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:59.680\nWe haven't seen a single star wars movie together since\n\n01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.240\nphantom menace\n\n01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.480\nWell, no, there was the one there was there was the one that came out after phantom menace\n\n01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.480\nThat was either the second or third of the trilogy and and you said have you seen it yet?\n\n01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.000\nAnd I said no and you said are you gonna see it and I said\n\n01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.160\nNot in the theater and you said I will pay for your movie ticket\n\n01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.040\nIf I can go to the theater with you and sit sideways in the seat next to you and watch you watch it\n\n01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.080\nAnd I think we did that\n\n01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.720\nMust have been the second one\n\n01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:36.080\nFlying rtd too. It wasn't like it wasn't aside from aside from that invitation. It wasn't there was nothing cool about it\n\n01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:42.960\nYeah, so it's not really unmemorable, but yeah, we watched the phantom menace together. We sure did. We sure did. We were so excited\n\n01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.320\nWe're so excited. It was a rainy\n\n01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.800\nCan we get a confirmation on the solo date though? Yeah, what's going on? Are we gonna wear solo costumes?\n\n01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.720\nYeah, man\n\n01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.400\nNew solo or old solo both one of each right?\n\n01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:05.920\nI don't want to wear my dad. Did you get your garage fixed yet? Yeah, awesome. But there's no address on my garage. You get your what?\n\n01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:13.760\nYour what garage you get your garage tickets yet? The garage is fixed. Yeah, they haven't quite finished\n\n01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:20.800\nAre they playing at the palladium? But the people that deliver food keep coming coming this fall to the palladium garage\n\n01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120\nJustifiably complaining Harmon's garage\n\n01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:26.160\nPlaying for four nights\n\n01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.160\nAll right, here they come\n\n01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.880\nLooking lovely. Look at these new boots the garage are wearing. Look at that\n\n01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:39.600\nThere's the fluorescent light that he's pretty sure is on all the time, but it never has the patience to test\n\n01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.800\nBecause you can just always see it still on\n\n01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.240\nIt's probably it's definitely not on during the daytime somehow\n\n01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:51.680\nSo it only knows to come on at night and then stay on all throughout the night. So it has consciousness\n\n01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.720\nWe've confirmed that\n\n01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.800\nI think I'm so sorry I asked about that fucking garage\n\n01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.080\nIt's been the pain of his existence. Cody's dog pisses in Harvey's water dish\n\n01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.200\nOn the reg\n\n01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.520\nHe doesn't mind it though. I'm sure he don't he fucking laps it up. He loves it\n\n01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.880\nHarvey loves Barbara and Barbara's like I can't tell\n\n01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.720\nLike I mean it's that is the ultimate like even in the dog world. That's like\n\n01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.400\nLike straight disrespectful fucking amazing\n\n01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:31.200\nLike she just pisses and Cody said I've never seen her do it. I was like I always pictured her like peeing on it like marking the bowl\n\n01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:36.160\nUh, she said no, she fucking like aims it into it\n\n01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.320\nWow, does Cody's dog have her own bowl there?\n\n01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.840\nUh water.
