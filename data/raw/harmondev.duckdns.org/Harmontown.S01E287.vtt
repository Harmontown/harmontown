00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this installment of Harmontown.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I am Brandon Johnson, sitting in for the lovely Jeff Davis.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
We miss you so much.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Can't wait to have him back.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
It's so good to be here.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Glad you tuned in.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Put on your shit in pants.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Get ready to take a shit, because we're taking you to Harmontown.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Let me bring to the stage someone you know and love,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
and you know you love him, Spencer Crittenden.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Dear, dear, and aren't you so lucky?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
They call him the wonder.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
They call him the 20th wonder of downtown Pomona.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Rock Schrab.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Let's bring him to the stage.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
He looks so good.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Don't you agree?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And last but not least, from an Ikea bed,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
$79 we're offering a special right now here in Harmontown.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
The first 15 callers gets his bed for $74.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Yo, wake up sleepyhead.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Yo, rapping in bed.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Yo, I'm just a rapping sleepyhead.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Yo, I didn't want to be awake, but I got to get out for your mama's sake.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I got to fuck her pussy, I got to fuck her butt.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I got to kiss her tail.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I start to nut.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I got to stay in bed and play Minecraft,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
but I like to fuck your mama in her crack.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
So I got to try to be a master of both worlds.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I got to fuck your mama and all the other girls.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
Yo, when I go to the street, thank you for getting me back on beat.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
I'm just a Minecraft bed, rapping motherfucker.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I fucked your mom like my name was Chris Tucker.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Yes.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes, Tucker.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Good morning. Good morning, everybody.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Good morning, Daniel.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
How'd you sleep?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Did you have any great dreams?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Good, yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
You sounded like you were having a nightmare.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And you were there.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I was merely a fly who dreamt of being a man.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And now the fly has awakened.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh, that's great.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Let's see.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
What have we got here?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And then let's get back to bed.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
We ordered french fries.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
No, we didn't.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
All right, composite sketches in true crime shows.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
I noticed that in all stories, true crime stories,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
in which the composite sketch actually plays an active role,

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
the people are always like, and the sketch came through.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And when you look, and then we found him at the train station,

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
he looks exactly, you could, it's like they drew a photograph of him

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
and then they show it split screen and it's either,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
it's like the most information you could get from a composite sketch

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
is the person's race.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Like that's it.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
All it is is just a racist drawing of either a white guy

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
or a black guy or a Hispanic guy.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
It never looks anything like the guy.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
If it's a white guy, it looks like maybe the darkness of the hair is represented.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
But they always do this big thing about how accurate the sketch was.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's never accurate.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
And police work doesn't seem to work.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Eyewitness accounts are garbage.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
So the sketch by nature is going to be garbage.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah, it's pretty crazy how people just get shit wrong.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
The amount of like, what do you call them,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
unjust, what are the technical terms,

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
the wrongful convictions.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Church for the wind.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
The wrongful convictions that are turned over, it's fucking crazy.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Like when we came out with DNA and we opened that box and we're like,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
oh man, everyone in prison is like, it's like a crapshoot.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
It is crazy, but there's a thing called the Innocence Project.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I hope people know about it.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
It is amazing.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
There's a lot.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What was the thing though?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
There was a little, there was like, who is it?

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
There was some case where the guy was like railing against the Innocence Project a little bit.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Bill Cosby.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
No.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
That would be amazing if he just bothered to, he's like, well, I'm here.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
He's just ragging them up.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
Since my stock can't go down anymore, I may as well experience being a villain.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm trying to do old Cosby.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
But no, there was somebody, I can't remember who it was, but they were in the difficult

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
position of like, I don't know, some crazy case.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
And then they were saying like, yeah, but the.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
You must have quit.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
The Innocence Project like wanted, they were claiming that the Innocence Project was like

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
pressuring them to, to fuck man.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
It's like, it's not, it wasn't quite as simple as, because the Innocence Project isn't going

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
to want you to plea, plea out necessarily, but it was like something close to that where

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
basically because the guy wouldn't just do the thing that would make the Innocence Project

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
put another notch in their belt, they just, they just dropped them like a rock because

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
he was sticking to his actual convictions.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And I can't remember what the fuck it was, but anyways, whatever.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, Gandhi was an asshole too.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
You can look it up.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Like, like, like, like, it's a.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Let's not look it up.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Let's dive.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Let's have a deep dive tonight into what made Gandhi an asshole.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I think, I think he was racist.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Maybe I like, like against like maybe some race that maybe when he was growing up beat

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
up his dad.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I don't know.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Tonight on Harmontown, but you know, the irony is he would eat.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
He ate that race that tonight on harm.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
It was ravenous for them.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
No, I.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I love that.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
But more importantly, we need to understand, I would urge us.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't care what we think anymore, but I like, we got to stop our hero worship.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Like who care?

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Gandhi, I'm sure he, you know, he probably like, he probably like owed somebody money.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You know, he probably cheated at cards.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
And he loved eating that race.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Who cares?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
You know, he did something.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
He did one.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He did a good thing.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
You know, somebody makes an album.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It's a good album.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Then you find out that they're a bad unicyclist like an all of a sudden fucking world falls

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
apart.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Like, like.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I just let's assume everyone sucks.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
And then we'll be like, we're just begrudgingly interacting with anyone.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
So it's like, yeah, he made that movie.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, we actually, we've fallen from this world where everybody was, you know, things were

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
so much classier and more heroic and gilded.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
But yeah, we all also know that every time we pop the hood on any one of these people

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
from for that survives into the modern world, like they end up, it's like, Oh God, they

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
were a horrible piece of shit.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
That's like the invitation there should probably be, you know, we got to stop expecting people

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
to be either gods or monsters, whatever.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
You've heard the yammer.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Maybe the inspiration we can draw is that people are amazing even when they're just people.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
So instead of us like judging the past, we could sort of be inspired by the fact that

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
despite the fact that Martin Luther King had mistresses and did all sorts of crazy sex

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
stuff and smoke marijuana that just came out.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
And also as a co-kid that also just came out that we could still be inspired by him.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I mean, that's that's always been a good classic example because it's like so it's it's like

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
a yeah, Martin Luther King cheated.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Like he sees he was he was a philanderer.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
He was like, he was not a perfect person.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
He was like, and it's like, God damn, can yeah, like, like, I don't know.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
It's it's hard.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Not bad for somebody who isn't perfect.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
The problem is that we invented like all this technology that we can use to like it's

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
a black light.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Like we look at each other and then but like people are supposed to just be people.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
That's what you're saying.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
I just think it's crazy because why does someone assume that because you're good at rallying

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
people to fight for the rights, you're an excellent husband.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That's the thing that's the disconnect that's happening.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
And that's the putting on a pedestal behavior, which is unhealthy and usually comes with

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
not viewing someone as a real person.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
So in a way is kind of maybe dehumanizing after its fashion because we because it's

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
hero worship because hero worship gives us and I'm as guilty as anybody like we you want

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
to you want to live in a world where people become the focus, you know, like like individuals

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
so that you can go, OK, well, if that person turned out to be racist or a woman beater

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
or whatever it's good, that's a that was a close call because I was going to have to

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
stop eating meat for a second there.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
And like like we focus on these people and then we go like but it's funny our capacity

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
for it doesn't always take the form of like cynicism like we we collectively but I think

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
we we do it like the wave like we one section of the Coliseum like rises up and says this

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
guy was the guy of Comey 2012.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Remember that guy?

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
That guy that made that video that that pretty much through no fault of his own just happened

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
to be viewed by 80 billion people.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
And and then so then like while half of the world was like this is amazing.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
It automatically makes the other half of your body go like why is it amazing?

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Let's let's ask questions of the guy ends up in his street in the underwear in the underwear

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
jerking off in the San Diego street in his underwear.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I think that is a very interesting point.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
I wonder if there's science to that because you do get a sense that people tend to bifurcate

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
into like binaries.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
It's like if there's going to be a yes, then there's naturally going to be a no.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, it's like and it's more about like like a gut instinct or like a sociological thing

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
more than it is about the actual facts in a situation ever.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, I guess I always feel that way.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
Like it's like, oh, I thought I liked so and so like you want to you want to get all in

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
for some reason like it's easier.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
We should recognize it as a truly lethal instinct though this this this this this taste we have

10:15.000 --> 10:24.000
for admiration of people because it's a it's a prelude to it's like a vampire bite.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
It's like we're like hungry for their neck and we act like just because it's flattering

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
in the first step that the that we're not doing what we're doing, which is like we're

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
going to we're going to hurt that person.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
There's this new thing where everyone is swapping out now Donald Glover based on his performance

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
this weekend for Kanye.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Poop de scoop.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
They're saying on Twitter.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, I don't even know what that I don't worry about it.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
It's all bad.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
So it's this idea that like, oh, these people are interchangeable and Kanye failed us.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
And now we good.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Thank God that he showed right up Donald Glover is right here and we we have our rapper.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
It's a crazy thing and you're like, oh, these two are not related at all.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
One person can be having a mental breakdown and the other person be having a great moment

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
in history and they're not either one or in service to you at all.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
So it's crazy to watch us within 24 hours within a week.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Be like, well, we're done with Kanye.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Who's next?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, how convenient.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
He's there.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I mean, it's a total.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Well, that's look at what we do with our movie remakes and stuff.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
We just go like, oh, breaking bad guy is bald now because he's not breaking bad.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
He should be Lex Luthor.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, it's like the dumbest shit.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
And that's where that's where racism comes from, too, because you go you go like, oh,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
if you recognize if you can connect baldness as a dot, you sure are going to connect a

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
rapper and blackness and like specifically, you know, Donald is a fan of Kanye and like

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
clearly heavily influenced by him.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
But but like, yeah, it is it is like fucked up that your brain goes there and goes, but

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
we've always had that.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It's like, you could only have one Kevorkian at a time.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
You can only have one Dr. Ruth at a time, one Madonna, like Johnny Carson comes out.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
He's going to make a there's only there's only five jokes you can tell.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
And so who's the slut tarot card?

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Is it Madonna or is it Dolly Parton because of her giant tits or, you know, like through

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
the decades?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Dolly Parton.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
It kind of you kind of pick one, you know, the concept of Godwin's law like Dolly Parton

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
is really just saying like we do pick famous archetypes and just you run with those like

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
what's relevant.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And so the bad one is Hitler.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
You can see that.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Dolly Parton.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
She's the good one.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
What is it?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You keep you always hated part.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Why?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
What's your beef with Dolly Parton?

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
No, I'm just saying she's sexier than Hitler.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, I'm going to disagree.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
It's controversial.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, it is.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
I think that it's important to understand this stuff because it's like what you're what

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
we're talking about is like this oversimplification or something, this very late mental laziness.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
And like, I think we need to understand the aspects of our human mind that do that because

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
like, for instance, I don't know, you tend to forget like you forget a phone number.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
If you know a phone number is in your phone because your brain makes a mental shortcut.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
It's like your brain's always defragging and trying to do things to save space and it's

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
making bad judgments and stereotypes to save space.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And we need to understand that.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
But I think the concept of even admitting that is like it makes certain people insecure

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
or not feeling control or have to deny it.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
And it's like, no, it's very freeing to understand what's actually going on behind the engine.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
We just have to, you know, take that into account because we do have a car that needs to not break.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Right.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, you could forgive yourself.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Right.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You could go, oh, there I go again being human.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
I guess.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Oh, sorry.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Change the oil.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
I fucked up like because I'm a fucking monkey with a fucking robot brain stuck into my head

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
by a God that really just is experimenting as he goes.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
And I'm like, I'm wound up and I'm like not used to living in concrete instead of a jungle.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
And I fucked up.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm a monster right in that moment.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So like.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Because we also, here's the other thing, we don't know how to cope with happiness either

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
for the same reason.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Like we.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm getting there.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Are you learning how to cope with happiness?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Getting there.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I got the therapist, the therapist ordered, she didn't order me.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
She told me that's the last thing.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Like I got to, I have to learn how to process happiness.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
You want to, you want to go to the Buddhist temple with me tomorrow?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
That's not how you process happiness.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
You fucking hippie.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Wow.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Sorry.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
He's right.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
He's right.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
He's right.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
He's right.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
He's right.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
He's right.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
I saw Spencer going into egg slut one morning.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh yeah.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
And he yelled at me and I heard a yell that sounded like Rob Schrab.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And I was like Rob Schrab, he doesn't be in Glendale.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
And I turned around.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
It was like seven o'clock in the morning.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
And it was some other car that I didn't recognize and I didn't see him.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
But I was like, I'm certain that was a Rob Schrab noise.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
But I don't see any Rob Schrab sources.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I screamed egg slut.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
And shamed him.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
As you were going.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
What did I think you said?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I texted you what I thought you said.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
You said, I thought you said exit.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Exit.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Exit.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I thought some like my first instinct was someone was telling me to leave.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
That makes more sense than calling a business egg slut.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Slut.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I always knew you were such a slut.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
How much do you?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Such a slut.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
All these videos now, that Glover video.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You're such a slut, Spencer.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
You're egg slut.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
I love eggs.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I always knew.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I always knew.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I could always tell you you're such a little egg slut.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
So loose with eggs.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You're so slutty with those eggs.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Egg slut.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Next to VL4.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I want to know what Dan's thought was.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Well, I just wonder.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I have the old school question about it, which probably doesn't even apply anymore.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Because I think it's kind of.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
These are real names of businesses.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm just wondering.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Egg slut.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Wondering.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Texaco.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Yellow fever.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Baskin Robbins.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
What is going on?

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
What kind of pop goes the world bullshit are we living in?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
What?

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
Spencer, my Dungeon Master is walking into egg slut as I'm on the way to LA Fitness to

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
do push ups.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
In Glendale.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
In Glendale.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I was just wondering.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
And the world keeps on turning.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It keeps turning.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
One day turns into the next day.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
And now I'm talking about my Dungeon Master going into egg slut before I go into LA Fitness

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
to do push ups.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
In Glendale.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
It's the promos for push ups.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Good thing George Carlin's dead.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You're the new George Carlin.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I know.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
There can't be two old white guys doing this.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You think I'm white?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You were saying you'd watched a bunch of videos.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't know what all these Donald Glover videos are.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
I watched a childish video and I was just, I'm just, I'm just finding myself wondering

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
because I'm 45.

17:06.000 --> 17:14.000
Like, wait, do you think, are the, are the, are the, are the wonors, wonors?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
No.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
That's all CG.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Oh yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I was wondering about that.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You don't think there is some compositing?

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Well, I'm sure there's, and he's like, nothing really went in front of the camera, but I

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
mean, there was one when they go with just before.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I mean, if you sit down and look at, if you look at something like Birdman, if you're

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
watching for it, you could kind of say, oh, they probably did it there.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
It's like a camera turn or something like that.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I'd have to go through it.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Well, I'm saying what this, but at this point, do you think if you go through it, because

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
I remember that's where we were with the Collier Boy friend video.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Like I was like watching and like, okay, okay, they changed there.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
They changed there.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.500
But now I think we're at the point where they might have, you could, you don't, you don't

17:56.500 --> 18:02.000
have to have a fucking waiter walk through frame in order to like fake a, a winner.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Right.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
That's true.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I mean, I'm sure they did as much of it as humanly possible, just knowing, knowing.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Knowing those crazy guys.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I do not think it was a winner.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
But they made it look effortless and they made it look seamless.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
So, you know, they deserve, they deserve, they deserve my thumbs up.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm going to click on that.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Add it to the 10 million views.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I just saw what I pulled it up.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And that's just since yesterday.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
That's, that's quite a Monday morning when nobody wants to work.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
That's going to triple.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I really got to watch that Atlanta show.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Did you like the video that you watched?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Yes, I did.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I guess you're kind of compelled to be.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
But I like Atlanta for the same reason I thought those are very interesting music videos just

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
because it's like, I, I don't know.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I can't.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Who could make this?

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
It's like, it's just like, it's, I want to see it because it's like, I couldn't do

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
it.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It's from outside your, your world.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
It's from outside your tendencies.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
It's from outside.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
I mean, that's, that's the crazy thing about Glover is like when, when he was just the

19:11.000 --> 19:19.000
funny kid on the set, like you still knew he had a 350 IQ and there was always something

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
frightening underneath about it.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Like because he was just so fucking smart.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
And, and you could see that he would just, it was like, he was just, he was like a stem

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
cell, but that's not, not the way Bob Dylan was where there's a lot of detractors of Bob

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Dylan where they go like, oh, all he did was hang out and like learn, learn shit.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Like, I don't think, I don't think Glover's like that.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
Like, it was just like, he was young, but he was like, he's just like, like, like, like

19:49.000 --> 19:55.500
he's, he's, he could have done anything and now he's like at that century post and it's

19:55.500 --> 19:59.000
like just from outside.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
That's all you know is that it's lateral.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Like it's, it's, it's, it's, it's crazy.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Like, like I haven't watched the fucking show yet, but, but I, but I watched that video

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
and I read his, his profile piece in, in whatever magazine was.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
And it was like, oh, that was always when you look backwards, you can see so clearly

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
the, the, the growth, but like looking forward, you would never know if you went back in time

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
and you were like, he's gonna, he's gonna do that.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
You ever think you two will make up?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't think we're fighting.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm trying to start something.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
I remember him saying in his Instagram and he hoped he didn't, I didn't hate him or whatever.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Did you ever reply to anything?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I've seen him since then.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
We had, we had, we had a little meet and greet like probably two years ago now.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
For Deadpool cartoons.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It wasn't for Deadpool.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
A different cartoon?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
No.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Are you sure?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
It wasn't, we ended it, we, we, we, we, we, we were just catching up.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
See that, that Affinity War?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
You ever see that show?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Affinity War came out.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
You talking about the Marvel movie?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Pretty sure he's talking about the movie.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
The guys are in it.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Let's do Rob Schrab's top three Infinity War spoilers.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Okay.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
There's a segment.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
All right.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Rob Schrab.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Number one.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
No, no, no.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Infinity War rap.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Who gives me a beat?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
We all do.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Number four.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Wait.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Infinity Wars.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
The spoilers are here.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
It's time to hear what happened in Infinity Wars before you see it.

21:48.000 --> 21:55.000
The Infinity Gauntlet is, which is.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Shame on you.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
That could be nice actually.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
A beat like that.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You get it.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Well, okay.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Am I, Brad?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
What?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I said the format is fucking up my shit.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Let's start from scratch.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Because I like this segment.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Let's take this back.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Here's how we do it.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
God.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
We'll do a beat.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
We'll do a beat while I rap.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
And then we'll, I'll rap for two measures.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I think they're called measures, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Bars.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Bars?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Bars.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
The show opens in three nights, people.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I rap for two bars.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I remember like the joke Jeff does.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And then, and then, and then drop, drop the bottom out of that fucker.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Go, go dry.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
And then, and then Schrab will do an Infinity War spoiler.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
And then after, after it's finished, bring that beat back, et cetera.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
So it's kind of like a 10 list effect.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
These are spoilers.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
These are things that.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
These are infinity.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
These are Rob Schrab's Infinity War spoilers.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Cover your ears now.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
They could also be fake spoilers.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
Cover your ears now and don't spread the spoil after I spoil.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, what if we're here, you know, as part of a performance we have to give.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
What do you tell you?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Otherwise want to hear these spoilers.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
What's that?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Someone may not have heard these spoilers is what you're saying.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
That's on stage right now.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Somebody might not have heard these spoilers and I'm about to spoil the spoilers.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
So don't retweet the spoilers.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Quote the spoilers.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Spoil.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
Get hints about the spoilers because you're just going to spoil it for everybody else.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
So if you haven't seen Infinity Wars and you want to be.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Unspoiled.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Unspoiled.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Thank you.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Cover your ears now because it's about to get spoiling.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Okay.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
And also I'm going to say let's make this a 10 minute bit.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Okay.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
All right.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
That way people can fast forward.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm just going to say this that some of the spoilers are kind of dumb and don't really

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
pay off.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Wait, well, you're not really going to do actual spoilers.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
What are we doing?

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
What are we doing?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
What?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I don't want real spoilers.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Maybe one real spoiler, two fake spoilers.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm going to get four spoilers and three of them are going to be fake and one is going

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
to be real.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
And then at the end of my spoiling, you're going to pick which is the spoiler.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I don't like.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I don't like.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Okay.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
No.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Moving on.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Because I don't want to deal in real spoilers.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Let's hit the wrap.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Let's do the four wraps, though.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
No, no, no, no.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Let's just have silence between the wraps.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I feel like so many wraps already.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I thought you were going to do joke spoilers.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
What?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I thought you were going to do joke spoilers.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
You didn't even see the fucking movie and what you're talking about.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Well, so you were going to do it.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
So can we see some, let's just, let's just do the spoilers.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Let's do three spoilers.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
What you're getting angry at is that you like, you committed so much.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
You convinced me.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Well, you dick.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Three spoilers.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Drop that beat.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Drop it.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Infinity.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Infinity war spoilers.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
This is the segment where infinity gets spoiled.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Deal with it.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Oh, Thanos.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Is that two bars?

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Welcome, boys and ghouls.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I'm the spoiler.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Oh.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Sounds like some Crip Creeper.

25:29.000 --> 25:39.000
The fourth spoil of the infinity wars is that the infinity gauntlet is finite.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah, infinity war spoilers.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
No, no, you don't need to see it.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
My health shake is almost finished.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
He just took a stick and peed it.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah, infinity war spoilers.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Yo, Rob Schrab's infinity war spoilers.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Avengers.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, no.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm a red spoiler.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
I'm the bad guy of this spoiling.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Okay.

26:08.000 --> 26:16.000
There are three Scarlett Johansson cameos in infinity wars.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Yeah.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Spoilers.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
It's a more complicated.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
The first.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Oh, sorry.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Sorry.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Subset of infinity war spoilers is this guy.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Spoilers.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Three.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
Her role in the professional as Natalie Fortman.

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
Your picture didn't know Scarlett Johansson was pretending to be Natalie Fortman as a

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
child in the professional.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Okay.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
That's that's the that's one of three of that guy's spoilers.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
We can just do the first one.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Okay.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Otherwise, that's kind of like eight spoilers.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Okay.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Or seven.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Spoilers, it's a more complicated bit than you could have participated.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
Yo, it's a complicated movie full of Marvel characters that are going to get spoiled.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
The Hulk.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm a grandma spoiler.

27:13.000 --> 27:21.000
We in the third act of the infinity wars.

27:21.000 --> 27:36.000
There was a mishap on the stage and nobody cleaned it up and it's in the movie.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Rap.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
Yo, behind the scenes spoilers about behind the scenes BTS spoilers from the grandma's

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
point of view.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yo, this stuff doesn't rhyme.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It's just interstitial styrofoam.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Thor's friend.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I'm the original spoiler.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Wow.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Okay.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
I'm going to take this last spoil and jump on my balloon and you'll never get it.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Goodbye.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, no.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Of course, the spoiler would spoil spoiling.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Yeah.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
Damn it, spoiler.

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
Wait, guys, I'm going to send our other amazing current character MC gun control after the

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
spoiler.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
MC gun control.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
It's me, MC gun control awareness gun control.

28:26.000 --> 28:35.000
I'll go get the spoiler using the AR 15, the most devastating weapon in terms of human

28:35.000 --> 28:45.000
lethality, combining a body count greater than all other previous gunpowder based weapons

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
put together.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Keep away from me, you fucking gun.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
The punisher.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm going to use awareness to shoot down his balloon.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Aware wolf.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Using my awareness firing rifle.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
A female aware, where will be aware restness.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh boy.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Okay.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
We're rusty.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
I went over by Mike Chile's house and got a fucking stone by his house.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Yeah.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Just outside.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
He didn't even know I was there.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
It's a sketchy area.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
That's fucked up.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I wouldn't do drugs.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Why am I not high?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
How come everybody's high but me all the time?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Do you want me to go get drugs?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
You don't answer texts.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Yeah.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Because you don't.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I met a fan.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Answer your phone.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
I met a fan who gave us this this free pot stuff.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Oh, yeah?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Oh, give me some.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
Give me kind of what what situation was it though?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
What?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Because when we were in Chicago.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh, sorry.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
When we were in Chicago, somebody handed me four pounds of edible weed gels.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh my God.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Do you remember that?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Do not.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
It was after the show and the guy came up to me had no shoes on and a wet corduroy suit.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Oh, is that Levi?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
That sounds like Levi.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
It was kind of wet.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
No shoes.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Sounds like Levi.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
No shoes.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Was that raining outside?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
No shoes.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
That part, no.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
It wasn't raining.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
That's why I was like.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Oh, that's cool to get to the show.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And he had to be a ton of pot.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Is that a thing?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Do people hand you pot?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Oh, yeah.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
I mean, Spencer's Spencer's kind of like a what we in Minecraft would call a vacuum hopper.

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
Or what you normies would call a lightning rod.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
Having a guy on the show that's a little more like like it's like it's like I assume people

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
do most of the tongue related stuff when they went to kiss concerts to Gene Simmons, even

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
though they all had tongues.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
The show's just for you now.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
They all had tongues.

30:51.000 --> 31:01.000
That was a strange time when kiss was around and Gene Simmons was like the guy that liked

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
sticking his tongue out.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That was like his thing.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
And like he would stick his tongue out and my mom would go terrible.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
I was like, well, it's almost pointless to say it.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
But it just it's still it still makes the mind real.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
Like when you just look at what what our parents were frightened of and us.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
I mean, I was a kid and I was like, boy, George, uncomfortable.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
You know, like, I was like, my brother was into all this cool music, like boy, George

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
and Prince and all that stuff.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
We've talked about that before.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
I was like, I was like, I'll just stay with my Phil Collins because I just I'm not that

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
confident in my and exploring these boundaries that these top 40 singers are exploring.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
But like and then and then the things that your parents were were like, you got to go

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
to a special camp.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
If you had a poster of it on your wall, it's just dudes in makeup.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Just like guys that just wanted to look pretty.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
It's kind of amazing.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I mean, we all you say Phil Collins.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Can I just have what era Phil Collins?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Sususudio.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
No jacket required.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I've been over this.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
I mean, the real thing is that my brother had tasted music.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I did not.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
That was great.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
There was a Genesis eight track in the basement next to the eight track player.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
There was it was like one of five eight tracks.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
Like I just and I just so I just listened to the same thing over and over again.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
And then so then as I hit puberty and it was like time to get my first album, you know,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
because I was like getting hormones in my body.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
I was like, I'm going to get an album for my birthday, not a toy truck.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
I was like, I don't I don't have any favorite bands.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
So just sort of tracking fucking Phil Collins.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So you didn't like Phil Collins?

32:46.000 --> 32:55.000
You were just now just acknowledging that probably not a lot of people that are music

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
musicies.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
They're probably not like, you know, now I'm so old, it doesn't matter now.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
Now it's like being into like a fucking Mel Tormey or something.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It's like it could be it could be as cool as it is.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
It could be anything.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You know who I like?

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
You know who I discovered late in life that I've been a fan of my entire life because

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
like I was listening to YouTube and it just like, you know, just kind of randomly goes

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
over to the something that has the same tags or whatever.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
I was listening to some, I don't know, some 80 song and it just took me to a Billy Ocean

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
playlist.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
And I knew every lyric and I was super happy.

33:36.000 --> 33:46.000
And by the time the 16 songs were done, I was like, I guess I'm a big fan of Billy Ocean.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
He's an ocean of hits.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
He really is.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
He really is, Dan.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
I'm not even kidding about that.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
He has a lot more hits than a lot of people think.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
He has two hits.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
No.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
No.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Count them off.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Don't do it.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Don't do it.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Don't do it.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
Billy Ocean's hits.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Number 10.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Carabin Queen.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
No.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
She's wearing the same thing.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
What's number one?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
You got.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Get out of my dream school.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Get out of my dream school.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
Get out of my dream school.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Number seven.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Because that's it.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
There you go.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Love a boy.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Okay.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
All right.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Number six.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Six.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Six.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Billy Ocean's ocean of hits.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Number six.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
There'll be sad songs to make you cry.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Love songs holding true.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Not a hit.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Not a hit.

34:38.000 --> 34:46.000
You know what I'm doing.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
But he lasted longer than Ricky Martin at this point for sure.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
He's got a lot of hits.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
He's got a lot of hits.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
If you like his music, there's a lot of hits.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Did you watch the videos as well, though?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Is that part of my...

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
You gotta watch the videos.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
You gotta watch the videos.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Something tells me.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
Because inexplicably, fucking a lover boy is a sci-fi video where he rides a horse to

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
a cave and inside the cave is a fucking Star Wars canteen.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Yeah.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Fuck you, Billy Ocean.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
I love you.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
He's dressed like Han Solo.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
He's got the white shirt and black vest.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
It's just like, let me be.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't care.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I want to be your lover boy, but I also want to be Han Solo.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
I want to be a cave.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
I need to get off tattooing.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Cody was wearing a neoprene jacket.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
And she was talking about how she's like, I love my neoprene jacket.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And I call her my bean.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
And then I was like, neoprene bean.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Now she's wearing neoprene.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
And she's like, what are you...

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
That's really catchy.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
What are you doing?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
I'm like, Billy Ocean.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Why do they call it neoprene again?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Why is it neoprene?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Because it's not your mom's preen.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Neoprene.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
What is the texture of the neoprene?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Is it soft?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
It's like scuba suit.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's like a scuba suit.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Slightly spongy sort of skin.

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
It's what Robert Redford had to wear in order to keep from the heat detectors from picking

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
neakers.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
And sneak eakers.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
Did you have a little hiccup in the middle of that?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Yeah.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Well, it was the same suit.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Neoprene me.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Neoprene me.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
But yeah.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Warrant's eakers.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
If there's anything that's three syllables and then a fourth syllable that's separated,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I always think of Billy Ocean.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
If someone goes, can I get some of those Styrofoam eggs?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I go, Styrofoam eggs.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Get out the exit, boobah.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
There's another thing like that.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
What is it?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
What is the song?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
I can't remember.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Girls on film or boys on film?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Girls on film.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Any three syllables.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
No.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Girls on film.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
It's another thing where it's like.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Billy Idol's Eyes Without a Face.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
His lawyer without a case.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Baseball without a face.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
What was the song Billy Ocean did for the Jewel of the Nile?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Oh, Jewel of the Nile.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
What was it?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Oh, right.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Remember that one?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Oh, Jesus.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Go and get tough.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Oh, Jesus.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Get going.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Go and get rough.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Tough, get rough.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
In a head.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
In a head.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
I'll climb any mountain.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
I'll do anything.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I'll do anything.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Ooh, can I touch you?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Can I touch you?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Wow.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah, you did.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Do the things that lovers do.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
You spent time there.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Oh, my ass cheeks.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Uh-oh.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Stuck together.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Why?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Peanut butter.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Peanut butter.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Peanut Butter.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
I know I know in your street culture that you just you don't want to do it the same way twice, but street culture

38:04.000 --> 38:09.320
Look, we've got we've got a customer to serve. So I mean we got a platinum record all half in the can

38:10.000 --> 38:16.440
Can we just take it from the top? All right. Let's just just get this shit done. Okay. I have to go to my mother's house after this

38:16.440 --> 38:21.760
All right, you know one just one. Thank you one. Thank you. That's all before I die, mom

38:21.760 --> 38:28.720
One Billy this wall is covered and I gotta move the history that is taken with your Sunday fucking afternoon

38:28.720 --> 38:32.380
I'm recording here. I gotta go from here Billy and move my mom's couch

38:33.760 --> 38:38.500
Thank you and then when I go hey, can you mind moving the pickup truck so I can take my

38:39.800 --> 38:41.800
She gives me that look

38:42.400 --> 38:44.560
You know, you know, I'm done

38:44.560 --> 38:52.600
What is this a contract what the fuck Billy we're not the ones and it's slowly and looking at you

38:52.600 --> 38:56.640
It sounds like your mom's the one that has the problem

38:57.440 --> 39:00.880
Like we're happy that you're here. Oh my god

39:10.280 --> 39:12.280
Don't worry, this is part of the process

39:12.280 --> 39:18.480
This is where he usually comes around

39:43.280 --> 39:49.920
Please shrink back down to normal size and resume your album recording or we will open fire

39:52.920 --> 39:54.920
Billy no no Billy

39:56.880 --> 40:03.200
Okay, oh shit, I didn't know that would work. Sorry. It's all right. It's all right. Are you ready? Yeah?

40:07.880 --> 40:09.880
We're leaving

40:09.880 --> 40:11.880
You know, I love my mom

40:13.360 --> 40:15.200
Okay, Billy

40:15.200 --> 40:17.200

40:17.920 --> 40:22.560
Just lay this track down and get out of here Billy. He's really Dan is waiting. Okay, but let it go

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040

I always wanted to see him go up with things go up to Diana's good. Let me fuck you. I want to fuck you, you know

After eating here. Got a stomach cut open. Fill it with titties. Fill it with titties and squirt blood

50:00.640 --> 50:05.120
That's the thing about the 70s is we were on to something we were titties were squirting blood

50:08.320 --> 50:11.920
So yes, now we have pissed him off to answer your question

50:13.560 --> 50:15.560
Have we ever pissed?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.640
Yeah, now. Yeah. Yep. Now we have

50:18.640 --> 50:26.320
Um, do you see any now I now I get now again T we have do you do you see any Kanye spectrum?

50:27.960 --> 50:33.760
As him yeah, do you this this recent meltdown? Do you can you do one? Oh, did he have a wait?

50:33.760 --> 50:36.880
Did he have a meltdown? Yeah, do one thing for me because what did he do?

50:36.880 --> 50:42.960
Oh, I didn't I haven't been keeping so Kanye West has been in the press lately doing different things

50:42.960 --> 50:46.160
He stopped by TMZ where he announced that slavery was a choice

50:46.160 --> 50:49.760
the 400 years of oppression was a choice and

50:50.840 --> 50:56.380
Has a fire dismanagement has gotten on and off trip Twitter in a sporadic way

50:56.960 --> 51:04.280
Came out and wore a MAGA hat. Right. I saw yeah, and it's been getting sort of progressively worse as we've been going on

51:04.280 --> 51:06.280
So some people

51:06.360 --> 51:13.040
Are mad but what I see is a little bit of spectrum ish or a little bit of some people are saying drug use

51:13.040 --> 51:17.760
Meds on and off meds. Yeah, because we talk about that on the show every once in a while

51:17.760 --> 51:21.920
I was wondering. Do you see any of that? Well, sure for

51:22.320 --> 51:24.440
In what Kanye is doing. Yeah, of course

51:24.440 --> 51:28.880
I mean it was the alternative would be to go. No, I think Kanye is being completely

51:29.400 --> 51:36.320
Rational and was born without any like neurological. Yeah, I think it's that

51:36.320 --> 51:43.040
He's always been a weirdo. He's always been a weirdo. He's always been pretty. I mean, yeah

51:43.040 --> 51:49.960
I mean, he's he's always a big personality. I always I would like like I'm always like how many fucking albums

51:49.960 --> 51:51.960
Do you need to go platinum before?

51:52.280 --> 51:59.480
Like how you know, is there a little bit of a you know, how much shit did we put up with from from from old white guys?

51:59.480 --> 52:05.240
Like not to go there repeatedly, but like I was like Kanye had like so many

52:05.240 --> 52:13.240
Like hits under his belt. Yeah before he he was like famous for being crazy for for basically just saying

52:13.760 --> 52:20.080
In most of the context that it was happening in unless you can I guess like him storming the stage at the

52:20.600 --> 52:23.480
VMAs, but the VMAs are fucking fake awards

52:23.520 --> 52:27.200
Like like there's not even you're not even really getting an award for anything

52:27.200 --> 52:30.880
So to come up on stage. Isn't that where he did the Taylor Swift thing? You get a moon, man

52:30.880 --> 52:35.400
But but other than that it was just like that's MTV. He's like he's like I don't want these

52:35.920 --> 52:39.120
I don't want these floor tiles on the floor for my thing

52:39.120 --> 52:45.320
You know like like being a perfectionist and I was always like kind of in his corner because the first place people go is oh

52:45.320 --> 52:53.240
You're crazy. You're manic depressive. You're you know, they diagnose you and but who cares like like it's a capitalist society

52:53.400 --> 52:54.640
so

52:54.640 --> 52:59.800
Like I got the cure to my schizophrenia right here. It's called. I'm a billionaire

52:59.800 --> 53:05.120
Yeah, but and I do think that we we don't we like like Frank

53:05.120 --> 53:12.560
I don't know this is white guilt talking, but I feel like we we unevenly apply that rule to black men like we we let them

53:13.400 --> 53:20.680
Go crazy from getting rich and then we we really break out the medical clipboards like in a way that we don't with like

53:20.840 --> 53:22.960
Yeah, white guys that get rich and go crazy

53:22.960 --> 53:29.840
I think we love all all dismantling of celebrity, but it is this one's interesting because um

53:30.280 --> 53:34.160
There is that feeling of like yes, we kind of all knew that he was crazy

53:34.160 --> 53:39.680
I don't know why this is different. You describe it that stuff the difference that I'm hearing is that it sounds sad

53:39.920 --> 53:47.400
like the slavery thing and the you know, it's like that that that explains a lot because I came into all

53:47.400 --> 53:51.400
I saw was him tweeting pictures of his is like, you know, does this look like the sunken place?

53:51.400 --> 53:56.920
And I was I was like that's a little sad, but it's it's it's also like it wasn't so sad that I wasn't like

53:57.760 --> 54:03.720
Laughing at it because it was like, yeah, yeah, of course it does it does look like a corridor of the Sunken place

54:06.200 --> 54:10.360
You should be proud of because I mean like like you bought it

54:10.360 --> 54:15.800
You like like you bought the sunken place that's like you weren't in prison there by Catherine Keener like so so good for you

54:15.800 --> 54:17.200
but but like

54:17.200 --> 54:24.120
Anyways, but I didn't know that that was the backstory. I didn't hear about that TRL or whatever thing like he took over TMZ

54:24.120 --> 54:25.880
Which you know, he classically hates TMZ

54:25.880 --> 54:29.320
He likes to strike out at them punches their photographers breaks their cameras

54:29.320 --> 54:35.280
But he went to TMZ and at some point was addressing the entire room instead of just being interviewed

54:35.360 --> 54:42.960
So he stood up and sort of gave in held court and then later on they sort of had boob like footage of him doing the same thing and getting to

54:43.240 --> 54:46.760
What do you mean? He took over would you mean like he went into their offices?

54:46.760 --> 54:51.360
They will let you usually they'll have a celebrity sit down between two people Harvey and

54:52.000 --> 54:58.680
Dredd dude and they'll talk right so he was supposed to be facing forward talking to those twos on the either side of them

54:58.680 --> 55:04.600
And he at one point gets up and turns around and tells this story about why he got liposuction how he got addicted to opiates

55:04.640 --> 55:06.320
Do you see any of that shit?

55:06.320 --> 55:11.200
So he stands up and he's like I had to go get liposuction because I don't want you guys to call me fat like you did Rob Kardashian

55:11.200 --> 55:15.000
And I was trying to go to the Grammys and I was in the red carpet and you guys call me fat

55:15.000 --> 55:18.480
So then they gave me opiates, and I was taking a bunch of day

55:18.480 --> 55:23.880
And then when I went to the hospital because I took too many they gave me seven and released me is where he started

55:23.920 --> 55:30.840
So like he's having a moment right? Yeah, that is but we did spit. I just noticed that people sort of suspended their

55:31.880 --> 55:36.880
Judgment yeah, they were like they're like well. This is serious. He's like it's like Gary Busey, you know like well

55:36.960 --> 55:38.960
Like like where you go?

55:39.680 --> 55:43.120
We kind of felt that way about Charlie Sheen, but we were just like let him go

55:43.120 --> 55:51.080
You know like like but yeah, also there's this thing. There's this crazy thing with Sheen Charlie Sheen people were like fuck yeah

55:51.600 --> 55:56.600
Right it was like it was a Trump effect where they were sort of like this is a rallying cry for guys

55:56.600 --> 56:02.440
Who've wanted to live this way for a long time in cells basically which is also a crazy new thing

56:02.440 --> 56:07.640
Because he also well I want to examine this like what we experienced when we hear what we picture Kanye

56:07.640 --> 56:13.640
Saying this stuff because it's part of it is it's vulnerable. He's saying

56:14.360 --> 56:16.360
He's like clearly

56:16.480 --> 56:18.480
It's like there's a difference between a guy

56:19.200 --> 56:21.200
going alpha and like

56:22.200 --> 56:25.760
Being there's a difference between he's clearly out of his mind and

56:26.640 --> 56:28.640
He's clearly out of his mind

56:29.280 --> 56:34.960
Like oh he had how come he didn't know that saying that saying I could lift a thousand pounds

56:34.960 --> 56:40.080
Would make him seem weak, but then someone saying like yeah

56:40.080 --> 56:41.400
I've been really weak lately

56:41.400 --> 56:47.280
Yeah, in a way that is then you then you immediately go well then I'm on your side if you're being

56:47.880 --> 56:51.000
Truthful, and I don't want you to get hurt. So get off of the TV

56:51.160 --> 56:56.440
There's also this rap braggado show that makes it difficult to figure out when somebody's being crazy

56:56.440 --> 57:02.880
You just never want a rapper to I mean in air quotes. You never want a rapper to I think this is amazing

57:02.880 --> 57:06.680
But like it's just not the part of the word lipo section

57:07.120 --> 57:10.480
That's probably been that's probably the first time that's really been introduced

57:13.200 --> 57:15.200
I got a chemical pill

57:16.320 --> 57:20.400
I'm over here trying to get this light bow for my life. Oh

57:21.440 --> 57:23.880
It's an interesting it's an interesting thing to watch

57:25.840 --> 57:32.800
Because people are taking there's this very fine line where you say are we shitting on this dude because we shit on people

57:32.800 --> 57:38.480
At this point are we getting out a little bit of racism in that we've never really had the backs of black dudes

57:38.480 --> 57:44.360
So now that one's going crazy who happens to be rich and has been very vocal about how we fucked the system to get rich

57:45.040 --> 57:52.320
Are we are we doing this thing? I used to watch Jerry Springer and all these talk shows where there'd be a black mother on stage

57:52.440 --> 57:54.800
She'd be being shit on by a white audience

57:55.360 --> 58:01.440
For being a bad mother and yet there was a section of it where you were like now what wait a minute, right like what?

58:01.440 --> 58:07.320
Some of you all are just being straight up awful about this shit, right and some of that is what I've seen

58:07.320 --> 58:10.920
I've seen some people who are taking a pot shot at a black millionaire

58:10.920 --> 58:16.440
I've seen some people who have no no respect for the fact that we're watching somebody with a

58:16.880 --> 58:20.720
Mental illness. Yeah, like it's a crazy crazy thing to watch

58:21.320 --> 58:23.520
Are you fucking with this incel shit at all?

58:24.600 --> 58:27.840
Yeah, man, I'm gonna do my third session next week

58:27.840 --> 58:34.560
I mean, I we knew we we kind of hate to claim this but we sort of

58:35.000 --> 58:41.080
We started we sort of discovered the incel movement on this stage because Cody Cody Cody found it

58:41.080 --> 58:48.080
Well going down a rabbit hole and she was remember that that the Gaspacho blog guy. He was he was incel

58:48.600 --> 58:54.280
He was the guy but I don't know the origin Cody Cody found a blog by this guy that

58:54.280 --> 58:57.360
Among other things he had this blog entry where he

58:58.400 --> 59:00.960
He was behind two women in a restaurant

59:01.520 --> 59:04.640
And and he overheard them saying one of them said

59:05.080 --> 59:11.280
Oh good, they have Gaspacho and the other one said what's Gaspacho and the other one said it's like cold tomato soup or something

59:11.280 --> 59:17.280
And the other one said that's gross and then and he said and that's the moment when I knew I was gonna try Gaspacho

59:18.280 --> 59:23.560
And then he tries it and he's like and I loved it and that's the thing and it was like it's just amazing

59:23.560 --> 59:31.000
That's that's the in cell thing. It was like he was like so are these gamer gate dudes? Yeah, same batch it all okay

59:31.000 --> 59:37.160
So crazy because they I don't think you're backed up enough what what I kind of know what you're talking

59:37.480 --> 59:40.320
In cell community means a voluntary cell

59:40.320 --> 59:47.480
But it's a men's right activists and people who who hate women and and have radical beliefs that are predicated on the fact

59:47.480 --> 59:51.280
That they're not getting late, so it all dates back to I mean all

59:51.280 --> 59:58.480
All internet culture comes back to like something awful and this like in video game cultural circles and

59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.360
4chan and it kind of spawned a bunch of stuff, but it's just like racism and white supremacy was always kind of just

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.800
under the surface of that so I mean

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.200
4chan kind of popped up a bunch of times they made operations against

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.200
Scientology and stuff, but they weren't really overtly races for a long time

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:23.320
But racist factions of them started gaining more steam and then when the gamer gate thing blew up that kind of coincided with

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.440
The pickup artists movement and the men's rights activists movement, which is also

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.800
You know centered in male bodybuilding culture and all this online culture and so that kind of

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:38.920
Coalesced with this online gaming culture movement and Gamergate and they just from there

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.920
It's basically everyone on that spectrum is just a different shade of some form of Nazi

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.840
It usually comes out of misogyny, but it ends up like expressing itself as some form of Nazism

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.560
But it's it's generally under Gamergate

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:59.280
But then people like Gaspacho man is probably like he felt empowered because he had some Gamergate related blog where he was like

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.800
Here's this girl playing a video game on Twitch and so isn't this the problem with video games?

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:09.600
And so like it's all this like misogyny stuff that comes out of this this like 4chan culture

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.200
But it shows up in all these avenues, but there was in cells during Gamergate and before Gamergate

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.960
And they were just made fun of the same way, you know, like losers were made fun of that's also part of it is like in the

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.200
Culture you're making fun of people for being losers

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.160
And you're also doing that to like hide the fact that you're an anonymous loser as well

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.600
And so they're kind of self-hating about it

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.920
But in cell has like been around forever, but they've just been you could attach a decade to the birth of it

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:43.440
What would you say like 2011 maybe later? It's only it's new yeah reasonable all this shit goes back

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.960
There's a really interesting article about the two thousand okay five

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:53.880
I mean if you really want to like oral history trace the roots from that that end up blooming into things like Gamergate and all that stuff like the

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.800
the kind of inextricably braided

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.440
flower stem of

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.600
You know

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.000
Men's men male male rage for lack of I'm trying to think of the classiest phrase so the

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.160
like like male male fucking

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.880
alpha energy

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.280
Being bound to video game and internet and hacking culture

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:25.200
Like I can't remember what a publication did a really a pretty pretty in-depth like backward look at the whole thing

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.160
What was the guy called? It was like angry uncle though. What was that?

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.680
There was like a there was like a zine at one point. I was I mean as you would imagine with any of this stuff

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.440
There's like a culture that you can trace back that all starts somewhere

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.240
But it's not as if that means that there was a Ben Franklin that started it

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:47.000
But it's always it's always been in all those cultures. That's things something awful always had racism 4chan always had racist memes and stuff

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.160
And it just like it was just circulating and do you think it coincides with science?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.960
It seems as if these dudes are not that these dudes are

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.960
Intelligent and that's a section of the left because I don't even know if they're left

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.440
They feel like they feel like they have distance themselves from any sort of political party as well. Yeah, I think the yeah, but is the bond

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.360
Science I think it's anger

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.280
I think it's it's nerds that grew up watching cartoons that were like you bump into someone and they dropped their papers

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.840
And then three days later you're having sex with them

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.880
And you're a loser because you failed to do that and they're like I did everything right

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.680
I'm bumping into all these women holding papers and they're like well. No, you're a fucking idiot if you believe that

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.200
But they are fucking idiots who do believe that because we are sending that signal, but it's like I think they're all these people that for so long

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.080
They're like I'm a nice guy. Why don't people date me?

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.360
And it's like because you say things like that and but we don't actually sit to explain it to them

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.400
But it's like so there's all these people that for so long think they're doing it right

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:51.680
But it's like no you're a jerk and you're a racist and you're a misogynist and no one's explained to you subtly

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.200
what that means because you probably don't have a support network because you know then that's how people get radicalized is because

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:05.200
You don't have a support network and other people are like actually it's because it's sort of it's it's it's sort of like it's this syndrome where it's like

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:12.640
It's a first world empire and people get comfortable and then there's this shift if you if you if you stop if you do start doing anything

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.520
Other than constantly ascending as an empire

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.760
I think what happens what we're observing is that if things level off and then start to get to a point where oh

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:29.400
This is the third time I heard Time magazine mentioned that whites will be a minority by the year whatever and that oh

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.520
College isn't working like doesn't matter for job placement

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.880
And they say the dream starts to fall apart a dream that if you're 16 years old

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.240
You never knew you were buying into but you subconsciously were so then you turn 16

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:50.440
And it's like that that that judge Reinhold monologue in fast times where they go the party's over and he's like he does his monologue

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.840
And goes like I'm waiting for the fucking party to start. It's like you like these

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.360
you can you can be a you could be a white kid and

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.600
Be familiar with these phrases and these concepts that have something to do with

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.000
Progress and the world is getting softer or or

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:15.280
Progressive or what's your own or it's crumbling and and it's melting and then you like you you just you you just get this

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.840
High out of going yeah, but everything's bullshit

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.960
That's why movies like the Matrix or and Fight Club and and Star Wars and whatever

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.520
There's all the stories are about you fucking waking up and realizing that everything's bullshit

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.840
You you got a you got to figure this shit out

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.280
And that's how you become a hero everyone wants to be a hero

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.200
And so you're it's one thing to be like in a cradle being fed titty milk from a lamb

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.480
That's whose feet never touched the ground and you can complain about it

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480
I remember you and I talked about that we were like

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.560
Generation Xers like go like all we knew is that we hated Pepsi that was it was that easy to be a rebel

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.560
It was just like fuck Pepsi

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:59.400
And and then it's like all right, but yeah now I think it gets to a point because I guess somewhere in our heads

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.960
Maybe we were like yeah fuck Pepsi, but then then I'll have a Pepsi later like I mean and by that

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.960
I mean I'll have a billion-dollar corporation later

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:14.960
Like like I'll like like yeah fuck this shit because we watch the big chill and we watch the breakfast club and we go

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.480
Oh, I get it. I understand how society works

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:24.640
It goes up a staircase especially if you're a white dude like you you you can complain and be hip the whole way

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.800
I think that's where this concept of virtue signaling comes in is that these guys think they're calling out

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.320
Which is like the only reason you would ever

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.640
Say that shit was bad

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:41.920
Well, you're walking up this stairway to heaven is if you were trying to impress people on the way up if you're gonna like here

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920
I go to heaven it's lame

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:50.320
Which is the equivalent that's that's what they I think that's what they mean by virtue signaling is that you're going like

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.880
Like I'm part of the liberal hive mind that guarantees that

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.520
I'll always have dirty money coming in from

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.720
Podesta's pedophile ring and drone strikes and

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.880
But I'm also gonna make everyone like me and have have

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:15.600
Sex with all the women because I'm lying to them about how I thought Oprah's speech at the Oscars was just fine

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.760
The opposite of a dog whistle

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.280
Yes, the opposite of a dog. So are these cats gonna

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.720
Do you think they will link up and

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.920
Militarize do you think they're gonna hook up with the Trump supporters? Yeah, I think they think they're better

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.400
I think they think they're better than the Trump people

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.400
Yeah, Trump fans. I think they're on a different level where they are more aligned with

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.440
Say an evil Bill Gates versus a Donald Trump, but a billionaire nonetheless

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:49.080
But you stop being one of these guys the minute you you admit that you want anything

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960
so that

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.240
That that simultaneously is good news and terrible news because that's a lot like

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.280
Any terrorists sell? Yeah, because you basically like the first guy to say

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.160
Jesus these ISIS meetings are so great. I almost don't want to blow anything up anymore

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:15.080
You're out of Isis like like you you you got to just be mad and show up like like and like

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.800
Fucking great point defeats the purpose if you if showing up makes you

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.320
Express the actual feelings of contentment that you were seeking in the first place

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.720
That's a crazy if I can for just a second

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.000
That's a crazy point because the truth is we know that people lash out because they're lonely

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.720
But when they get together and they have a drive to explode things that yes

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.760
They have to get to that final episode. That's what I think fascism is like it's catalyzed by by like

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.200
Privilege people that exploit that phenomenon like there's a certain amount of lower-class discontent

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.760
That will recycle itself like a compost bin because poor people will just get sad

01:08:53.240 --> 01:09:01.760
Because they're poor and then their porous will make them like invent new music and and and and be more religious and and be

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.480
Just generally happier and make rich people go like Jesus these poor people are fucking ecstatic

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.480
I like I should lighten up a little bit. Maybe give something to charity or whatever this like like that system

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.160
Yeah, that system breaks down when

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:27.120
When when shit gets bad enough for long enough that somebody out there usually a 70 year old mummy or like several million of them

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:33.800
Like they go oh the poor people are doing that thing where they're bummed out about being poor again

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.320
I think I'll fucking poor instead of instead of building a wall between me and them and letting them be poor and listening to their wonderful music

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:47.520
I think I'll I think I'll start exploiting their their sadness and their anger because if I go like this

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.360
They start going like that. Yeah, and then like either money comes in or there's like an agenda like I want that

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.480
I want that regime taken down and then it's like

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:06.960
It's an orchestra conducted by fucking dangerously stupid selfish sociopaths who are just like I think I think I think this guy over here

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.280
It says that poor people shouldn't be as angry. What do you guys think and they're like?

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.320
And and and and this guy is it has the IQ of a fucking handball or he wouldn't have been born rich

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.960
And so then that's the days that we're in I feel like

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.000
Like like I dread that we're in a right-wing slide into a genuine fascist regime

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.480
not and I also feel like a lot of us are reacting to it by

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.920
by going oh, but

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:45.280
Oprah will get elected next and that'll be even worse and like I don't even want to argue about that in your wildest dreams

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.360
Like I'm not if I really thought that was gonna happen. I wouldn't be so fucking

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.520
terrified right now because I also we keep trying to hire someone to clean up the mess when in reality

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.880
It's probably we were going like this when we were stable. This was every eight years

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:07.840
Do we just change our minds as a country about whether or not we should have but it's just fucking like 60 years of fucking steady

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.400
This is called stability and then moving in either direction

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.360
Like all at once is called us, you know a movement

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.000
Are we able to fight these dudes or will they burn themselves out or what is the for it?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.120
What do you what is the forecast for these dudes and do you know any?

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.320
I don't know like it's just all these people are like they're so far gone. They just got to be told like

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.760
You know, this isn't this isn't gonna do what you want, but they don't want to hear that like so

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760
I think most of them will just

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:46.720
You know not go anywhere the same way most, you know racist people just yell at people at most and don't end up killing people

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:53.200
But still it generates and bubbles up killers, you know, like this ain't like I think it'll still continue to be dangerous

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.040
But I don't think it'll be more or less dangerous than it ever has been like or not ever

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.960
I mean, obviously we've crossed the point and it's gotten much dangerous more dangerous recently

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.600
But beyond that, I don't think there's anything my most optimistic hope

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.560
Is that and this is like still a nightmare the optimistic version of the future

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.000
Which is why I can't wait to retire because it's just no no no world for me anymore is that

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040
Is that this is gonna get bad enough

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:26.320
But the the people are still gonna have enough of a toehold and there's enough of a blue wave

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.720
Whatever however you want to characterize the the pendulum going back the other way

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.240
But that the pendulum will have no choice but to go

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.800
We no longer have a sense of humor about this this this this and that and it's gonna make it even worse

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.560
It's it's it's good. It's like it's like if you graph it

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:51.200
It's just moving towards a super volcano explosion because we're not gonna we're not gonna learn from this fucking experience

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.240
If we learn anything to lighten up and take people less seriously. Yeah, we're gonna

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:02.000
We're gonna be like I don't I don't give a fuck what you have to say about due process or

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.280
Uh, uh, how you have a story too

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:12.800
You said this word and this word is connected to this word and that school of thought and you're fucking toast forever

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.920
Wrong tweet at the wrong time mother fucker done

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.960
And like like like that society will progress along those lines because we won't have a sense of humor about

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.280
Like why would we why would we they're fucking nazis?

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.720
I feel like we got tricked into respecting people's opinions

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:37.440
I feel like the idea of oh respect everyone's opinions like wait why why wait why why would we do that?

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:44.240
We're just gonna respect everyone's opinions our opinions like assholes and everyone has one and they all stink

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.560
That's what we respect is that everybody has this smelly bullshit

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.160
No, opinions are terrible and they need to be terribly well defended before we should

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560
Accept them as anything

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.080
Anything that sucks though is it's not just opinions you're you're thinking of all of society being people in toga's talking about

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.800
How the world should run in between these ionic columns

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.880
Like what about fantasy? What about the fact that vice just ran their second article?

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.880
um within a month about how uh, some rick and morty fans, uh, uh, have too much

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.800
Incessed on their minds or those are people who have their opinions overly respected

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:28.240
Uh, the the the the vice magazine or the yeah the vice magazine writers who got away with that

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.400
Are you?

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.840
Okay, it's not that much of a stretch because we all know that fucking pornhub is nothing but incest

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:44.080
I just feel like I just feel like we're insane along with like as we go as we gild up for fighting nazis

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.160
We we also are like

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.000
We are um, we're not learning the lesson here

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.480
And I'm not saying it's an easy lesson to learn

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.040
I don't I'm not

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.880
Lecturing anybody or saying that I have the solution or that I'm not exactly along with everybody that's doing everything

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:08.960
But like let them finish we're becoming intolerant like as we fight intolerance. We it is a steady slide because

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.600
like

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.520
like

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.160
Like I'm ready to retire because like I I read that vice magazine article

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.320
it was like they dug up quotes from me about kink shaming and

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.520
incest porn or whatever and they were like here's what Dan Harmon had to say and it was kind of like the

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.360
article was a little bit it was responsibly written like I didn't feel like the person was trying to

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.600
Come at it was trying to take me down. Yeah, because I feel like if they could have they I mean if they wanted to they

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.120
They they easily could have they included like

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.680
giant passages of me talking so that I was clear and contextual and they

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.240
It it felt like a responsibly written thing

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.600
But at the same time I couldn't help but feel like the kid that wrote the article

01:15:52.160 --> 01:16:01.440
Is born of a new world where he he was basically only able to entertain the idea of freedom of fantasy and taboo online as

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.160
As in the same category as the least likable taboos themselves where the hippest thing you could do is go

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:14.080
Well, some people believe that instead of what it was 15 years ago, which is the hippest thing you could do would be to go

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:14.960
So

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.960
Some people are turned on by that

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.480
and and and and it's just increasingly becoming like

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.560
it's like because

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560
like like that we're gonna

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.320
We we we we we can read each other's minds now and everything that we say and so now we're just like

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:39.120
It's not resulting in us loving each other anymore. It's resulting in us like like getting off on

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.760
on

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.520
learning what a

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.840
Perfect person is by virtue of pointing out every

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400
Everything that everyone else is doing like we're not

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:58.240
Looking within and we're not like admitting anything to ourselves. We're not like we're not we're not we're not relaxing anymore

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.560
like the thing that would fucking

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.360
That you want to be able to weaponize and point at this right wing movement like a fucking cannon is

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:15.360
Is is levity is is is awareness and a high IQ and humor because they are in a full state of panic

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.560
Yeah, I mean because that's the thing that yeah those guys like you can you think they control us

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.640
I mean you wouldn't believe

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.080
How much we control them if we were like fucking

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.920
Actually cool with each other and ourselves if you if you

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:40.160
If you it takes not being fucking triggered by words frankly you cannot fucking stand as I've said a thousand times at a protest against nazis

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.600
and here's someone

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.880
Uh say something mean to his wife at the fucking nazi protest and be like

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.040
You know like like hey stop the stop protesting the nazis

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.040
This guy is like being really mean to this this lady and and then someone else shims in and goes

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.480
Did you just call him a he because that's my friend and he's a trans

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.960
Uh a gender that and every like we're

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760
Trying to prove that we're like

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.280
Fighting for good by fighting each other and there's a there's nazis over there

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.400
I just want to like it's 9 11

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.840
It's just like wait what what was

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.840
Oh, what if we start a fire it's like a reenactment of every night right now

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280
Don't break the bulb

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.080
Don't break

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.640
Shob please you two cents

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.680
I'm too sensitive. You're too sense. Please Rob. You're too sense. You're too sense. You're too sense

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.800
Because you care about things. I do care about things

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:49.360
I I heard you talk about the meats and the vegetarianism. Do you have an incel version of that?

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.960
Do you guys have people that you fight against like we fight against

01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:00.640
For race or sexism in the in the vegetarian world are there targets the thing that I was surprised at when I

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.960
I'm so sorry. We're out of time

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.560
Uh, that's so good. I didn't have a punchline anyway

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.720
No, no, no the the the the thing that I was the most surprised of when I went vegan publicly

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.120
Was the amount of hate that I got which I was like what why would you

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.040
The minute I would say something was that all sides

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:32.800
Yeah, pretty much. You know, I got I mean, I don't know what democrat liberal gay. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.520
For sure. Sure. Mostly dudes. Okay, mostly dudes like if I said something like I

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.320
Why is hunting still a thing and uh, well, you know, I'm anti zoo

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.920
You know, I'm anti puppy farm and that kind of stuff and um, you know, I I I say, you know, like

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.880
To consider an option instead of having bacon on your ice cream

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:59.440
Uh, and and and there's just lots and lots of hate. Don't tell me what to do and I don't like being

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.120
You know, just like just like they felt like they were being attacked

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.760
Because I said this is this is important to me. I used to

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.160
Not think this way. I had a click inside my head that

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.480
Made me understand like what I was eating had a history to it that wasn't just like

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.240
Just showed up. Yeah, there was there was suffering behind it

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.680
And I didn't want to be responsible for that and I and and I got a lot of

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.120
Anger towards me just wanting me to shut up. Do you notice that when people stand up for rights?

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.720
There is this I didn't notice this in the past maybe because I wasn't there

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.480
But there is this thing people immediately think about what they're gonna have to do without

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.720
Yeah, exactly. I mean when I say something that

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:50.560
Hits too close to home like yeah, you know, you put bacon on your ice cream. Did something have to live in pain and fear and die

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.120
horribly for you to have that little bit of

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.400
On your ice cream. How was it worth?

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.640
Don't we also though

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:03.200
Isn't that just shaming someone though? Wouldn't someone then feel attacked?

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.400
What would are you had to kill something to eat dessert like that is

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.160
Is attacking someone well, tell me how to not shame somebody

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200
I mean to consider

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.760
To consider like where

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.960
Where it came from. I mean that is the trick the trick really

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.160
What is the trick? You know, I mean I I haven't done it right because I get people angry

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:30.000
And I don't want to shame anybody because that's the quickest way to have somebody

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.720
Shut you down or yell at you or turn you off or ignore you or whatever

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.000
I just I used to think one way and then I was when I realized

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.320
what I was

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320
doing and becoming a part of I

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.440
It just it was a it was a big turn for me. So I

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.720
Was it imagery or did you see processing?

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.880
It was a friend of mine died and I started looking at life and death

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.520
differently and

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920
I got my dog

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.960
Who I adore and I remember like I I started

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600
posting puppy pictures

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.680
Ironically on Twitter

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:18.960
But then I started admitting I actually really like this and then I started putting all kinds of animals on there

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.960
and then somebody said

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.040
you're obviously vegetarian

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120
you love animals and

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:31.040
And somebody says he's not vegetarian. He still eats me Rob. Why don't you know calling me out on it?

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.040
And I was like, well

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.240
Yeah

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.960
I say I love animals. Why am I being a part of this and it just made me do a lot of research and

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:46.080
and and then something just clicked inside of me and then I just I could not be a part of it anymore and

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.560
It's just something that I I feel if

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.960
Because I've had this experience when I you know wrote about it or posted something about it

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:00.400
There there's like a bunch of people that have written me and said, you know

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.600
I never thought of it that way until I started seeing your post

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.040
I started reconsidering a lot of stuff and I

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.320
I'm now vegetarian or I'm now vegan or or whatever and I'm thinking differently and I felt like I accomplished something

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.600
So that I guess that's the right way to do it, but I don't want to shame

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:25.120
Anybody, I mean, I don't want anybody to be feel bad. I mean like I used to eat meat for

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:29.440
45 years my parents still eat me, you know Kate still eats fish

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.520
I

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.760
Shaming anybody is is not going to do anything. No one's gonna stop

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.200
I wonder if there's a part of us that has a response to discipline because what I heard you say was that you

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:47.760
Took an idea on and then put it right to use immediately. Well, we have a response to change. Yeah, like

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.360
like

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:57.600
Willy-nilly change so we the same amount of energy that you feel going into a force field when because I want to get

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:03.920
A little bit underneath this because yeah, we could talk about the social dynamics of like catching more flies with honey and like

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.560
Oh, the way you should do it is to prepare a nice

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.120
Pasta dish on instagram and tell people how happy you are while you're eating and lead by example

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.800
but

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.120
Get underneath that because then the Malcolm X of veganism would say fuck that

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.520
I'm not going to play nice just because of blah blah blah

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.720
I I think way down underneath it is basically we don't like people

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.920
when the other people when they're

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.080
Activated and it's not because we want them to fail. It's because we

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.320
We're all like these sperm cells like headed for what we perceive is the same egg. Maybe or we

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.960
Uh, we just or maybe it's just more simple than that like a primate

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.600
Survival jealousy needs to keep what happened yesterday going today

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.680
That's part of your job as a primate and the other half of your job is to want to be a hero

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:56.960
so

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.440
so if someone's popping off next to you about how

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.880
Anything should be different

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.760
You're hearing it's not that you have ill will for that person

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.240
It's just that it's like well first of all you're fucking with half my job

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.440
Which is to make sure yesterday happens again today

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:14.960
um

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.760
A thousand examples of that make you a hero by the way like being a good person

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.960
You know the

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.440
You know the certain traditions that actually are that we praise people for honoring

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.560
And like knowing the alphabet and stuff like that

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.600
But then you're also fucking with the other half of my job because to the extent that I wanted to like bring

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160
Change I wanted to bring it to other people

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.800
I don't want to fucking be told that it's time to change it that makes me feel like

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.200
It it feels like sin to us, which I kind of admire about our species

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.240
How do you how do you do what I want to do?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.880
Which is not

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:59.200
Make anybody feel bad. I just want somebody to I just my very boring answer is the is that you don't have

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.280
You shouldn't do anything differently

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.800
The only thing for for your own personal satisfaction

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.960
Uh would be to not take it personally the way the reaction that it causes because before I would tell you

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.120
I would have to be your vegan

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.960
If evangelical coach to come up to a level where I was like

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:23.520
You know the best way to do it to keep people from throwing tomatoes at you is to blah blah blah, and it would that would really be about

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:30.160
I'm I'm fine with the tomatoes. I'm I'm more concerned about like Spencer who who felt like I was

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.400
Just shaming somebody because of the ice cream bacon analogy. I mean like I I don't want

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.560
Spencer's just just pointing out that an activist by definition is always gonna. It's always gonna cause shame

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.960
I don't know. That's necessarily true. Well, I think that it's hard to argue for not eating animals

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.960
If your argument is because it hurts animals because that's telling you someone that they're not being compassionate enough

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.640
I think there's other reasons that you can argue for it that don't involve that and I'm not saying you have to

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.960
I'm just saying that like like there are more than one ways to advocate that aren't inherently attacking someone

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.320
But a very common one is a way that assumes everyone thinks the same way as you do

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.760
And that way you say something that then could unintentionally attack someone who doesn't assume the same things as you are

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.720
My sister who is amazing activists, right? What she always likes to do is trade

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:29.280
So what you're if you're trying to get something out about why someone should be a vegan you're supposed to say

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.560
Your high blood pressure will no longer be an issue. It's to give them the power of choice

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880
Instead of saying because I get that

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.760
Yeah, look people see through that shit immediately. Yeah, if you do that with race they get even angrier because they're like

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.960
Well, I don't want to dole out concessions. My my feeling about that is that's one tactic is like, okay. Well

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.960
I'm saying

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.440
it would be

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.000
If we were all empathetic if we were empathetic to all life, maybe we would be

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360
empathetic to each other

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.400
That's true

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.160
And I and I think you know if we're going well, I stopped eating meat

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.040
I don't care that the animal is

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.080
Goes through whatever but I stopped doing it because I'm thinner now

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:24.000
It seems like not a very noble noble. Here's how my therapist defines trust

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.040
Says does the pert do you believe that the person has your best interests at heart?

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.680
It doesn't even have to mean that they're like they would take a bullet for you or anything

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.600
It's like do you do you think that they have your best interests at heart?

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.360
Which like okay, so I don't trust those guys that are have a six pack on the back of my car

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.880
Like as I come out of the 7-Eleven parking lot like I don't trust them. Like I I have a few

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.800
They're behaving in a way that makes me think that they don't have my best interests at heart

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:59.440
So they can say everything they want about about why I don't trust them, but they're strangers and I don't believe it yet

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.160
I want to know like why why can't I

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.440
Say you shouldn't eat meat because animals feel pain and fear death

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.920
I don't see because the person doesn't trust that you have their best interest at heart because

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:15.920
What he's saying is that the inherent implication is that they don't have compassion

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.240
So they're saying if I let this person into the parking lot of my 7-Eleven's life

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.640
Like I could get mugged. I could end up exposing myself like if if I say, okay, I'm interested in being

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.920
Um more open-minded about this topic

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:39.920
Are you gonna enter the lobby of my life and then just start moving fucking plants around because you might be a shitty decorator

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.200
You could be the rightest person in the world about how my lobby needs to be unlocked

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:51.440
But you may suck at decorating lobbies or you may be the best fucking lobby decorator for somewhat

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.800
They're a completely different building and like in any case like like I have to stay me

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:04.720
And and grow I can't just like fucking let you in like a fucking virus and reprogram my nucleus

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.840
Or I'm a bad person that could end up hurting other people

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:16.720
So so I need to trust you and and and like so when it's and then we have these like social cues that we can use to

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:22.080
Let people know that they can trust us. It's it's a that's I think to me

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.960
That's job number one in all interaction is

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680
like try to let the person know

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.800
That as far as you're concerned like you you you don't

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840
You're not out to hurt them

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.080
But it's hard because if you just say that that's what a serial killer says like Ted Bundy war

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:45.120
I don't know. I get I get a lot of like every I get a lot of like you think you're you're better than me

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.400
Because you are like that. I was like no no

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.320
No, because well, that's why I said that is because you were you were bringing up that people give you a lot of pushback

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.600
And so if people are giving a lot of pushback, I you know, I experience it myself

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.760
I'm sure I've tweeted stuff back at you and that's what I was experiencing in those

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:09.600
Circumstances where it's like, yeah, this is what you're doing. You're throwing a lamb into a wood chipper

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.680
It's like, well, no, I'm hiring someone to do that for me. It's not the same

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.360
But you know, it's so that's me pushing back at an argument right you made and so that's fine

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:25.120
If you want pushback, but you were saying that it's bad that that happens to you and so that's I was saying I was surprised

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.280
right, yeah that that

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.880
which I

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.920
I mean, I was like wow. I didn't realize that this

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.200
was

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.920
It was not just me saying you should stop doing this. It was just me saying

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:44.160
I'm vegan it would be like just being at a restaurant with a bunch of people and then I'm saying I'm vegan

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.360
And then I would pull up my wallet and they go, but you got a little other wallet

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.680
They everybody jumps on that and I mean like actually it's not leather

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.040
It's

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.880
Pleather it's it's not I I made sure to get it like

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.160
Because I don't want to be a hypocrite. That's what we know about

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:06.640
Is that's why I stopped with dairy because it's if I'm going to go vegetarian and I do a little bit of research

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.160
You should really go vegan all the way

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.880
But it was the hardest thing about it. I'm sorry. The hard thing about it was

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:19.520
Which I think a lot of people go through it's like I don't think I can live without a hamburger

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600
I don't think I can live without cheese

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.240
that was the thing that that

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.960
I was like really I can't

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:31.520
That's not really a good excuse and then it took like maybe like three weeks for me to

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.040
Break out of that habit or whatever. I'm sorry. Go ahead. This is why I think it's related to discipline

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:42.960
Because your ability to take on a new idea and execute it has something to do with your discipline

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:48.400
When you bring it up to people, I think they immediately feel called out on their personal discipline

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:54.720
So it's a it's a difficult place to start. I also think I think like I said, I think people want to know

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.720
What is the benefit to even?

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.840
entertaining the ideas that you're giving me

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.160
So I think that is the game sometimes, you know, I am it's interesting

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.320
I'm on this the reason one of the reasons I'm fascinated by this is I'm on the facebook a lot

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:13.040
I'm in a facebook group that is los felices echo park silver lake. It's the neighborhood

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:19.120
group right about that and and people will get on and do exactly what we just did where somebody will say

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.280
I don't like when people ride their bikes on the sidewalk and you get pushback

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:29.840
And it's the most interesting. It's it's any any point of view almost, you know, any point we go like like when the

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.080
Like you see it all the time now with like the woman thing like when somebody goes like

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.760
So this is a profile of a woman who says when she was 13

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.320
Johnny Depp I'm making this up. Don't sue me. I like like I'm riffing one. Johnny Depp

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:54.400
I've picked her up as a hitchhiker and say a a fingered her and and then he made her be his personal assistant

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.080
He never thanked her and she got pregnant. He talked her into an abortion

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.520
And it's like it's like this whole like like the part of your brain that goes from that's hot goss

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.160
to like

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.000
I gotta police this

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
It it I think it's linked somehow

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.920
Like like and I started putting road flares on it where I'm like wait if this

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:23.200
Woman who's 40 saying when she was 13 Johnny Depp did this or whatever like if I don't police it

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360
If I don't pipe up and go

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.840
Give me a break. First of all, I believe you second of all like

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.120
Why are you hitchhiking if you didn't want that? You know, it's like

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.480
It's it's like we it's almost like

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.960
Yeah, we hate women

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.280
But also like there's a there could be a deeper problem here that's actually like just becomes racism sexism

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.680
closed-mindedness dog

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.120
dogmatism

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.080
If I can like just just general bad humanity

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:56.800
Yeah, that hasn't been tested at this many rpms because there's been no internet

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.160
There's a little conditioning going on

01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:05.200
We just like we need to like we need to medically evolve a little bit to get we the same way that we realized carbs and

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:11.680
Glutons or whatever we go through phases. We're capable as a society of going, you know, it's bad this thing that you've never heard of before

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.720
Yeah, we have this tendency when we receive

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:16.720
communication

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:24.400
We're we're running a little bit of an outdated force field protocol where it's still just as dangerous as ever to

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:32.400
Trust anything you hear, but there's a difference between not trusting things being a skeptic and being

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.240
um

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:37.520
A cop, you know, like like like yeah like lashing out

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.640
and reacting as if

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.880
If you say nothing and the person next to you says I deserve all the pants if you say nothing

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:53.920
Do your pants teleport off your body? Right? Right because the bad guys certainly are afraid of that and you know what?

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400
That's why they're bad guys because

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.960
They're right because when they're what they're afraid of is if everybody starts saying

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.480
I want the pants to be evenly distributed. They will lose some of their pants. They have a valid fear

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.560
That makes them the death star

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.560
We have an irrational fear of it when we when we're dealing on a human level

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.760
Like we we get like we just don't want to like we think that if we don't get mad when you get cut off in traffic

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.560
That everyone's going to start cutting you off in traffic and there's just no science to back that up

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.800
In fact, what's going to happen when you fly into a fucking right?

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.800
It's actually no you finished that idea because I think you're gonna cause more you're gonna get more of that

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.280
lose your general like

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.040
Fucking

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.680
Appreciation of good driving. Like, you know, like I feel myself getting worn down listening to true crime podcasts

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:51.920
Or I'm just like boy the bad guys really kind of just get away with it. Don't say if I have to hear one more detective

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.720
on his 68th birthday

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:57.680
um with with half of his face removed from some

01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.920
Uh, skin cancer procedure that he was barely able to pay for with his pension

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.400
explaining to me that because uh, some dude

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:14.320
Is about to get injected with chemicals tomorrow on his 90th birthday after raping and eating like 48 people for

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.240
70 years like I just and the justice has been served

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:24.640
Like you know that sooner or later that you they don't get away with it. I'm like he got away with it

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:29.680
They they get away with it the guy they just caught in california who was a cop who started killing people

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.080
Uh as a cop

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.600
As a cop he was a cop the internet is

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.000
And they found out about a way too late the internet is showing us

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.080
Something that we were able to we we had we evolved a certain amount every time we you know

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.040
You invent the campfire people come around you invent plumbing

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:54.960
You get exposed to more and more people there's varying levels of internetness to humanity each level

01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.880
We're like fuck so many new people so many new ideas. I'm gonna go fucking insane. This is crazy

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.640
I I my neighbor used to be a bear and now it's this fucking arab

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.760
I don't know what is happening to him like I gotta figure this out

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:13.840
Like we always then just barely like like it'll be a profit or it'll be some kind of movement

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.600
Or it'll be a horrible collapse and a rebuilding like we'll keep up with it

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.400
The basic leitmotif is we just keep learning and increasing resolutions that uh,

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.600
there's more bad than good in the world like like that we

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.720
We can see it more

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.240
Yeah, if you if you put if you if you if you invent a camera that can see everything in the universe

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.960
It's gonna pick up more bad than good

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600
Yeah, we're living in a real-time library

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:49.520
Well, we're very instead of it being something that we would have read about 10 years ago and been like that was fascinating

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.200
We're actually like holy shit. We know everything about that shooting

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.360
We know everything about that genocide. We were there. We have pictures of it

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.000
And we get to watch the survivors argue with the other survivors and the one the survivor

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.400
Then turns out to be a bigot later and

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.400
Meanwhile this basketball player that that nailed a free throw and he was a meme for 20 minutes

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.560
Now he turned out that dogfights in his basement and it's just like every big Bill Cosby's

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760
Like it's like the camera is everywhere. It's

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:24.320
And but we just we just we're seeing the surface of reality. We just gotta like

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.240
We gotta not

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.360
Let it give us a bad trip like like it's it's okay. This is overwhelming. This is what we look like

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.560
We're a squirming mass of flesh. There's a lot of like

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.480
sebum and

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:43.680
Wiry hairs and zits and nipples that have no reason and this is the naked body of humanity

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:50.560
And it's not a wonderland. It's it looks like the inharmon naked and and and and and and nipples without reason

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.800
Nipples without reason is a british band. I think that I think I was I was realizing this

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.400
I was watching some movie that had something to do with good versus flash garden

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:05.520
And uh, I was like, I think part of it might be because I I get really disillusioned when I think about like how

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520
Um, oh

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:14.480
Evil's more powerful than good like it's it out numbers it and all this stuff, but it's like that's actually only a reaction to

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.400
the

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:24.000
Uh false impression that anybody ever wanted me to think that good and evil were like this fucking rocky versus drago even matched

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.760
Like

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:32.960
Which is a fantasy if you if you thought about good as being about one fifth as powerful as evil in almost any context

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.360
Like one fifth the size one fifth the the advantage

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:43.360
Like like like because if it's good, it's good and it's not evenly matched with the amount of like

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.520
Like like my therapist says that like negative shit like

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.840
Affects your brain five times more than positive shit. Somebody says

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:59.520
Yeah, somebody says I like that shirt and it's like it just burns off like fucking flambé and a fancy restaurant

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.560
We evolved to you know have to survive danger. So it's like. Oh, is that a grizzly bear?

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.720
Probably not like you know, you can't say probably not you have to say

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.640
Oh god, that's definitely a rock that might one percent chance be of grizzly bear and then you know, you know

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:20.240
Yeah, we're not the we're not the progeny of of the chimps that that plate that we're like, you know

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.960
I hate to be a we need to give ourselves a break here

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.800
Hate to be a smurf, but we are also pre-wired to seek out joy

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.480
that's

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.920
We are wire to speak to seek out joy. We are but I'll tell you one thing we get a huge amount of joy from is

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:40.320
Being the first person to call it when there's something to be alarmed about like like we have a lot a lot of our joy

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.560
Is like tied into like alarmism?

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.000
We amplify negative outcomes like if you say hey

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.480
I'll flip you a coin and if I flip a coin you win two dollars

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.280
And if you lose the flip you give me 50 cents

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:59.200
It's like you could do that all day and then on average you will win a ton of money, but people will not see it that way

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.640
People will be like no I could lose some serious money. It's like people have a psychological tendency to think that risks are way worse

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.760
Like we definitely still do seek incentives and fine. Yeah, but to your point. I think I mean what you're saying is

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.480
but that

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.840
We're not going from giraffes don't have

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:27.520
a 50% good 50% bad perception like they they're just thinking about leaves and shit and they're

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080
They they're the worst like

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:38.160
We graduated to having a concept of good and bad and we're just we just keep finding out that

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.120
We perceive good a lot less

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.160
Like but we should still look at it as a gigantic leap from the hippopotamus which doesn't

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.400
Give a fuck who's good and who's bad and what's good and what's bad

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:58.160
Like the the hippo has no taste bud in its mouth for that and we have a thousand. We just have eight thousand more that taste bad

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.240
Sometimes we get addicted to the fine tuning of our existence

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.920
You know

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.920
Gotta change those couches

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:15.360
Is all dirty and we're an alarmist primate species that learn to adapt like a mild amount of pack

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:22.240
If we see a couch because we're really out hunted by by a biological killing machine couch hunters

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.400
What the biological killing machines?

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.280
What what

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:35.840
Tuned by man defined and hunt couches and murder does this get you less high as you smoke more or as you get more high

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.920
It gets you less high

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.360
That's the thing about we now less high than you have been you push through

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.840
So you can get so high that you're no longer really high. Yeah, that's what I like

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.880
And then I like to push through that into being that high again

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:55.600
And that's like 300 percent. I like how it hangs in the air. It's very fun. I don't know if the cameras picked that up

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.000
But it's cool. You know what you'd really like hanging in the air

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.800
Uh-oh blue apron. Oh shit

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:05.840
Tell us imagine if a box of food could hang in the air outside your door every day

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.720
Okay, I'm currently eating seshwan chops with fried pork nuts

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:14.560
seshwan chops pork nuts

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.080
Mmm

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.920
It's so sad watching your own brain die like like like like like like you just like the simple things

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.080
Or you just like can't riff can't riff food. Oh, come on. I can't riff no food

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.560
And then and then just all the like the celebrities names you just you just slowly forgetting them

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.960
That's like burning from the edges. Uh, like like a map in a fucking western like it's just like coming in like oh

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.040
Oh, how do I do when you when that happens to you? Do you sit there and try to

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.120
You don't you don't look it up right or ask anybody because you think that you can jump start your fucking dead synapse

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.120
That that were made you not remember jeff bridge's name and the garrick

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.560
Do you think there's bulletin jeff bridge's name lu garrick is lu garrick

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:01.680
Did you know that

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360
That brain she died

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.760
That's brain

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.280
She died

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.960
That's why that's why we have to acquire wisdom because that's all we can offer these new kids

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.000
We can't we're not going to be smarter and funnier than them. We're gonna we but only the only thing we can do is be like

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.280
Kid

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.440
Take it easy. Don't eat that berry

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:28.400
Or do and just don't freak out when you look like you have three hands. Yeah, you don't have three hands

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.240
Like calm down

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.520
You're you there's no way you have an opinion about this. You're 16. Give me some gum

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:39.200
Did you say that brain she died that brain she died?

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.880
Yeah, does that make sense like in a context that i'm not getting

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.320
Well, it's sort of like it doesn't not make sense. I was being like kind of nautical

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.880
I guess with a skosher jamaican

01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:55.600
I got that then. Okay, that day. I was going to say Bob Marley, but with Robert Robert Shaw on high seas

01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.400
I thought it was like one of those do androids dream of electric shrimp or whatever

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.000
Like yeah, I was just trying to get primal, you know, I was like that I was I was like I was like forget it

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.960
But you know like words that brain she died, you know, I was like I did note

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.880
Yeah, no, that was good. I was like, you know, that's the ultimate. Fuck you is for guys to

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.520
Uh, feminize their own brains. Yeah, the like the way we do ships and

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:23.680
everything that we're like, oh, it's a she because it's

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.200
Like

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.480
It's like our ultimate doff of the cap like look at her look at this boat. She's a beauty. We're like, we're like, yeah

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.720
You know, like you're about to take a test. Let's see if the old girl still got it. Yeah

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.400
Because if you made it a dude, you'd be in pie. Let's climb on that big fat cock and go fight some russians

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400
It's but you're Bill Bill

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.840
Come on. What are you doing? Look at those balls. Let's just people come on. Look at all those guys carrying balls and

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.480
Bill's having a little bit of an episode when you clean your gun

01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:02.320
I want you to think of it like it's your your husband. Okay. All right. All right. Let's just uh,

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.720
Anyway, let's bring the singer out again

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:10.080
Hey, yeah, everything. Let's get out here and sing a little bit. Bill. What the fuck the investors are here

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:16.000
But that'd be kind of cool. Like, like, you know, your own brain. You're like, oh man, my brain. She's not running good today

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.560
Yeah, I like I can't I can't tell

01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.440
That's fun. It's polarizing. That's what it is. Oh, it's polarizing. Well, you would take better care of it

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.040
If it were shirts, what's your reaction? I got a emotional level to men

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.840
Using the female pronouns to refer to their own brains

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:45.760
So that so going from battleships to brains and calling on women wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be like a slippery slope anyway

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.240
It would just be more of the same at least we'd be talking about our brains

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.400
Hey, you're talking about it. It's very do you know what I'm saying?

01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:02.560
It's very crazy thing is if we started calling women he and she or he he and him because because we were like that's it

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.560
We're taking it. You know, like we're like like only battleships are women now

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:13.520
Like like that last parade was out of bounds you guys. I don't like how many of you showed up and I don't like what you burnt

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.600
From now on you're a bunch of hymns. That's what you are if I want to talk to a woman. I'll talk to this gun

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.000
I'm gonna clean her. I believe we've pushed through

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.040
We've finally pushed through

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.160
Like we just revealed

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.040
Yeah, Schrab

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.120
When does solo come out and how long does it usually take for a movie and when are you and I gonna go see it together

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.600
I'll go see solo with you for sure. Are you serious?

01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.560
See a movie together

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.160
I make these exceptions for these some of these star wars movies not the recent one

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:59.680
We haven't seen a single star wars movie together since

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.240
phantom menace

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.480
Well, no, there was the one there was there was the one that came out after phantom menace

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.480
That was either the second or third of the trilogy and and you said have you seen it yet?

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.000
And I said no and you said are you gonna see it and I said

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.160
Not in the theater and you said I will pay for your movie ticket

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.040
If I can go to the theater with you and sit sideways in the seat next to you and watch you watch it

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.080
And I think we did that

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.720
Must have been the second one

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:36.080
Flying rtd too. It wasn't like it wasn't aside from aside from that invitation. It wasn't there was nothing cool about it

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:42.960
Yeah, so it's not really unmemorable, but yeah, we watched the phantom menace together. We sure did. We sure did. We were so excited

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.320
We're so excited. It was a rainy

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.800
Can we get a confirmation on the solo date though? Yeah, what's going on? Are we gonna wear solo costumes?

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.720
Yeah, man

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.400
New solo or old solo both one of each right?

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:05.920
I don't want to wear my dad. Did you get your garage fixed yet? Yeah, awesome. But there's no address on my garage. You get your what?

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:13.760
Your what garage you get your garage tickets yet? The garage is fixed. Yeah, they haven't quite finished

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:20.800
Are they playing at the palladium? But the people that deliver food keep coming coming this fall to the palladium garage

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120
Justifiably complaining Harmon's garage

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:26.160
Playing for four nights

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.160
All right, here they come

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.880
Looking lovely. Look at these new boots the garage are wearing. Look at that

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:39.600
There's the fluorescent light that he's pretty sure is on all the time, but it never has the patience to test

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.800
Because you can just always see it still on

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.240
It's probably it's definitely not on during the daytime somehow

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:51.680
So it only knows to come on at night and then stay on all throughout the night. So it has consciousness

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.720
We've confirmed that

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.800
I think I'm so sorry I asked about that fucking garage

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.080
It's been the pain of his existence. Cody's dog pisses in Harvey's water dish

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.200
On the reg

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.520
He doesn't mind it though. I'm sure he don't he fucking laps it up. He loves it

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.880
Harvey loves Barbara and Barbara's like I can't tell

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.720
Like I mean it's that is the ultimate like even in the dog world. That's like

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.400
Like straight disrespectful fucking amazing

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:31.200
Like she just pisses and Cody said I've never seen her do it. I was like I always pictured her like peeing on it like marking the bowl

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:36.160
Uh, she said no, she fucking like aims it into it

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.320
Wow, does Cody's dog have her own bowl there?

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.840
Uh water. No. Yeah, how does she get water? Oh look Schrabs on it's on

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:50.640
Well, no they dog Schrabs and maybe get her her own piss and bowl. Well, I'm saying like

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:57.120
Is good. Is there one drinking bowl? Is there one water bowl for the dog? Yeah, that's all it's all the same

01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.520
So she's drinking her own pee

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:04.080
Yeah, she's not yeah, I don't know what why yeah, why is she pissing in Harvey's water?

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.640
That's the only water that's the only water I would I would say I would say if she had her own bowl that she only drank out of

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:16.880
Then something malicious is going on, but I think what we're finding out is she likes to taste her own pee

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:22.240
Yeah, you know or she's trying to pee in it. So she she's telling Harvey. This is my bowl

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:29.040
Despite the that's true dogs communicate with their pee. Yeah, that's how they text it's like twitter marking her bowl

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.560
right

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.880
Also, they they go, okay

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Okay, come on

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:42.640
So like no like if lolly sees a boy dog

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:46.880
That she has a crush on she will pee

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:52.240
Yeah, the dog will smell that and then it'll pee and then lolly will smell that in a pee

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.960
So they're having a conversation in humans. What's that? That's no different than humans. Yeah, they're just like saying

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.960
Hey, do you like me? I think so, but do you like me?

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.480
Maybe

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.960
Yeah, well, maybe you maybe maybe, huh?

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.840
Yeah, but they took it out of me

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.160
Okay

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:18.800
Yeah, they could still get down. Nigel let's Harvey. Steve Levy ladies and gentlemen at home Steve

Win at fetch and then he humps him

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.360
Hell Nigel's a small one and Harvey's the big one. So when Harvey wants to win at fetch

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:38.480
They communicate like Nigel goes like, hey, uh, you don't come here for the hunting game

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:45.360

Overlooking the forest and the city

Floating into the clouds like a city cities float like big balloons in the hindenburg

You're a beauty. Some words always rhyme

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:12.240
All the time he never got a rhyme south with anything but mouth and Gary Busey is a pussy
