Dan Harmon\n\n01:52.560 --> 01:58.220\nthings are being knocked off let's bring it back from there we don't want\n\n01:58.220 --> 02:03.780\nto do that till like the end of the concert if anything I mean isn't it\n\n02:03.780 --> 02:08.420\nironic that you I tried to telegraph to you for a teachable moment it's it's an\n\n02:08.420 --> 02:12.660\nact of cowardice to kick over a chair that you've tripped over it would have\n\n02:12.660 --> 02:17.780\nbeen brave for me to say I tripped over a chair that would have been the the\n\n02:17.780 --> 02:23.260\nmachismo move but I did what a rock and roller sometimes does cornered by their\n\n02:23.260 --> 02:33.380\nown glory I was like yeah I meant to I hate chairs oh boy I threw it on the\n\n02:33.380 --> 02:43.940\nground speaking of irony paradoxes is the plural of paradox paradoxes what\n\n02:43.940 --> 02:52.620\nis it paradoxes okay welcome to the 300th episode of a thing that we never\n\n02:52.620 --> 02:56.820\nplanned and we knew and you would be the only person that has been for all 300 I\n\n02:56.820 --> 03:01.140\nwould say that's probably inaccurate yeah I never really thought about that I'm\n\n03:01.140 --> 03:05.580\nsure I miss 50 or so yeah even Carson could like not show up for a couple but\n\n03:05.580 --> 03:09.340\nlike it wasn't called Carson town you have no Joan Rivers but it was called\n\n03:09.340 --> 03:13.500\nthe late show with Johnny Carson so and he did but but you know what I can't\n\n03:13.500 --> 03:19.100\neither maybe I just can't fill these shoes can't do it the subscribers would\n\n03:19.100 --> 03:28.140\nrevolt yeah we still have some some shoes subscribers oh yeah yeah I'm sure we\n\n03:28.140 --> 03:37.500\ndo I thank you for those of you who are newcomers those of you have been here\n\n03:37.500 --> 03:42.660\nwith us and followed us through all our venues what a I guess tonight's gonna be\n\n03:42.660 --> 03:49.460\na night of probably remembrance unavoidably one of the what one of the\n\n03:49.460 --> 03:52.620\nweird ironies of the show is that we probably do a little too much recapping\n\n03:52.620 --> 03:55.540\nanyway by accident because we're like middle-aged alcoholics that are\n\n03:55.540 --> 04:00.500\ncasually repeating ourselves like let's do a clip show you guys did that last\n\n04:00.500 --> 04:05.260\nweek you do you mean you retell that story about we definitely complained\n\n04:05.260 --> 04:09.300\nabout just listening to podcasts last week\n\n04:09.300 --> 04:14.300\nSchrab made a big deal about that being a bad thing to do right and we do\n\n04:14.300 --> 04:18.020\nactually for his enjoyment we have some clips of our own show tonight to play\n\n04:18.020 --> 04:23.300\nfor him he'll love it yeah he probably won't disrupt it at all\n\n04:23.300 --> 04:28.300\noh we've got we I didn't want to go overboard with the guests you know I did\n\n04:28.300 --> 04:31.820\nlike like what do you you know we go let's get Doug Henning out here that was\n\n04:31.820 --> 04:38.580\na magician yeah whatever it was like I think I think I think probably under\n\n04:38.580 --> 04:42.740\n200th or our 100th we've probably had the same like I'm always like we'll get\n\n04:42.740 --> 04:49.060\nus our our progenitor the person without whom we we wouldn't have I wouldn't\n\n04:49.060 --> 04:54.380\nhave started doing the podcast and we'll we'll bring her and her her husband\n\n04:54.380 --> 04:57.460\nkind of comes along with her wherever she goes it's kind of a tag along we'll\n\n04:57.460 --> 05:01.620\nbring her out in a second but I first wanted to before she comes out I wanted\n\n05:01.620 --> 05:06.580\nto keep it classy and talk to you about the fact that I'm shitting my brains out\n\n05:06.580 --> 05:14.220\nright now yeah I I I right now something well something is happening to me\n\n05:14.220 --> 05:22.900\nclassy something beautiful it's like I think I might be dying only because I'm\n\n05:22.900 --> 05:29.580\nexperiencing for the first time in my life just pure diarrhea without any other\n\n05:29.580 --> 05:35.180\nsymptoms so it's like like you just say listen to your ass is just a faucet like\n\n05:35.180 --> 05:40.140\nI don't have a fever I don't have I don't I don't have a tummy ache even I\n\n05:40.140 --> 05:45.020\njust have like a like I'll eat a cracker and my body will go you want to turn\n\n05:45.020 --> 05:50.940\nthat into four ounces of water and then the irony is I drink anything I'm even\n\n05:50.940 --> 05:54.180\ntesting the theory I can drink anything I'm drinking a course light right now\n\n05:54.180 --> 05:58.660\nlike I like it doesn't do anything with that but there's pizza backstage and I\n\n05:58.660 --> 06:02.620\nwas like I know I can't nibble that or it or my body will go into this juicer\n\n06:02.620 --> 06:08.460\nmode I have no idea what's happening has been happening all weekend and then it\n\n06:08.460 --> 06:15.180\nwas I'm surviving on a modium and what's up you know what it means you're\n\n06:15.180 --> 06:25.740\nin love that's more plausible than Dave Kline's theory which is that my body is\n\n06:25.740 --> 06:36.180\nshitting out all its fat and like Dave okay it's possible to do that why I don't\n\n06:36.180 --> 06:40.420\ngazelle do that while they're running from a tiger I adore Dave Kline Dave\n\n06:40.420 --> 06:45.180\nhe's sitting right near me I think last week we proved that he has no actual\n\n06:45.180 --> 06:49.940\nqualifications as a trainer that's that sounds that sounds pejorative a bunch of\n\n06:49.940 --> 06:55.620\ndrug addicts came on stage and you were the most fit person on the whole well\n\n06:55.620 --> 06:58.860\nthat sounds like a qualification right there he's getting the job done and I\n\n06:58.860 --> 07:02.380\nwould never work with whatever you think in your head is a legitimate trainer\n\n07:02.380 --> 07:06.740\nfuck that guy I wouldn't work with him so like I'm working with the only guy\n\n07:06.740 --> 07:12.420\nthat I would ever be this long into working out and still show up every\n\n07:12.420 --> 07:18.100\nevery time like I would I would have bailed so long ago on like any kind of\n\n07:18.100 --> 07:24.540\nlike I don't want to say real because it makes you sound unreal I although\n\n07:24.540 --> 07:30.060\nsometimes I believe that I'm the only one that could see you but like but I\n\n07:30.060 --> 07:34.780\nthere's absolutely no way there's no way I would ever do a fucking like the\n\n07:34.780 --> 07:40.300\nfucking trainer that's like supposedly like the real thing I had to go with Dave\n\n07:40.300 --> 07:44.660\nKlein all right anyways and I'm gonna live like five years longer at least\n\n07:44.660 --> 07:49.540\nbecause of it unless I shit out my soul tonight I don't know if I did I run over\n\n07:49.540 --> 07:55.180\na gypsy baby yeah you don't remember that oh don't do that don't do that that\n\n07:55.180 --> 07:59.300\nI'll give you the diaries right away yeah it's just I think what Spencer and I\n\n07:59.300 --> 08:03.700\nour theory is just so you don't panic at home tonight my theory is his butt\n\n08:03.700 --> 08:11.620\nthinks it's his dick he keeps peeing out his butt you sorry what was our theory\n\n08:11.620 --> 08:18.020\nyou've made up that theory you're trying to appeal to a demographic which\n\n08:18.020 --> 08:24.700\ndemographic would that be our theory was that because I've been eating on these\n\n08:24.700 --> 08:29.060\nprotein bars like I got these oh yeah I just like these peanut butter protein\n\n08:29.060 --> 08:33.340\nbars and I think there's like there's so my body has taken in so much like fake\n\n08:33.340 --> 08:39.380\nalcohol-based sugar like substitute that it finally got to a typical part of\n\n08:39.380 --> 08:43.700\nour bodies like so we live on the moon now like like like so you're just gonna\n\n08:43.700 --> 08:49.060\nshit in a funnel right like like maybe I'll help you propel like like like I\n\n08:49.060 --> 08:52.500\nthink I think I think your body like if you starve it your body goes into\n\n08:52.500 --> 08:56.300\nketosis if you you know your body reacts to certain things it's taking in your\n\n08:56.300 --> 09:00.540\nbody goes okay so we're obviously being hunted right now so here's how I'll\n\n09:00.540 --> 09:05.580\nreact right and when you're on the moon if you I think if you eat enough of\n\n09:05.580 --> 09:09.260\nthis like synthetic like protein bar your body eventually goes so we're\n\n09:09.260 --> 09:13.940\nmoon rakers like like let's just poop liquid I don't know I thought you guys\n\n09:13.940 --> 09:18.540\nwould enjoy that theory but like but I don't want to you know look part of our\n\n09:18.540 --> 09:23.420\n300th episode is gonna be a recalibration of our social contract I'm sorry if\n\n09:23.420 --> 09:27.260\nsometimes I let you know after you don't react to something that you should have\n\n09:27.260 --> 09:31.980\nreacted to it I never mean to do that to you you know Tolstoy towards the end of\n\n09:31.980 --> 09:36.940\nhis life he kept a diary and towards the end of his life a lot of his entry is\n\n09:36.940 --> 09:41.140\njust about pooping right so you're turning into Tolstoy so you're in good\n\n09:41.140 --> 09:45.820\nliterary company right I'm not gonna connect the dots between diary and\n\n09:45.820 --> 09:50.900\ndiarrhea I'm not gonna do it cuz I'm like a craftsman like I don't I don't just\n\n09:50.900 --> 09:56.380\nconnect whatever dots there yeah that would be dumb yeah I don't think there's\n\n09:56.380 --> 10:03.580\nanything else before we start bringing out friends and just looking back oh\n\n10:03.580 --> 10:10.140\nhere's a boy if you didn't like the last thing I thought you'd laugh at you'll\n\n10:10.140 --> 10:21.220\nlove not laughing at this here we go the ultimate paradox I thought as I was\n\n10:21.220 --> 10:26.260\ngetting dressed this morning the more slimming your shirt color the more\n\n10:26.260 --> 10:29.220\ndandruff enhancing\n\n10:29.220 --> 10:34.780\nshe's like driving to work I'm like Jesus fucking dog hair and dandruff I'm\n\n10:34.780 --> 10:38.940\nlike why do you why do you have so many black shirts oh cuz you don't want to\n\n10:38.940 --> 10:44.300\nlook like you're fat you're trying to like be like the Venom suit and like you\n\n10:44.300 --> 10:48.100\nyou've fallen for that theory that if there's no color that you could like\n\n10:48.100 --> 10:54.220\nthat people won't see your body you'll be a shadow is it means I like I like\n\n10:54.220 --> 10:56.580\nwhat's going on with your hair and your beard right now like I like I like the\n\n10:56.580 --> 11:00.300\nwhole design right now I put a little shampoo this morning and I so you got to\n\n11:00.300 --> 11:04.500\ngive it a couple days to oil back down but you but you but you you crossed over\n\n11:04.500 --> 11:08.500\nrecently into being almost completely gray-haired but the use like that happened\n\n11:08.500 --> 11:12.980\npretty fast for me or maybe I just haven't seen you that much yeah I like it\n\n11:12.980 --> 11:16.940\nyou look great that's you look like that like you look like one of the\n\n11:16.940 --> 11:30.820\ncaptains of like the deadliest catch yeah the deadliest catch of all life\n\n11:32.220 --> 11:38.940\nyou know that crab trap comes up oh it's full of death it's full of it's full\n\n11:38.940 --> 11:44.180\nof sands of time 300 miles off the bearing to see I can't remember what\n\n11:44.180 --> 11:48.300\nthe fuck all right and it's actually sponsored by Coors light so

honestly for\n\n11:57.660 --> 12:03.500\nreal like like I never I never would have the podcast thing I never would have\n\n12:03.500 --> 12:08.100\ndone it she said one night at the roost you should do a podcast and then I kind\n\n12:08.100 --> 12:12.580\nof resisted it for a while and did a show at nerd melt and and then started\n\n12:12.580 --> 12:20.860\ndoing it and and she's also the reason why your favorite person in the world\n\n12:20.860 --> 12:27.860\nthat you miss so much all the time is what used to be on the show before he\n\n12:27.860 --> 12:33.300\nbecame so valuable to you that he had to go away and serve you from a different\n\n12:33.300 --> 12:44.300\ntier of reality let's let's what what a charming intro I just want the audience\n\n12:44.300 --> 12:51.980\nto know we're I

compliment hates you is like fuck\n\n13:44.180 --> 13:50.660\nthis guy resents is like Lucifer talking about God Wow Wow that's crazy you\n\n13:50.660 --> 13:55.060\nreally that's like the highest form of flattery I resent him\n\n13:55.060 --> 14:00.900\nwhy the audience misses him that's a that's a fucking come on that's good\n\n14:00.900 --> 14:05.100\nno I'm in I'm into it he doesn't like it quite a bit yeah I'm changing\n\n14:05.100 --> 14:08.660\nmicrophones that one has a dent in it and I feel like I'm better than that\n\n14:08.660 --> 14:13.500\nnow old Kumail would have kept that microphone I'm not gonna have a fucking\n\n14:13.500 --> 14:19.020\ndented microphone I'm God yeah well good luck with that\n\n14:19.020 --> 14:33.020\nconehead do either of you guys we've really gotten into\n\n14:33.020 --> 14:36.940\nunrelatable comedy now where we just talk about the lumpiness of the\n\n14:36.940 --> 14:40.860\nmicrophones we're talking about don't do relatable because I tried to I was\n\n14:40.860 --> 14:44.940\ntrying to make them laugh by doing the meme of like I miss Kumail and it just\n\n14:44.940 --> 14:50.460\nI guess people like think that these guys are on the reddit yeah I guess maybe\n\n14:50.460 --> 14:54.420\nthey were I used to be on the reddit oh that no don't be that Emily are you\n\n14:54.420 --> 14:58.140\nproud or are you ashamed of what you've created over 300 episodes\n\n14:58.140 --> 15:04.500\nboth is both an option always I mean what a crazy thing happy 300 episodes thank\n\n15:04.500 --> 15:15.420\nyou thank you amazing thing and the show you started out doing was we're all\n\n15:15.420 --> 15:20.180\ngonna go to the moon right how will we survive there right and every week\n\n15:20.180 --> 15:25.780\nexplored that topic right that was the original conceit right look at like\n\n15:25.780 --> 15:34.900\nthat's where we started yeah and now it's 300 episodes later and Trump is\n\n15:34.900 --> 15:42.540\ngoing to the moon and I don't want to dig a hole and hide and die which that\n\n15:42.540 --> 15:47.700\nis easier than going to the moon yeah I like I listen I don't want to be the\n\n15:47.700 --> 15:53.380\nodd one out but I I like Spencer's theory that your butt has become a dick it\n\n15:53.380 --> 15:58.220\njust thinks it's a dick out of your penis because then we can be sure that\n\n15:58.220 --> 16:06.500\nsounds oddly like satisfying like I know I genuinely said I'll never poop out\n\n16:06.500 --> 16:09.660\nmy penis well because I never know what that feels like aren't you picturing\n\n16:09.660 --> 16:16.820\nlike a like like what's it the soft sir the car max or what's the thing like\n\n16:16.820 --> 16:21.820\nthe car max the lip the lip balm like it's got the little tiny hole and then it\n\n16:21.820 --> 16:26.980\nhas like that really satisfying narrow like like the worm that comes out like\n\n16:26.980 --> 16:30.900\nit's like really consistent and like you can like write with it if you were a\n\n16:30.900 --> 16:35.340\nchef like I just I mean obviously you wouldn't need to wipe you just got a\n\n16:35.340 --> 16:43.540\nq-tip and you're good to go car max would you have to squat for that or you\n\n16:43.540 --> 16:49.500\nthink you could do it standing oh you could do it standing these are questions\n\n16:49.500 --> 16:54.540\nI can't answer speaking to Dan Dan Pupens there's something that you said\n\n16:54.540 --> 16:58.860\nlike sometimes things stick with you like when I'm shaving I remember comments\n\n16:58.860 --> 17:01.900\nabout shaving because it's a kind of a quiet moment or I'm washing my hair I'll\n\n17:01.900 --> 17:07.140\nremember a line or a joke about washing air but you have haunted me with the\n\n17:07.140 --> 17:13.340\nthing that you said that you can never wipe enough it's never done because\n\n17:13.340 --> 17:23.020\nmy my butt is like an endless can of shoe polish that is stuck with me and it\n\n17:23.020 --> 17:27.980\nwill stay with me until I have Alzheimer's well then someone sent me that\n\n17:27.980 --> 17:31.820\nmeme that was like I got from Parks and Rec like Chris Pratt the thing where he's\n\n17:31.820 --> 17:36.460\nlike it's like it's like wiping a magic marker it felt so so much seen you felt\n\n17:36.460 --> 17:43.940\nseen yes like thank you and he and he was like

Schrab wondering about space\n\n18:37.220 --> 18:41.060\nexploration why don't we ever go down that's not\n\n18:41.060 --> 18:59.340\nstrong and that was that why don't we go down that's weird because really watch\n\n18:59.340 --> 19:06.580\ntheir mouths moving that clip was longer than I remember yeah alright well we've\n\n19:06.580 --> 19:12.580\nbeen keep we've here's something I've always wanted to know how come when we\n\n19:12.580 --> 19:21.220\nwhen we when we go into space how come we've never gone down we're always going\n\n19:21.220 --> 19:28.780\nto the moon I was going there always sending stuff out how come we don't go\n\n19:28.780 --> 19:44.940\ndown in the earth somebody what into the center of the earth no no no why don't\n\n19:44.940 --> 19:50.660\nwe ever go down yeah because when you make it go up we always go why do we\n\n19:50.660 --> 19:54.420\nalways go why do we always go well we're gonna go to we're gonna go to we're\n\n19:54.420 --> 19:57.860\ngonna go

making those let those\n\n20:25.260 --> 20:29.580\nlittle like mobiles of the solar system is just a flat thing yeah why don't they\n\n20:29.580 --> 20:35.780\never go down because then then you'd hit

25:58.460\ngave you we gave it to each other do you do you has and I'm sorry to do this but\n\n25:58.460 --> 26:05.460\nthis is a question that affects me do you get mad if Camille forgets to flush\n\n26:05.460 --> 26:12.180\nlike I don't forget okay okay how can you forget I'm the first clue is there's\n\n26:12.180 --> 26:18.380\nsomething in there this is a guy that changes outfits to go poo he's not gonna\n\n26:18.380 --> 26:24.340\nforget the no no yeah okay he goes to Narnia to poop all right oh what did I\n\n26:24.340 --> 26:31.540\nforget okay okay all right everybody just settle the fuck down all right so\n\n26:31.540 --> 26:36.820\nand I've discussed this on the show before the last five years I've been\n\n26:36.820 --> 26:42.300\ngetting forgetting to flush the toilet oh it just started the last five years it\n\n26:42.300 --> 26:49.540\njust started I blame Wi-Fi I think there's something in the air that is\n\n26:49.540 --> 26:57.100\naffecting my brain oh so like the bees were getting lost yeah I read a\n\n26:57.100 --> 27:00.340\nscience paper it said that bees are getting lost and then some people are\n\n27:00.340 --> 27:03.940\nforgetting to flush I think that Wi-Fi kills ghosts I think that's why we\n\n27:03.940 --> 27:08.580\ndon't see ghosts anymore I think you're right because there were ghosts and then\n\n27:08.580 --> 27:12.780\nthey got pulverized by all this electromagnetic radiation without bodies\n\n27:12.780 --> 27:16.420\nto protect themselves you were saying there were ghosts until the late 90s\n\n27:16.420 --> 27:22.100\nyeah absolutely there were you saw no I just know you know why I think there's\n\n27:22.100 --> 27:28.060\nno ghosts why because it's it is because of Wi-Fi but here's why I like ghosts\n\n27:28.060 --> 27:32.500\nghosts can only walk around and they can't touch anything but think about it\n\n27:32.500 --> 27:36.580\nwe're all on our phones and iPads now so ghosts are like set they're like oh I'm\n\n27:36.580 --> 27:41.780\njust gonna watch ABC news with this guy like they're ghosts are like they don't\n\n27:41.780 --> 27:44.700\nhave to be poltergeist they're like what's this tea kettle doing here this\n\n27:44.700 --> 27:47.900\nisn't my watch tea kettle they're they're like Jesus Christ that's a great\n\n27:47.900 --> 27:51.380\ntweet you know they're being entertained now yeah the ghosts are like\n\n27:51.380 --> 27:56.260\npacified because what do we know about ghosts they love petty yeah they get\n\n27:56.260 --> 28:01.140\nhooked in by petty shit otherwise they go to fucking heaven when you die\n\n28:01.140 --> 28:04.460\nthere's a gateway that goes like rise above it and they're like no I'll do\n\n28:04.460 --> 28:08.780\nthe Twitter of fucking supernatural activity which is hang out here and\n\n28:08.780 --> 28:12.500\nfucking monitor everything otherwise I might miss something who's living in my\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:16.380\napartment and then and then for everybody to be like hey look it's my\n\n28:16.380 --> 28:20.940\ndick and balls the ghost is like fuck yeah okay that's a pretty good theory\n\n28:20.940 --> 28:24.860\nthat's not a bad theory so you're saying they're still around they're just\n\n28:24.860 --> 28:28.620\nplacated they're happy they're happy they're more like us now they're not\n\n28:28.620 --> 28:32.380\nlike who is this living in my house they're like oh it's one of me oh yeah\n\n28:32.380 --> 28:37.580\nrecognize game recognize game it's another floaty yeah non-person just like\n\n28:37.580 --> 28:41.580\ndrifting through the fucking earth like not knowing where to go so I have a\n\n28:41.580 --> 28:46.740\nquestion is it possible that you just flushed it and it's not enough great\n\n28:46.740 --> 28:51.780\nquestion that that that's sorry sorry I wanted to go back to get a very good\n\n28:51.780 --> 28:58.740\nquestion so lately in order I've been trying really hard to flush to flush so\n\n28:58.740 --> 29:06.540\nhard it's been it's a lot like a dream for getting forgetting is getting in\n\n29:06.540 --> 29:11.860\nthe way and and I but it's like I have so much anxiety to the point that I'll\n\n29:11.860 --> 29:16.500\nbe like like this morning I'll be driving to work and then I'll stop at a\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:21.700\nstop sign and what oh shit and I'll text Kate going hey just in case flush the\n\n29:21.700 --> 29:29.100\ntoilet before you open open the lid or you close the lid there's your fucking\n\n29:29.100 --> 29:41.380\nproblem particles get on your toothbrush oh yeah that's a great reason to\n\n29:41.380 --> 29:47.180\nflush you're you're remembering you're remembering poop particles enough to\n\n29:47.180 --> 29:52.860\nclose it in like a fucking mug why are you gonna get a window installed in the\n\n29:52.860 --> 29:58.220\nlid of the toilet oh that could be good there you go that's it\n\n29:58.220 --> 30:03.180\nthere's fancy glass top toilet hi yeah like a glass top toilet or you could\n\n30:03.180 --> 30:07.180\nremember to flush like every other fucking human being in the world you know\n\n30:07.180 --> 30:10.780\nwhat you could get I bet you there's a lot of people out there that forget to\n\n30:10.780 --> 30:14.780\nflush and it's more than that it's your anxiety about it is now the big deal\n\n30:14.780 --> 30:20.100\nnow it's a big deal because because I'll at the stoplight I'll text and I'll go\n\n30:20.100 --> 30:29.740\nand it and it there's not even ellipses of like too late that was the prices\n\n30:29.740 --> 30:37.140\nright yeah how people forget like oh did I leave the oven on or whatever you're\n\n30:37.140 --> 30:42.900\nlike yeah I like that too except I just it's yeah that happens to me where I\n\n30:42.900 --> 30:46.620\nthink I've left a straightening iron on but all every time we leave the house\n\n30:46.620 --> 30:50.540\nokay that's true but I'd never leave on but you actually are leaving poop in\n\n30:50.540 --> 30:56.220\nthat toilet maybe an auto flusher like I air airport that could be but also you\n\n30:56.220 --> 30:59.580\nhave one of the most exotic toilets I've ever seen yeah it's a great toilet one\n\n30:59.580 --> 31:03.540\nof those Japanese things that talks to you yeah water fountain dances I need to\n\n31:03.540 --> 31:09.420\nupgrade I need to upgrade yeah you here I have an idea upgrade no don't upgrade\n\n31:09.420 --> 31:12.500\nhere's an idea down great you're saying Wi-Fi so you're on your phone and\n\n31:12.500 --> 31:15.860\nthat's the problem right you know about how long it's taking you to poop five\n\n31:15.860 --> 31:19.700\nminutes ten minutes what is it what is what do you have to poo before you start\n\n31:19.700 --> 31:24.660\nset an alarm and then go poo and then when the alarm goes off how was he gonna\n\n31:24.660 --> 31:29.500\nremember to do that he can't remember to remember to poop I bet when you have to\n\n31:29.500 --> 31:32.780\ngo poop at that moment you're like I have a flush afterwards and then you\n\n31:32.780 --> 31:38.820\nforget in the interim right yes I'm just glad I had an alarm I've been feeling\n\n31:38.820 --> 31:43.220\nbad because as I think your brain just degenerates and there's like pixels that\n\n31:43.220 --> 31:47.780\nget removed from the JPEG you know I for me it's I keep forgetting Jeff\n\n31:47.780 --> 31:50.780\nBridges name and like like stuff like that like I'm like who the fuck was that\n\n31:50.780 --> 31:54.780\nway it's like just random people that you should like I'll spend I'll be going\n\n31:54.780 --> 32:01.020\nit's not like and everyone's just waiting for me and I'm like no no and I\n\n32:01.020 --> 32:05.900\ndon't I know that all I have to say is the bad guy from seven but I won't say\n\n32:05.900 --> 32:09.620\nit because that'll be weakness like I like cuz then they'll go Kevin Spacey\n\n32:09.620 --> 32:15.020\nI'm like I'm not old like like so I'll just sit there I forgot the name of the\n\n32:15.020 --> 32:22.060\nbad guy from seven everyone has to wait until I forge my neural pathway back but\n\n32:22.060 --> 32:26.340\nI'd rather I'd rather forget celebrities names and forget that my I don't know his\n\n32:26.340 --> 32:31.540\nonly has one victim this is really really I mean I thought I'd share\n\n32:31.540 --> 32:36.500\nsomething with you that you know I mean with with the audience but I mean like\n\n32:36.500 --> 32:44.020\nmy my real question is just can't have a right to be mad at me yeah yeah only\n\n32:44.020 --> 32:51.340\nbecause you're a grown-up okay well she has a right to be mad but it's gonna do\n\n32:51.340 --> 32:55.740\nabout as much good as being mad at the weather all right well no here's the\n\n32:55.740 --> 32:59.420\nissue it is Emily brought up something that's interesting if this was the\n\n32:59.420 --> 33:02.900\nthing from the very beginning when you guys met she's like this guy's great I\n\n33:02.900 --> 33:06.340\nthink I'm really falling for him he never flushes right he could get past that then\n\n33:06.340 --> 33:09.620\nshe should be then that's part of the equation but now she's with you and you\n\n33:09.620 --> 33:13.100\nspring this on her many years into the relationship she can't even do that you\n\n33:13.100 --> 33:16.380\nknew I was like this when you met me you can't even do that she can say you\n\n33:16.380 --> 33:20.500\nchanged you used to flush changed but we're all changing we're all dying and\n\n33:20.500 --> 33:24.420\nideally we're dying together and partners but what if there's something wrong with me\n\n33:24.420 --> 33:27.820\nwhat if there's something wrong with your brain there is something wrong with all of us\n\n33:27.820 --> 33:32.980\ntoilet carbon-based lifeforms we're melting but you can't make fun of that yes you can\n\n33:32.980 --> 33:38.260\nwatch we've been doing it for a while I'm going great I think this is just like\n\n33:38.260 --> 33:45.580\nyour new you're trying out for a while he walked around with a little box of\n\n33:45.580 --> 33:50.300\nCaptain Crunch yeah that would look who came to the set the bathrobe thing and\n\n33:50.300 --> 33:55.420\nI don't like we've established that Rob doesn't flush Dan is pooping his pants\n\n33:55.420 --> 34:04.660\ncurrently Kumail takes his shirt off like a fucking lunatic I take back to\n\n34:04.660 --> 34:08.620\nthat I was done to find out everyone doesn't do it it's just it's just it's\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:12.260\nbecause it's like for me it's like like I've never done it but I always think\n\n34:12.260 --> 34:14.900\nabout it when it's too late when I'm sitting down

donate it to the\n\n36:20.900 --> 36:31.700\norphans no I what day is it my boy it's Christmas\n\n36:31.700 --> 36:46.940\nwith this with Delta miles I've only worn it for four hours also doesn't sleep\n\n36:46.940 --> 36:51.820\nin underwear where's specific I don't I cannot sleep in underwear if I'm on a\n\n36:51.820 --> 36:54.820\nplane and I have to take a nap I'm going into the bathroom taking off my\n\n36:54.820 --> 36:58.580\nunderwear not putting on another underwear coming back and sitting in my\n\n36:58.580 --> 37:01.820\nseat to take a nap then what when before it's time to land I'm going into the\n\n37:01.820 --> 37:06.460\nbathroom I'm putting on underwear because now I'm ready for the day this is\n\n37:06.460 --> 37:11.180\nmaking me feel like I have a hidden superpower because I feel like well you\n\n37:11.180 --> 37:17.780\nhave a superpower which is like super sensitivity to your underwear being used\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:22.100\nI hate I have the opposite I'm like juggernaut and you're like that the\n\n37:22.100 --> 37:26.260\ngirl with that has to wear the gloves and the X man or the other I shall kill\n\n37:26.260 --> 37:31.900\npeople that's right we're both powerful but like I'm like it's been six days I\n\n37:31.900 --> 37:40.100\nshould change my underwear because I read an article about it someone just\n\n37:40.100 --> 37:45.980\nreminded I saw a zeppelin in the sky that was a certain I don't know I hate I've\n\n37:45.980 --> 37:49.780\nalways hated underwear I probably didn't start wearing underwear till I was\n\n37:49.780 --> 37:54.940\nprobably about 14 I delayed it as long as I could I probably have 50 pairs of\n\n37:54.940 --> 37:58.580\nunderwear that are currently in rotation well and this is a good question I\n\n37:58.580 --> 38:03.620\nthink for the board what is the oldest pair of underwear you own cuz it's a\n\n38:03.620 --> 38:10.060\ndisgusting thing to think about Nathan I don't know I don't know do you name your\n\n38:10.060 --> 38:14.740\nunderwear not name it but like no no the longest like the oldest pair she\n\n38:14.740 --> 38:19.300\ndidn't say name them she said I don't know they're all kind of they look the\n\n38:19.300 --> 38:26.380\nsame to me well that's so right so we're lucky in it while we think about it\n\n38:26.380 --> 38:53.100\nshould we bring up Brandon Johnson and find out what his underwear\n\n38:53.100 --> 39:04.860\npants okay how what's your what's your what's your problem dirty night pants it's\n\n39:04.860 --> 39:11.620\na dirty white pants dirty night pants we didn't for her we're doing I'm just I'm\n\n39:11.620 --> 39:16.620\nI love this idea of such elegance of changing your underwear throughout the\n\n39:16.620 --> 39:20.500\nday like that yeah man right so you agree with the rest of us in the middle of\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:24.460\nthe bell curve that he's like Downton Abbey style it's not good why is it not\n\n39:24.460 --> 39:31.780\ngood I will tell you it's just a lot of laundry to manage doesn't matter you're\n\n39:31.780 --> 39:36.500\nworth it yeah man goddamn you're worth it it's on some Rick Ross shit for real\n\n39:36.500 --> 39:41.860\nyeah I just it is some rapper baller type like I only wear this white t-shirt and\n\n39:41.860 --> 39:50.060\nI throw that shit away you know I did some math for the price that most people\n\n39:50.060 --> 39:54.580\nspend on like coffee weekly you could definitely have brand new socks every day\n\n39:54.580 --> 39:59.060\nof the week that sounds like a horrible infomercial and that's why I've come up\n\n39:59.060 --> 40:04.700\nwith soccer day are you telling me all I have to do is fill out paperwork and\n\n40:04.700 --> 40:10.540\nsocks will come to my house I'm telling you all fill out half of it oh I will\n\n40:10.540 --> 40:27.340\nnever be alone again you will never be alone again well what have we learned\n\n40:27.340 --> 40:35.180\nover 300 episodes that it's okay if I forget the flow no no that's not been\n\n40:35.180 --> 40:43.340\nthe take away but the texting and saying honey I'm sorry I don't remember how\n\n40:43.340 --> 40:47.300\noften when you're texting or how often is it what percentage of time have you\n\n40:47.300 --> 40:52.500\nnot flushed and what percentage have you flushed and you're almost a hundred yeah\n\n40:52.500 --> 40:57.260\nit's all almost a hundred almost a hundred so what if you take like a golden\n\n40:57.260 --> 41:02.300\nstring right you tie it to the to the flusher and you will put a loop on the\n\n41:02.300 --> 41:06.460\nother end when you sit down on the toilet you put the looped end if you\n\n41:06.460 --> 41:09.700\nremember if he could remember to put a string on his finger he could remember\n\n41:09.700 --> 41:14.100\nto remove poop out of you see a golden string on your toilet you will remember\n\n41:14.100 --> 41:18.300\nto put a string on your thing right let's string on your let's not shoot\n\n41:18.300 --> 41:22.740\nlet's not shoot from the makers of soccer days let's yes and string on your\n\n41:22.740 --> 41:26.220\nthing string anything's good you could also say it as you do it that helps me\n\n41:26.220 --> 41:30.700\nwhen I like and unplugging stuff I go I have unplugged the flat iron you're like\n\n41:30.700 --> 41:37.340\nme oh yeah now that's a good idea I think that's a helpful thing to say a rope\n\n41:37.340 --> 41:43.420\ncoming down from a really well-anchored thing in your cities what it's it's a\n\n41:43.420 --> 41:47.780\nlike you shape it into a thing that slips over your neck like right so it's\n\n41:47.780 --> 41:51.780\nhanging you're not gonna forget you it's gonna be in your way the way to get it\n\n41:51.780 --> 41:56.220\nout of your way as you slip it over your neck you take a poop yeah you get up if\n\n41:56.220 --> 42:00.860\nyou you could forget everything you could forget to wipe you

at night so I\n\n43:30.300 --> 43:46.020\nthought ziplock bag size like the size of the big daddy coke bag I did a dime\n\n43:46.020 --> 43:54.900\nbag of shit that was a little logo on him from her cartel the cops are like\n\n43:54.900 --> 43:59.420\nwho's the scorpion person her poop actually has a blue hue to it\n\n43:59.420 --> 44:04.460\nyeah did you make sure the the air was all out of it before you close it I did\n\n44:04.460 --> 44:09.740\na pretty good job are you trying to keep it fresh no but I did the instinct was\n\n44:09.740 --> 44:14.820\nthere why oh just get all the air out

let me have my thing wait did you did you save it until\n\n44:24.940 --> 44:29.620\nyou found a toilet to flush it down here's what I did I put the bag you woke\n\n44:29.620 --> 44:37.420\nme up I double-bagged it three times and then only though the word that met\n\n44:37.420 --> 44:41.940\ntwice but three times you are so high a mighty firm and who has to get naked to\n\n44:41.940 --> 44:48.380\nshit that's the opposite of what you did I am clean clothes are far away from the\n\n44:48.380 --> 44:56.380\nshit you're sitting into a bag and then I went down to our dumpster which was\n\n44:56.380 --> 44:59.900\nbehind the building and got rid of the evidence you were living together oh yeah\n\n44:59.900 --> 45:04.340\nwe were married so during during this period where the toilet was at what on\n\n45:04.340 --> 45:08.780\nearth was coming in oh I think you were at work or something you weren't there\n\n45:08.780 --> 45:15.660\nyou just bought a first-class ticket on United yeah you weren't there for\n\n45:15.660 --> 45:19.500\nwhatever reason you were not home and it was just not the kind of neighborhood\n\n45:19.500 --> 45:23.540\nyou could like walk to the closest as a guy who listens to too many true crime\n\n45:23.540 --> 45:28.060\npodcasts with Cody like I if I get a text if I ever got a text from Cody that\n\n45:28.060 --> 45:35.740\nsaid had to take a shit waters out shit in a bag actually shit on the floor like\n\n45:35.740 --> 45:41.580\ninstead of leaving the house ever I'd be like good good yeah I don't think that's\n\n45:41.580 --> 45:44.940\nhealthy but I know that would be right I was like good good just oh yeah next\n\n45:44.940 --> 45:48.820\ntime don't leave the bedroom yeah no it was a bad neighborhood it was pretty\n\n45:48.820 --> 45:52.340\ncommon if you open the dumpster it was full of bags of shit just bagged and\n\n45:52.340 --> 45:56.180\nbags of shit everybody was doing that over there so somehow it's okay to leave\n\n45:56.180 --> 45:59.580\nthe house and go behind the building the building the back door was like that\n\n45:59.580 --> 46:07.860\nenclosed yeah dumpster space yeah no wait I have more questions I thought of\n\n46:07.860 --> 46:11.660\nmore questions but you wiped I assume and where did the toilet it went in the\n\n46:11.660 --> 46:18.100\nback with it yeah yeah I got rid of all the evidence so you would wipe and put\n\n46:18.100 --> 46:22.980\nit into the bag yeah of shit or a separate bag same bag so it was just one\n\n46:22.980 --> 46:28.660\nbag with the poop found that was like oh I know what happened here this is act\n\n46:28.660 --> 46:33.340\none and two and three you ever see like a public toilet or like a workplace\n\n46:33.340 --> 46:35.860\ntoilet where there's like a conversation going on because there's\n\n46:35.860 --> 46:40.340\nsomething going wrong with the toilet or so somebody will put up a sign they put\n\n46:40.340 --> 46:44.700\nall the effort into an aerial true type font a piece of typing paper above the\n\n46:44.700 --> 46:51.140\nthing it says like but they just it's like don't flush tampons well they would\n\n46:51.140 --> 46:54.300\nthat they would be that specific because then you'd know exactly what not to\n\n46:54.300 --> 46:58.700\nflush but I'm saying like when they get amorphous and they're like don't flush\n\n46:58.700 --> 47:03.020\nnon-waste or something like that and then there's like so then people get\n\n47:03.020 --> 47:07.700\nballpoint pens ago you so you mean like toilet paper like everyone turns into a\n\n47:07.700 --> 47:11.740\nreddit forum like like that it's like like people are like no idiot they mean\n\n47:11.740 --> 47:15.300\nwhether they like what do you like like like but it's legitimate questions I'm\n\n47:15.300 --> 47:18.780\nlike what do you what is this a time bomb like what am I shitting in yeah\n\n47:18.780 --> 47:23.020\nthat's tough that's a tough one we have if you're flushing something that has\n\n47:23.020 --> 47:26.980\nbecome waste like no matter what it is that's what that's what you would write\n\n47:26.980 --> 47:33.620\non this side if I am flushing this already I worked in an office in\n\n47:33.620 --> 47:39.660\nChicago of all therapists and for whatever reason random turds kept showing\n\n47:39.660 --> 47:44.340\nup on the on the women's bathroom floor for weeks at a time how do you know they\n\n47:44.340 --> 47:50.780\nwere random they were different people each time we couldn't figure out we\n\n47:50.780 --> 47:53.260\njust call it a phantom shitter we couldn't figure out if it was like\n\n47:53.260 --> 47:58.740\nfalling out of a pant leg or if it was intentional it was not a happy workplace\n\n47:58.740 --> 48:02.140\nI'm really fascinated with that stuff like I because I think it's like an\n\n48:02.140 --> 48:06.900\neruption of like it's sort of like shoplifting yeah it's like an urban\n\n48:06.900 --> 48:11.260\nphenomenon like among people who are like like like there's one thing it's\n\n48:11.260 --> 48:14.540\nlike oh you saw that Canadian video where the woman just shits on the floor of\n\n48:14.540 --> 48:18.260\nthe restaurant there's it but I was I saw that I was like there's no mystery to\n\n48:18.260 --> 48:21.780\nthis she's asking to go to the bathroom she's infuriated she has she and then\n\n48:21.780 --> 48:25.460\nshe and I then I found out later I was totally right totally nailed it I know\n\n48:25.460 --> 48:30.220\nmy shitting people and but but it fascinates me when people are like I\n\n48:30.220 --> 48:37.100\nlived in an apartment complex and for six weeks every three days like in the\n\n48:37.100 --> 48:42.780\ndryer yeah I saw and it was like it's some cereal yeah like person that's\n\n48:42.780 --> 48:48.300\nlike there it's that's so fascinating to me either I think some form of rage that\n\n48:48.300 --> 48:51.940\nyou can only really express through your shit it's amazing that's a targeted\n\n48:51.940 --> 48:57.340\nbecause I have you know when you get so angry you can only shit it out I don't\n\n48:57.340 --> 49:01.020\nbut I'm clearly someone that I were and I we all kept being like oh I hope no one\n\n49:01.020 --> 49:05.540\nthinks it's me right I mean like I left that job and I was like please let the\n\n49:05.540 --> 49:09.980\nphantom shitter continue or else it's on me and the phantom shitter did oh that\n\n49:09.980 --> 49:15.580\nwould be great right and then that person stopped it was just an elaborate\n\n49:15.580 --> 49:19.980\nrevenge on you 35 people who just like oh Emily yeah I saw that movie was pretty\n\n49:19.980 --> 49:24.540\ngood she shit on the floor at that one place when the killer when they arrest\n\n49:24.540 --> 49:28.020\nthe wrong guy and then the and then the kid there's like that period of time where\n\n49:28.020 --> 49:32.860\nthe real killer is like I could go out hang up my jersey and I'm like no I\n\n49:32.860 --> 49:36.020\ngotta kill more people and they're like all right you can leave jail guy but\n\n49:36.020 --> 49:39.180\nthere is some kind of like modern like it's like getting your hands dirty in a\n\n49:39.180 --> 49:42.500\nworld where we don't really do that anymore I'm starting to kind of get it I\n\n49:42.500 --> 49:46.500\nguess I mean I did that's what's because you know that the person who takes a\n\n49:46.500 --> 49:51.900\nshit in their apartment buildings dryer every Wednesday is not also a serial\n\n49:51.900 --> 49:55.740\nkiller yes like they're not they're probably not torturing animals or\n\n49:55.740 --> 50:01.700\nsomething it's like it's such a weird pinprick like magma eruption I that's\n\n50:01.700

or are you do you how much money does AC for the AC I\n\n01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.820\nmean I guess you can you can save a little bit of cash see so you were\n\n01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.140\nactually here to answer the other question man sit around in a car that's\n\n01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.900\nhot and be an animal for an entire week to save this was not why you were brought\n\n01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:26.180\nup yes it is yes it is he's opinion on whether or not it's good to be in heat we\n\n01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.140\nall agree it's bad to be in heat he's he's equating it with exactly but he\n\n01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:36.060\nthere's nine people up here he's he's saying if I could talk over you for a\n\n01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:42.380\nsecond let him talk for fuck's sake all right go ahead I don't know what else you\n\n01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.860\nwant okay well here's what I heard you say it's what Schrab is saying which is\n\n01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:54.660\nbasically like I like like the savings on air conditioning are probably in\n\n01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.260\ncomparison to the jeopardy you know that you're just saying that because now\n\n01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.940\nyou're on the spot and we have a different question than the one you thought\n\n01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:08.460\nyou were answering no all right he went to he was doing a funny joke to open he\n\n01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.300\ngained everyone's esteem and I don't think he was doing a joke I think he\n\n01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.820\nthought that was the question whether or not I wish we could someone with\n\n01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:30.540\nhis intentions were all right thank you Christian Christian it does anyone know\n\n01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.660\nhow much money it doesn't save a lot of money but these are people who don't\n\n01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:39.180\nmake a lot of money and a lot of the money they make goes to pay the costs of\n\n01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.420\nthem doing their job yep which is what which is paying for the car paying for\n\n01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.940\nthe gas for the car paying for maintenance that's their job that's a big part of\n\n01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.700\ntheir job is to pay for the car what that's what their office is do you think\n\n01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.820\nthis is their job Spencer if we feel I thought I was driving with our awareness\n\n01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.900\nthat people who work every day jobs are unfairly paid can we do we have to be\n\n01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.220\nso distracted by that when we're discussing this other thing well that's\n\n01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.860\nthe reason why you're uncomfortable though and I agree that being uncomfortable\n\n01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:14.020\nis not a good thing but it's just the thing that has a reason right but I\n\n01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:19.020\nunderstand that we have any air conditioning driver out of their\n\n01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:25.180\noverhead I would know that here's my biggest problem the surprise oh you want\n\n01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:31.220\nthe air conditioning on as sweat is just dripping off everybody's face it's like\n\n01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.300\nif you're a restaurant and you get water because people are usually thirsty when\n\n01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.860\nthey're eating their friends so for you if that's water if she had been like hey\n\n01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.900\nI know it's very hard I didn't have it on because I'm saving money because I'm\n\n01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.460\nnot super rich you'd be okay is that okay do you want the AC or not so she\n\n01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.020\ndoes a little guilt trip to you before before you oh that would be awesome\n\n01:03:52.020 --> 01:04:01.940\nright I'm 10% Kevin day just came down with the day thanks Kevin it's 10\n\n01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:10.900\nKevin day everybody 10% fuel efficiency is lost Kevin by having the\n\n01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:17.460\nair on 10% fuel it 10% of anything is significant yeah literally on the way\n\n01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:28.580\nhere we're low on gas and you were like let's turn off the AC I had a friend it's\n\n01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:33.500\nso stupid when we were 16 that he was like we wanted out of gas we got to turn\n\n01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:42.780\noff the radio well depends on what songs playing all right so ride share\n\n01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.460\noperators within the sound of our voice when we're in desert cities where it\n\n01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.620\ngets to 120 degrees Fahrenheit like we need to have this conversation among the\n\n01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:57.500\nmany things that they're unfair to drivers they're 10% of their overhead as\n\n01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.700\nopposed to someone in Minnesota is like it's an important thing and we're\n\n01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:07.380\nfeeling at first here having the conversation and I'm sure it'll be fixed\n\n01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:14.140\nby next week yeah but 10% so fucking lot so never I would have always assumed\n\n01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.500\nwhen I heard my parents talking about like oh we're gonna get you know don't\n\n01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.900\ndon't turn up there I was in my head I was always like yeah and we should always\n\n01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.700\neat generic peanut butter because a hospital bills like I was like I bet\n\n01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:35.140\nthis doesn't add up to anything 10% a lot there's also this thing where people\n\n01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.460\nwho are doing the share sort of in the share movement are compromising\n\n01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:44.620\nthemselves so when you hear somebody ask for them to compromise themselves a\n\n01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:50.900\nlittle bit more it kind of sparks a nerve well at the same time if you're\n\n01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.260\ngonna do the job you should probably have a cool cabin I get that but I also\n\n01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.540\nget the like we can't ask these slaves to fire burgers well to be clear we we\n\n01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.100\nshould definitely ask for it to be cold we should want it to be cold but while\n\n01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.860\ndoing that just understand why it is the way it is I mean all the feelings are\n\n01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:15.700\ncompletely great yes good this is good let's roll the clip that's great yeah\n\n01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.820\nbut should we shut you do a clip of us having this exact conversation a year\n\n01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:27.140\nago what we haven't solved it oh my god I mean part of the reason they have the\n\n01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:31.220\nconversation is because maybe a ride service would say hey we're adding a\n\n01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:38.700\nbutton that for three dollars extra for 10% of the thing you the driver will\n\n01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:43.860\nreceive an alert that says please cool down your cabin as you roll up oh if I\n\n01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.060\nwas a driver I would never pick that person up I would be like that guy's an\n\n01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:52.420\nasshole you're telling me ahead of time like I get a certain way so come\n\n01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.500\ncorrect when you come to me I'd be like bye come correct that must be nice I like\n\n01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.380\nthat you'd be that picky but like if people really wanted it that badly if\n\n01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.020\nyou live in Arizona and every time you take a ride share service your big\n\n01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.260\nfucking problem is that unlike a cab which runs on a medallion service you\n\n01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.900\nclimb in and it's fucking overhead paid by the corrupt you know medallion\n\n01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:18.860\ncabbies do this too it's cool as hell and then every time a lift comes it's\n\n01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.900\nlike hot and you have to have the conversation like if I don't know what\n\n01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.380\nthe statistics are the next thing Kevin Dane needs to come down is go like\n\n01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:30.020\nhere's how many people have a problem with like being I've always noticed it\n\n01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.740\nI've always noticed that conversation I've always found it like kind of like\n\n01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:40.900\ncrazy and absurd I find it way less absurd and like the 10% of anything is\n\n01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:47.580\nlike huge so now that can reduce my outrage by at least 10% if not 90\n\n01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.780\nbecause if I get in I'm like it's hot it feels like empathy for the poor like\n\n01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:58.820\nlike like like like like now I can now I can fucking use that heat to make me\n\n01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:06.220\nstronger as a liberal great now I have everything plus I have a Tesla so yeah\n\n01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:11.380\nI don't unless I'm super drunk I don't need your hot-ass car I learned about\n\n01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.740\nthis from cabs I got like four cabs in a row and that's what they were doing and\n\n01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.540\nI was like what the fuck and then I looked it up and they're like saves a\n\n01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:22.820\nlot of money and I was like I guess if that's your job and then I never did\n\n01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:26.860\nthis did this issue I remember in the Milwaukee days like you know when we\n\n01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.820\nwould like fill up our tank

01:08:37.940\nconditioner and I was up but I always wondered like what does that mean per\n\n01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:44.180\nmile now we know ten percent hey who wants to listen to the time that

that way so I think I did it right but now\n\n01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.860\nthat I did that's why I kept rapping tonight so when I get in the car I think\n\n01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:25.940\nabout the rap this is the thing that I did that's crap to make it off balance\n\n01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:30.340\nto make it strange it's got to be strange so tomorrow is a new day a new\n\n01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:34.700\ndirection a new way I got to improve I got to change I did it too well tonight\n\n01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.860\nthat wraps my brain I got to get in the tub and wonder what I can write

this is getting nice\n\n01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:24.100\nsorry those clips are at meltdown which is now gone and yeah I think we always\n\n01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.660\nknew how special that place was and of course when it closed down we were all\n\n01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:33.620\nable to eulogize it but the thing like I always thought oh this is a good place\n\n01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:39.180\nbecause of the crowd that it draws and the simplicity all this stuff but like\n\n01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:44.580\nI like we moved out of there and tried to do this show at my stage at star burns\n\n01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:48.700\nwith an audience without an audience we tried to do the show in a in a VO booth\n\n01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:55.620\nnow we've moved here this place is great no disrespect but the crazy thing that\n\n01:33:55.620 --> 01:34:02.060\nis to realize that oh meltdown was more than actually the absence of a bunch of\n\n01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:06.380\nstuff it was actually like inimitable it was it like like I always thought of it\n\n01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:11.340\nas like oh if we could just get these pillars out of here we'd be great yeah\n\n01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.140\nbut but there was something secret about it and I don't know what it is do you\n\n01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:23.780\nthink it was as as true like natives of that place and and founding parents of\n\n01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:28.140\nit what was it I'll start you off with one thing that people said over and over\n\n01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:33.540\nagain was it simple altitude like is it just at the audience the audience and\n\n01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:37.940\nthe performer like down at the same level I think that's part of it it always\n\n01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:42.780\nfelt like a basement to me like your coolest friends like parents basement\n\n01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.660\nthat you got to hang out in and do whatever you wanted and everybody left\n\n01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:49.500\nyou alone they say low ceilings are important for comedy yeah I think they\n\n01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.580\nare ceilings are good music it just had like a it just the opposite of an Indian\n\n01:34:53.580 --> 01:35:00.420\nburial ground whatever that it's like it just yeah living air but was that\n\n01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.580\nplace a fluke was it was it was it was it was that an accidental discovery or\n\n01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:08.700\ndid someone have to stand in that space and go this would be perfect for\n\n01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:13.700\nperformance I think Gaston the owner of meltdown comics always wanted it to be a\n\n01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:18.140\nperformance space but I think he wasn't ever gonna put in time to like he didn't\n\n01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.580\nhe didn't have the ability to put in time to like make it one so that was kind\n\n01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:25.540\nof it was kind of loosely like random shows were there and then that yeah and\n\n01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.300\nthen we started doing meltdown there and then I got hired to like do all the\n\n01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:33.740\nother shows there which is how which is how Harmontown because I was like I need\n\n01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.860\nshow so bad and there was nothing happening but it just always felt\n\n01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:41.300\nmagical yeah it's like you know you say all those things about the high ceilings\n\n01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:45.260\nand the that it was a pretty small space whatever it is whatever the physical\n\n01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:50.020\ndimensions of a great comedy theater are it had that but it also had I don't know\n\n01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.020\nthe fact that you have to go through a comic book store to get there there was\n\n01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:58.620\nyou know it was like as you said an Indian living air about that place there\n\n01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.700\nwas something magical about it you know I understood the cut that's what that's\n\n01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:06.740\nthe thing is that I understood the comic going through I understood the factual\n\n01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.620\ninformation oh it's hip yeah it's the new Largo it's it's it's LA it's\n\n01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:18.100\nunderground it's but like understanding that as a as a matter of\n\n01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:22.540\nfashion which makes it like actually artificial where you go like oh the\n\n01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:28.660\nreason this is successful is actually because of mass hysteria is actually a\n\n01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:34.980\ndisservice because that room is inimitable like we sit here in this\n\n01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:38.380\nroom for instance we like try to like we're like god damn it now that we're\n\n01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:42.620\nin a different room how do we get that fucking meltdown sound and it's crazy like\n\n01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:47.940\nif I were gonna record an album whatever that is anymore I would I would be\n\n01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:52.100\nlike can we buy the melt meltdown spit like like because what is it it's\n\n01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:56.380\nmysterious yeah there's also a whole community around it I mean we would see\n\n01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:59.140\npeople come to our show and then they would become friends and people like\n\n01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:04.260\nmet there and got engaged and married and divorced and you know it was on to work\n\n01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:08.340\nhere and when I don't like if you guys got married after tonight you'd be\n\n01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:15.820\nmonsters like why did you marry we were sitting next to each other in a fucking\n\n01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.220\nauditorium downtown it'd be like you monster you deserved this divorce I'm\n\n01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:26.220\nkidding I'm kidding your audience has always been the most special of all the\n\n01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:32.100\naudiences I will say that meltdown ever had the most like literally people saying\n\n01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:36.060\nbringing in their own chairs because I told a guy once will you pay the money\n\n01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:40.580\nfor the chair like jokingly and he brought his own chair to be like now I\n\n01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:45.540\nget it free yeah I didn't guess who that was and I had no choice but to be like\n\n01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:51.380\nyou have bested me please come on it just does it rhyme with Thratom Flaw\n\n01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:59.660\nFloodberg 100% yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I didn't I mean sorry sorry I\n\n01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:03.300\nknew our audience is special but I always thought that that place was so\n\n01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:08.820\nspecial and I will we'll be

people\n\n01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:05.820\nthink we know what we're doing oh my god the best part very scary yeah mostly is\n\n01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:11.300\nthat is that like it's because the obviously the agents like are able to now\n\n01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:15.620\nit's like they're able to get people are able to say can I meet with them and the\n\n01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:18.740\nanswer is yes and like you get to they have these meetings that you never\n\n01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:24.540\nthought you'd have and so it's all it's it's mostly positive right yeah well the\n\n01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.220\ngreatest thing really is the thing that we've wanted to do for years and years\n\n01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:33.740\nand years we for a little brief window right now we're in a position where we\n\n01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:39.540\ncan do them right can go away very quickly yeah yeah like if I if like my\n\n01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:43.220\nnext the next movie I mean if it comes out it doesn't do well it could go away\n\n01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:48.540\nright then you see it all the time so so we're trying to we're very aware of\n\n01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:53.500\nthat it's a little bit so yeah that was that raise your anxiety which is a\n\n01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.820\nterrible thing to happen to you that wouldn't have been the case before you\n\n01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.700\nhit the moon with us now it's like the expectations are high I mean I'm sure\n\n01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:05.660\nyou're aware of this we're like and so everybody keeps telling us don't write\n\n01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.020\nyour second thing right your third thing right like don't well first of all I've\n\n01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:13.820\nactually never heard that and that like that's fucking it's great right that\n\n01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:19.460\nsounds awful and accurate yeah horrifying yeah that sounds awful because\n\n01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:21.940\nthere's so much pressure on you to like recreate what does that mean I don't\n\n01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.660\nquite understand it mean skip the second thing just because you put so much\n\n01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:27.660\npressure on yourself for what were you gonna write oh my god what will you\n\n01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:30.580\nguys be doing next they're like skip it just go to the next we would literally\n\n01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.460\nbe doing press but everyone else knows this is your second thing yeah it's not\n\n01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:39.300\nas good yeah we would be doing press this idea that there would be pressure on\n\n01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.860\nyou that you would go say you loved poodles and you're like and then you\n\n01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:48.740\nmade the big sick and like the big sick made everybody like J. J. Abrams wants\n\n01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:53.580\nto meet with you and then you're like do we pitch him the poodle movie or do we\n\n01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:59.180\nlike pitch him a fucking Star Trek poodle thing or like like you have an\n\n01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:03.660\nanxiety that didn't exist when you were just like I'll fucking do anything I\n\n01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.940\nwant there's a fear when you actually get the freedom to do whatever you want\n\n01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:11.340\nof like oh shit now I have to do whatever now I have to bet right yeah now\n\n01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:15.940\nI have or the house went yes exactly that's exactly right we've done a good\n\n01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:21.500\njob of only doing what we so that what we want to do has not changed and where\n\n01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:27.700\nwe've been able to do that we haven't like what do you say that we like before\n\n01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.980\nour movie that we were like we want to make stuff like sure yeah yeah is the\n\n01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.020\nkind of stuff that we're both doing individually and together so it's like\n\n01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:37.020\nthat part's good but then it's also like when you get the freedom to do\n\n01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.860\nwhatever there's like a certain terror in the freedom to do whatever here's my\n\n01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:46.180\nmost sensitive crazy question because I don't even I've like you guys are life\n\n01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:51.500\npartners and writing partners what does that do to a relationship like like to\n\n01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:55.060\nbe under like I've never makes you take all your clothes off when you take a\n\n01:43:55.060 --> 01:44:00.100\nshit yeah and I put all of his clothes on when I take a shit so that's what's\n\n01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:04.220\nchanged you guys have been very candid so I would just have like have you had\n\n01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:11.140\nfights that have like been brought on by monstrous fights absolutely yeah you\n\n01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:14.620\ndon't have to share them because I think that's too yes well we live in two\n\n01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:20.100\ngossipy a world so it's not gossipy so we have had fights because the thing is\n\n01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.940\nif you if you have a fight with a co-worker there's a ceiling to where\n\n01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:25.900\nthat fight can go yep but if you're having a fight with a co-worker who's\n\n01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.740\nalso the person you're in love with the ceiling is much higher so you can start\n\n01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.900\non a lower really the basement's much lower yeah starting on like hey I\n\n01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:40.660\ndisagree it should be like this with a co-worker you're like it can't really\n\n01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:45.980\nget as personal as it can with this so you we really had to have rules we had to\n\n01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:50.020\nfigure out how to be able to write together I think if you shared a couple\n\n01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:54.300\nof those would be valuable first of all to me I have a I have a girlfriend who's\n\n01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:00.300\na writer like we get we get by okay it's fucking hot it's it's a challenge to\n\n01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:05.500\nlike approach the area yeah because and we're not partners we don't work on\n\n01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:09.300\nstuff together so like if you guys figured out how to not kill each other we\n\n01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:13.260\njust have like a couple rules of like you can't you have to find the specific\n\n01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:16.380\nwe literally booked time to work with each other rather than just assuming that\n\n01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.100\nthe other person's available I think that's a big one you have to have those\n\n01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:23.340\nlines otherwise just hanging out at home can be worse so if that so to be clear\n\n01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:27.940\nabout that if you guys are like hey as lovers let's go stay at this hotel and\n\n01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:32.340\nhave a pina colada's if kumail's like mmm that's a good pina colada I think the\n\n01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.380\nprotagonist should think it's like knock it off my face yeah okay literally in\n\n01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:42.540\nthe shower before you came here you're like can I ask you a word question no hey\n\n01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:47.820\nI'm in here taking a shit I'm not showering I can understand your confusion\n\n01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:59.100\nI'm naked well we have we have specific work times and then as you said if we're\n\n01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.660\nlike just hanging out we have to get the other person's probably like if she\n\n01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.220\nthinks of something for the movie or whatever we're working on she has to be\n\n01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:09.660\nlike hey can we switch gears so you and the other person has to give you\n\n01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:14.100\npermission and that makes a huge difference give us is there a safe word\n\n01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:23.300\nfor to get to get out look fucking too much yeah ruining the honeymoon yeah\n\n01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:26.620\nand don't do it in bed no talking about work stuff in bed that's a big one yeah\n\n01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:32.740\nand yeah and we also don't like the way we write together is when we like when\n\n01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:35.300\nwe're like breaking a story or something we're together but then we don't\n\n01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:41.340\nactually write in the same room that would destroy those drafts back and\n\n01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:46.500\nforth and but you know it's really it's great like so we're like working on\n\n01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:49.860\nsomething right now together and it's like really exciting because we'll like\n\n01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.700\ntalk about it and then later in the day I'm like I always thought of that one\n\n01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.780\nthing I don't think anybody in the world but her could have thought of that and\n\n01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:00.860\nit's really exciting and it's also like she'll write something and I'll be the\n\n01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:05.060\nfirst person in the world to read it and that's very exciting it's like I get to\n\n01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:18.260\nlook inside her brain so to the positive I feel the same way about you and I\n\n01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.580\nthink that's part of it is starting with that respect of like oh I really like\n\n01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:25.460\nwhat he does and what a cool thing that I get to have access to it before\n\n01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:28.460\nanybody else and you have to kind of start on that foot of like I'm a big\n\n01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:32.060\nfan of this person because if not if you're coming at it from like a how can\n\n01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:36.180\nI fix what they've done then you're already losing right yeah I mean I'm\n\n01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:43.460\nnever gonna find love well you don't have to start there you don't have to\n\n01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:49.540\nstart here you can you can you can just be at right aid and be like she shares\n\n01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:54.180\nmy interest in these knit socks the best boyfriend I've thought about this I\n\n01:47:54.180 --> 01:48:02.660\nthought you were the best boyfriend did you think about it in the bathroom can't\n\n01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:12.300\nyou see it in her drafts yeah why is everyone named Steve Agee I think that's\n\n01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.540\namazing I don't want to lose that if only for myself just that idea because the\n\n01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.140\nit's like you know how magnets like they have fields so like they can propel\n\n01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.220\neach other as easily as they can like they can like magnets are out of fucking\n\n01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:28.100\ncontrol they get in the presence of each other and they do shit beyond your\n\n01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:35.700\ncontrol I'm not being insane clown posse I I also don't understand magnets but\n\n01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:42.180\nI'm not pretending I do but I but it's like because Cody and I aren't writing\n\n01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:47.100\npartners we don't write together but she's the first writer I've ever been\n\n01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:53.660\nwith and like when the truth is like for her to say hey would you read my script\n\n01:48:53.660 --> 01:49:01.740\nlike it it's it sends fucking spasms of panic through me really yes because what\n\n01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:05.260\nyou guys have achieved is you're like oh I'm a big fan and all this stuff will\n\n01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:10.780\nyou you've you've worked together and other stuff and it's like I'm like I\n\n01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:15.580\nthink there's like things like I freak out because I'm like what if I fuck up\n\n01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:19.500\nwhat if I what if you fuck up while reading her stuff well what if what if\n\n01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:23.620\nwhat if anything about this perfect stasis you're like what if I don't like\n\n01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:29.500\nit it's like you guys are to put it in Star Wars terms you like what you guys\n\n01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:36.820\nare kind of describing to me is like hey we're we're Luke and Han and I'm like\n\n01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:42.700\nbut people change roles and then I'm like like what but if you if you if you\n\n01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:46.700\nsee a writer from across a bar and then you're like you start talking and then\n\n01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:49.100\nyou start dating and then you hook up and you're in a relationship with a\n\n01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:54.500\nwriter it's like you're Han and Han and like you're who's gonna shoot first like\n\n01:49:54.500 --> 01:50:01.140\nlike like like like like like like on you never you don't you don't want to\n\n01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:06.580\nfuck with that like you know baby oh she just wants another drink\n\n01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.300\nCody hello everybody\n\n01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:17.820\nCody have a seat I'm really just feeling came out here to remind you to shut\n\n01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:21.860\nthe fuck up listening from back there\n\n01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:32.540\nbut yeah I mean it is work I'm not saying that this the way that we work\n\n01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:37.740\ntogether is it's still work you have to sort of figure out and there's still\n\n01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:43.580\nbumps and we both think we're alpha still yeah that's not like that doesn't go\n\n01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:46.500\naway you just have to kind of like realize like oh maybe sometimes there's\n\n01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:50.660\ntwo alphas are too bad it's like yeah it doesn't go away I have achieved that I\n\n01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:57.540\nhave that with Rob a little bit like like like when we write together like like\n\n01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:01.500\nRob and I have written stuff together for 20 years and then like Justin who\n\n01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.620\ndid Rick and Morty like you for you find partnerships with people where you're\n\n01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:15.180\nlike okay this works and it doesn't always work but when you think about the\n\n01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:21.100\nmath of it like the the everybody in this room might look oh I get together on\n\n01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:24.100\nWednesdays and I write with my friend and we're trying to write a screenplay\n\n01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:27.980\ntogether and they're my writing partner take the difficulty the challenge of\n\n01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:35.260\nthat relationship multiplied times oh unrelated to anything that I do like oh\n\n01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.820\nI'm dating this person I'm trying to make that work and then you multiply those\n\n01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:44.940\ntwo things that's why I'm like what how are you guys well we were not in that we\n\n01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.740\nwere able to work together and not write together because writing is a sort of a\n\n01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.660\nvery personal thing very vulnerable yeah very vulnerable thing so we sort of you\n\n01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:57.780\nknow with meltdown I was performing and she was producing the show and then we\n\n01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:03.740\nhosted a podcast together so we slowly worked up to figuring out how to write\n\n01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:06.860\ntogether because that is you guys had a precedent of not punishing each other\n\n01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:12.940\nfor vulnerability things like that like I think that's important as a mental\n\n01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:18.540\nhealth professional maybe not to go I don't think that hurts no if you're\n\n01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:24.740\ngonna write with a lover find a shrink maybe it's the lesson no all right well\n\n01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.980\nthank you for answering that stuff frankly well the other thing that's great\n\n01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:33.340\nis that we do we're very similar and the things we like I think for different\n\n01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.140\nreasons and so we're able to write together because we have the same\n\n01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:43.420\naesthetic the same taste but we sort of focus on different things of it so we\n\n01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.980\nkind of have different strengths that work well one of you the better dialogue\n\n01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:51.700\nor story person or is it like are you kind of both equally strong there like\n\n01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:55.060\nyou guys kind of share roles well Emily's very good at character stuff\n\n01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:59.660\nbecause she's a therapist and tell them about your thing about how you sort of\n\n01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:03.740\nwell when you're like theorizing someone you're you're you're you're telling\n\n01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:06.380\nabout how you accidentally caught that murderer while we were writing that\n\n01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:13.260\nNash Bridges spec and he's also very good at that too like and yeah we both\n\n01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:16.460\nhave we're both kind of good at the same stuff I would say we don't need to like\n\n01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:21.220\nget ready yeah we're both good at the same
