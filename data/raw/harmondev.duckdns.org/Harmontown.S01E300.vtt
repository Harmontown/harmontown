WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.060
What's up Dumbledore flim flammers how you doing tonight as you can see we got

00:22.060 --> 00:25.820
a lot of a lot of chairs up here because we got a whole lot of show you

00:25.820 --> 00:30.480
excited for number 300 everybody

00:42.200 --> 00:48.560
we should get everybody up on stage and do the Spencer dance all right the

00:48.560 --> 00:54.760
dynasty typewriter at the Hayworth in beautiful MacArthur Park Los Angeles the

00:54.760 --> 00:59.580
three hundredth Harmontown is now in session

01:04.020 --> 01:08.100
Spencer Crittenden everybody

01:08.100 --> 01:24.620
let's have Spencer why do we have bells we know about this to buzz in all

01:24.620 --> 01:33.360
right you got more candles more candles I got subtle accessories speaking of

01:33.360 --> 01:37.820
accessories let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown mr. Dan Harmon

01:52.560 --> 01:58.220
things are being knocked off let's bring it back from there we don't want

01:58.220 --> 02:03.780
to do that till like the end of the concert if anything I mean isn't it

02:03.780 --> 02:08.420
ironic that you I tried to telegraph to you for a teachable moment it's it's an

02:08.420 --> 02:12.660
act of cowardice to kick over a chair that you've tripped over it would have

02:12.660 --> 02:17.780
been brave for me to say I tripped over a chair that would have been the the

02:17.780 --> 02:23.260
machismo move but I did what a rock and roller sometimes does cornered by their

02:23.260 --> 02:33.380
own glory I was like yeah I meant to I hate chairs oh boy I threw it on the

02:33.380 --> 02:43.940
ground speaking of irony paradoxes is the plural of paradox paradoxes what

02:43.940 --> 02:52.620
is it paradoxes okay welcome to the 300th episode of a thing that we never

02:52.620 --> 02:56.820
planned and we knew and you would be the only person that has been for all 300 I

02:56.820 --> 03:01.140
would say that's probably inaccurate yeah I never really thought about that I'm

03:01.140 --> 03:05.580
sure I miss 50 or so yeah even Carson could like not show up for a couple but

03:05.580 --> 03:09.340
like it wasn't called Carson town you have no Joan Rivers but it was called

03:09.340 --> 03:13.500
the late show with Johnny Carson so and he did but but you know what I can't

03:13.500 --> 03:19.100
either maybe I just can't fill these shoes can't do it the subscribers would

03:19.100 --> 03:28.140
revolt yeah we still have some some shoes subscribers oh yeah yeah I'm sure we

03:28.140 --> 03:37.500
do I thank you for those of you who are newcomers those of you have been here

03:37.500 --> 03:42.660
with us and followed us through all our venues what a I guess tonight's gonna be

03:42.660 --> 03:49.460
a night of probably remembrance unavoidably one of the what one of the

03:49.460 --> 03:52.620
weird ironies of the show is that we probably do a little too much recapping

03:52.620 --> 03:55.540
anyway by accident because we're like middle-aged alcoholics that are

03:55.540 --> 04:00.500
casually repeating ourselves like let's do a clip show you guys did that last

04:00.500 --> 04:05.260
week you do you mean you retell that story about we definitely complained

04:05.260 --> 04:09.300
about just listening to podcasts last week

04:09.300 --> 04:14.300
Schrab made a big deal about that being a bad thing to do right and we do

04:14.300 --> 04:18.020
actually for his enjoyment we have some clips of our own show tonight to play

04:18.020 --> 04:23.300
for him he'll love it yeah he probably won't disrupt it at all

04:23.300 --> 04:28.300
oh we've got we I didn't want to go overboard with the guests you know I did

04:28.300 --> 04:31.820
like like what do you you know we go let's get Doug Henning out here that was

04:31.820 --> 04:38.580
a magician yeah whatever it was like I think I think I think probably under

04:38.580 --> 04:42.740
200th or our 100th we've probably had the same like I'm always like we'll get

04:42.740 --> 04:49.060
us our our progenitor the person without whom we we wouldn't have I wouldn't

04:49.060 --> 04:54.380
have started doing the podcast and we'll we'll bring her and her her husband

04:54.380 --> 04:57.460
kind of comes along with her wherever she goes it's kind of a tag along we'll

04:57.460 --> 05:01.620
bring her out in a second but I first wanted to before she comes out I wanted

05:01.620 --> 05:06.580
to keep it classy and talk to you about the fact that I'm shitting my brains out

05:06.580 --> 05:14.220
right now yeah I I I right now something well something is happening to me

05:14.220 --> 05:22.900
classy something beautiful it's like I think I might be dying only because I'm

05:22.900 --> 05:29.580
experiencing for the first time in my life just pure diarrhea without any other

05:29.580 --> 05:35.180
symptoms so it's like like you just say listen to your ass is just a faucet like

05:35.180 --> 05:40.140
I don't have a fever I don't have I don't I don't have a tummy ache even I

05:40.140 --> 05:45.020
just have like a like I'll eat a cracker and my body will go you want to turn

05:45.020 --> 05:50.940
that into four ounces of water and then the irony is I drink anything I'm even

05:50.940 --> 05:54.180
testing the theory I can drink anything I'm drinking a course light right now

05:54.180 --> 05:58.660
like I like it doesn't do anything with that but there's pizza backstage and I

05:58.660 --> 06:02.620
was like I know I can't nibble that or it or my body will go into this juicer

06:02.620 --> 06:08.460
mode I have no idea what's happening has been happening all weekend and then it

06:08.460 --> 06:15.180
was I'm surviving on a modium and what's up you know what it means you're

06:15.180 --> 06:25.740
in love that's more plausible than Dave Kline's theory which is that my body is

06:25.740 --> 06:36.180
shitting out all its fat and like Dave okay it's possible to do that why I don't

06:36.180 --> 06:40.420
gazelle do that while they're running from a tiger I adore Dave Kline Dave

06:40.420 --> 06:45.180
he's sitting right near me I think last week we proved that he has no actual

06:45.180 --> 06:49.940
qualifications as a trainer that's that sounds that sounds pejorative a bunch of

06:49.940 --> 06:55.620
drug addicts came on stage and you were the most fit person on the whole well

06:55.620 --> 06:58.860
that sounds like a qualification right there he's getting the job done and I

06:58.860 --> 07:02.380
would never work with whatever you think in your head is a legitimate trainer

07:02.380 --> 07:06.740
fuck that guy I wouldn't work with him so like I'm working with the only guy

07:06.740 --> 07:12.420
that I would ever be this long into working out and still show up every

07:12.420 --> 07:18.100
every time like I would I would have bailed so long ago on like any kind of

07:18.100 --> 07:24.540
like I don't want to say real because it makes you sound unreal I although

07:24.540 --> 07:30.060
sometimes I believe that I'm the only one that could see you but like but I

07:30.060 --> 07:34.780
there's absolutely no way there's no way I would ever do a fucking like the

07:34.780 --> 07:40.300
fucking trainer that's like supposedly like the real thing I had to go with Dave

07:40.300 --> 07:44.660
Klein all right anyways and I'm gonna live like five years longer at least

07:44.660 --> 07:49.540
because of it unless I shit out my soul tonight I don't know if I did I run over

07:49.540 --> 07:55.180
a gypsy baby yeah you don't remember that oh don't do that don't do that that

07:55.180 --> 07:59.300
I'll give you the diaries right away yeah it's just I think what Spencer and I

07:59.300 --> 08:03.700
our theory is just so you don't panic at home tonight my theory is his butt

08:03.700 --> 08:11.620
thinks it's his dick he keeps peeing out his butt you sorry what was our theory

08:11.620 --> 08:18.020
you've made up that theory you're trying to appeal to a demographic which

08:18.020 --> 08:24.700
demographic would that be our theory was that because I've been eating on these

08:24.700 --> 08:29.060
protein bars like I got these oh yeah I just like these peanut butter protein

08:29.060 --> 08:33.340
bars and I think there's like there's so my body has taken in so much like fake

08:33.340 --> 08:39.380
alcohol-based sugar like substitute that it finally got to a typical part of

08:39.380 --> 08:43.700
our bodies like so we live on the moon now like like like so you're just gonna

08:43.700 --> 08:49.060
shit in a funnel right like like maybe I'll help you propel like like like I

08:49.060 --> 08:52.500
think I think I think your body like if you starve it your body goes into

08:52.500 --> 08:56.300
ketosis if you you know your body reacts to certain things it's taking in your

08:56.300 --> 09:00.540
body goes okay so we're obviously being hunted right now so here's how I'll

09:00.540 --> 09:05.580
react right and when you're on the moon if you I think if you eat enough of

09:05.580 --> 09:09.260
this like synthetic like protein bar your body eventually goes so we're

09:09.260 --> 09:13.940
moon rakers like like let's just poop liquid I don't know I thought you guys

09:13.940 --> 09:18.540
would enjoy that theory but like but I don't want to you know look part of our

09:18.540 --> 09:23.420
300th episode is gonna be a recalibration of our social contract I'm sorry if

09:23.420 --> 09:27.260
sometimes I let you know after you don't react to something that you should have

09:27.260 --> 09:31.980
reacted to it I never mean to do that to you you know Tolstoy towards the end of

09:31.980 --> 09:36.940
his life he kept a diary and towards the end of his life a lot of his entry is

09:36.940 --> 09:41.140
just about pooping right so you're turning into Tolstoy so you're in good

09:41.140 --> 09:45.820
literary company right I'm not gonna connect the dots between diary and

09:45.820 --> 09:50.900
diarrhea I'm not gonna do it cuz I'm like a craftsman like I don't I don't just

09:50.900 --> 09:56.380
connect whatever dots there yeah that would be dumb yeah I don't think there's

09:56.380 --> 10:03.580
anything else before we start bringing out friends and just looking back oh

10:03.580 --> 10:10.140
here's a boy if you didn't like the last thing I thought you'd laugh at you'll

10:10.140 --> 10:21.220
love not laughing at this here we go the ultimate paradox I thought as I was

10:21.220 --> 10:26.260
getting dressed this morning the more slimming your shirt color the more

10:26.260 --> 10:29.220
dandruff enhancing

10:29.220 --> 10:34.780
she's like driving to work I'm like Jesus fucking dog hair and dandruff I'm

10:34.780 --> 10:38.940
like why do you why do you have so many black shirts oh cuz you don't want to

10:38.940 --> 10:44.300
look like you're fat you're trying to like be like the Venom suit and like you

10:44.300 --> 10:48.100
you've fallen for that theory that if there's no color that you could like

10:48.100 --> 10:54.220
that people won't see your body you'll be a shadow is it means I like I like

10:54.220 --> 10:56.580
what's going on with your hair and your beard right now like I like I like the

10:56.580 --> 11:00.300
whole design right now I put a little shampoo this morning and I so you got to

11:00.300 --> 11:04.500
give it a couple days to oil back down but you but you but you you crossed over

11:04.500 --> 11:08.500
recently into being almost completely gray-haired but the use like that happened

11:08.500 --> 11:12.980
pretty fast for me or maybe I just haven't seen you that much yeah I like it

11:12.980 --> 11:16.940
you look great that's you look like that like you look like one of the

11:16.940 --> 11:30.820
captains of like the deadliest catch yeah the deadliest catch of all life

11:32.220 --> 11:38.940
you know that crab trap comes up oh it's full of death it's full of it's full

11:38.940 --> 11:44.180
of sands of time 300 miles off the bearing to see I can't remember what

11:44.180 --> 11:48.300
the fuck all right and it's actually sponsored by Coors light so you're

11:48.300 --> 11:51.700
fricking right in it right now you got well let's roll into our other

11:51.700 --> 11:57.660
unofficial sponsor some of our illustrious alumnus yeah yeah honestly for

11:57.660 --> 12:03.500
real like like I never I never would have the podcast thing I never would have

12:03.500 --> 12:08.100
done it she said one night at the roost you should do a podcast and then I kind

12:08.100 --> 12:12.580
of resisted it for a while and did a show at nerd melt and and then started

12:12.580 --> 12:20.860
doing it and and she's also the reason why your favorite person in the world

12:20.860 --> 12:27.860
that you miss so much all the time is what used to be on the show before he

12:27.860 --> 12:33.300
became so valuable to you that he had to go away and serve you from a different

12:33.300 --> 12:44.300
tier of reality let's let's what what a charming intro I just want the audience

12:44.300 --> 12:51.980
to know we're I don't hate him I hate the audience for loving him okay so you

12:51.980 --> 12:56.580
okay so you hate one person now you hate 100 people we all know if you watch

12:56.580 --> 13:01.380
this show or if you've ever been to the reddit that the dog whistle for I hate

13:01.380 --> 13:07.020
Harmontown is I miss Kumail like let's bring out come on John and Emily Gordon

13:07.020 --> 13:34.100
everybody

13:34.100 --> 13:38.980
Kumail did you hear that Dan hates you yeah no I heard he knew I think you

13:38.980 --> 13:44.180
resents you it's different he resents is a compliment hates you is like fuck

13:44.180 --> 13:50.660
this guy resents is like Lucifer talking about God Wow Wow that's crazy you

13:50.660 --> 13:55.060
really that's like the highest form of flattery I resent him

13:55.060 --> 14:00.900
why the audience misses him that's a that's a fucking come on that's good

14:00.900 --> 14:05.100
no I'm in I'm into it he doesn't like it quite a bit yeah I'm changing

14:05.100 --> 14:08.660
microphones that one has a dent in it and I feel like I'm better than that

14:08.660 --> 14:13.500
now old Kumail would have kept that microphone I'm not gonna have a fucking

14:13.500 --> 14:19.020
dented microphone I'm God yeah well good luck with that

14:19.020 --> 14:33.020
conehead do either of you guys we've really gotten into

14:33.020 --> 14:36.940
unrelatable comedy now where we just talk about the lumpiness of the

14:36.940 --> 14:40.860
microphones we're talking about don't do relatable because I tried to I was

14:40.860 --> 14:44.940
trying to make them laugh by doing the meme of like I miss Kumail and it just

14:44.940 --> 14:50.460
I guess people like think that these guys are on the reddit yeah I guess maybe

14:50.460 --> 14:54.420
they were I used to be on the reddit oh that no don't be that Emily are you

14:54.420 --> 14:58.140
proud or are you ashamed of what you've created over 300 episodes

14:58.140 --> 15:04.500
both is both an option always I mean what a crazy thing happy 300 episodes thank

15:04.500 --> 15:15.420
you thank you amazing thing and the show you started out doing was we're all

15:15.420 --> 15:20.180
gonna go to the moon right how will we survive there right and every week

15:20.180 --> 15:25.780
explored that topic right that was the original conceit right look at like

15:25.780 --> 15:34.900
that's where we started yeah and now it's 300 episodes later and Trump is

15:34.900 --> 15:42.540
going to the moon and I don't want to dig a hole and hide and die which that

15:42.540 --> 15:47.700
is easier than going to the moon yeah I like I listen I don't want to be the

15:47.700 --> 15:53.380
odd one out but I I like Spencer's theory that your butt has become a dick it

15:53.380 --> 15:58.220
just thinks it's a dick out of your penis because then we can be sure that

15:58.220 --> 16:06.500
sounds oddly like satisfying like I know I genuinely said I'll never poop out

16:06.500 --> 16:09.660
my penis well because I never know what that feels like aren't you picturing

16:09.660 --> 16:16.820
like a like like what's it the soft sir the car max or what's the thing like

16:16.820 --> 16:21.820
the car max the lip the lip balm like it's got the little tiny hole and then it

16:21.820 --> 16:26.980
has like that really satisfying narrow like like the worm that comes out like

16:26.980 --> 16:30.900
it's like really consistent and like you can like write with it if you were a

16:30.900 --> 16:35.340
chef like I just I mean obviously you wouldn't need to wipe you just got a

16:35.340 --> 16:43.540
q-tip and you're good to go car max would you have to squat for that or you

16:43.540 --> 16:49.500
think you could do it standing oh you could do it standing these are questions

16:49.500 --> 16:54.540
I can't answer speaking to Dan Dan Pupens there's something that you said

16:54.540 --> 16:58.860
like sometimes things stick with you like when I'm shaving I remember comments

16:58.860 --> 17:01.900
about shaving because it's a kind of a quiet moment or I'm washing my hair I'll

17:01.900 --> 17:07.140
remember a line or a joke about washing air but you have haunted me with the

17:07.140 --> 17:13.340
thing that you said that you can never wipe enough it's never done because

17:13.340 --> 17:23.020
my my butt is like an endless can of shoe polish that is stuck with me and it

17:23.020 --> 17:27.980
will stay with me until I have Alzheimer's well then someone sent me that

17:27.980 --> 17:31.820
meme that was like I got from Parks and Rec like Chris Pratt the thing where he's

17:31.820 --> 17:36.460
like it's like it's like wiping a magic marker it felt so so much seen you felt

17:36.460 --> 17:43.940
seen yes like thank you and he and he was like thank you you stole that and I

17:43.940 --> 17:47.620
was like no you probably still I don't who knows who stole what I mean what when

17:47.620 --> 17:54.620
I wipe my ass it never stops great great minds think alike great asses wipe

17:54.620 --> 17:59.740
alike speaking speaking of great minds we've had some wonderful ones on this

17:59.740 --> 18:03.940
show I thought that's what Jeff was doing I

18:03.940 --> 18:08.580
thought he was setting up a clip and you know we could we have a bunch of clips

18:08.580 --> 18:10.940
right now that we can play up in the screen and you'll be able to hear them

18:10.940 --> 18:22.060
if you're an audio listener as opposed to a video listener haha burn yeah let's

18:22.060 --> 18:24.820
just test it I just want to try to see how it goes

18:24.820 --> 18:29.660
computers on and the sound down for this next one here's a here's a little

18:29.660 --> 18:37.220
clip of our friend of the podcast Rob Schrab wondering about space

18:37.220 --> 18:41.060
exploration why don't we ever go down that's not

18:41.060 --> 18:59.340
strong and that was that why don't we go down that's weird because really watch

18:59.340 --> 19:06.580
their mouths moving that clip was longer than I remember yeah alright well we've

19:06.580 --> 19:12.580
been keep we've here's something I've always wanted to know how come when we

19:12.580 --> 19:21.220
when we when we go into space how come we've never gone down we're always going

19:21.220 --> 19:28.780
to the moon I was going there always sending stuff out how come we don't go

19:28.780 --> 19:44.940
down in the earth somebody what into the center of the earth no no no why don't

19:44.940 --> 19:50.660
we ever go down yeah because when you make it go up we always go why do we

19:50.660 --> 19:54.420
always go why do we always go well we're gonna go to we're gonna go to we're

19:54.420 --> 19:57.860
gonna go to the moon and we're gonna go to Mars and then maybe we'll go out this

19:57.860 --> 20:02.340
way might be right under us we could be a whole other solar system right under

20:02.340 --> 20:08.820
us we never like an apartment complex maybe a sun under the sun even in

20:08.820 --> 20:14.420
section it's like everybody you see some a rocket takes off it just goes left it

20:14.420 --> 20:20.420
doesn't go we never go down you know and I think this is why the South Pole needs

20:20.420 --> 20:25.260
a like like a rocket they teach you when you when you're making those let those

20:25.260 --> 20:29.580
little like mobiles of the solar system is just a flat thing yeah why don't they

20:29.580 --> 20:35.780
ever go down because then then you'd hit a baby but the that's because it's

20:35.780 --> 20:41.140
based on a mobile mobile mobile oh shit we're we're

20:41.140 --> 20:56.860
that's a day let's bring out Rob Schrab everybody Rob Schrab

20:56.860 --> 21:11.060
happy is I thank you for the chair Dan yeah well we do we

21:11.060 --> 21:17.060

21:26.860 --> 21:32.180
about going down right the chairs are too high for you I'm referencing the clip

21:32.180 --> 21:37.220
we just watched haha by the way in case we play any more clips I did not want to

21:37.220 --> 21:42.260
create the false impression that any clips we play it then the person in the

21:42.260 --> 21:47.860
clip is gonna come out like that's not true at all we are absolutely tapped that's

21:47.860 --> 21:53.100
it that's the end of that right out with like no one's coming that's not we're

21:53.100 --> 21:57.180
not gonna be like here's Curtis Armstrong saying I like lost my shoe and

21:57.180 --> 22:00.180
then he's gonna come out it's just gonna be a clip of him saying he lost his shoe

22:00.180 --> 22:04.020

would be odd were you wearing a bathrobe in that clip yeah it was yes it

22:26.900 --> 22:31.060
seemed like the kind of thing a guy would talk about what was it I think it was

22:31.060 --> 22:36.820
just like Dan's like hey I'm coming to get you and I was like it was like Sunday

22:36.820 --> 22:43.620

22:55.500 --> 23:01.020
wearing bathrobes around the house yeah yeah well what do you wear I'm just

23:01.020 --> 23:04.460

23:04.460 --> 23:09.140
underwear and a t-shirt the underwear you've been wearing all day or is it a

23:09.140 --> 23:13.700
fresh pair for the night I wear it all day you wear it all day and then you go

23:13.700 --> 23:18.300
to sleep in it at night yeah why everybody does that don't you everyone

23:18.300 --> 23:24.500

23:24.500 --> 23:27.940
nighttime undies you wear the daytime Monday's unless you're gonna have we'll

23:27.940 --> 23:33.300
be doing laundry forever on Friday if we do that that is a double underwear are

23:33.300 --> 23:39.180
you crazy you can buy underwear it's so cheap and it lasts forever away like

23:39.180 --> 23:44.940
disposable underwear no I didn't say that Jesus no price all day you've been

23:44.940 --> 23:49.920
wearing underwear and then you wear that you've changed yeah he's I change

23:49.920 --> 23:55.500

23:55.500 --> 24:01.340
you will it changes your life change your socks at like 2 p.m. it's like the day

24:01.340 --> 24:04.940
just started this is also one person no this is smart I'm liking this well look

24:04.940 --> 24:15.140
this is good I change on these oh Rob's down shops doing I drop my phone maybe the chair is not a

24:15.140 --> 24:20.740
great idea yeah this is also a man who takes his shirt off when he goes to the

24:20.740 --> 24:26.180
bathroom in a large way do you take your pants off sometimes I take my pants off

24:26.180 --> 24:31.900
I leave my pants on and shit into them shirtless oh wait that's why you change

24:31.900 --> 24:38.700
your underwear before you go to bed that's right by then I've already peed in

24:38.700 --> 24:53.780
it multiple times and if I'm lucky pooped in it twice or thrice wait so did

24:53.780 --> 25:03.980
Schrab Emily did you just announce that Kumail Nanjiani great of movie fame takes

25:03.980 --> 25:08.700
his I'm not in fame takes his takes his shirt off to go poo I am a hundred percent

25:08.700 --> 25:13.420
announcing that if it's gonna be a major one I get it are you afraid are you

25:13.420 --> 25:18.100
afraid you're gonna poop on your shirt to me all of no I just want to be free I

25:18.100 --> 25:33.660
even take my wedding I even take off my wedding ring I take off my wedding ring

25:33.660 --> 25:51.820
because what we have is not part of this this is me with the wedding ring that I

25:51.820 --> 25:58.460
gave you we gave it to each other do you do you has and I'm sorry to do this but

25:58.460 --> 26:05.460
this is a question that affects me do you get mad if Camille forgets to flush

26:05.460 --> 26:12.180
like I don't forget okay okay how can you forget I'm the first clue is there's

26:12.180 --> 26:18.380
something in there this is a guy that changes outfits to go poo he's not gonna

26:18.380 --> 26:24.340
forget the no no yeah okay he goes to Narnia to poop all right oh what did I

26:24.340 --> 26:31.540
forget okay okay all right everybody just settle the fuck down all right so

26:31.540 --> 26:36.820
and I've discussed this on the show before the last five years I've been

26:36.820 --> 26:42.300
getting forgetting to flush the toilet oh it just started the last five years it

26:42.300 --> 26:49.540
just started I blame Wi-Fi I think there's something in the air that is

26:49.540 --> 26:57.100
affecting my brain oh so like the bees were getting lost yeah I read a

26:57.100 --> 27:00.340
science paper it said that bees are getting lost and then some people are

27:00.340 --> 27:03.940
forgetting to flush I think that Wi-Fi kills ghosts I think that's why we

27:03.940 --> 27:08.580
don't see ghosts anymore I think you're right because there were ghosts and then

27:08.580 --> 27:12.780
they got pulverized by all this electromagnetic radiation without bodies

27:12.780 --> 27:16.420
to protect themselves you were saying there were ghosts until the late 90s

27:16.420 --> 27:22.100
yeah absolutely there were you saw no I just know you know why I think there's

27:22.100 --> 27:28.060
no ghosts why because it's it is because of Wi-Fi but here's why I like ghosts

27:28.060 --> 27:32.500
ghosts can only walk around and they can't touch anything but think about it

27:32.500 --> 27:36.580
we're all on our phones and iPads now so ghosts are like set they're like oh I'm

27:36.580 --> 27:41.780
just gonna watch ABC news with this guy like they're ghosts are like they don't

27:41.780 --> 27:44.700
have to be poltergeist they're like what's this tea kettle doing here this

27:44.700 --> 27:47.900
isn't my watch tea kettle they're they're like Jesus Christ that's a great

27:47.900 --> 27:51.380
tweet you know they're being entertained now yeah the ghosts are like

27:51.380 --> 27:56.260
pacified because what do we know about ghosts they love petty yeah they get

27:56.260 --> 28:01.140
hooked in by petty shit otherwise they go to fucking heaven when you die

28:01.140 --> 28:04.460
there's a gateway that goes like rise above it and they're like no I'll do

28:04.460 --> 28:08.780
the Twitter of fucking supernatural activity which is hang out here and

28:08.780 --> 28:12.500
fucking monitor everything otherwise I might miss something who's living in my

28:12.500 --> 28:16.380
apartment and then and then for everybody to be like hey look it's my

28:16.380 --> 28:20.940
dick and balls the ghost is like fuck yeah okay that's a pretty good theory

28:20.940 --> 28:24.860
that's not a bad theory so you're saying they're still around they're just

28:24.860 --> 28:28.620
placated they're happy they're happy they're more like us now they're not

28:28.620 --> 28:32.380
like who is this living in my house they're like oh it's one of me oh yeah

28:32.380 --> 28:37.580
recognize game recognize game it's another floaty yeah non-person just like

28:37.580 --> 28:41.580
drifting through the fucking earth like not knowing where to go so I have a

28:41.580 --> 28:46.740
question is it possible that you just flushed it and it's not enough great

28:46.740 --> 28:51.780
question that that that's sorry sorry I wanted to go back to get a very good

28:51.780 --> 28:58.740
question so lately in order I've been trying really hard to flush to flush so

28:58.740 --> 29:06.540
hard it's been it's a lot like a dream for getting forgetting is getting in

29:06.540 --> 29:11.860
the way and and I but it's like I have so much anxiety to the point that I'll

29:11.860 --> 29:16.500
be like like this morning I'll be driving to work and then I'll stop at a

29:16.500 --> 29:21.700
stop sign and what oh shit and I'll text Kate going hey just in case flush the

29:21.700 --> 29:29.100
toilet before you open open the lid or you close the lid there's your fucking

29:29.100 --> 29:41.380
problem particles get on your toothbrush oh yeah that's a great reason to

29:41.380 --> 29:47.180
flush you're you're remembering you're remembering poop particles enough to

29:47.180 --> 29:52.860
close it in like a fucking mug why are you gonna get a window installed in the

29:52.860 --> 29:58.220
lid of the toilet oh that could be good there you go that's it

29:58.220 --> 30:03.180
there's fancy glass top toilet hi yeah like a glass top toilet or you could

30:03.180 --> 30:07.180
remember to flush like every other fucking human being in the world you know

30:07.180 --> 30:10.780
what you could get I bet you there's a lot of people out there that forget to

30:10.780 --> 30:14.780
flush and it's more than that it's your anxiety about it is now the big deal

30:14.780 --> 30:20.100
now it's a big deal because because I'll at the stoplight I'll text and I'll go

30:20.100 --> 30:29.740
and it and it there's not even ellipses of like too late that was the prices

30:29.740 --> 30:37.140
right yeah how people forget like oh did I leave the oven on or whatever you're

30:37.140 --> 30:42.900
like yeah I like that too except I just it's yeah that happens to me where I

30:42.900 --> 30:46.620
think I've left a straightening iron on but all every time we leave the house

30:46.620 --> 30:50.540
okay that's true but I'd never leave on but you actually are leaving poop in

30:50.540 --> 30:56.220
that toilet maybe an auto flusher like I air airport that could be but also you

30:56.220 --> 30:59.580
have one of the most exotic toilets I've ever seen yeah it's a great toilet one

30:59.580 --> 31:03.540
of those Japanese things that talks to you yeah water fountain dances I need to

31:03.540 --> 31:09.420
upgrade I need to upgrade yeah you here I have an idea upgrade no don't upgrade

31:09.420 --> 31:12.500
here's an idea down great you're saying Wi-Fi so you're on your phone and

31:12.500 --> 31:15.860
that's the problem right you know about how long it's taking you to poop five

31:15.860 --> 31:19.700
minutes ten minutes what is it what is what do you have to poo before you start

31:19.700 --> 31:24.660
set an alarm and then go poo and then when the alarm goes off how was he gonna

31:24.660 --> 31:29.500
remember to do that he can't remember to remember to poop I bet when you have to

31:29.500 --> 31:32.780
go poop at that moment you're like I have a flush afterwards and then you

31:32.780 --> 31:38.820
forget in the interim right yes I'm just glad I had an alarm I've been feeling

31:38.820 --> 31:43.220
bad because as I think your brain just degenerates and there's like pixels that

31:43.220 --> 31:47.780
get removed from the JPEG you know I for me it's I keep forgetting Jeff

31:47.780 --> 31:50.780
Bridges name and like like stuff like that like I'm like who the fuck was that

31:50.780 --> 31:54.780
way it's like just random people that you should like I'll spend I'll be going

31:54.780 --> 32:01.020
it's not like and everyone's just waiting for me and I'm like no no and I

32:01.020 --> 32:05.900
don't I know that all I have to say is the bad guy from seven but I won't say

32:05.900 --> 32:09.620
it because that'll be weakness like I like cuz then they'll go Kevin Spacey

32:09.620 --> 32:15.020
I'm like I'm not old like like so I'll just sit there I forgot the name of the

32:15.020 --> 32:22.060
bad guy from seven everyone has to wait until I forge my neural pathway back but

32:22.060 --> 32:26.340
I'd rather I'd rather forget celebrities names and forget that my I don't know his

32:26.340 --> 32:31.540
only has one victim this is really really I mean I thought I'd share

32:31.540 --> 32:36.500
something with you that you know I mean with with the audience but I mean like

32:36.500 --> 32:44.020
my my real question is just can't have a right to be mad at me yeah yeah only

32:44.020 --> 32:51.340
because you're a grown-up okay well she has a right to be mad but it's gonna do

32:51.340 --> 32:55.740
about as much good as being mad at the weather all right well no here's the

32:55.740 --> 32:59.420
issue it is Emily brought up something that's interesting if this was the

32:59.420 --> 33:02.900
thing from the very beginning when you guys met she's like this guy's great I

33:02.900 --> 33:06.340
think I'm really falling for him he never flushes right he could get past that then

33:06.340 --> 33:09.620
she should be then that's part of the equation but now she's with you and you

33:09.620 --> 33:13.100
spring this on her many years into the relationship she can't even do that you

33:13.100 --> 33:16.380
knew I was like this when you met me you can't even do that she can say you

33:16.380 --> 33:20.500
changed you used to flush changed but we're all changing we're all dying and

33:20.500 --> 33:24.420
ideally we're dying together and partners but what if there's something wrong with me

33:24.420 --> 33:27.820
what if there's something wrong with your brain there is something wrong with all of us

33:27.820 --> 33:32.980
toilet carbon-based lifeforms we're melting but you can't make fun of that yes you can

33:32.980 --> 33:38.260
watch we've been doing it for a while I'm going great I think this is just like

33:38.260 --> 33:45.580
your new you're trying out for a while he walked around with a little box of

33:45.580 --> 33:50.300
Captain Crunch yeah that would look who came to the set the bathrobe thing and

33:50.300 --> 33:55.420
I don't like we've established that Rob doesn't flush Dan is pooping his pants

33:55.420 --> 34:04.660
currently Kumail takes his shirt off like a fucking lunatic I take back to

34:04.660 --> 34:08.620
that I was done to find out everyone doesn't do it it's just it's just it's

34:08.620 --> 34:12.260
because it's like for me it's like like I've never done it but I always think

34:12.260 --> 34:14.900
about it when it's too late when I'm sitting down I'm like damn I should have

34:14.900 --> 34:17.860
taken my shirt up so I love the idea of your watching forensic files and you're

34:17.860 --> 34:25.060
like I love you I love you too and then and then Kumail's like like a couple

34:25.060 --> 34:32.620
minutes later he's like he stands up he pauses forensic files he takes his shirt

34:32.620 --> 34:38.020
off like a Mountain Dew commercial and Emily just knows he just walks off it's

34:38.020 --> 34:41.460
like I guess it's I guess it's gonna be three minutes yeah and I did find out

34:41.460 --> 34:46.460
because he would walk back into the room putting on his shirt I love that he's

34:46.460 --> 34:50.140
like John Henry he's like I'm gonna go beat a steam engine I don't want to

34:50.140 --> 34:55.300
bring any any of that battle back with me true because I'm a human being I'm

34:55.300 --> 34:59.260
civilized but when I'm sitting on the toilet I'm a fucking animal I'm gonna

34:59.260 --> 35:03.260
go slay a dragon and when I come back I'm still gonna be a white knight like I'm

35:03.260 --> 35:08.180
gonna have blood all over me that in public I don't poop in public no but

35:08.180 --> 35:14.460
like at work and stuff sure you you've pooped at work right oh no I if it's a

35:14.460 --> 35:18.420
trailer yeah yeah I take everything off you take everything off in your trailer

35:18.420 --> 35:24.900
at work yeah you strip you strip down you take off your socks like you're a

35:24.900 --> 35:28.900
clone like you're a clone a Logan's run clone or something like you're yeah

35:28.900 --> 35:33.180
Logan's run is like you get totally nude even if you're in on a shoot in a

35:33.180 --> 35:37.540
trailer yeah you get down to the fucking nitty gritty grass tax what about an

35:37.540 --> 35:42.700
airplane now great question I've never pooped in an airplane yeah it's great

35:42.700 --> 35:46.580
no it's not good what theoretically you've taken some very long flights you

35:46.580 --> 35:51.540
never had this although I do go into a plane and the first thing I do is I go

35:51.540 --> 35:56.820
and change my underwear in the airplane but I go and change that's a good you

35:56.820 --> 36:01.660
this is why you're so fucked like this is all genius level move this is all

36:01.660 --> 36:06.900
amazing shit you must like you have the best you must love it every day of your

36:06.900 --> 36:12.540

36:12.540 --> 36:15.620
underwear going to bed what do you do with it what do you do with the dirty

36:15.620 --> 36:20.900
underwear what do you do with this dirty underwear so now you donate it to the

36:20.900 --> 36:31.700
orphans no I what day is it my boy it's Christmas

36:31.700 --> 36:46.940
with this with Delta miles I've only worn it for four hours also doesn't sleep

36:46.940 --> 36:51.820
in underwear where's specific I don't I cannot sleep in underwear if I'm on a

36:51.820 --> 36:54.820
plane and I have to take a nap I'm going into the bathroom taking off my

36:54.820 --> 36:58.580
underwear not putting on another underwear coming back and sitting in my

36:58.580 --> 37:01.820
seat to take a nap then what when before it's time to land I'm going into the

37:01.820 --> 37:06.460
bathroom I'm putting on underwear because now I'm ready for the day this is

37:06.460 --> 37:11.180
making me feel like I have a hidden superpower because I feel like well you

37:11.180 --> 37:17.780
have a superpower which is like super sensitivity to your underwear being used

37:17.780 --> 37:22.100
I hate I have the opposite I'm like juggernaut and you're like that the

37:22.100 --> 37:26.260
girl with that has to wear the gloves and the X man or the other I shall kill

37:26.260 --> 37:31.900
people that's right we're both powerful but like I'm like it's been six days I

37:31.900 --> 37:40.100
should change my underwear because I read an article about it someone just

37:40.100 --> 37:45.980
reminded I saw a zeppelin in the sky that was a certain I don't know I hate I've

37:45.980 --> 37:49.780
always hated underwear I probably didn't start wearing underwear till I was

37:49.780 --> 37:54.940
probably about 14 I delayed it as long as I could I probably have 50 pairs of

37:54.940 --> 37:58.580
underwear that are currently in rotation well and this is a good question I

37:58.580 --> 38:03.620
think for the board what is the oldest pair of underwear you own cuz it's a

38:03.620 --> 38:10.060
disgusting thing to think about Nathan I don't know I don't know do you name your

38:10.060 --> 38:14.740
underwear not name it but like no no the longest like the oldest pair she

38:14.740 --> 38:19.300
didn't say name them she said I don't know they're all kind of they look the

38:19.300 --> 38:26.380
same to me well that's so right so we're lucky in it while we think about it

38:26.380 --> 38:53.100
should we bring up Brandon Johnson and find out what his underwear

38:53.100 --> 39:04.860
pants okay how what's your what's your what's your problem dirty night pants it's

39:04.860 --> 39:11.620
a dirty white pants dirty night pants we didn't for her we're doing I'm just I'm

39:11.620 --> 39:16.620
I love this idea of such elegance of changing your underwear throughout the

39:16.620 --> 39:20.500
day like that yeah man right so you agree with the rest of us in the middle of

39:20.500 --> 39:24.460
the bell curve that he's like Downton Abbey style it's not good why is it not

39:24.460 --> 39:31.780
good I will tell you it's just a lot of laundry to manage doesn't matter you're

39:31.780 --> 39:36.500
worth it yeah man goddamn you're worth it it's on some Rick Ross shit for real

39:36.500 --> 39:41.860
yeah I just it is some rapper baller type like I only wear this white t-shirt and

39:41.860 --> 39:50.060
I throw that shit away you know I did some math for the price that most people

39:50.060 --> 39:54.580
spend on like coffee weekly you could definitely have brand new socks every day

39:54.580 --> 39:59.060
of the week that sounds like a horrible infomercial and that's why I've come up

39:59.060 --> 40:04.700
with soccer day are you telling me all I have to do is fill out paperwork and

40:04.700 --> 40:10.540
socks will come to my house I'm telling you all fill out half of it oh I will

40:10.540 --> 40:27.340
never be alone again you will never be alone again well what have we learned

40:27.340 --> 40:35.180
over 300 episodes that it's okay if I forget the flow no no that's not been

40:35.180 --> 40:43.340
the take away but the texting and saying honey I'm sorry I don't remember how

40:43.340 --> 40:47.300
often when you're texting or how often is it what percentage of time have you

40:47.300 --> 40:52.500
not flushed and what percentage have you flushed and you're almost a hundred yeah

40:52.500 --> 40:57.260
it's all almost a hundred almost a hundred so what if you take like a golden

40:57.260 --> 41:02.300
string right you tie it to the to the flusher and you will put a loop on the

41:02.300 --> 41:06.460
other end when you sit down on the toilet you put the looped end if you

41:06.460 --> 41:09.700
remember if he could remember to put a string on his finger he could remember

41:09.700 --> 41:14.100
to remove poop out of you see a golden string on your toilet you will remember

41:14.100 --> 41:18.300
to put a string on your thing right let's string on your let's not shoot

41:18.300 --> 41:22.740
let's not shoot from the makers of soccer days let's yes and string on your

41:22.740 --> 41:26.220
thing string anything's good you could also say it as you do it that helps me

41:26.220 --> 41:30.700
when I like and unplugging stuff I go I have unplugged the flat iron you're like

41:30.700 --> 41:37.340
me oh yeah now that's a good idea I think that's a helpful thing to say a rope

41:37.340 --> 41:43.420
coming down from a really well-anchored thing in your cities what it's it's a

41:43.420 --> 41:47.780
like you shape it into a thing that slips over your neck like right so it's

41:47.780 --> 41:51.780
hanging you're not gonna forget you it's gonna be in your way the way to get it

41:51.780 --> 41:56.220
out of your way as you slip it over your neck you take a poop yeah you get up if

41:56.220 --> 42:00.860
you you could forget everything you could forget to wipe you start walking away

42:00.860 --> 42:06.820
oh I forgot oh what am I oh what was I I must have been so preoccupied with the

42:06.820 --> 42:12.260
events of the day oh look at this is a toilet full of shit here I'm naked my

42:12.260 --> 42:17.780
wedding rings gone how can you not write as you get up from the toilet go for

42:17.780 --> 42:20.580
the flush is that not part of muscle memory here's what I learned here's a

42:20.580 --> 42:23.340
rhyme check we're gonna take away from this conversation as you're putting your

42:23.340 --> 42:28.300
shirt back on just flush the toilet from now on now on I'm gonna get totally

42:28.300 --> 42:31.780
nude every time I poop no matter where I am it's freeing you're gonna love it but

42:31.780 --> 42:38.180
I'm also gonna stop flushing Emily what's your weird poop stories

42:38.180 --> 42:45.460
ladies don't have those I had to okay I had to dump in a ziplock bag once when

42:45.460 --> 42:53.500
we lived in Brooklyn yeah whoa that's legit that's some Iceland shit hurricane

42:53.500 --> 42:59.060
Sandy what what happened or weirdest charity event ever probably like New

42:59.060 --> 43:08.620
Year's Eve that's why the $75 came from I didn't know I'd be Oscar-nominated one

43:08.620 --> 43:18.100
day I thought I was at the top of my game was this a deleted scene from the

43:18.100 --> 43:26.180
big sick our toilet was just out and they were like we're not getting to you

43:26.180 --> 43:30.300
for days and we lived in a dangerous neighborhood it was late at night so I

43:30.300 --> 43:46.020
thought ziplock bag size like the size of the big daddy coke bag I did a dime

43:46.020 --> 43:54.900
bag of shit that was a little logo on him from her cartel the cops are like

43:54.900 --> 43:59.420
who's the scorpion person her poop actually has a blue hue to it

43:59.420 --> 44:04.460
yeah did you make sure the the air was all out of it before you close it I did

44:04.460 --> 44:09.740
a pretty good job are you trying to keep it fresh no but I did the instinct was

44:09.740 --> 44:14.820
there why oh just get all the air out why I tell you why because I didn't want

44:14.820 --> 44:19.860
it to pop that's fair right well you're not like blowing into it are you sure

44:19.860 --> 44:24.940
you take your shirt off let me have my thing wait did you did you save it until

44:24.940 --> 44:29.620
you found a toilet to flush it down here's what I did I put the bag you woke

44:29.620 --> 44:37.420
me up I double-bagged it three times and then only though the word that met

44:37.420 --> 44:41.940
twice but three times you are so high a mighty firm and who has to get naked to

44:41.940 --> 44:48.380
shit that's the opposite of what you did I am clean clothes are far away from the

44:48.380 --> 44:56.380
shit you're sitting into a bag and then I went down to our dumpster which was

44:56.380 --> 44:59.900
behind the building and got rid of the evidence you were living together oh yeah

44:59.900 --> 45:04.340
we were married so during during this period where the toilet was at what on

45:04.340 --> 45:08.780
earth was coming in oh I think you were at work or something you weren't there

45:08.780 --> 45:15.660
you just bought a first-class ticket on United yeah you weren't there for

45:15.660 --> 45:19.500
whatever reason you were not home and it was just not the kind of neighborhood

45:19.500 --> 45:23.540
you could like walk to the closest as a guy who listens to too many true crime

45:23.540 --> 45:28.060
podcasts with Cody like I if I get a text if I ever got a text from Cody that

45:28.060 --> 45:35.740
said had to take a shit waters out shit in a bag actually shit on the floor like

45:35.740 --> 45:41.580
instead of leaving the house ever I'd be like good good yeah I don't think that's

45:41.580 --> 45:44.940
healthy but I know that would be right I was like good good just oh yeah next

45:44.940 --> 45:48.820
time don't leave the bedroom yeah no it was a bad neighborhood it was pretty

45:48.820 --> 45:52.340
common if you open the dumpster it was full of bags of shit just bagged and

45:52.340 --> 45:56.180
bags of shit everybody was doing that over there so somehow it's okay to leave

45:56.180 --> 45:59.580
the house and go behind the building the building the back door was like that

45:59.580 --> 46:07.860
enclosed yeah dumpster space yeah no wait I have more questions I thought of

46:07.860 --> 46:11.660
more questions but you wiped I assume and where did the toilet it went in the

46:11.660 --> 46:18.100
back with it yeah yeah I got rid of all the evidence so you would wipe and put

46:18.100 --> 46:22.980
it into the bag yeah of shit or a separate bag same bag so it was just one

46:22.980 --> 46:28.660
bag with the poop found that was like oh I know what happened here this is act

46:28.660 --> 46:33.340
one and two and three you ever see like a public toilet or like a workplace

46:33.340 --> 46:35.860
toilet where there's like a conversation going on because there's

46:35.860 --> 46:40.340
something going wrong with the toilet or so somebody will put up a sign they put

46:40.340 --> 46:44.700
all the effort into an aerial true type font a piece of typing paper above the

46:44.700 --> 46:51.140
thing it says like but they just it's like don't flush tampons well they would

46:51.140 --> 46:54.300
that they would be that specific because then you'd know exactly what not to

46:54.300 --> 46:58.700
flush but I'm saying like when they get amorphous and they're like don't flush

46:58.700 --> 47:03.020
non-waste or something like that and then there's like so then people get

47:03.020 --> 47:07.700
ballpoint pens ago you so you mean like toilet paper like everyone turns into a

47:07.700 --> 47:11.740
reddit forum like like that it's like like people are like no idiot they mean

47:11.740 --> 47:15.300
whether they like what do you like like like but it's legitimate questions I'm

47:15.300 --> 47:18.780
like what do you what is this a time bomb like what am I shitting in yeah

47:18.780 --> 47:23.020
that's tough that's a tough one we have if you're flushing something that has

47:23.020 --> 47:26.980
become waste like no matter what it is that's what that's what you would write

47:26.980 --> 47:33.620
on this side if I am flushing this already I worked in an office in

47:33.620 --> 47:39.660
Chicago of all therapists and for whatever reason random turds kept showing

47:39.660 --> 47:44.340
up on the on the women's bathroom floor for weeks at a time how do you know they

47:44.340 --> 47:50.780
were random they were different people each time we couldn't figure out we

47:50.780 --> 47:53.260
just call it a phantom shitter we couldn't figure out if it was like

47:53.260 --> 47:58.740
falling out of a pant leg or if it was intentional it was not a happy workplace

47:58.740 --> 48:02.140
I'm really fascinated with that stuff like I because I think it's like an

48:02.140 --> 48:06.900
eruption of like it's sort of like shoplifting yeah it's like an urban

48:06.900 --> 48:11.260
phenomenon like among people who are like like like there's one thing it's

48:11.260 --> 48:14.540
like oh you saw that Canadian video where the woman just shits on the floor of

48:14.540 --> 48:18.260
the restaurant there's it but I was I saw that I was like there's no mystery to

48:18.260 --> 48:21.780
this she's asking to go to the bathroom she's infuriated she has she and then

48:21.780 --> 48:25.460
she and I then I found out later I was totally right totally nailed it I know

48:25.460 --> 48:30.220
my shitting people and but but it fascinates me when people are like I

48:30.220 --> 48:37.100
lived in an apartment complex and for six weeks every three days like in the

48:37.100 --> 48:42.780
dryer yeah I saw and it was like it's some cereal yeah like person that's

48:42.780 --> 48:48.300
like there it's that's so fascinating to me either I think some form of rage that

48:48.300 --> 48:51.940
you can only really express through your shit it's amazing that's a targeted

48:51.940 --> 48:57.340
because I have you know when you get so angry you can only shit it out I don't

48:57.340 --> 49:01.020
but I'm clearly someone that I were and I we all kept being like oh I hope no one

49:01.020 --> 49:05.540
thinks it's me right I mean like I left that job and I was like please let the

49:05.540 --> 49:09.980
phantom shitter continue or else it's on me and the phantom shitter did oh that

49:09.980 --> 49:15.580
would be great right and then that person stopped it was just an elaborate

49:15.580 --> 49:19.980
revenge on you 35 people who just like oh Emily yeah I saw that movie was pretty

49:19.980 --> 49:24.540
good she shit on the floor at that one place when the killer when they arrest

49:24.540 --> 49:28.020
the wrong guy and then the and then the kid there's like that period of time where

49:28.020 --> 49:32.860
the real killer is like I could go out hang up my jersey and I'm like no I

49:32.860 --> 49:36.020
gotta kill more people and they're like all right you can leave jail guy but

49:36.020 --> 49:39.180
there is some kind of like modern like it's like getting your hands dirty in a

49:39.180 --> 49:42.500
world where we don't really do that anymore I'm starting to kind of get it I

49:42.500 --> 49:46.500
guess I mean I did that's what's because you know that the person who takes a

49:46.500 --> 49:51.900
shit in their apartment buildings dryer every Wednesday is not also a serial

49:51.900 --> 49:55.740
killer yes like they're not they're probably not torturing animals or

49:55.740 --> 50:01.700
something it's like it's such a weird pinprick like magma eruption I that's

50:01.700 --> 50:05.220
what I would say this person like going like the alley McBeal you know like

50:05.220 --> 50:09.340
going to work as a legal clerk and being like and in conclusion my power point

50:09.340 --> 50:14.460
and they're like good job Daphne and she's like you got it moving on up moving

50:14.460 --> 50:17.820
and then the full moon comes up she's like I have to do this or else I can't

50:17.820 --> 50:22.940
succeed and it's like all of her the ghost of her father going like women

50:22.940 --> 50:28.260
mean nothing and she's like I'll shit you into a dryer turn you on high heat and

50:28.260 --> 50:32.700
then you just hear the thudding going is it weird that I always picture a woman

50:32.700 --> 50:36.380
when it's like the phantom pooping because we're not allowed to express our

50:36.380 --> 50:41.780
anger any other way again I shoplifting like a female thing you can let me off

50:41.780 --> 50:45.500
the hook like only if you weren't here and I said that I would get that's right

50:45.500 --> 50:49.620
yeah that's right women but also that woman remembers to do it once a week

50:49.620 --> 50:55.060
yeah it's self-care in a way how do you know things are so intense what are you

50:55.060 --> 51:02.900
doing oh you know I take five minutes every morning you know just sort of

51:02.900 --> 51:08.100
hang out with friends I'm bad and I'll have like a bagel and then I shit in the

51:08.100 --> 51:14.980
dry alright I feel like I feel like everybody everybody's like oh you you

51:14.980 --> 51:21.700
talk too much about shit just a little too much like but I have a gripe I have

51:21.700 --> 51:29.700
an issue what is it you guys have this gripe no okay listen up just lift what's

51:29.700 --> 51:34.300
up with the air conditioning you know what's up with the AC really you get in

51:34.300 --> 51:41.580
the car and it's fucking summer hot summer hottest summer in record here you

51:41.580 --> 51:47.460
get in there and it's a hot box it's fucking hot hot hot and the first thing

51:47.460 --> 51:58.300
you go do you want the AC on they're like yeah motherfucker put the AC on probably

51:58.300 --> 52:03.900
to save money yeah I know but come on give me a break do you do you want the

52:03.900 --> 52:10.740
AC out so put it on and then like when I like Friday night I'm driving with this

52:10.740 --> 52:16.300
person and then see oh you shot oh I thought he met the mechanics of the

52:16.300 --> 52:20.220
fucking car I'm like could you be more of a baby you mean riding you mean no I

52:20.220 --> 52:32.340
yeah you mean lift an Uber driver yeah yeah yeah yes you want it do you want

52:32.340 --> 52:38.500
to be sweating or in your back sticking to the back of my shitty money do you

52:38.500 --> 52:42.580
want to be comfortable or yeah or do you want to roll down the window and get

52:42.580 --> 52:47.740
the fucking air in your face how about what you get in a car and it was like

52:47.740 --> 52:51.700
you get like an SUV with a group and then you're like fucking hot back here

52:51.700 --> 52:56.300
and you're like oh hey oh yeah you do you do a million things like there's such

52:56.300 --> 53:00.220
a fucking like amount of Chuffa you got four people working on a problem back

53:00.220 --> 53:05.540
there 18 dials everybody you're doing and then finally only when it needs to

53:05.540 --> 53:13.340
involve a capitan you go like is it air anything air oriented anything and it's

53:13.340 --> 53:17.660
always the first response is always like just victim blaming like like they

53:17.660 --> 53:22.140
could just like like like I it it's already on like they'll just say

53:22.140 --> 53:25.380
something that makes you feel fucking insane like it's already it should work

53:25.380 --> 53:30.500
it's already on this is what this shit was happening to me on Saturday so I get

53:30.500 --> 53:38.900
in the car and I do the whoo really hot one today which is you try to ramp in

53:38.900 --> 53:44.660
trying to and then they go oh would you like the AC on and I go yeah that's

53:44.660 --> 53:49.220

53:49.220 --> 53:57.220
what who am I to say yes I go like it's Los Angeles you know what no I'll roll

53:57.220 --> 54:02.380
down the window and get on the freeway yeah yeah and then after a while I'll

go like genius okay now let's say let's try some and then she's like oh I okay

54:15.380 --> 54:22.180
I'll put it on but I just get so cold in here it's like a fucking 122 degrees out

54:22.180 --> 54:27.340
people are dying outside a way to measure don't you wish there was a way to

54:27.340 --> 54:31.060
measure at the end of all of our lives don't you just wish it could be like

54:31.060 --> 54:35.460
monopoly or something where we could just little things like how many of the

54:35.460 --> 54:40.020
people that succeeded or failed like like to the extent that their success or

54:40.020 --> 54:45.180
failure had anything to do with money like how much it's like like I just want

54:45.180 --> 54:49.220
to like be there at the fucking like st. Peter's gate or whatever where we all

54:49.220 --> 54:54.700
tabulate and go like yeah you know what every time you fucking like like like

54:54.700 --> 54:59.380
like didn't buy popcorn when you were in line and you made your date buy it like

54:59.380 --> 55:04.020
you didn't it made you poorer like you didn't like like are this like your

55:04.020 --> 55:08.020
your laundromat putting that label on the machine and then making this hub

55:08.020 --> 55:12.980
cap you save five dollars didn't get rich from doing any of this shit like I

55:12.980 --> 55:19.580
want but she was good she was like okay I'll turn it on and then what I start

55:19.580 --> 55:26.380
she was slowly turning it off like slowly yeah and I went okay and I rolled

55:26.380 --> 55:31.860
down my window and then she turns around and goes what's going on do we want AC

55:31.860 --> 55:34.980
or fresh air

55:35.580 --> 55:39.940
oh yeah you shouldn't turn on the you shouldn't open the window when the AC is

55:39.940 --> 55:45.340
on that's an insane person thing to do if it's not cold enough it's actually

55:45.340 --> 55:49.460
the smartest thing maybe use your mouth than like request things like a human

55:49.460 --> 55:56.740
when somebody says hey do you want AC and I go yes and you slowly turn it off

55:56.740 --> 56:01.740
what she was she was cold she gets too cold also I'll say that people who drive

56:01.740 --> 56:05.220
left and over don't make them no they don't make money make very little money

56:05.220 --> 56:22.060
from AC's that helps them pay the rent and it's the hottest summer in record how

56:22.060 --> 56:25.860
much change your underwear half it through the day how much fucking money do

56:25.860 --> 56:29.860
you save by not using AC enough see the spreadsheet of it that's what I'm saying

56:29.860 --> 56:33.700
I want to see at the end of everyone there how much town through town you

56:33.700 --> 56:38.620
actually do spend a lot of money is it $30 a week but is it highway it doesn't

56:38.620 --> 56:46.820
make a bit of it is it $4 a month use your mouth like a human being yeah use

56:46.820 --> 56:50.900
your mouth like a human most of your complaint is I shouldn't have to ask for

56:50.900 --> 56:56.020
AC yes yes we'll ask for it I never I shouldn't have to ask for AC on the

56:56.020 --> 57:00.500
hottest summer in the history of the world but it's not a problem when you have

57:00.500 --> 57:06.140
a mouth you can use and you do yes it is a problem no it's not yes it is it is

57:06.140 --> 57:10.140
a problem it's just a thing that happens you know you do it's a problem

57:10.140 --> 57:13.740

the bank from that you didn't invent haha other people in yes I also sent a

58:06.660 --> 58:11.620
link to a toilet that flushes as soon as you stand up can you hack other people's

58:11.620 --> 58:16.900
toilets and then make the flesh in the description it said no more fighting over

58:16.900 --> 58:25.100
forgotten flushes you should get it before they go out of business because

58:25.100 --> 58:30.060
nobody else has this problem well how can your neighbors toilet and just flush

58:30.060 --> 58:37.740
it all night so many problems doesn't need to be on Wi-Fi he laughs for

58:37.740 --> 58:44.140
Emily there's a new Ziploc crap sack it's gonna be a little pocket for toilet

58:44.140 --> 58:47.540
paper yeah you need a separate little pocket one for is there anybody in our

58:47.540 --> 58:52.860
audience we could crowdsource this like try to try to restrain yourself like if

58:52.860 --> 58:56.940
you really feel like you have something concise and from an expert place that we

58:56.940 --> 59:04.260
can defer to that like like like I really want to know the data on the cost of

59:04.260 --> 59:10.780
air conditioning it's been it's been mythbusters yes you could like flip

59:10.780 --> 59:15.060
this is it as much as you would get a result on this buster you save money by

59:15.060 --> 59:19.220
not using the AC yeah I know you save more money by not air conditioning the

59:19.220 --> 59:23.140
car than if you don't but I just want to know what the scale of it is yeah like

59:23.140 --> 59:31.020
if it is if you save five dollars worth of gas how often like just driving me

59:31.020 --> 59:36.900
from one side of the town not gonna be fine yeah so get a five dollar tip it's

59:36.900 --> 59:41.860
an option I don't they don't they don't say they don't get the tip they don't see

59:41.860 --> 59:46.460
who tips yeah how would let no pre that you're gonna tip before there is there

59:46.460 --> 59:50.540
no reason to raise their hand right here drivers you do though you get in the

59:50.540 --> 59:56.460
car with the five dollar bill okay you want to just come up here and give us

59:56.460 --> 59:59.820
a little bit of information from your perspective we won't we won't we won't

59:59.820 --> 01:00:18.020
attack or what's your name sir I'm Christian Christian okay you don't have

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.620
to tell us anything about yourself that you don't want us to know but stop it

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:26.140
you fuck right give us your love you give us your background why why you might

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:35.740
have the knowledge about this so I went to UC San Diego oh it's very hot there

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.740
why yeah it's hot there and I got a degree in computer engineering and now

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:44.740
I'm an Uber driver so okay there's how many degrees intersection of expertise

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:52.380
okay yeah yeah so yeah you can you can see who tips you thank you I've been

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:59.980
wanting to know this thank you wait I don't know you do did you just do the

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:06.540
world's most perfect joke or are you do you how much money does AC for the AC I

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.820
mean I guess you can you can save a little bit of cash see so you were

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.140
actually here to answer the other question man sit around in a car that's

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.900
hot and be an animal for an entire week to save this was not why you were brought

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:26.180
up yes it is yes it is he's opinion on whether or not it's good to be in heat we

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.140
all agree it's bad to be in heat he's he's equating it with exactly but he

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:36.060
there's nine people up here he's he's saying if I could talk over you for a

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:42.380
second let him talk for fuck's sake all right go ahead I don't know what else you

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.860
want okay well here's what I heard you say it's what Schrab is saying which is

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:54.660
basically like I like like the savings on air conditioning are probably in

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:59.260
comparison to the jeopardy you know that you're just saying that because now

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.940
you're on the spot and we have a different question than the one you thought

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:08.460
you were answering no all right he went to he was doing a funny joke to open he

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.300
gained everyone's esteem and I don't think he was doing a joke I think he

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.820
thought that was the question whether or not I wish we could someone with

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:30.540
his intentions were all right thank you Christian Christian it does anyone know

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.660
how much money it doesn't save a lot of money but these are people who don't

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:39.180
make a lot of money and a lot of the money they make goes to pay the costs of

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.420
them doing their job yep which is what which is paying for the car paying for

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.940
the gas for the car paying for maintenance that's their job that's a big part of

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.700
their job is to pay for the car what that's what their office is do you think

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.820
this is their job Spencer if we feel I thought I was driving with our awareness

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.900
that people who work every day jobs are unfairly paid can we do we have to be

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.220
so distracted by that when we're discussing this other thing well that's

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.860
the reason why you're uncomfortable though and I agree that being uncomfortable

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:14.020
is not a good thing but it's just the thing that has a reason right but I

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:19.020
understand that we have any air conditioning driver out of their

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:25.180
overhead I would know that here's my biggest problem the surprise oh you want

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:31.220
the air conditioning on as sweat is just dripping off everybody's face it's like

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.300
if you're a restaurant and you get water because people are usually thirsty when

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.860
they're eating their friends so for you if that's water if she had been like hey

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.900
I know it's very hard I didn't have it on because I'm saving money because I'm

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.460
not super rich you'd be okay is that okay do you want the AC or not so she

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.020
does a little guilt trip to you before before you oh that would be awesome

01:03:52.020 --> 01:04:01.940
right I'm 10% Kevin day just came down with the day thanks Kevin it's 10

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:10.900
Kevin day everybody 10% fuel efficiency is lost Kevin by having the

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:17.460
air on 10% fuel it 10% of anything is significant yeah literally on the way

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:28.580
here we're low on gas and you were like let's turn off the AC I had a friend it's

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:33.500
so stupid when we were 16 that he was like we wanted out of gas we got to turn

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:42.780
off the radio well depends on what songs playing all right so ride share

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.460
operators within the sound of our voice when we're in desert cities where it

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.620
gets to 120 degrees Fahrenheit like we need to have this conversation among the

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:57.500
many things that they're unfair to drivers they're 10% of their overhead as

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.700
opposed to someone in Minnesota is like it's an important thing and we're

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:07.380
feeling at first here having the conversation and I'm sure it'll be fixed

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:14.140
by next week yeah but 10% so fucking lot so never I would have always assumed

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.500
when I heard my parents talking about like oh we're gonna get you know don't

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.900
don't turn up there I was in my head I was always like yeah and we should always

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.700
eat generic peanut butter because a hospital bills like I was like I bet

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:35.140
this doesn't add up to anything 10% a lot there's also this thing where people

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.460
who are doing the share sort of in the share movement are compromising

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:44.620
themselves so when you hear somebody ask for them to compromise themselves a

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:50.900
little bit more it kind of sparks a nerve well at the same time if you're

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:54.260
gonna do the job you should probably have a cool cabin I get that but I also

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.540
get the like we can't ask these slaves to fire burgers well to be clear we we

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.100
should definitely ask for it to be cold we should want it to be cold but while

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.860
doing that just understand why it is the way it is I mean all the feelings are

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:15.700
completely great yes good this is good let's roll the clip that's great yeah

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.820
but should we shut you do a clip of us having this exact conversation a year

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:27.140
ago what we haven't solved it oh my god I mean part of the reason they have the

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:31.220
conversation is because maybe a ride service would say hey we're adding a

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:38.700
button that for three dollars extra for 10% of the thing you the driver will

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:43.860
receive an alert that says please cool down your cabin as you roll up oh if I

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.060
was a driver I would never pick that person up I would be like that guy's an

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:52.420
asshole you're telling me ahead of time like I get a certain way so come

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.500
correct when you come to me I'd be like bye come correct that must be nice I like

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.380
that you'd be that picky but like if people really wanted it that badly if

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.020
you live in Arizona and every time you take a ride share service your big

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.260
fucking problem is that unlike a cab which runs on a medallion service you

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.900
climb in and it's fucking overhead paid by the corrupt you know medallion

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:18.860
cabbies do this too it's cool as hell and then every time a lift comes it's

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.900
like hot and you have to have the conversation like if I don't know what

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.380
the statistics are the next thing Kevin Dane needs to come down is go like

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:30.020
here's how many people have a problem with like being I've always noticed it

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.740
I've always noticed that conversation I've always found it like kind of like

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:40.900
crazy and absurd I find it way less absurd and like the 10% of anything is

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:47.580
like huge so now that can reduce my outrage by at least 10% if not 90

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.780
because if I get in I'm like it's hot it feels like empathy for the poor like

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:58.820
like like like like like now I can now I can fucking use that heat to make me

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:06.220
stronger as a liberal great now I have everything plus I have a Tesla so yeah

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:11.380
I don't unless I'm super drunk I don't need your hot-ass car I learned about

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.740
this from cabs I got like four cabs in a row and that's what they were doing and

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.540
I was like what the fuck and then I looked it up and they're like saves a

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:22.820
lot of money and I was like I guess if that's your job and then I never did

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:26.860
this did this issue I remember in the Milwaukee days like you know when we

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.820
would like fill up our tank a dollar at a time and we're not gonna make it to

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.900
Dale's house in time to get drunk and they'll be like gonna turn off the air

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.940
conditioner and I was up but I always wondered like what does that mean per

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:44.180
mile now we know ten percent hey who wants to listen to the time that open

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:50.860
Mike Eagle taught me to drop my mom a fucking crutch okay nobody I do fuck you

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:55.380
or are we we also have we have some hits on here there's there's Rob Schrab's

01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:03.740
oh shit yeah all right have fun for a minute and 35 seconds

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:32.380
fucking shit

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:43.340
fucking shit man oh shit oh my ass let's let's let's bring game master Spencer

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:57.220
Crittenden out

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:12.980
oh shit oh shit oh shit shit shit fucking shit

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:19.980
my my thumbs are greasy from the all those chips that I eat I eat a lot of

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.980
chill all right I don't have anything else

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:28.980
chips are delicious I have some chips before I came here all right hey so I

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.860
think I think we'll do things in hashtag

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:50.460

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:58.380

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:12.220
was like it's like yeah you gotta get up the fuck your mama thing because it has

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:16.380

south it's over it's over I mean I was I was very impressed by that I did I you

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:35.220
know it's a good show because we've been through a lot on stage without that was

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.900
that was interesting because there were clips in there where we didn't have the

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.580
audience and then we did have the audience like the Cheapy Peepy thing

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:45.900
there was no audience right yeah I wonder they didn't like it it couldn't

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:51.300
afford it they didn't like it yeah we had a lot of good times you know we had

01:19:51.300 --> 01:20:01.420
some bad times oh we also had some bad time no I'm just making that up it's

you know me you could have done better I could have done better like you know

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.820
it's hard because you know we live in this world it just reinforces the fact

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:20.540
that you're not you're not supposed to be free it's supposed to be happy and like

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:26.180

rhyme it way yeah do it first day of rap camp let's go let's go first day of

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:24.740

gonna lock her is a hard word you give me this is good this is good don't do the

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:38.500
last word and I'll do the last word let's start with let's just start with

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:50.620
the ace walk our ways through the east yeah yeah yeah oh no all the clips for

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:55.540
our 400th episode go ahead and don't say the last word of the line I'll say the

01:25:55.540 --> 01:26:13.980
word I wake up in the morning and I go to bathroom I never really know when I'm

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:40.180
gonna go run run DM passive aggressive I don't think that I don't think that you

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:46.420
should be learning from me but like like a trade secret is you come up with a

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:52.380
word and then while you think of the rhyme for that word you say I fucked your

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:57.580
mama so hard that I like that gives you just enough time so you just like went

01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:05.540
to the kitchen and had some milk fucked your mama so hard I felt like that's

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.500
that's where the crutch okay so it would be like I woke up in the morning go to

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:15.540
the bathroom fuck your mama so hard in that bathroom yeah yeah yeah dreaming go

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:20.780

01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:03.700

wait I'm gonna pick you up it's gonna be 900 degrees fuck fuck you wait I'm part

01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:18.180
of the white boy so I ironically have the high road it doesn't make a ton of

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:24.260
sense but it'll shut you up if you're thinking about complaining about it in

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:30.500
the back room wait I want to hear Emily on that vocal thing can you can you pass

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:35.260

if that's a joke about my period I don't know how to rap at all

01:29:47.900 --> 01:30:00.660
in the bathroom take your friend out one night have a real good

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:17.060
time in the bathroom I have no rhythm at all that's the problem and the solution

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:24.740
yeah in the bathroom it reminds me of the time that John Mayer wrapped on our

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:44.180
show for 24 seconds John Mayer's flow was fucking like crazy I'm gonna drive

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:51.700
home you're gonna say John fuck you there's some things you just shouldn't

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:55.020
do you're gonna run the whole transcript through that brick you call the brain and

01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:58.420
then you're gonna complain you're gonna ask if you can take it out the next time

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.380
they put it up on the net you're gonna say uh that thing I'd rather forget can

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:05.860
we take the rap out we do it yet I just don't want to hear from people telling me

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.460
that there was something I said that they could get the smell on me that I was

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:12.980
trying too hard in the backyard I bought the milkshake but it had lard and it was

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:17.860
all curdled yeah I don't want to be that way so I think I did it right but now

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.860
that I did that's why I kept rapping tonight so when I get in the car I think

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:25.940
about the rap this is the thing that I did that's crap to make it off balance

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:30.340
to make it strange it's got to be strange so tomorrow is a new day a new

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:34.700
direction a new way I got to improve I got to change I did it too well tonight

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.860
that wraps my brain I got to get in the tub and wonder what I can write to tell

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:41.780
you can you take a couple things out tonight cuz I don't like two legs I

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:46.660
don't like four legs I don't like even pegs I like shit missing that's when my

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:56.900
brain goes blessin out with your love on up there in the tub on holy fuck you

01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:04.220
bury the lead you fucking wrap good I'm embarrassed that I did it in front of

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:08.140
you you can never come back again

01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:16.580
apparently the key is looking up to the right actually I'm like doing this with

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:21.380
your fingers yeah that was something she that's all you got to do yeah what

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:25.300
were those keys for around his neck what was it what was those keys I don't know

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:32.380
that the height of the driver's an uber so he has to have keys to get in well so

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:40.820
much hate so much hate they were keys to the bathroom in the bathroom

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:53.620
all right well you know what when I never meant fucking dick in the knee cap

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:58.460
with a microphone that does hurt children please you like that noise

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:14.500
Rob shit yeah what you're doing drive you're doing away this is getting nice

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:24.100
sorry those clips are at meltdown which is now gone and yeah I think we always

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.660
knew how special that place was and of course when it closed down we were all

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:33.620
able to eulogize it but the thing like I always thought oh this is a good place

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:39.180
because of the crowd that it draws and the simplicity all this stuff but like

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:44.580
I like we moved out of there and tried to do this show at my stage at star burns

01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:48.700
with an audience without an audience we tried to do the show in a in a VO booth

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:55.620
now we've moved here this place is great no disrespect but the crazy thing that

01:33:55.620 --> 01:34:02.060
is to realize that oh meltdown was more than actually the absence of a bunch of

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:06.380
stuff it was actually like inimitable it was it like like I always thought of it

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:11.340
as like oh if we could just get these pillars out of here we'd be great yeah

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.140
but but there was something secret about it and I don't know what it is do you

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:23.780
think it was as as true like natives of that place and and founding parents of

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:28.140
it what was it I'll start you off with one thing that people said over and over

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:33.540
again was it simple altitude like is it just at the audience the audience and

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:37.940
the performer like down at the same level I think that's part of it it always

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:42.780
felt like a basement to me like your coolest friends like parents basement

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.660
that you got to hang out in and do whatever you wanted and everybody left

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:49.500
you alone they say low ceilings are important for comedy yeah I think they

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.580
are ceilings are good music it just had like a it just the opposite of an Indian

01:34:53.580 --> 01:35:00.420
burial ground whatever that it's like it just yeah living air but was that

01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.580
place a fluke was it was it was it was it was that an accidental discovery or

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:08.700
did someone have to stand in that space and go this would be perfect for

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:13.700
performance I think Gaston the owner of meltdown comics always wanted it to be a

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:18.140
performance space but I think he wasn't ever gonna put in time to like he didn't

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.580
he didn't have the ability to put in time to like make it one so that was kind

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:25.540
of it was kind of loosely like random shows were there and then that yeah and

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.300
then we started doing meltdown there and then I got hired to like do all the

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:33.740
other shows there which is how which is how Harmontown because I was like I need

01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.860
show so bad and there was nothing happening but it just always felt

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:41.300
magical yeah it's like you know you say all those things about the high ceilings

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:45.260
and the that it was a pretty small space whatever it is whatever the physical

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:50.020
dimensions of a great comedy theater are it had that but it also had I don't know

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.020
the fact that you have to go through a comic book store to get there there was

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:58.620
you know it was like as you said an Indian living air about that place there

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.700
was something magical about it you know I understood the cut that's what that's

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:06.740
the thing is that I understood the comic going through I understood the factual

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.620
information oh it's hip yeah it's the new Largo it's it's it's LA it's

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:18.100
underground it's but like understanding that as a as a matter of

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:22.540
fashion which makes it like actually artificial where you go like oh the

01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:28.660
reason this is successful is actually because of mass hysteria is actually a

01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:34.980
disservice because that room is inimitable like we sit here in this

01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:38.380
room for instance we like try to like we're like god damn it now that we're

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:42.620
in a different room how do we get that fucking meltdown sound and it's crazy like

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:47.940
if I were gonna record an album whatever that is anymore I would I would be

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:52.100
like can we buy the melt meltdown spit like like because what is it it's

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:56.380
mysterious yeah there's also a whole community around it I mean we would see

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:59.140
people come to our show and then they would become friends and people like

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:04.260
met there and got engaged and married and divorced and you know it was on to work

01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:08.340
here and when I don't like if you guys got married after tonight you'd be

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:15.820
monsters like why did you marry we were sitting next to each other in a fucking

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.220
auditorium downtown it'd be like you monster you deserved this divorce I'm

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:26.220
kidding I'm kidding your audience has always been the most special of all the

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:32.100
audiences I will say that meltdown ever had the most like literally people saying

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:36.060
bringing in their own chairs because I told a guy once will you pay the money

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:40.580
for the chair like jokingly and he brought his own chair to be like now I

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:45.540
get it free yeah I didn't guess who that was and I had no choice but to be like

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:51.380
you have bested me please come on it just does it rhyme with Thratom Flaw

01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:59.660
Floodberg 100% yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I didn't I mean sorry sorry I

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:03.300
knew our audience is special but I always thought that that place was so

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:08.820
special and I will we'll be fine here too but also it's been 300 episodes so

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:14.340
why not stop you know let's just stop just stop are you the netting stop it

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:19.780
stop bro are you not making this podcast stop making it I'm not fishing for

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.020
that

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:28.220
I said is this the last episode can you swear to that I want to see what

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:33.820
happens now I'm too drunk to make decisions I am I'm just tired I'm

01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:39.140
tired of being me tired of being famous stopping doing the podcast won't stop

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:44.060
you from being you will it though yeah no but I could be me in a dark room where

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:49.900
no one can hurt me anymore like you can hurt yourself who's the one person who

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:56.060
hurts you the most what no I I no one has ever given me more pleasure than

01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:04.340
myself believe me you locked me in a room with me I'm gonna experience a lot of

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:10.380
pleasure that's the one thing I know for sure there will be no pain you come

01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:15.900
back in a year and there'll be like a lot of blogs on the wall and it won't be

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:23.300
written in ink anyways what else is the black bags if you need them what else is

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:26.940
on the docket well look wait we didn't even like if I was a Martian I was

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:29.940
listening to the podcast like oh who's Kumail and Emily who the fuck are you

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:35.220
guys like last we bid you guys kind of farewell there there was never an

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:41.460
official thing but like our ships drifted apart you we haven't spoken to

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:47.300
you guys what what what has changed about life like is there anything we got

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:51.140
some fake grass in our lawn instead of real grass did you guys move you got a

01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:56.180
nice house oh are you still living in the same places when you were non Oscar

01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:01.060
nominated well when you get nominated you get a house the nomination doesn't

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:07.220
come with a deed to a new house yeah and then take it away from someone just a

01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:10.820
normal person all the nominees of your category move into the same house and

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:15.300
the winner gets to keep it that's unfortunate so Jordan there now yeah

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.900
yeah we call it our house I mean yeah no we're in the same place right in

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:28.180
terms of career both as actors writers like so thought like like if you to the

01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:33.060
extent that you can remember so imagine this path before the big sick and now

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:38.020
then the big sick is this big black box that's like we can't analyze that but

01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:42.420
imagine that as a black box for the purpose of the equation so can you can

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:51.140
you compare like what has like really everything it's very different good good and bad sure

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:55.740
mostly good more good than bad yeah we get to choose what we want to work on

01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:59.620
rather than being like oh it'd be cool if we got this job either one of us people

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:05.820
think we know what we're doing oh my god the best part very scary yeah mostly is

01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:11.300
that is that like it's because the obviously the agents like are able to now

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:15.620
it's like they're able to get people are able to say can I meet with them and the

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:18.740
answer is yes and like you get to they have these meetings that you never

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:24.540
thought you'd have and so it's all it's it's mostly positive right yeah well the

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.220
greatest thing really is the thing that we've wanted to do for years and years

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:33.740
and years we for a little brief window right now we're in a position where we

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:39.540
can do them right can go away very quickly yeah yeah like if I if like my

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:43.220
next the next movie I mean if it comes out it doesn't do well it could go away

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:48.540
right then you see it all the time so so we're trying to we're very aware of

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:53.500
that it's a little bit so yeah that was that raise your anxiety which is a

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.820
terrible thing to happen to you that wouldn't have been the case before you

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.700
hit the moon with us now it's like the expectations are high I mean I'm sure

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:05.660
you're aware of this we're like and so everybody keeps telling us don't write

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.020
your second thing right your third thing right like don't well first of all I've

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:13.820
actually never heard that and that like that's fucking it's great right that

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:19.460
sounds awful and accurate yeah horrifying yeah that sounds awful because

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:21.940
there's so much pressure on you to like recreate what does that mean I don't

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.660
quite understand it mean skip the second thing just because you put so much

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:27.660
pressure on yourself for what were you gonna write oh my god what will you

01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:30.580
guys be doing next they're like skip it just go to the next we would literally

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.460
be doing press but everyone else knows this is your second thing yeah it's not

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:39.300
as good yeah we would be doing press this idea that there would be pressure on

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.860
you that you would go say you loved poodles and you're like and then you

01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:48.740
made the big sick and like the big sick made everybody like J. J. Abrams wants

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:53.580
to meet with you and then you're like do we pitch him the poodle movie or do we

01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:59.180
like pitch him a fucking Star Trek poodle thing or like like you have an

01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:03.660
anxiety that didn't exist when you were just like I'll fucking do anything I

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.940
want there's a fear when you actually get the freedom to do whatever you want

01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:11.340
of like oh shit now I have to do whatever now I have to bet right yeah now

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:15.940
I have or the house went yes exactly that's exactly right we've done a good

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:21.500
job of only doing what we so that what we want to do has not changed and where

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:27.700
we've been able to do that we haven't like what do you say that we like before

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.980
our movie that we were like we want to make stuff like sure yeah yeah is the

01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.020
kind of stuff that we're both doing individually and together so it's like

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:37.020
that part's good but then it's also like when you get the freedom to do

01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.860
whatever there's like a certain terror in the freedom to do whatever here's my

01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:46.180
most sensitive crazy question because I don't even I've like you guys are life

01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:51.500
partners and writing partners what does that do to a relationship like like to

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:55.060
be under like I've never makes you take all your clothes off when you take a

01:43:55.060 --> 01:44:00.100
shit yeah and I put all of his clothes on when I take a shit so that's what's

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:04.220
changed you guys have been very candid so I would just have like have you had

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:11.140
fights that have like been brought on by monstrous fights absolutely yeah you

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:14.620
don't have to share them because I think that's too yes well we live in two

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:20.100
gossipy a world so it's not gossipy so we have had fights because the thing is

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.940
if you if you have a fight with a co-worker there's a ceiling to where

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:25.900
that fight can go yep but if you're having a fight with a co-worker who's

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.740
also the person you're in love with the ceiling is much higher so you can start

01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.900
on a lower really the basement's much lower yeah starting on like hey I

01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:40.660
disagree it should be like this with a co-worker you're like it can't really

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:45.980
get as personal as it can with this so you we really had to have rules we had to

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:50.020
figure out how to be able to write together I think if you shared a couple

01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:54.300
of those would be valuable first of all to me I have a I have a girlfriend who's

01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:00.300
a writer like we get we get by okay it's fucking hot it's it's a challenge to

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:05.500
like approach the area yeah because and we're not partners we don't work on

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:09.300
stuff together so like if you guys figured out how to not kill each other we

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:13.260
just have like a couple rules of like you can't you have to find the specific

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:16.380
we literally booked time to work with each other rather than just assuming that

01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.100
the other person's available I think that's a big one you have to have those

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:23.340
lines otherwise just hanging out at home can be worse so if that so to be clear

01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:27.940
about that if you guys are like hey as lovers let's go stay at this hotel and

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:32.340
have a pina colada's if kumail's like mmm that's a good pina colada I think the

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.380
protagonist should think it's like knock it off my face yeah okay literally in

01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:42.540
the shower before you came here you're like can I ask you a word question no hey

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:47.820
I'm in here taking a shit I'm not showering I can understand your confusion

01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:59.100
I'm naked well we have we have specific work times and then as you said if we're

01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.660
like just hanging out we have to get the other person's probably like if she

01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.220
thinks of something for the movie or whatever we're working on she has to be

01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:09.660
like hey can we switch gears so you and the other person has to give you

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:14.100
permission and that makes a huge difference give us is there a safe word

01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:23.300
for to get to get out look fucking too much yeah ruining the honeymoon yeah

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:26.620
and don't do it in bed no talking about work stuff in bed that's a big one yeah

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:32.740
and yeah and we also don't like the way we write together is when we like when

01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:35.300
we're like breaking a story or something we're together but then we don't

01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:41.340
actually write in the same room that would destroy those drafts back and

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:46.500
forth and but you know it's really it's great like so we're like working on

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:49.860
something right now together and it's like really exciting because we'll like

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.700
talk about it and then later in the day I'm like I always thought of that one

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.780
thing I don't think anybody in the world but her could have thought of that and

01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:00.860
it's really exciting and it's also like she'll write something and I'll be the

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:05.060
first person in the world to read it and that's very exciting it's like I get to

01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:18.260
look inside her brain so to the positive I feel the same way about you and I

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.580
think that's part of it is starting with that respect of like oh I really like

01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:25.460
what he does and what a cool thing that I get to have access to it before

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:28.460
anybody else and you have to kind of start on that foot of like I'm a big

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:32.060
fan of this person because if not if you're coming at it from like a how can

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:36.180
I fix what they've done then you're already losing right yeah I mean I'm

01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:43.460
never gonna find love well you don't have to start there you don't have to

01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:49.540
start here you can you can you can just be at right aid and be like she shares

01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:54.180
my interest in these knit socks the best boyfriend I've thought about this I

01:47:54.180 --> 01:48:02.660
thought you were the best boyfriend did you think about it in the bathroom can't

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:12.300
you see it in her drafts yeah why is everyone named Steve Agee I think that's

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.540
amazing I don't want to lose that if only for myself just that idea because the

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.140
it's like you know how magnets like they have fields so like they can propel

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.220
each other as easily as they can like they can like magnets are out of fucking

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:28.100
control they get in the presence of each other and they do shit beyond your

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:35.700
control I'm not being insane clown posse I I also don't understand magnets but

01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:42.180
I'm not pretending I do but I but it's like because Cody and I aren't writing

01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:47.100
partners we don't write together but she's the first writer I've ever been

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:53.660
with and like when the truth is like for her to say hey would you read my script

01:48:53.660 --> 01:49:01.740
like it it's it sends fucking spasms of panic through me really yes because what

01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:05.260
you guys have achieved is you're like oh I'm a big fan and all this stuff will

01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:10.780
you you've you've worked together and other stuff and it's like I'm like I

01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:15.580
think there's like things like I freak out because I'm like what if I fuck up

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:19.500
what if I what if you fuck up while reading her stuff well what if what if

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:23.620
what if anything about this perfect stasis you're like what if I don't like

01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:29.500
it it's like you guys are to put it in Star Wars terms you like what you guys

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:36.820
are kind of describing to me is like hey we're we're Luke and Han and I'm like

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:42.700
but people change roles and then I'm like like what but if you if you if you

01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:46.700
see a writer from across a bar and then you're like you start talking and then

01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:49.100
you start dating and then you hook up and you're in a relationship with a

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:54.500
writer it's like you're Han and Han and like you're who's gonna shoot first like

01:49:54.500 --> 01:50:01.140
like like like like like like like on you never you don't you don't want to

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:06.580
fuck with that like you know baby oh she just wants another drink

01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.300
Cody hello everybody

01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:17.820
Cody have a seat I'm really just feeling came out here to remind you to shut

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:21.860
the fuck up listening from back there

01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:32.540
but yeah I mean it is work I'm not saying that this the way that we work

01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:37.740
together is it's still work you have to sort of figure out and there's still

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:43.580
bumps and we both think we're alpha still yeah that's not like that doesn't go

01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:46.500
away you just have to kind of like realize like oh maybe sometimes there's

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:50.660
two alphas are too bad it's like yeah it doesn't go away I have achieved that I

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:57.540
have that with Rob a little bit like like like when we write together like like

01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:01.500
Rob and I have written stuff together for 20 years and then like Justin who

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.620
did Rick and Morty like you for you find partnerships with people where you're

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:15.180
like okay this works and it doesn't always work but when you think about the

01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:21.100
math of it like the the everybody in this room might look oh I get together on

01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:24.100
Wednesdays and I write with my friend and we're trying to write a screenplay

01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:27.980
together and they're my writing partner take the difficulty the challenge of

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:35.260
that relationship multiplied times oh unrelated to anything that I do like oh

01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.820
I'm dating this person I'm trying to make that work and then you multiply those

01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:44.940
two things that's why I'm like what how are you guys well we were not in that we

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.740
were able to work together and not write together because writing is a sort of a

01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.660
very personal thing very vulnerable yeah very vulnerable thing so we sort of you

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:57.780
know with meltdown I was performing and she was producing the show and then we

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:03.740
hosted a podcast together so we slowly worked up to figuring out how to write

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:06.860
together because that is you guys had a precedent of not punishing each other

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:12.940
for vulnerability things like that like I think that's important as a mental

01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:18.540
health professional maybe not to go I don't think that hurts no if you're

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:24.740
gonna write with a lover find a shrink maybe it's the lesson no all right well

01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.980
thank you for answering that stuff frankly well the other thing that's great

01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:33.340
is that we do we're very similar and the things we like I think for different

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.140
reasons and so we're able to write together because we have the same

01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:43.420
aesthetic the same taste but we sort of focus on different things of it so we

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.980
kind of have different strengths that work well one of you the better dialogue

01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:51.700
or story person or is it like are you kind of both equally strong there like

01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:55.060
you guys kind of share roles well Emily's very good at character stuff

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:59.660
because she's a therapist and tell them about your thing about how you sort of

01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:03.740
well when you're like theorizing someone you're you're you're you're telling

01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:06.380
about how you accidentally caught that murderer while we were writing that

01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:13.260
Nash Bridges spec and he's also very good at that too like and yeah we both

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:16.460
have we're both kind of good at the same stuff I would say we don't need to like

01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:21.220
get ready yeah we're both good at the same stuff I would say yeah it's awesome

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:24.940
yeah I watched your movie way too late but I watched it on a plane it was like

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:31.380

Mr. Yahoo, there is a board meeting that is happening actually in the room you're standing in right now.

02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:50.780
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:52.780
Someone just wanted to remind you of that.

I'm CEO, head of the stockholders and chief board member. My name is Johnson.

02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:13.780
I'd like to know why we spent $30 billion this year on TV shows that no one wanted to watch.

02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:22.780
The new form of comedy explains itself.

02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:26.780
Roll the film, roll the film.

02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:33.780
In the 1938 series of new form of comedy, look at those boys go.

02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:35.780
Cary Grant's got a new form of comedy.

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:36.780
I'm just gonna leave.

02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:37.780
I'm just gonna leave.

02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:40.780
Lisa Yahoo, you could find your own way home, right?

02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:41.780
I'm only seven.

02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.780
It's okay, here's $50.

02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:44.780
I'm rich.

02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.780
Look at those gams.

02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:48.780
I'm gonna start my own network.

02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:50.780
Good luck with that. Good luck with that.

02:01:50.780 --> 02:02:01.780
It's super easy. It's so easy. Good luck. It's super easy. Good luck.

02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:11.780
That's how Ciso was born.

02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:13.780
Give us another joke, Dan.

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:15.780

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:23.780
Give us one of your famous Dan Harmon shoe jokes.

02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:25.780
Dan, come on.

02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:29.780
Top five Dan Harmon best shoe jokes.

02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:32.780
We're starting with the fifth joke.

02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.780
All right, here we go.

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:35.780
We're going live.

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:36.780
What's he doing?

02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:37.780
We're going live, people.

02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:38.780
We're going live.

02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:40.780
All right. Jesus Christ, man.

02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:41.780
Number five.

02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:50.780
The guy walks into his shoe store with a bottle of champagne and his cock hanging out of his pants.

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:59.780
The shoe woman says, can I help you, sir?

02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:03.780
And he says, what do you have in an 11 and a half?

02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:05.780
She takes him in back.

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:12.780
There's a sheep there wearing a beautiful pair of ruby slippers on its front hooves.

02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:19.780
And these amazing Air Jordan cross trainers on its rear hooves.

02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:33.780
With this gaping mouth for a butthole, a human mouth with teeth and lipstick and a tongue.

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.780
She says, have at it and goes back to the front of the store.

02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:40.780
He's left holding the champagne and his cock.

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:49.780
She's sweeping up later, he comes out with an empty bottle and no cock.

02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:53.780
She says, did you enjoy the 11 and a half?

02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:57.780
He says, at these prices, I'm going to need more champagne.

02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:03.780
We'll be back with joke number four.

02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:07.780
What do you call a shoe with no sole?

02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:14.780
The top of a sock.

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:19.780
That was a little more cerebral than number five.

02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:24.780
He's making us think.

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:46.780
Why did the Asian shoe in a racist society

02:04:46.780 --> 02:05:01.780
go to the horse's stable when he felt untied?

02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:07.780
They wanted to find the laces.

02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:09.780
I was looking for the laces.

02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.780
This is a racist society.

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:14.780
Here comes Dan Armand.

02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:18.780
I do shoes come in pairs.

02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:32.780
They like to converse.

02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:35.780
We build the number one joke as the number one joke for a reason.

02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:37.780
It has to top the converse joke.

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:42.780
The converse joke is a fucking 24 carat goddamn piece of cheese.

02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:45.780
All he has to do is tell one more joke.

02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:47.780
All he has to do is tell one more joke.

02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:49.780
Because they like to converse.

02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:52.780
It's got to be the best joke of the night.

02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:53.780
Damn, I'm going to fucking...

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:54.780
We got a hit.

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:57.780
We got a big, titted hit here.

02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.780
Big, titted hit here.

02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:00.780
One more joke.

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:02.780
Oh, my God.

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:04.780
Emmy season.

02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:05.780
Sweep, sweep.

02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:07.780
Moonshot.

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:09.780
We're going to be so fucking rich.

02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:11.780
All he has to do is tell one more shoe joke.

02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:12.780
Only one more joke.

02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:13.780
Oh, my God.

02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:14.780
One more joke.

02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:16.780
It's Susan and Gary from the booth.

02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:17.780
Can you hear us?

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:18.780
Oh, God.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:19.780
Holy shit.

02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:20.780
Yes.

02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:23.780
We're coming back from Tony Taco Time in five seconds.

02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:24.780
Oh, my God.

02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:25.780
Just be yourself up there, sweetheart.

02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:26.780
We love you.

02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:27.780
We got a big...

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:28.780
Kick it home, shoe boy.

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:29.780
Take it home.

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:30.780
Come on, shoe boy.

02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:31.780
Come on.

02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:32.780
Kick it.

02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:33.780
Kick this joke.

02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:34.780
Here we go.

02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:35.780
Here we go.

02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:36.780
Here we go.

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.780
In five, four, three.

02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:44.780
What do shoes and tarps have in common?

02:06:44.780 --> 02:06:45.780
What?

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:57.780
Under specific circumstances, they are covering corns.

02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:07.780
That's been it for Dan Harmon Tells Shoes.

02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:08.780
Yeah.

02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:09.780
Okay.

02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:10.780
Yeah.

02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:11.780
Yeah.

02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:12.780
Baby dance.

02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:13.780
Baby dance.

02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:14.780
Baby dance.

02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:15.780
Baby dance.

02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:18.780
Big pile of booties out front.

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.780
Candid camera hosted by Alan Funt.

02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:23.780
Saw your mama just the other day.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:25.780
Got her on my knees and I started to pray.

02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:28.780
Because your mama's booty is like a god to me.

02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:33.780
It's all that I ever see, like a tucci roll in those old ads.

02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:34.780
I fucked your mama.

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:39.780
The name is Tad.

02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:42.780
Thaddeus by birth.

02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:46.780
Then later shortened to the informal tad.

02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:49.780
I took your mama to the beach.

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:50.780
I fed her apples.

02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:51.780
I fed her a peach.

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:58.780
She started to get heartburn because the citric acid, that's what we learned is causing her

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.780
esophagus to fuck her up.

02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:03.780
Now she's in a sarcophagus.

02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:04.780
She's not dead.

02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:07.780
She's just getting out of her head.

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.780
Little meditation exercise.

02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:12.780
Fuck your mama between her tucci thighs.

02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:14.780
Put my head inside.

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.780
I got reverse born.

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:20.780
Now I'm wide.

02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:22.780
I'm wide.

02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:24.780
W-I-E-E.

02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:26.780
I meant to say it.

02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:28.780
It's a new way to say cool.

02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:29.780
Wide.

02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:31.780
You're wide now.

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.780
All right.

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.780
I'm good.

02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:36.780
I can't say, man.

02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:38.780
That shit was wide.

02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:40.780
That shit was wide.

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:53.780
Well, I was gone for far too long, but now I'm back.

02:08:53.780 --> 02:09:00.780
I was gone and for too long, your Comptroller was black.

02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:03.780
But now I'm back and here to stay.

02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:15.780
And all I want to say is some people call me Pringles Dick.

02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:19.780
But I never really found out why.

02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.780
I don't really have a Pringles Dick.

02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:25.780
I just keep my dick inside.

02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:31.780
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:34.780
Some people call me Pringles Dick.

02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:36.780
But I never really found out.

02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:38.780
No, I never found out.

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:40.780
I never really found out why.

02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:42.780
If you know, sing along.

02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:44.780
Some people call me Pringles Dick.

02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:47.780
But I never found out why.

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.780
I don't really have a Pringles Dick.

02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:54.780
I just keep my dick inside.

02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:00.780
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:03.780
Some people call me Pringles Dick.

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.780
But I never really found out.

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:25.780
I never really found out why.
