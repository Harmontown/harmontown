{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:27.000\nOh, you lucky sons of bitches.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:34.000\nWe had a goody in store for you tonight. Please keep the emotions high.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:57.000\nThe hands clapping for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:08.000\nDance break. Come quietly or there will be entertainment. Robocop, the original Robocop.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:12.000\nI'm going to go to my grave protecting its vision. Sick of it.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:17.000\nThese are the Robocop photos of the guy who looks like Batman.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nLooks like Batman. Just call it Batman. Sick of it.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:27.000\nI don't care who's sick of hearing about it. Sick of this new Robocop shit.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:32.000\nIt's a good movie. It's as good as Casablanca. It's as good as Citizen Kane.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.000\nYou don't remake those things. Everyone would be offended if you tried to remake them.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:44.000\nJust because it's about a Robocop doesn't mean you're allowed to just go over there and pee a little bit and see what takes.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nYou wouldn't do that with a so-called classic film.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nI haven't seen the artwork you're talking about.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nThis is a guy. He looks like Batman. It's black and it's rubber.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nYou know that someone's going to go, Robocop, there's a crime happening.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:04.000\nThere's going to be a thing where he goes, I'm Robocop. I'm online.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nMy prime directive is to get jiggy.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:13.000\nHe's going to jump in a CG thing up two towers and off of a roof and land.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nIt's going to look like Spider-Man.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nYou're going to go, why is that Robocop? Robocop's a tank.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:27.000\nRobocop was awkward. Robocop was an original concept. Robocop was a guy encased in ridiculous silver metal.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nI don't want to get off on a lot of tangents tonight.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:35.000\nAgain, the hallmark of Harmontown. Focus.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:40.000\nI want to focus. Tonight's theme is...\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nI'm just going to look at my cell phone.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nLet's diagnose me.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nI thought in the past that maybe I have Asperger's.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nI don't know if I do or not.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nHaving met Adam Goldberg, who's a frequent attendee of ours.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nThere he is. He's right center audience.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nAdam, say something just to support my case.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nYou think that I have Asperger's. That's correct.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:04.000\nYou can tell. You can feel it.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nI have Asperger's.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nHe also has a lot of rage.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nI'm starting to think, okay, now maybe I don't have it.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nAm I bipolar?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nNo.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nWho said no? A bipolar person said no.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nAre you bipolar?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:31.000\nWhy were you so confident that I'm not bipolar?\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nThere's a common thread between everything you do.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nThere's a rational streak.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nNothing you say just enters into the realm of what the fuck was that.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nWhy are you an expert in bipolarism?\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nDo you have a family member?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nOne. We see him sometimes.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nSometimes he's not there.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nMaybe you're bipolar.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nNo. Don't throw him under the bus.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nHe's here to report.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nI feel like I'm in a good mood tonight and sometimes I'm sad.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nBut that's everyone.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nThat's people.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nI think Dan, I don't know what you would call this,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nbut you have certain superpowers\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:12.000\nand any super power is going to give you a deficiency in some other way.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nFor instance, we know that whatever my power is,\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:20.000\nit takes away from bathing.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:26.000\nIs that like, do we have super dirt?\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nDo you know what angers me?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nThis is why I don't go to a therapist is because this is what stopped me\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nafter going to 11 therapists is that I was Googling around.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nI'm like, what's wrong with me?\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nWhat is my ism? What's my itis?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI was Googling around and I'm typing in symptoms like psychologically.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nI want to know. Solve me. Help me.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nLift the hood. Optimus my prime.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:54.000\nI found a thing that matched a lot of my symptoms.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.000\nIt used to be called Christ complex.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nBut then because that's too western,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nthey started calling it superiority complex.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nThat's when I stopped believing in psychology\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nbecause you wish you could diagnose everyone that's better than you.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nFuck you. Fool me 3,000 times.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:21.000\nFuck you. There's a disease called guy that's awesome.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:26.000\nFuck you. That's amazing. That's not fair.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nDo you think you're actually better than people or do you think...\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nI'm pretty sure I'm all right.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nI get the distinct impression that I'm fine.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nWho are people that you think are better than you\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:41.000\nthat have skills that you wish you had?\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nThe Coen brothers.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nAnd Robocop.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nAnd Greg Proups, who is our guest tonight.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nGreg Proups is here tonight.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nAnd I wanted it to be a surprise.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nI wanted to surprise you guys.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nI fucked it. I fucked it up.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nI want to take a survey because I want to shame Jeff.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nI want to get to the bottom of this.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nApplaud if the reason you're here tonight...\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nI have to word this carefully because you all love Greg.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nEveryone should love Greg.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nBut applaud if the clincher for you coming tonight\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nwas that you knew Greg was going to be here.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nThat's Greg Proups.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nThat's the loudest applause coming from the Greg Proups section.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nAnd by section I mean Greg Proups in the corner.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nSo I'm just saying that you get a promotional value\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nout of saying Greg Proups is here.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nBut here's what I wanted.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nI wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons tonight\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nand have us get into really dire circumstances,\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nlike being a real dungeon hard rock place.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nAnd then go, what are we going to do?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nAnd then have Greg come in like Carmine Regusso in Happy Days\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:55.000\nand just bail us out.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nWill he have a wife beater on?\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nYeah.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nI grew up in...\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nOkay, there was a show called Happy Days.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nThere was also a show called Laverne & Shirley.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nLaverne & Shirley was spun off of Happy Days.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nGary Marshall produced both of them.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nCarmine Regusso was the sexy guy on Laverne & Shirley.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nSo he became a part of the Happy Days milieu.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nThey did an episode of Happy Days\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nwhere Richie was supposed to fight some bullies\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nand then Fonz showed up and then everybody\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nhad their own gang.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nAnd then there was this scene where these bullies were like,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nyeah, is that all you got?\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nAnd then you heard Carmine Regusso,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nit's like, oh, I go from rags to riches.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nAnd this 47-year-old man,\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nlike, sidled under the stage and the audience went nuts\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nbecause it was Carmine from a different sitcom\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nthat was also successful.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nIt was a golden age of TV. It was amazing.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nWe can edit all this explanation out.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nThis never happened. I'm sorry.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nYou guys missed a lot by being 25.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nYou think that you get more. You get less.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nI'm going to die and then there's going to be\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\n10 years after I die when it's just hot\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nand there's just locusts. That's it.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nAnd maybe a couple holograms.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nBig deal.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nAnd it's going to be flickering marble.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nThat's all a hologram is.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nIt's just going to be a statue of a guy that invented holograms.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nAnd it's going to turn.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nAnd it's going to go, you know,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nin order to make sure you know it's a hologram,\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nevery, you know, you know that.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou know that.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nFucking dicks.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nSo is it time to diagnose you after that rant?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nI don't know. We'll have to bring shrinks up.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nThat's what I'm proposing.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nWhy don't we have Greg Proups diagnose you?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nThat guy. That narcissist.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nAll right.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nLadies and gentlemen, let's bring our\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nsurprise guest to the stage, Mr. Greg Proups.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:51.000\nThank you.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nStill dances, 80.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nYeah. You were doing the mud dance.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nI was. I love your tiger fit.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nWe had a good time last week.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nLet's desperately and joylessly try to recreate it.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nLet's just make the same thing happen all over again.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nI don't think you're maybe mildly Asperger.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nDo you get depressed?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nYeah, I do.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nI'm actually depressive reactive or manic.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nBut you don't get manic. Depressive reactive.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nYeah. You know, like, you don't.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nDo you have periods where you like write\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\n20,000 pages of dialogue?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nYeah. Okay.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nManic depressive.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nYeah.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:50.000\nThe best part of manic depressive is the giddy mania.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nYeah. Because you get so much done.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nNo, I, yeah.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nWell, I'm going to, if that were me,\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI would be on a high tonight.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nI'm like manic tonight.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nI feel like even though there are nights\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nwhen I come up here and we're doing this once a week now.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nThere are nights when I come up here and they\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nfar outnumber this type of night.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nThere are nights when I come up here and I go,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nwhat am I doing? Why am I doing this?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nIt's a justifiable question.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nWhy did they pay $10?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nIt doesn't make any sense. What am I supposed to do?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nExcept, honestly, express the fact that I\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\ndon't belong up here and I hate myself.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nAnd then there's nights like tonight\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nwhere I'm like Robin Williams.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nI'm like, oh, I've got a cup on my head.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nI'm Mr. Cuphead.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nAnd, and, and, and the...\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nStrum Thurmond.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nYo, hey, yo.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nHelp me, Lou.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nYou're starting to look like a...\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nAll right.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nBut yeah, something's wrong with me.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nNo, I think the manic part's what I wish I had.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nI was more hyper, I think.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nI'm more of a depressive stoner than anything else\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\neven though I'm pretty hyper.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI don't have the periods where I write the novel\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nand then you do and that's what I wish I had.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nWell, what can we trade?\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nYes, please.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nBecause I don't have the periods where I go on tour\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nand everyone wants to talk to me.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nI don't have the periods where I make everyone around me happy.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nQuick, quick change.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nGreg, you don't really like...\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nYou don't love being out like in a bunch of people\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nswarming over you after a show,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nbut you're on the road all the time.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nI am.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nSo you love the acclaim and the...\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nWell, I don't do it for the acclaim.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nI do it because of Edith Piaf.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nI do it because of the art.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nBut the acclaim is nice.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nI mean, the difference is\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nI'm not a lawyer, you know what I mean?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nOr a tax collector.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nI'm not a venal member of society.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nI'm not a publican.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nYou know, that people come up...\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nWhat's the word in the Bible?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nWere they a render under Caesar and all that?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nYou know, like one of the disciples is a tax collector\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nfor the Romans because they farmed it out.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nAnd people are bummed when they see you\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nif you're a lawyer or you're a dickhead.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nLike, I saw Karl Rove in an airport\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nand I was like, ugh.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nI didn't go like, oh, Karl Rove's here.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nThis is awesome.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt's usually, aren't you the guy on the thing?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nRight.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nAnd then I go, yeah, and then I explain who I am.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nNo, so people are usually happy\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nto see you because you're a comedian.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nSo they associate you with a moment of joy in their life\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nas opposed to, oh, I saw you\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nand you raised my fucking taxes in the 80s.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nThe last time I saw your face\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nI was finding out it's illegal\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nto have a right knee.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nExactly.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nAll I want to do is pour a ton of manure on your lawn.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nWell, I'm looking at my phone.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nI need to remind people because it's almost October\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nand it certainly will be October\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nby the time you're hearing this podcast.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nI think you'll find it's rocktober.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nAnd right now it's the end of September.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nYes, September just finished.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nIt's very important if you care about this podcast\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nthat you dress like Jarith from the labyrinth\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nfor Halloween.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nThat's David Bowie's character from the labyrinth.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nDress like him for Halloween.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nI get two things on the docket to talk about\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nbefore we play Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nDocket tuck.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nApple friend finder.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nAnd life after death.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nOne in the same.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nYeah.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nGuys all signed up\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nfor your friend finder app.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nThere's a new friend finder.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nI signed up because of you.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nYou invited me so now I know\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nat all times that you are at home\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nand Dino is at the drawing room.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nI thought it would take a year\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nfor you to actually\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nregister this thing.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nI'm probably going to turn it off.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nI didn't think you would take to the idea\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nof people watching your location.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nBut the thing is I don't have a girlfriend.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nIf I had a girlfriend and I could see\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nwhere she was at all times,\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nI'd blow my brains out.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nBut you don't have a girlfriend so why do you care?\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nThe thought of that stressed me out.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nYou have a girlfriend.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt's going to destroy your relationship.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nKnowing where each other are is going to destroy you.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nFirst of all I don't care where she is.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nSecond of all I like\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nthe idea of her caring where I am.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nI like that she can see where I am.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nIt's going to destroy you.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nI'll see you when we continue.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nNext topic.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nGreg, do you have any idea what we're talking about?\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nI adore apps. I think they're so useful.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nThat's great proof. Give them a big hand everybody.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nGreat to have you.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nWe'll see you next week.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nThere's a reason why we bring them back.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nYou've been a real treat.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nGet the fuck back up. We sit down.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nDungeon Master, come up and set your\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\ndungeon troves up.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nSpenser everybody.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nDungeon Master extraordinaire.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nFor those of you just tuning in\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nwe have a\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nwe have a Dungeon Master who's bearded,\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nponytailed and got a bag full of\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\ndice.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nThis is the ongoing saga\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nin the campaign of\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nSharpie Buttsalot\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nCorp.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nAnd Greg\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nmade a late entry as a unicorn character\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nlast time.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nTime and all with Codeine.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nAll right.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nGreg, what do you think happens after you die?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nYou mean in this game?\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nI was going to say Spenser writes it down on a piece of paper\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nand then it's logged forever in the anals of\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nDungeons and Dragons.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nAfter we die I have the slightest notion\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nI hope that it's\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\na fantasy world of what you wanted\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nin your life. If there's any justice\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nand I know this is going to sound wildly sentimental\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nto this crowd of youngsters but\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nI want to be with my wife after I\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\ndie. Me too.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nHigh five\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nheard around the world.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nI hope\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nit's fun after we die.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nI hope it's not a\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nterrible, you know like in the sci-fi movies\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nwhere you wander through a universe where clocks fly\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nby and then there's an odd random duck\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nand then a book and then a dude\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nin 18th century with a wig on comes by\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nand you're like, was that Coleridge?\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nAnd you're like, what the fuck was that?\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nThat to me seems kind of tedious.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nI don't like the purgatory limbo.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nNo one wants to do that forever.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nThat's the seventh time I've seen Taft.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nRight.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nNot noteworthy.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nNot deserving of my time tunnel.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nDoes Taft have an eternal home or what the fuck?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nAre they supposed to save him?\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nAre they supposed to talk him into eating less?\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nI mean, it's past the fact.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nI like the Elysian fields,\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nyou know, Greek mythology part where it's just\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nyou know, eternal rivers and fruit and whatnot\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nand I would like there to be\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\na big bag of weed that just never goes down.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nYou know, you reach into it and like, fuck,\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nit's still the same level. Instead of that\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\ndisappointing, oh fuck, I'm down to the last one.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nI wonder if animals, like there's got to be\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nan animal that thinks while it's dying.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nOh shit, I'm dying.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nWe think that that's the big difference.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nI think elephants, right?\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nWell, it seems to be that way.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nAt least they mourn each other after they're gone.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nBut that might not, that might be,\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nthat's not evidence of anything.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nThat's how we express the fact that\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nwe think about the fact that we're dying.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nWe bury each other.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nAnd what's odd is that Neanderthals\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nburied each other, which we are not Neanderthals.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nWe're not descendants of them.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nWe're cousins of them.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nThe same way we were chimps and gorillas.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nDidn't we kill the Neanderthals?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nYeah, we hunted them to extinction.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nWhatever we are.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nThat's why I didn't understand that fucking ABC show.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nIt made no goddamn sense.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nI kept making Neanderthal puns and\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nCro-Magnon puns and it was like,\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nmake up your mind where human beings\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nwe descended from.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nMy beef with cavemen\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nwas that they had a lot of\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nmakeup and teeth in\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nand they couldn't enunciate.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nThere was a lot of\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nlisping and slurring going on.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nThey shot it single camera, but it mainly took place\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nat and their places of work.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nThey really should have just made it\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nThe pilot of cavemen that wasn't the one\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nthey aired, but the one they got it picked up\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nthat was just flagrantly racist?\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nNot racist, just too racial.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nYeah, but like, yeah.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nI don't think it was racist.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nCavemen have big dicks and dance really well.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nIt was pretty\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\non the nose.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd they're often named stuff like A.J.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nand Scuttlebutt and whatnot.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nI get what you're saying, bro.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nMy mind says that focus groups were uncomfortable\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nwith the amount of racial allegory.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nWhich, having seen it, I agree.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nNow, that could mean two things.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nThat people think it's racist\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nor that people thought it was hack\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nto keep going to that well.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nAnd I did think, having watched the pilot,\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI was like, we get it!\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nWhat happens in the afterworld?\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nYeah, exactly. How did we get on?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nNo, I'm asking you.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nWhat do you think, Dan? This is my biggest fear.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nPrince said you can always see the sun.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nHe said, and night, night.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nI take Proup's answer\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nwho cares, who knows, who we don't know.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nBut the thing that terrifies me\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nis something that this\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nmy original Dungeon Master\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nGraham said at one point\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nwhen we were in high school\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nhe said, well,\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nwhen you die\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nyour awareness\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\ngets bisected\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nmoment by moment\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nand you become\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nthe moment\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nbefore your death\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nas you approach it\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nit gets increasingly small\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nand if you cut\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\na number that measures\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\ntime in half\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nyou can cut it in
