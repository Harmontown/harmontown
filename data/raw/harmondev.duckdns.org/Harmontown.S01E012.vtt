00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Oh, you lucky sons of bitches.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
We had a goody in store for you tonight. Please keep the emotions high.

00:34.000 --> 00:57.000
The hands clapping for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:57.000 --> 01:08.000
Dance break. Come quietly or there will be entertainment. Robocop, the original Robocop.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm going to go to my grave protecting its vision. Sick of it.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
These are the Robocop photos of the guy who looks like Batman.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Looks like Batman. Just call it Batman. Sick of it.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
I don't care who's sick of hearing about it. Sick of this new Robocop shit.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
It's a good movie. It's as good as Casablanca. It's as good as Citizen Kane.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You don't remake those things. Everyone would be offended if you tried to remake them.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
Just because it's about a Robocop doesn't mean you're allowed to just go over there and pee a little bit and see what takes.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
You wouldn't do that with a so-called classic film.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I haven't seen the artwork you're talking about.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
This is a guy. He looks like Batman. It's black and it's rubber.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
You know that someone's going to go, Robocop, there's a crime happening.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
There's going to be a thing where he goes, I'm Robocop. I'm online.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
My prime directive is to get jiggy.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
He's going to jump in a CG thing up two towers and off of a roof and land.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It's going to look like Spider-Man.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
You're going to go, why is that Robocop? Robocop's a tank.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
Robocop was awkward. Robocop was an original concept. Robocop was a guy encased in ridiculous silver metal.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
I don't want to get off on a lot of tangents tonight.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Again, the hallmark of Harmontown. Focus.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
I want to focus. Tonight's theme is...

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm just going to look at my cell phone.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Let's diagnose me.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I thought in the past that maybe I have Asperger's.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I don't know if I do or not.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Having met Adam Goldberg, who's a frequent attendee of ours.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
There he is. He's right center audience.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Adam, say something just to support my case.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You think that I have Asperger's. That's correct.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
You can tell. You can feel it.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I have Asperger's.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
He also has a lot of rage.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm starting to think, okay, now maybe I don't have it.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Am I bipolar?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Who said no? A bipolar person said no.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Are you bipolar?

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
Why were you so confident that I'm not bipolar?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
There's a common thread between everything you do.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
There's a rational streak.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Nothing you say just enters into the realm of what the fuck was that.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Why are you an expert in bipolarism?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Do you have a family member?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
One. We see him sometimes.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Sometimes he's not there.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Maybe you're bipolar.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No. Don't throw him under the bus.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
He's here to report.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I feel like I'm in a good mood tonight and sometimes I'm sad.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
But that's everyone.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
That's people.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I think Dan, I don't know what you would call this,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
but you have certain superpowers

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
and any super power is going to give you a deficiency in some other way.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
For instance, we know that whatever my power is,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
it takes away from bathing.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
Is that like, do we have super dirt?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Do you know what angers me?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
This is why I don't go to a therapist is because this is what stopped me

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
after going to 11 therapists is that I was Googling around.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm like, what's wrong with me?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
What is my ism? What's my itis?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I was Googling around and I'm typing in symptoms like psychologically.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I want to know. Solve me. Help me.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Lift the hood. Optimus my prime.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
I found a thing that matched a lot of my symptoms.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
It used to be called Christ complex.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
But then because that's too western,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
they started calling it superiority complex.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
That's when I stopped believing in psychology

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
because you wish you could diagnose everyone that's better than you.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Fuck you. Fool me 3,000 times.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Fuck you. There's a disease called guy that's awesome.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Fuck you. That's amazing. That's not fair.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Do you think you're actually better than people or do you think...

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm pretty sure I'm all right.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I get the distinct impression that I'm fine.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Who are people that you think are better than you

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
that have skills that you wish you had?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
The Coen brothers.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And Robocop.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And Greg Proups, who is our guest tonight.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Greg Proups is here tonight.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And I wanted it to be a surprise.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I wanted to surprise you guys.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I fucked it. I fucked it up.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I want to take a survey because I want to shame Jeff.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I want to get to the bottom of this.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Applaud if the reason you're here tonight...

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I have to word this carefully because you all love Greg.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Everyone should love Greg.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
But applaud if the clincher for you coming tonight

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
was that you knew Greg was going to be here.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That's Greg Proups.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
That's the loudest applause coming from the Greg Proups section.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And by section I mean Greg Proups in the corner.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So I'm just saying that you get a promotional value

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
out of saying Greg Proups is here.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But here's what I wanted.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons tonight

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
and have us get into really dire circumstances,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
like being a real dungeon hard rock place.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And then go, what are we going to do?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And then have Greg come in like Carmine Regusso in Happy Days

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
and just bail us out.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Will he have a wife beater on?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I grew up in...

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay, there was a show called Happy Days.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
There was also a show called Laverne & Shirley.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Laverne & Shirley was spun off of Happy Days.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Gary Marshall produced both of them.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Carmine Regusso was the sexy guy on Laverne & Shirley.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So he became a part of the Happy Days milieu.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
They did an episode of Happy Days

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
where Richie was supposed to fight some bullies

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
and then Fonz showed up and then everybody

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
had their own gang.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And then there was this scene where these bullies were like,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
yeah, is that all you got?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And then you heard Carmine Regusso,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
it's like, oh, I go from rags to riches.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And this 47-year-old man,

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
like, sidled under the stage and the audience went nuts

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
because it was Carmine from a different sitcom

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
that was also successful.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
It was a golden age of TV. It was amazing.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
We can edit all this explanation out.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
This never happened. I'm sorry.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
You guys missed a lot by being 25.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
You think that you get more. You get less.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I'm going to die and then there's going to be

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
10 years after I die when it's just hot

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
and there's just locusts. That's it.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
And maybe a couple holograms.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Big deal.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And it's going to be flickering marble.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
That's all a hologram is.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
It's just going to be a statue of a guy that invented holograms.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And it's going to turn.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
And it's going to go, you know,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
in order to make sure you know it's a hologram,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
every, you know, you know that.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You know that.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Fucking dicks.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
So is it time to diagnose you after that rant?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't know. We'll have to bring shrinks up.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
That's what I'm proposing.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Why don't we have Greg Proups diagnose you?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
That guy. That narcissist.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
All right.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring our

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
surprise guest to the stage, Mr. Greg Proups.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Thank you.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Still dances, 80.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah. You were doing the mud dance.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I was. I love your tiger fit.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
We had a good time last week.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Let's desperately and joylessly try to recreate it.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's just make the same thing happen all over again.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't think you're maybe mildly Asperger.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Do you get depressed?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, I do.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm actually depressive reactive or manic.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
But you don't get manic. Depressive reactive.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah. You know, like, you don't.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Do you have periods where you like write

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
20,000 pages of dialogue?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah. Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Manic depressive.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
The best part of manic depressive is the giddy mania.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah. Because you get so much done.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
No, I, yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, I'm going to, if that were me,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I would be on a high tonight.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm like manic tonight.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I feel like even though there are nights

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
when I come up here and we're doing this once a week now.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
There are nights when I come up here and they

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
far outnumber this type of night.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
There are nights when I come up here and I go,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
what am I doing? Why am I doing this?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's a justifiable question.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Why did they pay $10?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It doesn't make any sense. What am I supposed to do?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Except, honestly, express the fact that I

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
don't belong up here and I hate myself.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And then there's nights like tonight

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
where I'm like Robin Williams.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm like, oh, I've got a cup on my head.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm Mr. Cuphead.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And, and, and, and the...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Strum Thurmond.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yo, hey, yo.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Help me, Lou.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You're starting to look like a...

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
All right.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
But yeah, something's wrong with me.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
No, I think the manic part's what I wish I had.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I was more hyper, I think.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm more of a depressive stoner than anything else

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
even though I'm pretty hyper.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I don't have the periods where I write the novel

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
and then you do and that's what I wish I had.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, what can we trade?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes, please.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Because I don't have the periods where I go on tour

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and everyone wants to talk to me.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I don't have the periods where I make everyone around me happy.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Quick, quick change.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Greg, you don't really like...

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
You don't love being out like in a bunch of people

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
swarming over you after a show,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
but you're on the road all the time.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I am.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So you love the acclaim and the...

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, I don't do it for the acclaim.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I do it because of Edith Piaf.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I do it because of the art.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But the acclaim is nice.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I mean, the difference is

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm not a lawyer, you know what I mean?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Or a tax collector.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I'm not a venal member of society.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm not a publican.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
You know, that people come up...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
What's the word in the Bible?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Were they a render under Caesar and all that?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
You know, like one of the disciples is a tax collector

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
for the Romans because they farmed it out.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And people are bummed when they see you

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
if you're a lawyer or you're a dickhead.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Like, I saw Karl Rove in an airport

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
and I was like, ugh.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
You know what I mean?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I didn't go like, oh, Karl Rove's here.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
This is awesome.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's usually, aren't you the guy on the thing?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Right.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And then I go, yeah, and then I explain who I am.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
No, so people are usually happy

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
to see you because you're a comedian.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So they associate you with a moment of joy in their life

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
as opposed to, oh, I saw you

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
and you raised my fucking taxes in the 80s.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
The last time I saw your face

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I was finding out it's illegal

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
to have a right knee.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Exactly.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
All I want to do is pour a ton of manure on your lawn.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, I'm looking at my phone.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I need to remind people because it's almost October

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
and it certainly will be October

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
by the time you're hearing this podcast.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I think you'll find it's rocktober.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And right now it's the end of September.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Yes, September just finished.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
It's very important if you care about this podcast

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
that you dress like Jarith from the labyrinth

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
for Halloween.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's David Bowie's character from the labyrinth.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Dress like him for Halloween.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I get two things on the docket to talk about

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
before we play Dungeons and Dragons.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Docket tuck.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Apple friend finder.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
And life after death.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
One in the same.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Guys all signed up

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
for your friend finder app.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
There's a new friend finder.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I signed up because of you.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You invited me so now I know

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
at all times that you are at home

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and Dino is at the drawing room.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I thought it would take a year

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
for you to actually

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
register this thing.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm probably going to turn it off.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I didn't think you would take to the idea

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
of people watching your location.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But the thing is I don't have a girlfriend.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
If I had a girlfriend and I could see

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
where she was at all times,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I'd blow my brains out.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
But you don't have a girlfriend so why do you care?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
The thought of that stressed me out.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
You have a girlfriend.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
It's going to destroy your relationship.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Knowing where each other are is going to destroy you.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
First of all I don't care where she is.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Second of all I like

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
the idea of her caring where I am.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I like that she can see where I am.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It's going to destroy you.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'll see you when we continue.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Next topic.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Greg, do you have any idea what we're talking about?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I adore apps. I think they're so useful.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That's great proof. Give them a big hand everybody.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Great to have you.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
We'll see you next week.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
There's a reason why we bring them back.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You've been a real treat.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Get the fuck back up. We sit down.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Dungeon Master, come up and set your

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
dungeon troves up.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Spenser everybody.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Dungeon Master extraordinaire.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
For those of you just tuning in

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
we have a

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
we have a Dungeon Master who's bearded,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
ponytailed and got a bag full of

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
dice.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
This is the ongoing saga

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
in the campaign of

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Sharpie Buttsalot

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Corp.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And Greg

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
made a late entry as a unicorn character

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
last time.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Time and all with Codeine.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
All right.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Greg, what do you think happens after you die?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You mean in this game?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
No, no, no.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I was going to say Spenser writes it down on a piece of paper

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
and then it's logged forever in the anals of

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Dungeons and Dragons.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
After we die I have the slightest notion

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I hope that it's

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
a fantasy world of what you wanted

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
in your life. If there's any justice

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and I know this is going to sound wildly sentimental

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
to this crowd of youngsters but

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I want to be with my wife after I

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
die. Me too.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
High five

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
heard around the world.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I hope

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
it's fun after we die.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I hope it's not a

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
terrible, you know like in the sci-fi movies

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
where you wander through a universe where clocks fly

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
by and then there's an odd random duck

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
and then a book and then a dude

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
in 18th century with a wig on comes by

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and you're like, was that Coleridge?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And you're like, what the fuck was that?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
That to me seems kind of tedious.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't like the purgatory limbo.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
No one wants to do that forever.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That's the seventh time I've seen Taft.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Right.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Not noteworthy.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Not deserving of my time tunnel.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Does Taft have an eternal home or what the fuck?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Are they supposed to save him?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Are they supposed to talk him into eating less?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean, it's past the fact.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I like the Elysian fields,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
you know, Greek mythology part where it's just

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
you know, eternal rivers and fruit and whatnot

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
and I would like there to be

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
a big bag of weed that just never goes down.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
You know, you reach into it and like, fuck,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
it's still the same level. Instead of that

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
disappointing, oh fuck, I'm down to the last one.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I wonder if animals, like there's got to be

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
an animal that thinks while it's dying.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh shit, I'm dying.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
We think that that's the big difference.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I think elephants, right?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, it seems to be that way.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
At least they mourn each other after they're gone.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
But that might not, that might be,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
that's not evidence of anything.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
That's how we express the fact that

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
we think about the fact that we're dying.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
We bury each other.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And what's odd is that Neanderthals

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
buried each other, which we are not Neanderthals.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
We're not descendants of them.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
We're cousins of them.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The same way we were chimps and gorillas.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Didn't we kill the Neanderthals?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah, we hunted them to extinction.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Whatever we are.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
That's why I didn't understand that fucking ABC show.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It made no goddamn sense.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I kept making Neanderthal puns and

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Cro-Magnon puns and it was like,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
make up your mind where human beings

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
we descended from.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
My beef with cavemen

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
was that they had a lot of

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
makeup and teeth in

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and they couldn't enunciate.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
There was a lot of

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
lisping and slurring going on.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
They shot it single camera, but it mainly took place

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
at and their places of work.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
They really should have just made it

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
The pilot of cavemen that wasn't the one

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
they aired, but the one they got it picked up

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
that was just flagrantly racist?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Not racist, just too racial.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah, but like, yeah.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I don't think it was racist.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Cavemen have big dicks and dance really well.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It was pretty

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
on the nose.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And they're often named stuff like A.J.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and Scuttlebutt and whatnot.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I get what you're saying, bro.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
My mind says that focus groups were uncomfortable

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
with the amount of racial allegory.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Which, having seen it, I agree.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Now, that could mean two things.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
That people think it's racist

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
or that people thought it was hack

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
to keep going to that well.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
And I did think, having watched the pilot,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I was like, we get it!

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
What happens in the afterworld?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah, exactly. How did we get on?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
No, I'm asking you.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
What do you think, Dan? This is my biggest fear.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Prince said you can always see the sun.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
He said, and night, night.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I take Proup's answer

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
who cares, who knows, who we don't know.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
But the thing that terrifies me

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
is something that this

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
my original Dungeon Master

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Graham said at one point

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
when we were in high school

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
he said, well,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
when you die

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
your awareness

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
gets bisected

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
moment by moment

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and you become

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
the moment

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
before your death

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
as you approach it

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
it gets increasingly small

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and if you cut

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
a number that measures

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
time in half

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
you can cut it in half an infinite number of times

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
which means that the moment

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
you die

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
you may have

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
the last thought that you ever had

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
forever

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
in your life

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
that

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
that bummed me out

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I was 17 when I heard that

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
and I don't know what you're talking about

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I was like, God forbid

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
you be eating a graham cracker

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
and a bus hit you

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
and now for the next 550 million years

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
you're like, good graham cracker

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
that's hell, that's hell

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Here comes President Toph

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
he's eating a whole box of graham crackers

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
You want to go out like Michael Keaton

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
for that movie

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
150 years ago, people died a lot younger

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
death was a part of reality

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
people faced death, it was a thing

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
you could die young, you could die old

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
people were mainly like, don't fuck my wife

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
that's only mostly

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
went out I think

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
did I ever tell you the story

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
did I ever tell you

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
wait, wait, sorry

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
did I ever tell you the story of Schrab's interpretation

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
of the

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
you know that major Tom song

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
the 80's version

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
of the major Tom song

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
4, 3, 2, 1

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Greg who sings that

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Greg who sings that song

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
probably Greg, I can't remember

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
but it was like this major Tom

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
and at one point Ground Control says

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
hey are you still up there

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and Tom who's in space says

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
send my wife my love

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
then nothing more

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
that's the narrator saying there was nothing more

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
I was talking about that song with Schrab

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and Schrab was like

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
God that's fucking badass man

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
and I was like yeah that is pretty

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
it gets you in the ribs

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
it's not Citizen Kane

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
but it's like Kevin Klein and Dave

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
it hits a spot

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and he's like yeah, yeah I know

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
it's just like the guy's out in space

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and he's about to lose contact

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and the last thing he's thinking is don't fuck my wife

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
and I said what?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
and he's like no

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
it's like give my wife my love

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
then nothing more

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
like don't also give her

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
no Rob, no Rob

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
you don't understand where the quotation marks end

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
he thought that the guy was

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
going out into space

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
it's like give my wife my love

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and don't give her your dick you fucking

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
you horny bastards

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I know she's hot

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I met her at an astronaut bar

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Kevin I know it's gonna be you

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
you fucking cack

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
my favorite is our friend Matt Young

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
you know the song Panama by Van Halen

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
oh yeah

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
there's that breakdown where

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
David Lee Roth goes

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
run a little bit hot tonight

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
can barely see the road and the heat coming off it

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
reach down between my legs

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
ease the seat back

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
my friend Matt Young thought

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and it was his favorite song and I can't blame him

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
when he thought the lyrics were

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
reach down between my legs

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
ease the seed bag

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
ease the seed bag

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
ease the seed bag

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
is there any grosser way

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
to imagine

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
first of all

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
the idea that they would have had the imagination

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
to say seed bag

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
seed bag

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I don't want to think of it as a seed bag

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
but if you had one

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
you'd need to ease it once in a while

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I constantly do

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
the last thing you need to do is tense the seed bag

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
every time I sometimes

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
have occasion to like

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
48% of our audience knows what I mean

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
sometimes you have to ease the

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
seed bag

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
sometimes you have to reach between your legs

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
especially when it's running hot

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and it has no place in rock and roll

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I can barely see the road because of the heat

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
it's running

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
easy seed bag

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
you know my comes and coming

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Spencer everybody

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Spencer our dungeon master

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
if you'd be so kind as to recap

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and take us up to date where we are

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
in the campaign

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
when we last met

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
our heroes were in a tavern

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
they were hearing

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
some rumors about a burnt building

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
that was rumored to be from the

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
embermaller rumor

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
and it was pretty meta

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
in pursuit of the beast

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
they set off

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
after talking to an old man

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
about his burnt farm

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
they ended up in a burnt field

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
where they saw a most miraculous sight

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
a unicorn

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Tylenol with codeine

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
was a wonderful unicorn

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
oh

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
for fuck's sake

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
steady boy

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
steady

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and with his help

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
they defeated the embermaller

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
then they returned to turn in their quest

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
to ferris the captain of the wardens

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
so you guys were just talking to ferris last

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
back in this town which is named what

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
hawk thorn what's it called

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
thorn vale

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
thorn vale

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
ferris the captain of the wardens

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
did we part ways with the unicorn

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
he ran off but

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
you may come back

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
they run fast

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
they can just come in anywhere

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
do you guys want your characters?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
can you pass these down?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
character sheets are being distributed

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
i've seen this thing announced

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
5 or 7 times and i still have no idea

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
what goes on

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
you totally lost the first one

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
i didn't lose shit

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
guys don't fight

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
alright so you were just talking to ferris

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
you had just gotten 14

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
100 gold pieces from him

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
as a reward

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
go

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
well enjoy your reward

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
you have slain the embermall

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
and you have shown most bravery

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
in such circumstances

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
let me leave you

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
one last tanker to veil before i take my leave

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
this guy is alright

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
this guy seems pretty cool

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
sharpie what's next?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
i don't know

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
i feel like you and i need to level up

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
you mean make out?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
no

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
how do we level up

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
i don't know what you're talking about

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
we should

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
are we in that tavern

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
spencer?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
good tip

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
good tip on that embermall

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
yes i heard you took him out

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
very impressive

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
did you have any help?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
we had a unicorn drop by

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
he sat on my face for a while

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
i'm not sure where that got us

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
but we certainly got out of there alive

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
a unicorn? those are quite rare

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
was it Tylenol with codeine?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
the very same

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Tylenol with codeine

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
with a conny forest to the south

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
oh

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
maybe we should go

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
hang out with him

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
i'd like to

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
once you've had a unicorn sit on your head

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
for a half an hour

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
you never go back

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
was that like a days walk to the south?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
it'd be about half a days walk

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
cha-cha what's

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
in it for us if we go down to the south

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
and hang out with a unicorn?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
i just told you where he stays

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
you got weird

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
what's in it for us?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
that's a weird thing to ask

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
time gentlemen please

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
time gentlemen please

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
you don't have to go home

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
but you can't stay here

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
let's get some horses in head south

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
don't they have a jingle?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
there's a commercial for Coran's Horses

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
of horses

this guy is so drunk sharpie

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
the dagger has a silver handle

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
with a gold pommel if that's a thing

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
that knives have or dares

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
it was dubbed to me by a man

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
who came here not three years ago

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
this very night

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
he was heading for the forest too

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
but he never got there

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
wait a minute wait a minute

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
this sounds like worthy of investigation

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
also he turned into the witch from Wizard of Oz

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
half way through

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
that seems an ill boating

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
something pleasing to the eye

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
you say a guy gave you that

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
and then he went off where

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
really sure did he went off toward the forest

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
never did see him again

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
well maybe he shouldn't have given you that dagger

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
maybe that dagger would come in handy sharpie

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
oh i think it'll be good luck for you

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
good on ya

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
get outta here apple looser whack

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
after being slapped in the butt

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
by the horse owner

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
the horses take off towards the forest

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
thank god the 1930s

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
was creeping me out

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
you reach the forest as dawn

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
is breaking

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
you're at the edge of the forest

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
the path delves into the trees

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
i examine the path

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
the path seems

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
of solid construction well traveled

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
i fucking love you so much Spencer

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
i examine the path

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
the path seems of solid construction

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
years of people walking on it

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
have given this path a solidly

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
constructed

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
feel the dust is packed tight

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
with the years gone past

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
several thousands of feet

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
more growth has occurred

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
on either side of it than on it

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
as walking upon walking

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
has resulted in less growth

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
sharpie i got a pretty good feeling

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
about this path

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
i think a lot of people have walked this way

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
two paths diverge

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
in a yellow wood

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
is that the only path

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
spencer? that's the only path you can see

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
but perhaps if you get farther away

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
from the path you might find another way in

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
you're out of the woods

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
you're out of the dark you're out of the night

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
do you hear that?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
step into the sunset into the light

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
i hear fairies

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
i'm not a fairy i'm a guardian

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
we approach the guardian

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
this path has been well packed

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
oh boy

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
one of these guys

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
look i like you guys

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
especially sharpie

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
the gnome i'm not that hot on

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
this forest is an exclusive

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
forest where people party like it's

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
1963

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
that's

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
900 years in the future

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
it's a year that doesn't exist yet

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
and that's why it's so hard to get in

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
i'm gonna let you guys

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
oh nice dagger

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
are you looking at my emerald dagger

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
it's kind of called pommel

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
i wasn't but that's nice too

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
you

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
yes i am looking at your dagger

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
it glisters like the very emeralds

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
of the sun

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
it glitters

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
a new word

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
if i present you this dagger

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
which has been promised to give me luck

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
through this forest would you let me access

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
bribest me gnome

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
you bet your tips

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
flattery

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
flattery charges my battery

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
i'll take the dagger

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
i need two up front

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
two up front

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
i know i'd go from rags to riches

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
no idea we enter the forest

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
alright we got into the forest thank god

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
so exclusive

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
upon entering

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
entering the forest

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Tylenol with codeine is noted of your presence

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
he can

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
do i smell gnome face

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Tylenol

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
gnome

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
sharpie

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
hello

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
what brings you all to my bailiwick

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
i thought i'd left you after the ember mall was

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
deceased by the thorns of grander

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
flask

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
by the flaming balls of cathy lee gifford

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
by the huge canyons

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
of nebraska

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
who's for drinkledoodles

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
i'd love one

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
i could murder a drinkledoodle right now

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
i've got unicorn punch

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and i've got unicorn koolit

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
what's the difference

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
about five cents

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
that's unicorn humor

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
excuse me while i take a lap

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
look at him go

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Tylenol

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
what do you think happens after you die

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
what happens after you die

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
i am immortal

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
are unicorns immortal

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
mostly

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
we live on forever in people's dreams

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
they'll never be a unicorn

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
that doesn't exist

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
if there's one child thinking of him

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
or a small boy matriculating

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
through a catholic school

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
is there any news

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
of any fortune to be had

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
in this forest

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
indeed at the edge of the forest they say

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
there lives a man

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
so dangerous that only spencer can

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
describe him

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Admiral Darkstars

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
started a cult

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
deep within the forest of shadows

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
the forest of shadows

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
used to be the conny forest

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
until a dark spell went off

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
corrupting the branches and very trees

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
themselves

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
the shadow forest threatens to overtake

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
the conny forest home of Tylenol

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
with codeine unless someone can prevent

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
the dark influence of the cult

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
this has been a bummer

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
most major

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
for the mornings are eclipsed

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
by the darkness and the evenings

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
full of it with fog

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
you seem pretty upbeat

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
considering that your forest is about to die

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I haven't seen all y'all in a while

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
where is

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
this Admiral Darkstar

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Admiral Darkstar, right?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
even though he is an admiral

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
upon the land he doth dwell

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
at the edge of the woods is he

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
some 50 hectares hence

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
that's like a couple hundred yards

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
many more hectares

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
underestimated I have

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
for I am equine in brain

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
and therefore my ability to discern

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
distances is somewhat impaired

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
maybe we should camp for the night

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
indeed, what an idea

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I will make a magic fire using my

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
fucking

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I have a hoof

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I have a hoof thing I can do

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
alright we should camp there for the night

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
we will end that the campaign chapter there

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
absolutely

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Spencher everyone

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
edit in or edit in and out

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
point if anyone parked on sunset

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
in front of Meltdown there are towing cars

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
in the next 30 minutes

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
for reals?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
wait what did you guys

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
we did park

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
if anyone parked on sunset right in front of here

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
you have 30 minutes they are going to start towing people

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
we got one taker

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
two takers

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
three takers

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
wait that happens every night

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I went to a junior high school

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and every fucking

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
day there was an announcement

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
through the whole school and they would say

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
if you are parked on Franklin

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
or Washington your cars have been marked

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
because they come by and mark your car

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
there are spots where they say

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
you can park there for an hour but we are watching

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
for the chalk on the tire

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
and you have to move your car

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
it was insane it was in a public school

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
and the teachers would have to bail

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
they would be in the middle of telling you about the meaning of life

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
and so a cell

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
DNA unravels

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
attention if your car is parked on Franklin

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
your car has been marked

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
so I will be right back kids

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
just

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
hang on to that thought

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
when DNA becomes RNA

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
becomes UNA becomes IDA

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I will be right back

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and they are going to move their fucking capri

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
whatever I didn't name the car

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
my girlfriend's car got

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
repossessed today

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
well shit

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
we were out at the drawing room having a

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
what I think can only be described

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
as an elegant daytime cocktail

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
at one of Los Angeles's

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
premier shit holes

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
day drinking and I'm thinking of you

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
day drinking and I'm thinking of you

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I wonder if there's 8,000 things that can go wrong with your car

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
when you go to find your car

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
you left to go pick up

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
to take Erin to her car that you had left

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
last night in Hollywood

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
for safety's sake

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
and then I got a text from you

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I was like where the hell is Dan

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and Erin's car has been stolen

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
because that's what we

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
we had already been to

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
the parking in front of a driveway

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
went to the impound lot, no

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
that means that it's been stolen

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
and then the last final

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
thought from her was

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
oh it's been repossessed

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
wasn't really repossessed

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I guess so

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
kittens McTavish

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
it's no fun

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
it's no fun to be poor

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
it's like the least fun thing

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
next to being rich

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
those are the two least fun things in America

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
in that order

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
being rich and being poor

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
why is being rich no fun

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
being rich is no fun

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
because it actually turns out to be

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
not as fun as when you were poor

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
so then you get all bummed out

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
because you spend

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
your entire time being poor

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
craving being rich

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and so there's an extra depression to becoming rich

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
there's a

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
in

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
slaughterhouse 5

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Billy Pilgrim

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
like there's a scene

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I don't know what you call it in a book

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
a chapter I call scenes

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Billy Pilgrim

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Billy Pilgrim is

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
a prisoner of war and he finds himself

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
eavesdropping on a group of Nazi soldiers

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
discussing the

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
imminent

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
conquering of America

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
they know they're in a war with all of Europe

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
and that America's just joined

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
this is Billy Pilgrim

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Kurt Vonnegut's avatar

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
he's the protagonist

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
he's listening outside a window

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
he's shuffling shit as a prisoner of war

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
he's listening to the Nazis discuss America

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and how are we going to defeat them

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
what is the Nazis

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
point of view on America

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
at the time of this war

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and it's just Kurt Vonnegut fucking riffing

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
about America

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
it has nothing to do with Nazis

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
he doesn't give a shit

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
he's using the Nazis as

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
a work from work like looking in

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and commenting on all of it

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
what do fascists

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
think about America

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
if you were a fascist country how would you

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
invade America how would you take it over

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
how would they look at us

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
and it's a naked

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
disgusting and vigorating

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
look at capitalism

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
through the fascist lens

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
turns out

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
not that much distortion

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
fascism

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
capitalism they're compatible

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
they both depend on the idea

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
that there's a pyramid in place

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
there's a bunch of people with a bunch of

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
shit at the top and there's a bunch of

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
way more people

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
with a bunch less shit at the bottom

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and the way you move up is by

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
turning people in you know the way you

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
move up is by clawing over people

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
the value at the top

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
is defined by the amount of people

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
that don't have as much at the bottom

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
you

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
it's Mary Kay Cosmetics

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
it's Amway

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
it's anything

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
it's Scientology it's any organization

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
that has traction

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
this room

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
there's been

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
anecdotal things about

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
professors who have studied this stuff

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
in their classrooms there was a professor

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
who started

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
as a joke he's like okay my name is

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
the wave and there's people who are in the wave

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
it was the equivalent

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
of the Stanford Prison Experiment

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
but it was an experiment fascism

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
don't even know enough about this stuff but I know

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
that we all are primates

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
we all want

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
desperately to not be excommunicated

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
by each other and we all

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
look to our left

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
and look to our right and go what am I doing wrong

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and is there any way to move up

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and sometimes it becomes

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
very evident by the guy

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
directly above you fucking up

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and you go like well why is that guy above me

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
he keeps fucking up

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
really he keeps fucking up tell me more

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
well yeah this guy above me

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
keeps fucking up

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
well would you like his job yes I would

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I would like his job

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I guess I'm a real hero

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
yeah

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
or you're a Nazi

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
depending on the context

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
depending on what's going

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
down the conveyor belt at the bottom

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
are you measurably

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
more or less happy having

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
some money versus being poor

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I don't

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
it's so hard to fucking tell

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
there's that documentary

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
there's this thing like

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
it's like 40,000

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
a year or something like you peak

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
at your like that's how happy you are

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and that you like

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
anything beyond that you're

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
no more happy than anybody

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
poverty is depressing

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
not being able to

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
pay for ramen noodles is depressing

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
not being behind

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
in your gas bills and having the government

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
yell at you getting red envelopes

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
in your mailbox and having people

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
knock on your door and go what is the rent

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
all of that affects

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
your emotional level as Joey

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Lewis the old comic said money isn't everything

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
but it eases the nerves it sure helps

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
but there's a certain

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
point where those knocks stop and the red envelopes stop

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and the ramen noodles are easy to buy

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
buy whatever the fuck you want

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
and that number is around

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
40 grand a year something like that

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
it always changes because what the fuck do these numbers mean

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
what does 40 grand mean

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
don't know what that means

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
but there's a level where it tops off

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and after that

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
you ain't ever gonna be any happier

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
than you are

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
the happiness level

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
the serotonin level

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
the amount of good mood that you have

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
it tops off fast

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
if you know where your next meal is coming from

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
and if you think

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
your girlfriend likes you

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
and

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
there's a couple of minimal

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
requirements you need to be really happy

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
and then you could be making

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
8 million dollars a week

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
on top of that and all you're gonna do is go

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
you're punching your girlfriend

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
and going do you know what it's like to have 7 million dollars

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
a week to spare

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
you don't make it any easier on me

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
why are you making it so hard

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
proofs how did you do it

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
proofs how do you handle

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
having millions of dollars

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
you're despicable

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
how poor I am

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
considering how awesome I am

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I think you're right though

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
it's the moment when you're really

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
striving and I think about

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I was so desperately poor

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
when you have those moments

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
where you go do I buy a pack of cigarettes

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
or do I buy food today

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
or what was that

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Susan Healy, a comic from San Francisco

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
used to have a great line where she'd go

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
the first thought you have when you wake up in the morning

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
is what in my room can I sell

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
and then that

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
that goes away

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
but then I always think there's another kind of

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
built-in unhappiness

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
but what struck me

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
when you were talking about that was

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
more than simply being comfortable

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
or

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
having enough money to live

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
the psychopathy

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
of people who have billions of dollars

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
who won't desist

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
like what keeps you going

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
at the Warren Buffett level

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
what keeps you going at the mid-long

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I can't wait to find out

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
you know what I mean?

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
that's when I keep asking myself

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
do they get up every morning and go fuck you

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
do they get up and go like

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I got a billion

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I bought a house last year

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
with all of my anguish

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
with all of my sweat and all of my sadness

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
there's a number value on the house that I bought

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
and it's bigger than any house

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
that in Milwaukee

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I was like oh I'm one of these people

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I'm a douche

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Detail's magazine is doing a photo shoot

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
called TV Mavericks

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
so they invite me to a photo shoot

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
some of the people that I love

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
people that certainly make TV shows that I love

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I'm a TV Maverick

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
so I'm going to be in Detail's magazine

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
they have

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
procured a location

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
we're going to shoot them, let's make it look glamorous

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
because they're Mavericks

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
and I show up to this house

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I eventually ask the caretakers of the house

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
what is this house worth

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
$82.5 million

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
no fucking way

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
it's built into the side of a hill

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
it was ridiculous

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
because I was walking around that house

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
and I was starting to go

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
ah fuck

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I should have put my toilet on the ceiling

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
yeah yeah

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
what kind of dumb dick am I

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
but I didn't

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
why don't I have an avocado server

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
in my living room

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I didn't

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
at no point was I having happiness

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I wasn't thinking like

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
many doesn't bring fun, that's the weird thing

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I was just like ah fuck

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I have regular grass

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I don't have moss from the Amazon

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
this guy has moss for grass

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
the same amount of beer makes you

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
drunk and the same amount of

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I remember feeling

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
like the king of the county

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
when I had enough money to buy

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
myself dinner and somebody else

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
or enough for a burrito

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
or enough to buy myself a beer

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
and tip the bartender

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and not pay the 75 cents and the guy like 50

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and like

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I'm rich with $10 as if I felt with any other amount

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
of money and that's

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
a good perspective to have

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I think the happiest moment of my life is like

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
25 years ago

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
when my wife and I weren't married and I got in a cab

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
with her after a gig and I remember thinking

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
she was the woman I wanted

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
to be with and everything and that

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
to me is the happiest moment of my life

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
not getting a big check

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
or being untellier or any of that fucking

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
it certainly won't make your parents happy

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
your parents are never fucking happy

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and it's like I made a bunch of money

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
that's what you wanted right and they were like

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
don't spend an hour in one place

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
fucking cock sucker fucker please

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
murder you

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Dan tell them about the google map thing

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
no I want to tell them a better story

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I want to tell them about you

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
when me and Schrab

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
it's already a better story

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
and we would hang out like when we met Jeff

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Jeff was a fucking vagabond

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
a straight up hobo

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
and we were

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
soup can on my head

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
and wearing a barrel

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
with suspenders on it

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I couldn't afford suspenders

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I had a spindle on a stick

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
we'd go over to Schrab's place

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
and we'd rent a movie

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
back then you rented movies from a geographic

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
location that housed

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
movies in a weird matrix

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
grid

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I want to watch young frankenstein

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
pulling it from a shelf

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
like young frankenstein driving it to my

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
frankenstein player

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
you guys don't understand what I'm talking

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
about it was a weird era

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
it was a lot more acquisition

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Walter Brennan still roamed the earth

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
and we would do it

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
oh my god he sure did

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Jeff was a fun charming guy that we knew in LA

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Rob and I had just moved out from Milwaukee

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
how do you guys from Milwaukee

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
we woke up one morning

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Jeff was gone

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
there was a note on the coffee table

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
that said

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Dan

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
tonight I did something

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
that I will never forgive myself for

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
you guys left

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
change on the table from Del Taco

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and I took it

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I took it because

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I'm broke

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I love you guys

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I'm ashamed of myself

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and I promise you

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I will give you this money back

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
it was this beautifully written

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
in millfield letter

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Rob was like

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
listen to this from Jeff and I was like

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Jesus Christ give him a fucking car

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
what is he what happened

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
yeah we were all

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
but Jeff and I was into you

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
for two grand at one point

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
and then you were into me and then back and forth

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
we would like god damn it

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
you made monster house and had a ton of money

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and then like a year later you didn't have a nickel

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
yeah

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
you bought centipede and pacman

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
and then you had the full arcade

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
stand up centipedes and pacman

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
for real you bought a centipede and a pacman

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
yeah

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
and then he didn't have two quarters to shake together

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
a year later

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
but he did have pacman

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I've been a puppet

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
a pirate

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
a pirate

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
a pirate

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
a pirate

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
a pirate

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
a pirate

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
before I got

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
the call that I was going to be on whose line is it anyway

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I was evicted by the sheriff from my apartment

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
and I had to put everything I had on a trash bag

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
and I lied to a new landlord

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
that I would have a thousand dollars in ten days

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I didn't have any money at all

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I had no prospects none

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
and I just completely lied and I was

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
thrown out I left a bunch of shit at this place

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I really should go pay her back

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I never got

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
she was kind of an asshole

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
you were one of those guys though that was like

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
what's going on over there

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
and you're like California law states that

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
you're only allowed to evict someone after

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
you knew

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I was ducking and dodging

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and I had two trash bags of my most valuable

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
things and I went to this new place

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and the landlord was from London

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
he goes Jeff I met you

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
with your friend Matt before

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I'm back in ten days just give me a thousand dollars

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
first and last

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
and you're good to go

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
if you want stay in my place until I get there

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
there's a little shitty back house

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
in Echo Park it was really cool but it was really tiny

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
so I'm in this guy's nice house

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and I got two trash bags and all I had

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
was the

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
45 or yeah 45 cents

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I found in my couch

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
and I knew that I could eat a

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
burrito that night and I was so happy about that

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and I put my bags down and

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
literally the phone rang and my manager Tracy

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
has been with me through thick and thin

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
she goes are you sitting down I was like no

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
no furniture

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
there's nothing

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I was in the guy's crib and I really literally

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
had the trash bags I mean she goes

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I had been auditioning for Who's London

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
anyway for three and a half years

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
it was my fifth audition ever

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I fought against you from the beginning

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
of the process I don't

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I don't want to harsh this story at all

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
you were like you were a real admiral

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
dark star

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
and she goes you got the thing

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and I go when will they pay me

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
she goes you work on Tuesday you'll have the money

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
for the days the day before the guy got back

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
and I was like okay

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Cole and I hung up the phone and I

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
hit the ground like a sack of

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
just like a wet sock I would

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
splat on the ground like not like oh lordy

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
the end of my tether and I was like

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I will be alive in ten days

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
and it was like a couple months later

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
that everything was fine but like it's a beautiful

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
thing of getting right to the end of that

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I was like I don't want to go work at

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Starbucks I'll blow my brains out I can't do it

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000

while being interviewed about why I'm unhappy

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
an attractive woman

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
comes up to me and says oh your spine looks normal

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
and not weird

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
is that a hunch?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I have a hunch that I am a sex monster

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000

I

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I'm trying to be the straight man

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
despite my geekily tendencies

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and puffed out cheeks

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
just on my account

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I'm with you Adam

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
on that one

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
by the way I didn't

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
he's my fantasy world

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I'm trying to get you to comb your hair

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
this was the best way

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
that I thought I could give you a slight

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
personal grooming tip was to

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
end Harmontown

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I can only get through to you

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
through podcasts

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
I'm not psycho

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
no you're god right now

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
you're not psycho

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Dan Harmon doesn't look good

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I don't look good

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
easy a lot though

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Adam what else

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
what can we do

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I'm a simple man

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I like the rag

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
that you use to wash your car

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I doubt you

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
you've washed your own car

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
have you washed your own car

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
I have Dan yes

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
if you buy one of those discount rags

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
you can't use that rag again

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I just want a car

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
rag that you can reuse

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I'm down

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
the one you use

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
you use it and then you're like

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
it's all grey

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I don't want to put that on my car

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
exactly

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
to dream

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
the impossible dream

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
to wash my car

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
where the dust always goes

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
you can't live in the valley

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
it is very dusty

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
keep going

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
to wash out that car

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
to be employed

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
with health benefits

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
for my spine

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
to dream

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I do not have

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
as pictures I'm weird

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
there is a difference

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
and when you get into your car

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I urge you

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
to reach down between your legs

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
and ease

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
the seat bag

59:54.000 --> 01:00:04.000
