00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Hello, gang.

00:01.000 --> 00:14.880
For the Tennessee Techwriter, downtown, MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, Harmontown is now in session.

00:14.880 --> 00:19.040
On a rare rainy day in L.A., I love it when it's gray in L.A., I like it that way.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.040
Let's bring out the Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.

00:23.040 --> 00:34.040
Apparently, we have a fog machine.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.040
Oh, do we?

00:36.040 --> 00:38.040
Yeah, I don't have tuberculosis.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.040
Speaking of which, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.040
You know him. You might like him. You might need to.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.040
His name is Dan Harmon.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.040
Thank you.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.040
It's very polite of you.

00:54.040 --> 00:58.040
It's quite smoky out here, right?

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
Oh, yeah.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.040
Smoking. Smoking it up.

01:01.040 --> 01:04.040
Smoke machine getting rough.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.040
Wrapping to the beat that's there.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.040
Wrapping without a care.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.040
Genuine apathy is what I feel.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
Wrapping.

01:13.040 --> 01:20.040
Okay. First order of business, let's do apologies and then corrections.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
Yay.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.040
Sorry for last week. My part of it. Not anybody else's.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
What do you mean?

01:26.040 --> 01:32.040
I was blackout drunk, so I had to listen. It's a fitting punishment when I'm like,

01:32.040 --> 01:37.040
look, we got together, we did some ad reads at like 2.30 p.m. that day.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.040
Yeah.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.040
And I knew what I was doing. I talked to my therapist all about it.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.040
I'm like, she's like, you know, it's like, well, yeah, we got everything else squared away.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.040
Now that you're almost a perfect person, you know,

01:45.040 --> 01:49.040
starting to talk about the drinking and talking about the drinking means just that, you know,

01:49.040 --> 01:54.040
just doesn't have to be a movie of the week or demonized or binary decisions or anything.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.040
Just talk about your relationship with it.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.040
And I was very personally embarrassed by my own definitions.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.040
Last week, I couldn't put a thought together.

02:03.040 --> 02:11.040
I trampled all over the rose garden of a new engagement by trying to say something about it

02:11.040 --> 02:15.040
that I just came out as me going like, what if I was a slave?

02:15.040 --> 02:18.040
I don't even know what I was trying to say.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.040
It's a fitting punishment that I have to listen to the episodes where I don't remember them

02:22.040 --> 02:28.040
because then it's like, yeah, nose and shit kind of like, listen to what you said.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.040
I mean, yeah, airlines are criminal organizations.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
There I said it.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.040
It doesn't need to be 70 minutes.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.040
I don't know why I think no one agrees with me,

02:40.040 --> 02:47.040
but apparently there's a certain line of alcohol where I just don't know anyone has heard me

02:47.040 --> 02:50.040
and that I've said the thing.

02:50.040 --> 02:55.040
But it's like just, I'm already normally when I'm sober or a little tipsy,

02:55.040 --> 03:02.040
like I'm naturally stammery and babbly and embarrassing and confessional and awkward.

03:02.040 --> 03:09.040
But I think there's a deal is broken when I come out so incoherent

03:09.040 --> 03:13.040
that I may as well be like anybody.

03:13.040 --> 03:18.040
There's times that Dan, like as I've known you for a thousand years, that you're...

03:18.040 --> 03:20.040
Let me get a drink while you're talking.

03:20.040 --> 03:29.040
There's times when you're really drunk.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.040
Like when I get really drunk, I cannot talk.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.040
You can talk drunk.

03:34.040 --> 03:39.040
And sometimes when you're saying things drunk, drunkenly to adverbize that,

03:39.040 --> 03:43.040
you still are kind of making sense.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.040
And I wonder, am I just being dumb right now?

03:45.040 --> 03:50.040
Are you making a profound thought or are you just...

03:50.040 --> 03:52.040
No, I probably make no sense.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.040
And you're probably drunk too when I'm drunk because we're probably drinking together.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.040
Because why else would you and I be so shit-faced?

03:58.040 --> 04:02.040
The answer is each other. Bad for each other.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.040
We're like the opposite of a mongoose and a cobra.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.040
And no, I don't mean a cobra and a mongoose.

04:06.040 --> 04:13.040
See, you're drunk. I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

04:13.040 --> 04:19.040
What happens is your metaphors get mixed into a jambalaya...

04:19.040 --> 04:21.040
Yeah, that only happens when he's drunk.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.040
Your metaphors are great.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.040
No, this is a very pithy observation.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.040
You can't just invert the cobra-mongoose relationship.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.040
You end up with the exact same thing.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.040
Right?

04:31.040 --> 04:34.040
You're just going to turn one person into the mongoose.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.040
I still hate each other.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.040
So how drunk are you right now, like one to a hundred?

04:39.040 --> 04:42.040
Sober as a non-supreme court justice.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.040
You know, when in...

04:45.040 --> 04:47.040
Sober as a Kavanaugh.

04:47.040 --> 04:52.040
See, so sober that I'm doing boring, semi-topical, non-applicable humor.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.040
Like, oh, he's famous for beer, right?

04:55.040 --> 04:59.040
Madonna's a whore and Kevorkian kills people.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.040
Yeah, I'm sober.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.040
Oh, yeah.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
Remember Dr. Kevorkian?

05:05.040 --> 05:07.040
There is a saying when people say I'm sober as a judge,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.040
and I don't know if that's meant to be...

05:09.040 --> 05:11.040
That's what I meant. Ironic or, yeah.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.040
I was going to say sober as a judge, and then I was like,

05:13.040 --> 05:17.040
oh, fun thing to do.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.040
It's dumb.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.040
Like, I'm not saying I'm funny when I'm sober,

05:21.040 --> 05:24.040
or interesting or entertaining.

05:24.040 --> 05:28.040
I'm just saying, for me, it's like $5, $10, whatever you pay

05:28.040 --> 05:31.040
to listen to me talk for a little while.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.040
Like, my definition of malpractice is

05:35.040 --> 05:39.040
I don't understand what you're even trying to say.

05:39.040 --> 05:44.040
Like, you're just, like, figure-aiding in non-sensities.

05:44.040 --> 05:49.040
Like, even Jeff Bridges figured out what he meant

05:49.040 --> 05:52.040
at the Golden Globes, like, he eventually.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.040
Somebody asked me recently, like, what is Harmontown?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.040
Is it improv?

05:56.040 --> 06:01.040
I would just define it more as drunken malfeasance.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.040
Yeah, it's self-destruction, I think, you know,

06:04.040 --> 06:07.040
like a little confession, a little transparency

06:07.040 --> 06:09.040
at the risk of, you know, a little,

06:09.040 --> 06:15.040
it's like a rich man's NASCAR.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.040
You technically, supposedly, you don't want to see me

06:17.040 --> 06:20.040
burn to death, but let's face it,

06:20.040 --> 06:25.040
what are you, like, watching me go in circles?

06:25.040 --> 06:29.040
Yeah, rich man's NASCAR.

06:29.040 --> 06:34.040
Okay, so that's my apology.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.040
And I don't mean I owe you an apology.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
I owe anybody, well, I owe you an apology

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
if you guys came here last week.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
I think if you come out, you come out in the rain

06:43.040 --> 06:46.040
or a shine or whatever, you leave your apartment,

06:46.040 --> 06:48.040
you're risking your life for me.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.040
It's Logan's run out there.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.040
No, wait, Logan's run is a totally peaceful society.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.040
You just have to voluntarily die at 30.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.040
Zardaz out there.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.040
Zardaz out there.

06:59.040 --> 07:03.040
Tomorrow is a 70% chance of Zardaz.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.040
It's Rollerball out there.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.040
And you're not a professional rollerballer.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
You're one of the audience whose lives

07:09.040 --> 07:10.040
we don't really get to see.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.040
One day they will come out with a sequel to Rollerball

07:12.040 --> 07:14.040
that's like a Rosencransey-Gildensterni

07:14.040 --> 07:18.040
like, look at what it's like to be a Rollerball fan.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.040
Nobody knows what you're fucking talking about.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.040
I don't know about Rollerball.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.040
And yet, Sober as a senator.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.040
Sober as a Kavanaugh.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.040
Okay, those are the apologies.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.040
Corrections.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.040
The BBC tweeted somebody.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.040
I think they tweeted Cody.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.040
No, not Big Black Cock.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.040
The news.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.040
It's a porn abrieve.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.040
Yeah, yeah.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.040
We were all thinking it.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
Yeah, who among us heard BBC

07:51.040 --> 07:53.040
and didn't think Big Black Cock?

07:53.040 --> 07:55.040
Come on.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
Yeah, we're all people.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
Let's move on.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.040
The posh is not an acronym.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.040
That's another bullshit thing.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.040
Everything you hear that you hear is an acronym.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
It's all bullshit.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
I should have known better.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
Because it was British, I fell for it.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
I perpetuated a thing.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.040
Hopefully new friends, maybe if they come on the show.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.040
But if they listen to last week's episode,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
they probably won't come.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040
I think they're coming.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.040
I think they emailed the ladies I was referring to

08:23.040 --> 08:25.040
for the red-handed podcast.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
So maybe they'll come, but then I thought,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.040
they probably listened to.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
Whoa!

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
But I heard from them,

08:33.040 --> 08:36.040
and they speak with such dignified grace and poise,

08:36.040 --> 08:39.040
that I just kind of swallowed it and repeated it,

08:39.040 --> 08:42.040
that posh was an acronym for port out starboard home.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.040
No, it's not.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.040
It's a myth in the great kingdom.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.040
And it's like, I remember my dad telling me

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
that fuck stood for for use of carnal knowledge.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
Yeah.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
It's the truth.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
There's only two words that are actually acronyms.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.040
It's laser and scuba.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.040
Everything else is like everything else is an urban legend.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
There's nothing.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
Hey, did you know nothing's an acronym?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
It stands for non-official thing.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
Tactical harmony involving no.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
That's what I like.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
I like snafu and food bar, though.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
Yeah, those are real.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
Okay.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
No, but those are also just acronyms and not words.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
But that's what sucks about linguistics.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
Like the unlike, I mean, obviously in history,

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
there's like conflicting theories and stuff,

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
but there's generally prevailing opinions.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
But in linguistics is like,

09:31.040 --> 09:35.040
well, the top five things that could be the words are these,

09:35.040 --> 09:38.040
and they're all like, oh, it could be this guy's shoe fell off

09:38.040 --> 09:41.040
and it became the word or it could be it used to be logos,

09:41.040 --> 09:43.040
which meant this guy's shoe that fell off.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.040
And it's just like really weird because they're all like treated as

09:46.040 --> 09:48.040
like the real one, but it's like, well,

09:48.040 --> 09:50.040
it's probably not even any of these.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.040
I really, from what we really know of language,

09:53.040 --> 09:56.040
what we know is that the, what would you call it,

09:56.040 --> 09:59.040
the refraction, if that's, I don't know if that's what you'd call it,

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
like what is light going through glass?

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
Is that refraction?

10:02.040 --> 10:03.040
Diffraction?

10:03.040 --> 10:08.040
Diffraction, whatever the medium of time

10:08.040 --> 10:10.040
as language moves forward,

10:10.040 --> 10:14.040
it causes so much chaos in ratio to linear,

10:14.040 --> 10:17.040
logical evolution of words.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.040
Oh, did you know, I can't even riff an example,

10:20.040 --> 10:22.040
I'll just confuse and embarrass,

10:22.040 --> 10:25.040
but it just, the real stuff that we do know about,

10:25.040 --> 10:31.040
it only serves to show you that the logic is not linear at all

10:31.040 --> 10:33.040
in terms of how language develops.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.040
I'll riff probably a really embarrassing example because it probably,

10:37.040 --> 10:41.040
but just the idea that Bill is an abbreviation for William,

10:41.040 --> 10:44.040
and every example that's not a guy's name,

10:44.040 --> 10:47.040
like within our language, like how, you know,

10:47.040 --> 10:50.040
well, yoke became joke, became toke, became bloke,

10:50.040 --> 10:53.040
like it doesn't, there is no logic to it.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.040
None of that is real, yoke never became joke,

10:56.040 --> 10:58.040
there's no, I'm just, if you, but,

10:58.040 --> 11:01.040
so that suggests that the things that we have theories about

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
are probably wrong, right?

11:03.040 --> 11:06.040
Yeah, they're probably just the best stories that kept persisting.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
Yeah.

11:07.040 --> 11:13.040
There's a series, I think it's by, is it Earl Funk from Funkin' Waggles?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
It is.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.040
I don't know if I'm getting the name right if it's Earl or not.

11:18.040 --> 11:22.040
There's four books, I think, that are about etymology of idioms.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.040
Like why do we say, bury the hatchet,

11:25.040 --> 11:28.040
why do we say break a leg, all these things,

11:28.040 --> 11:30.040
and most of them are like, we don't,

11:30.040 --> 11:33.040
the jury is still out on that one.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.040
We think it's because of this,

11:36.040 --> 11:38.040
but here's the first time it was ever used in print,

11:38.040 --> 11:40.040
and I can't get enough of that,

11:40.040 --> 11:43.040
because there's a big debate about why to break a leg.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.040
Right.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
And I love that, because we really don't know.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.040
I grew up with people saying,

11:49.040 --> 11:51.040
oh, it's the opposite of good luck,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.040
because you're not supposed to be superstitious in the theater.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.040
They say, they're saying have the opposite of a great show,

11:56.040 --> 11:58.040
so you have a good show, but then you told me,

11:58.040 --> 12:00.040
you break a leg when you bow,

12:00.040 --> 12:03.040
so they're like, and you would bow if they were applauding at all.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.040
It's saying make it to the end, like get to the bow.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.040
Survive, be more interesting than the bear stabbing down the street.

12:09.040 --> 12:14.040
Hard to beat to the point where you have to actually do something

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
at the end of your play.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
Reading these books, because they're so old,

12:18.040 --> 12:22.040
I think I used one like, you know, episode seven of Harmon 10,

12:22.040 --> 12:25.040
where I said, porous Job's turkey.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.040
Damn.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.040
Job's turkey, you know that turkey was broke,

12:29.040 --> 12:31.040
because Job lost everything.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.040
If he had a turkey.

12:33.040 --> 12:38.040
Job's most prized family members were fodder for a jealous god.

12:38.040 --> 12:42.040
So, of course, his turkey probably was pretty stringy.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
Yeah.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
Pretty untended too.

12:45.040 --> 12:51.040
And I think that Mr. Funk said that the first time in print is that

12:51.040 --> 12:54.040
Job's turkey was so poor, it only had one leg,

12:54.040 --> 12:57.040
no feathers, and had to lean against a fence to stand up.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.040
That's a broke turkey.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.040
Why is Mr. Funk explaining the actual, he's the idiom man.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.040
He's the guy that writes the book that says,

13:05.040 --> 13:08.040
why do we say horse feathers? Why do we say heavens to Betsy?

13:08.040 --> 13:09.040
Right.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.040
So he's just being colorful, imagining Job's turkey?

13:12.040 --> 13:15.040
No, he's saying, here's the first evidence of this in print,

13:15.040 --> 13:18.040
being porous Job's turkey, where he had no feathers,

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
one leg, and had to lean against a fence to stand up.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.040
I'm sorry.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.040
Who?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
Job's turkey.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.040
Funk is referring to the first printed use of the phrase,

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
porous Job's turkey, right?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.040
Yes, correct.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.040
So that person who used the phrase was explaining Job's turkey?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.040
Yes.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
He was saying, yeah.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.040
He was letting you know that this is the first time

13:38.040 --> 13:39.040
anyone's ever thought.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.040
I know what he's doing.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.040
Who the fuck is explaining what,

13:42.040 --> 13:46.040
I would have assumed that the person that coined it

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
was just coining it as an idiom.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
Right.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.040
Not going, not writing an essay about how ill taken care of.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.040
Now let me tell you about Job's boat.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.040
Let's say, let's say,

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
This thing was small.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.040
If you were reading a newspaper in 1745,

14:00.040 --> 14:04.040
and somebody referred to somebody being porous Job's turkey.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.040
Right.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.040
You would have just let that pass by and that you,

14:07.040 --> 14:09.040
okay, that sounds like a broke ass turkey.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.040
I feel like we're having two different conversations here.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Yeah.

14:12.040 --> 14:16.040
Who said, Job, who went into this lengthy description

14:16.040 --> 14:18.040
of the turkey though?

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
A mystery person.

14:19.040 --> 14:22.040
I think Earl Funk says that the first guy that ever used it

14:22.040 --> 14:24.040
said porous Job's turkey, comma.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.040
So when you, when you coin an idiom,

14:27.040 --> 14:32.040
you have to actually show your math.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.040
You have to, you have to be like,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
This is this.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
This is this.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.040
This is colder than a witch's tit, comma, semi-colon.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
A very cold tit.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.040
A witch tit.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.040
The flesh being furthest from the body

14:45.040 --> 14:49.040
of an already unaccommodating creature.

14:49.040 --> 14:55.040
Equally unused, unused as witches are famously

14:55.040 --> 14:58.040
a non-maternal.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.040
You just keep, and then if it catches,

15:01.040 --> 15:03.040
if your explanation is good,

15:03.040 --> 15:06.040
the peer review in the New England Journal of Idioms goes like,

15:06.040 --> 15:07.040
Earl Funk comes in.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.040
Ah, colder than a witch's tit.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.040
It scans.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.040
I'll write it down.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.040
You read Per Richard's Almanac.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.040
He'll explain what I'm talking about.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.040
Trust me, witches' tits, freezing.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.040
I don't have to explain it.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
Look it up.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
It's in the book.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.040
Do the medieval equivalent of Googling it.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.040
You know cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey?

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
Oh yeah.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.040
Freeze the balls off a brass monkey?

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
Yeah.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.040
Yeah.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.040
Spencer knows.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
Oh, we all do.

15:42.040 --> 15:47.040
But what, so you're saying that beyond that just being a clever way of saying it's cold,

15:47.040 --> 15:49.040
like there's actually some logic to it?

15:49.040 --> 15:50.040
Yeah.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
Like a brass monkey is typically hot?

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
Oh yeah.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
Super hot.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.040
Because they're more conductive?

15:55.040 --> 16:00.040
Because they're way more, no, they're just not kept cold enough to be frozen, the balls

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
off of.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.040
No, it's brass.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.040
Go for it, Jeff.

16:03.040 --> 16:08.040
It's on a sailing ship where there's cannonballs and there's a rack that you keep the cannonballs

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
in.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.040
In a pyramid.

16:10.040 --> 16:15.040
And if it's cold enough, the balls, the cannonballs in the rack in a pyramid fashion

16:15.040 --> 16:20.040
will expand and crack and fly all over the deck.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.040
So it's so cold, it froze the balls off the brass monkey and for some reason.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.040
Where's the monkey?

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
That's what it's the pyramid of balls.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
The monkey is the rack of where they keep the cannonballs.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
Oh, I didn't know that.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
I didn't know that was cold.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
No, I didn't.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.040
But also, there is some debate about this.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
We don't know if that's actually why we say that.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.040
Right, because all linguist history is just made up.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
Yeah.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.040
It's weird.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
I always assume, well what time is it?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.040
Half past the monkey's ass quarter to his balls.

16:42.040 --> 16:47.040
Like I always just assume that a lot of our language is just made up by kids who are like

16:47.040 --> 16:49.040
finding out how to say stuff.

16:49.040 --> 16:54.040
They're kind of like, there was a guy in MSNBC that was a linguist that was talking about

16:54.040 --> 17:00.040
Donald Trump's use of language and he was like, yeah, it's a surprisingly juvenile

17:00.040 --> 17:06.040
use of language for a senior citizen and that's sort of like part of his appeal to people

17:06.040 --> 17:11.040
because it's like he talks the way, not only the way that we start talking when we're learning

17:11.040 --> 17:18.040
to talk, but he also talks the way our species talked when it was learning to talk.

17:18.040 --> 17:24.040
And before it learned to speak, speaking and talking being two different things, but him

17:24.040 --> 17:29.040
being like a pioneer politician who's just like, kind of like, Duncan Trussell said something

17:29.040 --> 17:32.040
terrifying at one point about Trump, which is like, I think he's just the first of a

17:32.040 --> 17:39.040
new breed of like politicians who are going to be like your local town's carpet king,

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
you know?

17:40.040 --> 17:44.040
Like you're not going to, the question is he doing a bit or not?

17:44.040 --> 17:45.040
It's never going to matter anymore.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.040
It's going to be like part of the job, part of the electability.

17:48.040 --> 17:52.040
You won't be able to be elected by, you know, by having poise.

17:52.040 --> 18:01.040
That would be a silly person's gambit when you can just stick out and then only a wise

18:01.040 --> 18:06.040
person would make an ass of themselves while running for president and et cetera, et cetera.

18:06.040 --> 18:11.040
It's sort of like, if you can forecast the way, I think that's a very optimistic prediction

18:11.040 --> 18:16.040
because it sort of says that our country is going to be around long enough that like we're

18:16.040 --> 18:20.040
going to keep having regular elections every four years of this.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
We're Venezuela now.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.040
But we're not Poland.

18:23.040 --> 18:27.040
I don't want to bring people down, but I got to share the things that bring me down.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.040
It's just such a fucking bummer.

18:28.040 --> 18:34.040
This mayor in Poland is like doing a charity event and that dude jumped up on stage and

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
stabbed him to death on the stage.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.040
And why am I bringing this up?

18:40.040 --> 18:45.040
It's a comedy show.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.040
There, but for the grace of God?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.040
I don't know.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.040
We saw there were swastikas burning in the street in Poland like a year ago.

18:52.040 --> 18:57.040
Look, we're in a worldwide right slide.

18:57.040 --> 19:01.040
America no longer has all three branches of government on the right.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.040
How long it will last?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
I don't know.

19:03.040 --> 19:09.040
But all of this rhetoric, all of this shit, I believe truly that whereas traditionally

19:09.040 --> 19:14.040
here to four, fascism's potting soil has been multicultural shifts and economic like

19:14.040 --> 19:15.040
roller coasters.

19:15.040 --> 19:22.040
That's when people get their cravings for authoritarianism start to get tempted.

19:22.040 --> 19:30.040
And I think that plus Facebook is going to destroy the planet because we were really

19:30.040 --> 19:33.040
not in economic bad shape.

19:33.040 --> 19:40.040
But the arrival of the internet or rather the arrival of dumb people to the internet,

19:40.040 --> 19:44.040
they kind of like they'd never seen the world before.

19:44.040 --> 19:51.040
And the first thing they see is, oh my God, there's so much more brown skin or so much

19:51.040 --> 19:57.040
more like opedy vagina or so much more than they were used to because their world is going

19:57.040 --> 19:58.040
from everything they can see.

19:58.040 --> 20:03.040
And trust me, as a guy who's left Twitter, I've become much more provincial and simplified.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.040
It really happens pretty quickly.

20:05.040 --> 20:11.040
I don't know nothing about nothing and I'm really happy about it.

20:11.040 --> 20:16.040
So assuming it works in reverse as well is when our parents got on the internet, my

20:16.040 --> 20:24.040
parents, Trump's generation, love you mom, love you dad, but Jesus Christ, the baby boomer

20:24.040 --> 20:30.040
plus the internet, they reacted to it as if it was our fault that they were racist.

20:30.040 --> 20:35.040
They were kind of like, where are all these black people doing on my phone?

20:35.040 --> 20:37.040
And I think that happened all over the world.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.040
I can't call the police on my phone.

20:40.040 --> 20:48.040
In high school history class, you can trace the global rises of militarism, nationalism,

20:48.040 --> 20:53.040
isolationism, economic depression and things that lead to both of the great world wars.

20:53.040 --> 20:59.040
We didn't have that and yet we're repeating that blueprint without the parts that actually

20:59.040 --> 21:02.040
caused it.

21:02.040 --> 21:10.040
It's like we invented a weird invisible plexiglass ramp to antisemitism and scapegoating immigrants

21:10.040 --> 21:14.040
and all these things that traditionally happen because your country has gotten to a point

21:14.040 --> 21:18.040
where it's using your currency as a doorstop or toilet paper and is using like bottle caps

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
for money.

21:19.040 --> 21:23.040
And we never got there.

21:23.040 --> 21:29.040
There was a housing crisis and a global economic crisis and all this stuff, but we didn't.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.040
We had YouTube autoplay.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
It really is.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.040
It's the internet's fault, God darn it.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.040
That's my point.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.040
No, it's the algorithms they like.

21:38.040 --> 21:44.040
They want clicks and Nazis click, unfortunately, and so it's like, yeah, you know what sells

21:44.040 --> 21:46.040
making people Nazis on accident.

21:46.040 --> 21:53.040
So this Polish mayor, 53 years old, a mayor like myself, he was a liberal.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.040
He was outspoken.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.040
He loved his gay rights.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.040
He was Polish.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.040
It's not a great time to be liberal.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.040
I think Jeff's going to stab you, Dan.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.040
That's not funny.

22:01.040 --> 22:05.040
That really happened.

22:05.040 --> 22:12.040
He was doing this charity event and a crazy guy that, of course, they're calling a lone

22:12.040 --> 22:13.040
wolf and he's crazy.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.040
He's crazy.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.040
Yes, I agree.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.040
What are you saying?

22:16.040 --> 22:20.040
I'm going to cut you.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.040
This isn't the funny portion of the show.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.040
I'm doing my Springer's first thoughts.

22:25.040 --> 22:32.040
Springer's opening arguments.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.040
I have no solutions and I have no appeal.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.040
I would die for my freedom of speech.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.040
I would die for other people's freedom of expression.

22:40.040 --> 22:45.040
I do not believe that laws need to be created to mitigate the way people speak.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.040
I believe that free speech, have we noticed, has consequences anyway.

22:49.040 --> 22:54.040
Let's talk about that weatherman that got fired for accidentally making the sound coon

22:54.040 --> 22:56.040
while he was saying Martin Luther King's name.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.040
Let's just talk about that in a second.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.040
We love firing people.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.040
But unless you're a Nazi.

23:05.040 --> 23:13.040
We're in trouble if we continue to ostracize each other and divide each other based on

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
language.

23:14.040 --> 23:21.040
We're basically handing the opposite of Kryptonite to the more nihilistic, more sociopathic of

23:21.040 --> 23:24.040
two sides of a political spectrum.

23:24.040 --> 23:33.040
The party that this poor mayor was the most outspoken against in his right-leaning Poland,

23:33.040 --> 23:37.040
they had issued death certificates for liberal politicians.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.040
He was very outspoken about that in particular.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.040
Can you imagine the irony?

23:41.040 --> 23:45.040
Can you imagine this guy's final thoughts as he's being stabbed in the fucking heart

23:45.040 --> 23:49.040
in front of his constituency and all the cell phones are just out?

23:49.040 --> 23:57.040
The pictures are so disturbing and confusing.

23:57.040 --> 24:04.040
The guy was the most outspoken about the rhetoric and how violent it was getting and how disgusting.

24:04.040 --> 24:11.040
These people who have nothing to lose and only the mentally ill to play with, they have

24:11.040 --> 24:15.040
nothing to lose and everything to gain from triggering a fucking psychopath.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.040
By the way, one in 100 people is so out of their gourd.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
God bless you.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.040
Probably a disproportionate number of them in my listenership.

24:23.040 --> 24:27.040
We love you. Welcome. If you're psychotic, you're not automatically a murderer.

24:27.040 --> 24:34.040
But one in 100 people is vulnerable to fucking messaging.

24:34.040 --> 24:42.040
We just got this weird ability to all talk to each other all the time about whatever we want.

24:42.040 --> 24:48.040
The politicians have arrived in that arena and the thugs among them are going like,

24:48.040 --> 24:55.040
yes, someone should kill that bitch. Well, if that bitch then gets killed, we're going to keep having this conversation.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.040
This isn't clearly about gun control.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.040
The guy crawled up on a stage with a knife.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.040
The government was trying to say it wasn't political.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.040
We didn't understand his motivation.

25:05.040 --> 25:12.040
He literally waved the knife around and said, I did this because this guy's political party locked me up.

25:12.040 --> 25:18.040
He was a mentally ill guy who had his mentally ill life that was in and out of prison and stuff.

25:18.040 --> 25:28.040
He decided to blame this political party that was also being told to die by the opposition who were issuing

25:28.040 --> 25:32.040
hilarious death certificates for liberal politicians.

25:32.040 --> 25:37.040
Our now deceased mayor of this Polish town was among the few who was going,

25:37.040 --> 25:45.040
guys, he went to his government and said, you should look at this as incitement of violence in a very dangerous time.

25:45.040 --> 25:49.040
And the government said to him, no, it's freedom of expression.

25:49.040 --> 25:54.040
It's a way of saying you disagree with someone politically to say they should die.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.040
And then he died.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.040
He was stabbed in front of everyone.

25:58.040 --> 26:02.040
So I am never going to let anybody tell me what to say.

26:02.040 --> 26:07.040
But what the fuck, man, we get fired for saying the wrong shit.

26:07.040 --> 26:12.040
And we're extending that to everyone but politicians.

26:12.040 --> 26:16.040
The only thing I wanted to say about that weatherman guy, by the way, I'm sure you've read that story.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.040
If I've read it, you've read it.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.040
But there was this weatherman.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.040
Do you know what I'm talking about?

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
He was speeding through.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.040
I actually didn't watch the clip.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.040
I'm inclined to take his word for it because I don't believe.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.040
Because you talk on microphones.

26:30.040 --> 26:38.040
Yeah, I mean, I just don't believe that the way you find out someone's racist is like a sound coming out of their mouth.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.040
I really don't.

26:39.040 --> 26:43.040
I mean, that's different from saying like a speech on the corner where you reveal like,

26:43.040 --> 26:48.040
I think that if your skin is this color, you're a worse person than this person.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.040
I just don't.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.040
I think it's a dangerous way of thinking.

26:52.040 --> 26:57.040
But also, it's not like somebody led that pack.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.040
It's sort of like, this is what we make people vulnerable to.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.040
I put the blame on corporations.

27:02.040 --> 27:10.040
Media corporations need to stop firing people within eight hours of Twitter trending them.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.040
It has to stop.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.040
Right.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.040
That's what Gamergate did.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.040
I'm sure it's regrettable within 16 hours.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.040
I almost got fired.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.040
I mean, if I had gotten fired, Rick and Morty would have been over.

27:21.040 --> 27:28.040
It was like, we went from, yay, 70 episodes to like, I had to spend three months wondering whether there was ever going to be a show again.

27:28.040 --> 27:42.040
Because in 2009, I humped a doll in a video that somebody called a number at Turner because they associated it with a blog entry they saw about someone else anonymously.

27:42.040 --> 27:49.040
And I was being investigated for fucking child sex trafficking because AT&T didn't want to take any chances.

27:49.040 --> 27:57.040
Like, we have to, I'm not personalizing this, or if I did, it would sound a lot like that.

27:57.040 --> 28:03.040
But I'm saying, I'm having this experience and I'm not accidentally saying anything.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.040
I accidentally humped a doll in 2009.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.040
Probably not a great idea.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.040
It doesn't seem too funny these days.

28:10.040 --> 28:21.040
But like, the parallel universe that almost got created because I did that 10 years ago is pretty extreme stuff.

28:21.040 --> 28:33.040
And it's not the Nazis that have a right within our country to operate within the dark bowels for no money and try to make people mad and racist at each other.

28:33.040 --> 28:39.040
They're pretty underfunded and pretty hard to, they don't show up to a lot of meetings after a while.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.040
Like, it left to their own devices, they are not the threat.

28:43.040 --> 28:55.040
I believe that when their antagonism meets, it has its handshaken by timid, cowardly, weird, reactive, scary insurance companies and corporations.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.040
That's when we're in trouble.

28:57.040 --> 29:07.040
Somebody's got to realize that this new world means a new policy is necessary and that all of us, like, Andy Warhol's wrong now.

29:07.040 --> 29:15.040
Like, we're all not going to be famous for 15 minutes, we're all in constant rotation, going to get fucking crop dusted with viral parasites.

29:15.040 --> 29:23.040
Like, we're all going to, every once in a while, find ourselves in the midst of a crazy and tropic, weird social phenomenon.

29:23.040 --> 29:29.040
And corporations owe it to us to not base whether they, we show up to work the following morning on that.

29:29.040 --> 29:41.040
Well, the only thing I want to say about that is, now, assuming that, assuming that, forget it for a second, whether or not that guy is more or less racist than any weatherman.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.040
I was on a challenge. Say it again.

29:44.040 --> 29:49.040
Okay, sorry, sorry. The guy was saying something, I don't know, he's doing his weather report and he must have been, he was trying to say Martin Luther King, Jr.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.040
Or is there was an event that was going to be at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park?

29:52.040 --> 29:55.040
And I think he said something like, Martin Luther Coon, King, Jr. or something like that.

29:55.040 --> 30:03.040
He stumbled and it sounded like the word Coon in the midst of civil rights leader that was, yeah, it's really not ideal.

30:03.040 --> 30:12.040
And they didn't catch it or do anything about it at the time and it went viral and then he got fired.

30:12.040 --> 30:23.040
And last couple days, I've been seeing within the news cycle, he's that lower left kind of story where he continued, oh, Al Roker says he believes this guy or whatever.

30:23.040 --> 30:31.040
It's as ridiculous as it should be, the situation when we're talking about something so silly and the only thing that I wanted to say about it,

30:31.040 --> 30:38.040
because I'm sure everyone's capable of having their own conversation about it and I'm not going to add anything to it, except this.

30:38.040 --> 30:47.040
Assuming he is no more or less racist than any other weatherman, assuming that you can tell whether he is or isn't by sound eruptions that come out of his mouth.

30:47.040 --> 30:53.040
I only asked this question, this is not a political or philosophical stance I'm taking.

30:53.040 --> 31:02.040
I just thought of this and it was like, you know, I think I might be right about this, I want to check.

31:02.040 --> 31:09.040
Isn't weatherman the only job you could do capably while racist?

31:09.040 --> 31:20.040
Like, if you gave me the ability to eliminate racism from any field and it had like 10 charges in it, I would get to food service way before,

31:20.040 --> 31:26.040
I tried running on my list, I was like, carpentry, no, no, I don't want a racist making my chairs.

31:26.040 --> 31:32.040
I just feel like it's probably like the one thing you could do without hurting anybody and be totally racist.

31:32.040 --> 31:40.040
Hey, who is that guy with the swastika on his face in the cafeteria? He's not touching my food, is he? No, he's the weatherman, okay.

31:40.040 --> 31:51.040
He can't control the weather, can he? No, no, that would be, then make sure let's police that field for racism if you can make it rain on certain neighborhoods.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.040
You're saying, we're finding out that you're soft on racist weathermen.

31:54.040 --> 32:09.040
I am either incredibly disrespectful towards meteorology, or I am biased about the idea that the first people that are getting fired

32:09.040 --> 32:26.040
happen to be the people who have to talk into microphones every day for, it's like, okay, come on. It would be kind of fun if Channel 5 and KTLA in Los Angeles had just racist weathermen.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.040
He gave you the weather and he was really good at it.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.040
This is an experiment, just to see if it hurts anybody.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.040
He also just slipped in some just full-on racism during it.

32:36.040 --> 32:46.040
Yeah, I don't know. You could try different things each week. Here's our misogynist weatherman, like, oh, there's a cold front coming in, not as cold as women can be toward me.

32:46.040 --> 32:59.040
I deserve sex, but lower socal deserves this cold front coming in, and we'll be back with sports with our Scientologists. Let's see what hurts.

32:59.040 --> 33:02.040
Just for fun, and this is a comedy, but do racist weathermen.

33:02.040 --> 33:09.040
I just did enough frenemy.

33:09.040 --> 33:16.040
Do a weatherman who hates Turks.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.040
Why? To what end?

33:18.040 --> 33:23.040
For comedy, and for memes, and for you to get fired.

33:23.040 --> 33:34.040
My quote-unquote joke was, isn't weatherman the one occupation that you could do while being racist? I did not get the laugh I expected.

33:34.040 --> 33:37.040
I was just working out new material.

33:37.040 --> 33:44.040
The laugh I thought I might get would be like a creeping one where everyone thought about it like I had.

33:44.040 --> 33:58.040
Actually, if you ranked every job in the entire planet, and you had to put your most racist person on your island community, if you had to put him in one place,

33:58.040 --> 34:04.040
Weatherman seems like the safest place, and that's if the guy's racist.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.040
But is he a great weatherman?

34:07.040 --> 34:09.040
Oh, he's the best.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.040
Oh, thank God.

34:11.040 --> 34:18.040
Even watch the clip. I'm sure he's just a guy that, I mean, well, now we know he's a guy whose life is probably ruined.

34:18.040 --> 34:24.040
I'm sure there's a lot of people listening for very good reasons who are going boo-hoo, smallest violin playing for that guy when blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

34:24.040 --> 34:32.040
So I'm not like, oh my God, the world's going to go to hell because you fired a fucking white weatherman.

34:32.040 --> 34:45.040
I don't want to bat for that team, but I am once again, as I will continue to do, I am saying as a fellow leftist barbarian,

34:45.040 --> 34:56.040
man, we got to get our tribes together because the only people that don't follow this fucking weirdly stringent book of rules are the people that are the most hateful in their hearts,

34:56.040 --> 35:07.040
all hearts, the people who actually want to tear us asunder and trample us and remove us, they often know exactly which words not to say.

35:07.040 --> 35:19.040
Case not in point, our president, but it's like look at the passes you get if you bat for the other team and like can we just, boy, why?

35:19.040 --> 35:27.040
That's why I'm saying corporations help us out because people can't, if I retweet somebody saying something embarrassing on the news,

35:27.040 --> 35:32.040
we can't legislate that, it's not my fault that that person gets fired.

35:32.040 --> 35:39.040
Even if I see it out of context and I'm like hashtag fire that fucker, I should be able to do that.

35:39.040 --> 35:50.040
If you can buy a gun in our society and not be a part of the problem, then you should be able to lose yourself in a crazy viral uproar and adamantly say,

35:50.040 --> 35:59.040
fuck this racist fucker, he should be stripped of all of his rights and paraded into the ocean on Twitter as a private citizen,

35:59.040 --> 36:08.040
and then six hours later be like, Jesus Christ, he's a human being, what the fuck, I was drunk, and not find out that you were part of getting him fired.

36:08.040 --> 36:20.040
And the only way to change that is if the actual fire, firing people, the dragons with the fucking fire breath, they've got to change.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.040
And I don't know, so I don't know, I don't want to do.

36:23.040 --> 36:29.040
Okay, our next segment is called, nope, just racist weatherman.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.040
Okay, a few more thoughts about that.

36:32.040 --> 36:35.040
Racist weatherman.

36:35.040 --> 36:38.040
So God bless you Polish mayor.

36:38.040 --> 36:43.040
Add a demo which, okay, Pavel Pavel a demo which I think that was his name.

36:43.040 --> 36:51.040
I think there was a British MP named Joe Cox or someone who also got murdered in a similar situation where someone one of her political opponents was like,

36:51.040 --> 37:00.040
ah, yeah, someone should kill this person or she's she's so dangerous that someone should stop her or something and then someone like shot her with an improvised gun or something and she died.

37:00.040 --> 37:04.040
It's no good bullies man.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.040
It's like it's the thing.

37:05.040 --> 37:08.040
It's like we got to we got to stand up against bullies.

37:08.040 --> 37:17.040
Like if the person that you're challenging, hurting, whatever, like just run it through the witness test of am I doing anything risky?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.040
Am I risking anything?

37:18.040 --> 37:26.040
And is this other person like so much more powerful than me that I can't hurt them by by doing this and like run it run it through that test.

37:26.040 --> 37:39.040
Like because we need to all be united against the people that punched down and that can actually hurt us because it could get bad so fast.

37:39.040 --> 37:42.040
Like these are our cousins abroad.

37:42.040 --> 37:46.040
These are the societies that are going through the same shit for whatever creepy reason.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.040
I blame Facebook.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.040
Everyone's like, well, it is Facebook.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.040
This is an issue and they're everyone's everyone's in these right slants.

37:51.040 --> 38:07.040
So like God, please let us let us emerge as the weirdly ironic like sensible one in this thing and lead everyone to back to regular ass gridlocked bureaucracy where I was so comfortable.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.040
I just want to die in peace.

38:09.040 --> 38:13.040
I don't want to I don't want to die screaming in fear.

38:13.040 --> 38:16.040
I don't want to die by racist.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.040
Yeah, man.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.040
Actually, that's better than colon cancer though, right?

38:19.040 --> 38:28.040
I just it maybe if I could if you could pick your age you could go like, well, when was I going to die of colon cancer?

38:28.040 --> 38:31.040
67 you get a bad colon.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.040
Okay.

38:32.040 --> 38:42.040
Can you can you I'll pay you a million dollars to make me colon cancer free until 67 and I will agree to be killed by racist.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.040
Well, I mean, yeah, that sounds great.

38:45.040 --> 38:52.040
Like, yeah, especially if you could be in the you could be like, okay, so now I'm going to since I'm going to get killed by racist.

38:52.040 --> 38:57.040
I'm going to I'm going to speak my mind at this rally and like, okay, send them up.

38:57.040 --> 39:03.040
And then like you you you set a price that you're willing to pay and then other people can like try and outbid you for that death.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.040
Right.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.040
Because your death won't go viral after a while.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.040
Right.

39:07.040 --> 39:12.040
It'll be like the new colon cancer is being an upstanding person.

39:12.040 --> 39:19.040
It'll enter an arms race of being like profound people with integrity.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.040
Irish elections.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.040
Yeah.

39:25.040 --> 39:28.040
Irish elections.

39:28.040 --> 39:36.040
It's a new segment about Irish elections.

39:36.040 --> 39:42.040
I feel bad for the people that listen to this show and Radio Lab because they're like all he does is repeat everything from Radio Lab.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
Apparently the Irish.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.040
Let me know what you think about this system, Jeff.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.040
All right.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.040
The Irish have this ranked voting system.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.040
Oh, yeah, we use that in Maine.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.040
Yeah, we're starting to experiment with it in local communities.

39:53.040 --> 40:00.040
Yeah, that will like a leftist like person or something one in America and a race because we use that the last midterm.

40:00.040 --> 40:07.040
Yeah, of not one person, one vote, but you rank your top five choices in order from one to five.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.040
Now you're already going too complicated.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.040
It'll never work.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.040
It has to be simple.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.040
You're allowed to just mark one person.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.040
Number one.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.040
Burning Sanders.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.040
You can do the same thing you've been doing.

40:16.040 --> 40:20.040
Number two, Hillary Clinton.

40:20.040 --> 40:25.040
But in this version, everyone goes one through five.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.040
So they count the number ones first.

40:28.040 --> 40:32.040
And then they start eliminating from the bottom of the number ones.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.040
Joe Biden.

40:33.040 --> 40:38.040
So everyone that had a number of everyone who everyone who voted for Bernie Sanders.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.040
What is the bit?

40:39.040 --> 40:50.040
No, I'm trying to help explain every everyone who everyone who's number one candidate gets eliminated in the beginning of the counting process.

40:50.040 --> 40:56.040
Their number two choice goes back into the pool and starts getting counted as if it's another ballot.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.040
Right.

40:57.040 --> 41:03.040
If you voted, so there's no like nader complex thing there where people are blaming each other.

41:03.040 --> 41:16.040
And there's no disenfranchisement of voting because your conscience as a voter is being reflected as a kind of like more modern kind of hash array of tastes and choices.

41:16.040 --> 41:22.040
So it's like a bell curve of like, oh, there was more twos and three choices than there were number one.

41:22.040 --> 41:33.040
In the event of a huge division among people of splintering, then what's going to come to the rise to the top is everyone's second or third choice, which means that you can't.

41:33.040 --> 41:38.040
It de-incentivizes the idea of shutting people out.

41:38.040 --> 41:52.040
And which which really is a, in my opinion, that's like a great cure for for the virus of fascism because it really you can't run on the ticket of, come on, everyone wants to say it.

41:52.040 --> 41:57.040
But no one's saying it, even though 30% of us are the ones saying it, everyone else is so fucked right now.

41:57.040 --> 42:06.040
If we all 30% of us are getting real fucking loud and scary will outnumber everyone else because they're so splintered and arguing with each other.

42:06.040 --> 42:20.040
That would never happen because not only do candidates need to consider how how they're perceived by the people that won't vote for them, because you want that edge of being a people's second choice at least.

42:20.040 --> 42:24.040
It's going to change the behavior of campaigns and candidates really fast.

42:24.040 --> 42:31.040
Only an idiot would be so rhetorically exclusive that they would be making this huge gamble, an appropriate gamble.

42:31.040 --> 42:46.040
You'd have to really believe in white nationalism, for instance, if you really like refused to bend a little bit about it rhetorically during your campaign, because you would be betting that if everyone made me their last fucking choice except for 30% of the people who made me their number one,

42:46.040 --> 42:49.040
I'll still win because you know what, no, there's no leadership here.

42:49.040 --> 42:55.040
That's a good that's an appropriate proportionately a gamble for you to make as a candidate.

42:55.040 --> 43:01.040
And it just it just causes this like, it's like a nice little Nyquil on your election.

43:01.040 --> 43:04.040
So Ireland does this already and Maine is also doing it.

43:04.040 --> 43:09.040
They're doing it for, I think, Senate races or congressional races in Maine, but yeah, Ireland everywhere.

43:09.040 --> 43:18.040
There was an election nerd on this radio lab who was saying like, you know, the way the Irish look at the American electoral system is they look at it like an IBM laptop from the 90s.

43:18.040 --> 43:33.040
Like, you guys got your democracy in the 1700s and it was like, it's it's this symbol of how everything was going to end up being and it's the most and it's the thing that everyone covets and and and it's so powerful and so amazing.

43:33.040 --> 43:44.040
But from back then and has and is now in danger of becoming absolutely symbolic of clunkiness and oppression and disenfranchisement like not it's got viruses and bugs and worms because.

43:44.040 --> 43:49.040
Oh, it was so perfect in some state of the art that it's not changing as fast with the Irish.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.040
They got their democracy in the 1920s.

43:52.040 --> 43:55.040
So they were like, I don't know.

43:55.040 --> 44:00.040
Fuck like can't really fuck fuck this up.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.040
Right. Let's try some different shit.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.040
Sorry, Irish friends.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.040
That was a horrible accent.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.040
Also, the sentiment was awful too.

44:08.040 --> 44:16.040
But but no, but they're they're lean and mean and they didn't they didn't they they they're like, OK, let's how do we do this right.

44:16.040 --> 44:21.040
And they came up this kind of weird Channel 101 voting system where you like your your ballot is five choices.

44:21.040 --> 44:26.040
The more I think about it, the more the more sense it actually makes the problem with our system, right?

44:26.040 --> 44:32.040
The problem with our system is that it's counterintuitive because what you think you're doing is voting for the person you want.

44:32.040 --> 44:37.040
But because of the election dynamics, you're actually just voting against the person that you don't want.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.040
So you vote for Hillary Clinton because you don't want Donald Trump to win.

44:40.040 --> 44:43.040
But a vote for Hillary Clinton doesn't make her win.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.040
It actually just prevents Donald Trump from winning.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.040
So you're you're only voting against your least preferred candidate.

44:48.040 --> 44:54.040
But in ranked choice voted voting, you actually are voting for your favorite person and then your next favorite person.

44:54.040 --> 44:58.040
You're never voting against someone or you can you put them as the last rank.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
So you would put Donald Trump as like seven.

45:00.040 --> 45:08.040
If there's a hundred people on an island and 30 of them want Elizabeth Warren and 30 of them want Hillary Clinton and 20 of them want Bernie Sanders,

45:08.040 --> 45:10.040
like Donald Trump shouldn't win.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.040
Right.

45:11.040 --> 45:15.040
We don't know who will win on the other side, but it's like it should be a no brainer.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.040
But like this one person one vote thing.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.040
It's counterintuitive disenfranchisement.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
It creates nihilism.

45:20.040 --> 45:22.040
It creates like this idea of like, why am I going to go to the polls?

45:22.040 --> 45:24.040
I'm not going to get counted anyway.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.040
Holy shit.

45:25.040 --> 45:28.040
Everybody gets counted in like a really weird way when you do this voting system.

45:28.040 --> 45:33.040
Like you're you're no matter how outside the fucking game you are.

45:33.040 --> 45:39.040
Representative Lee, like you you're you're you're you can watch this thing like a horse race and you're like, that's mine.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.040
That's that's because I picked her for third.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.040
You're you're you're invested the whole time.

45:44.040 --> 45:46.040
I think you feel represented.

45:46.040 --> 45:48.040
We're never going to change anything.

45:48.040 --> 45:52.040
We're going to go down fucking maybe not in flames.

45:52.040 --> 45:57.040
Maybe we'll go down like singing a song or something.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.040
I don't know.

45:59.040 --> 46:00.040
It's weird.

46:00.040 --> 46:03.040
I said we're going to go down dot dot dot and you were like in flames.

46:03.040 --> 46:06.040
No, I don't know.

46:06.040 --> 46:10.040
It's like you're having trouble in flames.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.040
That's it.

46:12.040 --> 46:15.040
How are we going to go down?

46:15.040 --> 46:23.040
I did like I've talked too many politics, but I did as an exercise today.

46:23.040 --> 46:27.040
I was a weird.

46:27.040 --> 46:31.040
I can't I can't zoom in on these things.

46:31.040 --> 46:38.040
What are you trying to zoom in on a screen grabs that I took because I was like my experiment today was I was like.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.040
I'm feeling so satisfied right now.

46:40.040 --> 46:43.040
I'm like not as phobic Poland not withstanding the world.

46:43.040 --> 46:47.040
I'm still scared about the world, but I'm I'm feeling comfortable right now.

46:47.040 --> 46:52.040
I'm reading the news on the toilet because I like it when Trump's in a bad mood.

46:52.040 --> 46:55.040
It's funny and like it makes me feel comfortable.

46:55.040 --> 47:01.040
I like an embattled like like government who's like, you know, where everything's in gridlock and stuff.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
And like it makes me feel comfortable.

47:03.040 --> 47:09.040
It makes me feel like maybe I'll live to see my 60s and like when things are like impossible to happen.

47:09.040 --> 47:14.040
And the worst among us are so frustrated by that that our true colors come out and actually people judge them for it.

47:14.040 --> 47:17.040
So I'm in a good mood lately about politics domestically.

47:17.040 --> 47:23.040
But it also then made me go, why are you such an elitist snob?

47:23.040 --> 47:26.040
Like, like, what do you like?

47:26.040 --> 47:31.040
Like, like now that you feel comfortable, why don't you think about other people?

47:31.040 --> 47:36.040
It was like, like we're learning a lot about narcissism and stuff from like studying the president.

47:36.040 --> 47:41.040
And I'm seeing a lot of myself in him and like trying to use it as like teachable moments.

47:41.040 --> 47:48.040
And I'm like, you know, that's that's a lot like me, the way he's reacting to that or or I'm better than that because of this.

47:48.040 --> 47:51.040
And like, maybe I can be even better than that by not judging it.

47:51.040 --> 48:00.040
And I was like, I became determined today to find like inspiring Donald Trump quotes.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.040
That's that's thirsty work.

48:02.040 --> 48:12.040
I was like, I was like, I was like, now that there's not this like kind of rabid fear, this echo chamber, you kind of like, he's the worst and I refuse to accept that he's not the worst.

48:12.040 --> 48:20.040
Like, it was just enough that I was like, what if I recreationally, what if I was like, I stepped into the shoes of a fan and I want to find him saying some cool stuff.

48:20.040 --> 48:25.040
What if my only modifier was the word very, but I can't I can't.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
I didn't I didn't anticipate this.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
Oh, okay, double click it.

48:28.040 --> 48:31.040
It was a very funny joke by a very funny guy.

48:31.040 --> 48:34.040
I'm the very funniest.

48:34.040 --> 48:40.040
So I literally googled like, Trump smart quotes.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.040
Okay.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.040
No, good.

48:42.040 --> 48:46.040
No, I'm in.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.040
If the word varies in there, I get $100.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.040
It was funny.

48:49.040 --> 48:53.040
The first thing that came up was that like, like there's a couple of funny things happen is here's a quote.

48:53.040 --> 48:56.040
It is a real honor and privilege to endorse Mitt Romney.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.040
Mitt is tough.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.040
He's smart.

48:58.040 --> 48:59.040
He's sharp.

48:59.040 --> 49:02.040
He allows bad things to continue to happen to this country we all love.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
That's the first that's the first one at the top of the thing.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.040
I'm like, that's not really very smart.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.040
He loves himself some Mitt Romney.

49:07.040 --> 49:15.040
And then the second quote was, but I have to say probably when I'm about 30, I'll be pretty not settled, but happy with what I've accomplished so far.

49:15.040 --> 49:17.040
I'm happy where I am now.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.040
That's an Amy smart quote.

49:19.040 --> 49:23.040
So I already that's how few smart quotes Donald Trump has.

49:23.040 --> 49:31.040
I Googled Trump smart quotes, got one quote from Trump about Mitt Romney that didn't involve dyslexia.

49:31.040 --> 49:39.040
And then the second thing down was someone named smart saying something.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.040
He's good fun though.

49:41.040 --> 49:46.040
But I did, I did find some stuff where I was like, you know, do you want to play a game?

49:46.040 --> 49:48.040
It's like, I love games.

49:48.040 --> 50:00.040
I'm going to play a game called, did I did I save this quote, because I thought it was dumb, gross, or reminded me too much of myself.

50:00.040 --> 50:02.040
I think those are the three categories.

50:02.040 --> 50:08.040
Trump quotes.

50:08.040 --> 50:12.040
Dumb, gross, or too close to home for me.

50:12.040 --> 50:15.040
Spencer and I, does the audience get to guess on these or?

50:15.040 --> 50:18.040
Let's not give the audience any power.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.040
Yeah, I like this.

50:20.040 --> 50:22.040
Power not to the people.

50:22.040 --> 50:27.040
We don't want to tell them, hey, so you either need to shout out dumb, gross, or this long sentence.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.040
That's good.

50:28.040 --> 50:30.040
Even they're not going to like that.

50:30.040 --> 50:31.040
Dumb, gross, or.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
Dumb, gross, or too close to home.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.040
Too close to home.

50:34.040 --> 50:39.040
Meaning, meaning I saved it because I'm like, you know what, be honest, Harmon, this sounds like something you'd say.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.040
That's why you don't like it.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.040
So dumb, gross, or Harmon.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.040
Yeah, dumb, gross, or Harmon.

50:44.040 --> 50:47.040
Here's our new segment, dumb, gross, or Harmon.

50:47.040 --> 50:50.040
Dumb, gross, or Harmon.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.040
Okay, wait.

50:52.040 --> 50:55.040
Can you start it over?

50:55.040 --> 51:01.040
Dumb, gross, or Harmon.

51:01.040 --> 51:05.040
That seemed like it was just in the middle of the, can you start it?

51:05.040 --> 51:07.040
That's definitely the middle.

51:07.040 --> 51:13.040
You don't want me to succeed because you get paid to make up songs on the road, so you're afraid.

51:13.040 --> 51:16.040
They're going to hire Dan, they're going to scoop Jeff.

51:16.040 --> 51:19.040
You're afraid Drew Carey is going to take me to Florida.

51:19.040 --> 51:26.040
Dumb, gross, or Harmon.

51:26.040 --> 51:29.040
These are things our president said.

51:29.040 --> 51:33.040
All right, that's enough.

51:33.040 --> 51:39.040
So these are Donald Trump quotes, and we have to judge whether they're dumb, gross, or Harmon.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.040
Okay, yeah.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.040
I don't make deals for the money.

51:42.040 --> 51:45.040
I've got enough, much more than I'll ever need.

51:45.040 --> 51:47.040
I do it to do it.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.040
Harmon.

51:48.040 --> 51:49.040
Yeah, Harmon.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
Now, gross.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.040
Darn.

51:52.040 --> 51:54.040
Because I do things for the money.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.040
You get to vote too?

51:55.040 --> 51:56.040
What?

51:56.040 --> 51:57.040
You get to vote as well?

51:57.040 --> 51:58.040
Well, yeah, I'm going to tell you why.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.040
I have the answer.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.040
You don't get to decide.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.040
Well, what if we outvote you?

52:03.040 --> 52:04.040
It's your opinion.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.040
You can tell me your opinion, but it won't be my opinion.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.040
Majority rules.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.040
What if we all say that sounds like a Harmon?

52:10.040 --> 52:13.040
Well, then you guys are assholes.

52:13.040 --> 52:17.040
No, you guys can make your own decision.

52:17.040 --> 52:21.040
By applause, who votes dumb on that one?

52:21.040 --> 52:22.040
Who votes gross.

52:22.040 --> 52:23.040
This just wants to hurt you.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
Who votes Harmon?

52:25.040 --> 52:28.040
Okay, so that's a Harmon quote.

52:28.040 --> 52:31.040
I don't think this is how the game works.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.040
It is now.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.040
That's fair.

52:33.040 --> 52:38.040
Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.040
Real excitement is playing the game.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.040
Gross.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.040
Gross.

52:42.040 --> 52:47.040
Yeah, I also thought that was gross.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.040
Here's a quote.

52:48.040 --> 52:52.040
I make money because I have to pay for everything apart from my school fees.

52:52.040 --> 52:55.040
My mother even makes me pay my own telephone bill.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.040
What?

52:56.040 --> 52:59.040
That's an Ivana Trump quote.

52:59.040 --> 53:02.040
That's an Ivana Trump quote.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.040
From when?

53:03.040 --> 53:05.040
The past?

53:05.040 --> 53:11.040
As long as you're going to be thinking anyway, think big.

53:11.040 --> 53:12.040
Dumb.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.040
Dumb.

53:13.040 --> 53:14.040
Dumb.

53:14.040 --> 53:15.040
Yeah.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.040
Without passion, you don't have energy.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.040
Without energy, you have nothing.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.040
Dumb.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.040
Dumb.

53:22.040 --> 53:25.040
A little more moderation would be good.

53:25.040 --> 53:29.040
Of course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.040
Harmon.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.040
Oh.

53:31.040 --> 53:38.040
Also, the Harmon category can also be kind of like, you know, if he only said this stuff,

53:38.040 --> 53:40.040
he might be my guy.

53:40.040 --> 53:45.040
Because for better or for worse, I'd be like, because it would be minus the, well, I'm

53:45.040 --> 53:48.040
not going to give you a key to solve the riddle.

53:48.040 --> 53:54.040
This is one that I truly just don't understand.

53:54.040 --> 54:00.040
This one I just screen grabbed because it was like, first of all, what the, the first

54:00.040 --> 54:04.040
thing the secretary types is the boss.

54:04.040 --> 54:05.040
Hell yeah.

54:05.040 --> 54:06.040
That's fucking badass.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.040
And I screen grabbed it because it's from this.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.040
That's an alpha male.

54:09.040 --> 54:14.040
It's from this website where you get quotes and they're like tag clouded.

54:14.040 --> 54:21.040
The tags for this quote are boss, first, secretary, thing, types.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
Fair.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.040
Yeah.

54:23.040 --> 54:25.040
Sometimes you're looking for a quote.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
The first thing the secretary types is the boss.

54:27.040 --> 54:28.040
What does that mean?

54:28.040 --> 54:31.040
The boss said, give me a taco bowl.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.040
Like the boss said.

54:33.040 --> 54:37.040
So if I type you, I'm getting your taco bowl or what?

54:37.040 --> 54:39.040
The secretary takes notes of what you're saying.

54:39.040 --> 54:42.040
Like by saying, like, oh, the boss is saying this.

54:42.040 --> 54:44.040
Maybe the boss, the boss, the boss, the boss, the boss.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.040
He starts everything.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.040
Oh, the boss, really?

54:46.040 --> 54:48.040
The secretary is taking notes of the conversation.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.040
The first thing the secretary takes is the boss.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.040
I don't know.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.040
I'm going to go harming with that.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.040
Oh, oh, oh, wait.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.040
No.

54:54.040 --> 54:59.040
Maybe what that means is the first thing the secretary types

54:59.040 --> 55:03.040
is the thing that decides the policy at the office or whatever.

55:03.040 --> 55:07.040
It's the first thing that he dictates to he or she and says,

55:07.040 --> 55:08.040
the boss wants this.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.040
The boss says that.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.040
But isn't there kind of like behind every great boss?

55:12.040 --> 55:14.040
Isn't that sort of like giving like, isn't that sort of like.

55:14.040 --> 55:15.040
That's right.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.040
The secretary's really running the show?

55:17.040 --> 55:20.040
Or am I, I don't know why you would say the first thing.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.040
I get that interpretation.

55:21.040 --> 55:24.040
It almost seems like it's just like badly improvised porn dialogue.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.040
Oh, for sure.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
Like, oh, she came in and she typed me, if you know what I mean.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.040
I don't know what you mean.

55:28.040 --> 55:32.040
There's nothing even remotely phallic about typing.

55:32.040 --> 55:35.040
Like my dick's like a key.

55:35.040 --> 55:38.040
Yeah, it's the kind of thing an idiot would say.

55:38.040 --> 55:43.040
I have an attention span that's as long as it has to be.

55:43.040 --> 55:47.040
I like that one.

55:47.040 --> 55:51.040
One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.040
Good people don't go into government.

55:54.040 --> 55:56.040
Dumb.

55:56.040 --> 56:00.040
Dumb and gross, but also, I agree.

56:00.040 --> 56:04.040
I'm the earnest Hemingway of 140 characters.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.040
Harmon.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
Harmon.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.040
That's a fucking.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.040
I also saved that one.

56:09.040 --> 56:11.040
It's probably, this joke's in poor taste,

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
but the first thing I thought when I read that,

56:13.040 --> 56:18.040
I was like, well, let's hope that metaphor follows through.

56:18.040 --> 56:25.040
Hey, oh.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.040
Here's one that's interesting.

56:26.040 --> 56:28.040
Some of these I just grabbed because I'm interesting,

56:28.040 --> 56:29.040
because I'm interesting.

56:29.040 --> 56:30.040
Harmon.

56:30.040 --> 56:31.040
Harmon.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.040
I'm like very, very interesting.

56:32.040 --> 56:34.040
I'm like the most interesting.

56:34.040 --> 56:38.040
No, apparently he said at one point, who knows when,

56:38.040 --> 56:43.040
if I don't get along with Democrats, I'm sort of like out of business.

56:43.040 --> 56:46.040
Where's that guy?

56:46.040 --> 56:48.040
That sounds presidential.

56:48.040 --> 56:50.040
That's neither dumb, gross, or Harmon.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.040
I know.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.040
That sounds like a president, doesn't it?

56:53.040 --> 56:56.040
Sounds like a grassroots, like working class, like actual.

56:56.040 --> 56:57.040
Yes.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.040
It sounds like Calvin Coolidge.

56:59.040 --> 57:02.040
Like Harry Truman, like desegregating the army.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.040
Why?

57:03.040 --> 57:04.040
Because he was so woke?

57:04.040 --> 57:06.040
No, because it saves money.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.040
All paths lead to Rome.

57:08.040 --> 57:10.040
Like that grassroots fucking Midwest capitalist,

57:10.040 --> 57:14.040
like let's stop hating each other because we can make more money.

57:14.040 --> 57:16.040
Now you're making it gross.

57:16.040 --> 57:18.040
Well, gross away.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.040
I mean, that's part of Harmon and part of him.

57:20.040 --> 57:24.040
And it's like, I just spent today looking through these numbers.

57:24.040 --> 57:29.040
What about the him that might have existed if someone hadn't come to him

57:29.040 --> 57:32.040
and shown him Cambridge Analytica figures that said,

57:32.040 --> 57:37.040
you know, if you wear a fucking figurative turquoise belt buckle out there

57:37.040 --> 57:42.040
and start getting a little like fucking like a race baby,

57:42.040 --> 57:45.040
like that's going to take you up 10% in this district.

57:45.040 --> 57:48.040
Like, because obviously what we know about the guy is that he says,

57:48.040 --> 57:50.040
all he wants is to be liked.

57:50.040 --> 57:55.040
I mean, it wasn't, I don't even, I think he's as racist as everybody his age.

57:55.040 --> 58:01.040
And probably like, and that's really racist because racism doesn't age well.

58:01.040 --> 58:04.040
It doesn't even, it's not even cool when it's freshly born.

58:04.040 --> 58:10.040
But it's like, it really gets its ugliest right before you shake your cane into the tomb.

58:10.040 --> 58:15.040
And say la vie, that's why we don't tend to listen to old people's opinions

58:15.040 --> 58:20.040
about whether or not you should marry somebody or what you should do at your wedding.

58:20.040 --> 58:25.040
And like, it's like, I think that the guy is just like, he was a Democrat

58:25.040 --> 58:27.040
and then he was an independent and then he was a Republican

58:27.040 --> 58:31.040
and he's just like, just want to win and like somebody was like, you know,

58:31.040 --> 58:34.040
you should be racist and he's like, that's easy.

58:34.040 --> 58:38.040
Just trying to be on his side, that's as best I can do.

58:38.040 --> 58:44.040
What my father gave me more than anything else is great tutoring and a great brain, frankly.

58:44.040 --> 58:49.040
You know, my father's brother was a top person at MIT, went to MIT,

58:49.040 --> 58:55.040
graduated from MIT, was a teacher at MIT, a professor at MIT, a great engineer.

58:55.040 --> 58:58.040
I mean, you know, I have very good genes.

58:58.040 --> 59:00.040
That was his father's brother.

59:00.040 --> 59:02.040
Yeah.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.040
I'm going to go harm another one.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.040
No, just dumb, dumb, absolutely dumb.

59:06.040 --> 59:10.040
Like, you just told me your uncle's smart and that you have good genes.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.040
Like, you go to MIT.

59:12.040 --> 59:14.040
He went to MIT.

59:14.040 --> 59:19.040
Trump has the intellectual wattage of half a saltine cracker.

59:19.040 --> 59:24.040
That's dumb with a big whipped cream of gross on top

59:24.040 --> 59:29.040
and underneath that he's revealing that he truly thinks that where you get into school is actually the

59:29.040 --> 59:32.040
it's the it's the ribbon that the pig gets at the state fair.

59:32.040 --> 59:34.040
It's like it's a it's a it's a ribbon for genetics.

59:34.040 --> 59:38.040
Really actually dangerously gross without even knowing it.

59:38.040 --> 59:42.040
People people assume I'm a boiler ready to explode,

59:42.040 --> 59:46.040
but I actually have very low blood pressure, which is shocking to people.

59:46.040 --> 59:49.040
Wait, that's Stephen Tyler.

59:49.040 --> 59:53.040
Well, I was I picked Alex as I was actually that's so me.

59:53.040 --> 59:56.040
That sounds like an aerospace lyric.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.040
That seems like something I'd be like bragging about.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.040
Everybody thinks I throw tantrums.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040
You haven't seen me throw tantrum.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
You know, the crazy thing is I'm fucking too low key.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040
I'm too low key.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040
Read that one.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.040
Read that one again for me because that's like a rock and roll lyric.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040
People assume I'm a boiler ready to explode,

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.040
but I actually have very low blood pressure, which is shocking to people.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040
Easy, easy.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.040
I mean, that's a that's a that's a version of me that I really don't like about myself.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.040
I kind of like my version of that is like,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.040
like I don't I don't I'm more shocking to me because I actually

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.040
it's it's like the worst AC DC song.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.040
I'm like a boiler.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:40.040
People assume I'm a boiler ready to explode, but I'm not.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.040
I don't eat enough salt.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.040
No, but I kind of my pre therapy self like really prides himself on like,

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.040
you know, I'm very comfortable.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:01:01.040
Like I'm a very like, like I had to recognize through therapy that a thing that I was doing to people that I like,

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:08.040
then I was like, if I've perceived myself as being in a conflict with somebody or if I've perceived someone as a threat to me or something like,

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:14.040
like I kind of like had this pride in the fact that I, yeah, but I can withstand like,

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:26.040
I can see the only way I characterize it is like an airlock like I'll step you over to where I know there's like noxious gases like coming out that are just like enough to make you turn green.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040
But I've breathed them my whole life.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.040
Like I'm kind of like, what's wrong?

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.040
You look like you're uncomfortable.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.040
You know, like I was really proud of that.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.040
Like, like for a while, I thought that made me Wolverine.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.040
And I don't like that guy anymore.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.040
And that's that's that I think that's really what's behind that.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.040
He's like, yeah, he got everybody thinks I'm like a big maniac.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.040
But the truth is I'm fucking cool as a cucumber.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040
And that's my secret.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040
Like everybody else is like, let's get to him.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.040
It's like, no, you're everyone is letting you get to them.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.040
You're cool as a cucumber because you're always a baby that's throwing its own shit.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.040
Like you have, of course, you're not upset about it.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:10.040
Like you're already upset about your fucking pudding that you didn't get so many people are on television that don't know me and they're like experts on me.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
That's me is bitching about.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040
I wouldn't mind a little bow in Japan.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040
They bow.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040
I love it.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040
Only thing I love about Japan.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
Harmon.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040
That's so mean.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.040
Like I would and I would think like, man, I can't wait for the Japanese to hear that podcast because you don't like travel that much.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040
You don't like Paris.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040
You don't like Rome.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.040
You don't like.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.040
Yeah, and I would think like, you know, I got that like, like that Dan explaining thing.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040
I'm like, here's the thing about like the Japanese will love this observation.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.040
Like, I love the bowing.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.040
It's the only thing I like, you know, and then I would, I would be like, why are they mad?

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.040
Jimmy Carter used to walk off the airplane carrying his own luggage.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040
Do you remember that?

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.040
I don't want my president carrying.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.040
I want the freaking Marines to be carrying his luggage and they want to carry his luggage.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Harmon.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
No.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
Dumb and gross, dumb and gross.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.040
That's you, like when you travel and you fly now, you hate the airline.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.040
You keep calling the Marines to carry your luggage.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040
I want to be treated like a human being.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040
That's dumb and gross.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040
That's what do you mean?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.040
You like Jimmy Carter less because he carried his own luggage?

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040
Dumb and gross.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040
Like what do you mean?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040
That's fucking awesome.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.040
If John Wayne carried his own luggage and was president, you'd be sucking his dick.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040
Fuck you.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.040
Like this idea that Jimmy Carter is a pariah because he like, fuck it.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:31.040
It's just like, like, wait, I'm now learning from you that he carried his own luggage.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.040
Can I go back and vote for him when I'm 10?

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040
Poor fucking guy.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040
All I knew about him was that he was a peanut farmer.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040
Everyone just decided like to just rail on this guy.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.040
I bet he was the best president ever.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040
Experience taught me a few things.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.040
One is to listen to your gut no matter how good something sounds in paper.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.040
The second is that you're generally better off sticking with what you know.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.040
And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040
Dumb.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040
Yeah, dumb.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.040
Like what does that even mean?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
And that's probably...

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040
It means nothing.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.040
He talks in circles.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.040
It means that he bankrupted the business.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:15.040
I think I was born with the drive for success because I have a certain gene.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040
Dumb, gross, and harm.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040
Nah, come on.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040
Racist.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.040
Where do you put it?

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040
Yeah, no, so gross.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.040
That's fucking like you're a Nazi.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040
Like what do you mean?

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040
That's a fundamental...

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.040
Now, in his defense, the guy, yeah, he's talking nonstop.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040
So who knows when he said that?

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040
But his dad is in the KKK.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.040
The people that like him because he represents the idea that, oh, gone are the days when

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.040
poise is what makes the difference.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.040
A certain demographic has come to connect the dots of poise and diplomacy with the dots

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:55.040
of elitism and your boxed out of the system because you're a grody person.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:02.040
So he's like a fire hose of garbage and people are like, oh, that means I don't have to be

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040
ashamed of myself.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Shame's a hell of a fucking thing to overcome.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.040
Like, I bet it feels really good.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.040
Must be nice.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.040
Wish I could be a fucking idiot that all of a sudden wakes up one day, reads a fucking

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.040
article, and decides they're proud of themselves.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Jesus Christ, where do I buy that fucking drug?

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:25.040
Yeah.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.040
I mean, it's $26 a bottle.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.040
Oh, yeah.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.040
But my doctor is awful.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.040
This is overprescribes regularly.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.040
So is our friend here?

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040
Jesse, are you here?

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
Oh, yeah.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040
All right.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.040
Oh, yeah.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.040
Jesse camp everybody's got a packet.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.040
It comes very good.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.040
Oh, yeah.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:03.040
It's a baby George.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.040
Yeah, there you go.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.040
Wait, what?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.040
You want to pop that?

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.040
The baby George.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:16.040
It's bigger than the normal George form and grill.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.040
We have a baby George.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040
We got a baby George.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:23.040
It's the champion of rotisseries.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
Thank you, Jesse.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040
Thanks.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040
Absolutely.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040
Jesse camp everybody.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.040
Well, you're quiet as a church mouse back there.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.040
I don't know why we keep being surprised.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.040
It's like, wait, you were here the whole time?

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.040
No, no, I think he just showed up.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.040
Oh, really?

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040
But still.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040
No, no, no.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.040
Like, no, yeah, that is true.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.040
But I didn't want to come empty handed.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.040
And I, you know, the baby George kind of came into my

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.040
acquisition through some funny means.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
Yeah.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.040
I was actually collecting a gambling debt for Jeff.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.040
So Jeff sends people to collect his debts.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040
No, no, no.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.040
Jeff takes a lot of bets.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.040
Yeah.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.040
He's big news, man.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.040
When he's flying out of town for a who's line, is it

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.040
anyway gig?

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.040
That's code for you.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.040
He's taking care of some Gambino's in Jersey.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040
Oh, yeah.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040
It's true.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.040
And with NFL as hot as it is right now, you know, a lot of

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040
debt.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040
Jesse.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040
Jesse, do me a favor.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040
Fashion corner.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040
Yes.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040
Walk me through your outfit right now.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040
Let's talk.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.040
First off, I do just want to say Dan is an honor to you

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:32.040
always, you know, get to see you and and Jeff as well.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.040
And of course the game.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.040
Master.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.040
Spencer.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040
Yeah.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040
There you go.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040
You got it.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.040
I didn't even help you.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.040
No, no, no, no.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.040
But guys, that being said, I'll zip it in the fashion corner.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.040
Yeah.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.040
Walk us from front.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.040
You can start from top to bottom or bottom to top.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:54.040
I know I want you to tell me the methodology of your

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040
outfit.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
Oh, yes.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.040
The methodology to it.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.040
It's heavy on the allergy.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.040
Not too much on the other.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.040
But I'll tell you what, I start with cowboy boots.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:14.040
I am a ten and a half and the drapes match the curtains.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.040
You know what I mean?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.040
The trace match.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040
Yeah.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.040
If you're ever curious about someone's weiner schnitzel

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:26.040
size, all you have to do is like look at like what their

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
shoe size is.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.040
Okay, Michael J. Fox, seven and a half.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.040
We know what you're talking about.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.040
Yeah.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.040
I mean, minute bowl.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.040
Hello.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.040
Well, as a person that's shorter than you and has bigger feet

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040
than you, I beg to differ.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040
Oh, no.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040
Don't worry about it, Dan.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040
What's your shoe size?

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040
Come on.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040
Hit him with the shoe size.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040
I'm 11 and a half.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.040
He's 11 and a half.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040
11 and a half.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.040
And my penis is 11 and a half.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.040
That just means it's going to grow later in life.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040
Like the baby.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.040
Don't think that that way you have now is your final

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040
penis size.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040
Oh, no.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.040
Everyone knows that the penis just grows older.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.040
If you go to a nursing home, there are a lot of long John

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.040
Silvers in the place, you know, I think you're mistaken.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040
Yeah.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.040
Well, your balls start to hang down to your ankles.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040
Yes.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040
That awaits all of us.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.040
You need to buy a second pair of socks for the balls.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.040
But yeah, I mean, you know, we're for, you know, your hands

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040
if they're made.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.040
You have bigger feet than Jesse, but he's bragging about

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.040
a giant penis.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.040
No, I wasn't 10 and a half.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.040
I'm a moderately average, average penis.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040
That's just average.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.040
If you went by my shoe size.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040
Which is the way to go.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.040
Definitely.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.040
I mean, Jeff, you everyone know is a my dick is shaped

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.040
exactly like a candy cane ampersand or an ampersand.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.040
That is one not in the vocab banks.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.040
Spencer's are shaped like one of those Dungeons and Dragons

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040
ampersands.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.040
It's like a dragon.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040
Oh, yeah.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.040
Dragon head.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.040
I gotta, I gotta say this.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.040
All the ladies after a night with Spencer say, damn, thank you

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040
for Spencer's gifts.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040
Oh, damn.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040
All of the ladies.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.040
That was, yeah.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
There were multiple.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
Yeah.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040
All right.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040
So now that's not zero.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.040
Let's talk about your trousers now.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040
What do you got?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040
You got some stretchy, stretchy tights going up.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040
Oh, wow.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.040
Well, it is rainy season here in LA.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.040
And so, you don't need to delve under the car hood, but I

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.040
have three pairs of leggings, jaggings, if you will.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.040
And then the armor, these are a pair of Massimo supply

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040
company.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.040
Yo, but they're women's jeans.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.040
I will admit, but I'll tell you guys this.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040
I'm a very tall man.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.040
So I always wear cowboy boots because then, you know, you can

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.040
always, it doesn't matter if your pants are too short, you

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.040
know, that's your secret.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.040
And like Stevie Nicks, I wear my boots all summer long.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040
Now, is there a fanny pack happening?

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.040
What do you got?

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.040
What do you got?

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.040
No fanny pack tonight.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.040
By the way, guys, to be honest, the reason I was a little

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.040
late tonight is because I went to the Szechuan fax

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040
machine theater.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040
What?

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.040
This is the dynasty typewriter.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Oh, yeah.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
Across town.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.040
There's a Szechuan fax machine.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040
All right.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.040
Okay.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040
Crickets.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040
Yeah.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.040
He's trying, he's trying, trying stuff out.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.040
Just trying some stuff out.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040
Yeah.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040
You're wearing four layers of pants.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.040
And then a pair of boxer briefs.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040
Just one T-shirt.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040
One.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.040
Well, this is an interesting garment.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040
Yeah.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.040
That's what I want to know about.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.040
That's somewhere between bathrobe, dashiki and cape.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040
It defies description.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040
Yo, bathrobe, it is a bathrobe.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.040
But dashiki, this was until I cut it down the middle.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.040
To be honest with you, a lot of times what I do, if there's

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.040
a dress with a really cool fabric, I'll just, you know, cut it

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.040
down the middle because a dress is just really a trench coat

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.040
with a seam up it, you know?

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040
Yeah.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.040
I mean, that's the truth, you know?

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040
Lid blown.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040
Lid blown.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040
Off of dresses and trench coats.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040
Happy to blow off that lid.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040
That's one thing I am happy to blow.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040
And also my piccolo.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.040
But yo, not just one cut down the middle, dashiki.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.040
One dashiki, two dashiki.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.040
There's no three dashiki for.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.040
But then, you know, just a good flannel.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.040
So I have something to keep my important cards, papers,

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.040
and rolling papers.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040
But then on top, you have what?

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040
No, I'm just kidding.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040
This is a epi pen.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040
Epy pen.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040
Yes.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040
You're terrified of bee stings.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040
Bee stings.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.040
I got bad peanut allergies and then I'm addicted to eating them.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040
Whoa.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.040
That's an expensive habit.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.040
Hold on, but guys, I didn't want to look.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040
If there's one thing I got to just put out there,

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.040
I'm here because I love Jeff forever.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040
Dan is the coolest.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.040
And I'm a huge Harmontown fan.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.040
And so I did just want to say that something I heard Dan say

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.040
tonight about Jimmy Carter, that was really, really dope.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040
I mean, if we're going to think about presidents and stuff,

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.040
Jimmy Carter has built literally over like 300, 400 houses

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.040
for Habitat for Humanity with his wife.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.040
You know, since leaving office.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040
I mean, he's a guy that will go, you know,

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.040
like to Katrina and build a house just with other volunteers.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040
He's been doing that.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040
And I mean, you know, I don't definitely mean to get political,

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.040
but his vibes that he sent out were peace and love and good.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040
And yeah.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.040
And then, you know, who knows.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.040
It's supposedly that they wrinked IQs of presidents,

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.040
and then Jimmy Carter is like probably our most intelligent

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040
president we've ever had.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.040
Yeah.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040
That doesn't surprise me.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040
No.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040
I grew up in the Midwest.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.040
So all I remember from that time, I was like eight, nine,

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040
10 years old, something around there.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.040
And I just remember this like hysteria for Reagan.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.040
And like, like, yeah, like everybody was like,

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.040
I was, I was socially conditioned to like, oh,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.040
Jimmy Carter is such a fuzz nut.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.040
Like, you know, like it was like, I don't even know what a president is,

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.040
but I know I hate Jimmy Carter.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.040
He sucks.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.040
He's such a terrible president.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.040
And like, I'm just fascinated by that because I'm like,

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.040
what did he, like, like it seems like such a quiet, you know,

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.040
and no one typically doesn't talk about it.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.040
And I have a sneaking suspicion that's because there is nothing

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.040
to talk about because he did a really good job.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040
Absolutely.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040
I'm assuming.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.040
And because he was so progressive that they destabilized him.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.040
They say like the, like the whole hostage crisis thing,

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.040
it was set up for him to fail so that,

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.040
so that he would not get reelected and he'd be a one-term president.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.040
There was an oil crisis back then.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.040
I'm really going to show my ass if I start talking about this stuff

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.040
because I don't know, but I have a feeling,

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.040
I have a weird feeling that there was an oil crisis

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.040
because OPEC was forming and like it was like the idea was that,

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040
oh, we had a little crossroads there.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.040
It was like we could have committed to our rhetoric about wanting democracy

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040
and all this stuff.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.040
But then you get a little tough choice there where the people that are sitting

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.040
on top of the things that you want start to get votes and stuff

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040
and they're going to vote for people that you don't like.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.040
And I have a feeling that there was probably a,

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.040
there probably existed some kind of like weird back to the future maelstrom

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.040
where, oh, either Biff goes, you know,

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040
starts washing your car or has a museum.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.040
I think he's done more after his presidency

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.040
than most presidents did during their presidency.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.040
Yeah.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.040
Because he's a humanitarian and he's an intellect

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.040
and those were the days when people that could actually complete a sentence

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.040
and be thoughtful and care about each other.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040
Yeah.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040
Yeah.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.040
I mean, it's, I'll tell you this really quick thing.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.040
Like about maybe like 15 years ago I was on a road trip

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.040
just kind of driving randomly through Georgia.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.040
And I ended up in Plains, Georgia,

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.040
which is literally the town in Georgia where he grew up

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.040
and still lives to this day.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.040
And there's maybe like 20 people in the town.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.040
It's dirt poor, but it's still where he never stopped living there.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040
He grew up there.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040
I mean, this is the one thing I want to say to that.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.040
I don't think that as a country we should ever elect a president

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.040
who has never been poor a day in their life because, you know,

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040
that's going to be, I'm sorry to say,

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.040
but someone that's going to lack empathy.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.040
And I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, just, you know.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.040
I don't know anybody cool, like my circle of friends,

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:32.040
all the people that I look up to and respect and think highly of

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.040
are people that know the value of what it means to have $1.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040
Well, how about an easier choice though?

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.040
Just say that the title of president shouldn't be a thing

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.040
that's like a reward or anything.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.040
It used to be a shit like a clerk job.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.040
In Ireland, this I learned from my ex-wife when we were just,

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.040
she was just here for Harmon Quest.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.040
She was explaining that they have this thing that I, you know,

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040
I've been saying since the Trump election,

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.040
when you look at like what people like about him

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.040
and what people like the only conflicts is like,

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.040
you could solve this in the blink of an eye by going,

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.040
okay, if we're going to keep insisting that the title of president

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.040
basically means American King, then make it a title worth that.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.040
In other words, just let him, like he said himself,

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040
all he wants to do is run around and say,

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.040
Hallelujah, like love it, like Louisiana,

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.040
peace out and have everybody like with the hats and the things.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040
Ireland has a president that does that.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040
That's, that's all they do.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.040
They elect the most Irish guy in Ireland and they call him president.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040
And then they have like, I don't know what his title is.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040
I don't know if it's Prime Minister or something else,

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.040
but it's like, it's function, it's just like, yeah.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.040
And then there's this person that rolls up their sleeves

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.040
and probably went to law school and like runs a fucking country,

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.040
like in cooperation with the bureaucracy that you need.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.040
If you're going to have hundreds of millions of people like,

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.040
like under you that need your,

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.040
their lives to not fall under the whims of things.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.040
Like I, I, yeah, yeah.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.040
So, and also though, definitely.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.040
And also someone that could actually build a all inclusive society,

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:04.040
you know, where, where the goal is for everyone to prosper and do well.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040
And I mean, and in order for that to happen,

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.040
you can't have someone who's corrupt.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.040
It should be a thankless job.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.040
You should like dread being any kind of politician,

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.040
because your life should be under a microscope every minute of every day.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.040
Everything you say should be checked and double checked.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:26.040
And it should be, it should be a job that attracts fetishists for organization.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.040
Fetishists for organization.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.040
Yeah.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.040
People who, there are people in the world who tend in our society

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.040
to become accountants and certain kinds of lawyers and things,

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.040
civil rights lawyers and people that, those should be our politicians.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.040
The people who would be like, yeah, no, that's not a job for me.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.040
The reason they're saying that is because it's a disgraceful occupation

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.040
for narcissists and blowhards.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.040
And they don't want people to look at how they smoked pot in college

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.040
and like call or what, you know, look, there's search histories up for debate

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.040
or if they ever had an affair and stuff.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.040
Could we just strip that stuff out and make it a, a graceless occupation.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.040
And now they're all trying to do Instagram stories too.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.040
Like beta or Royce, like trying to live tweet from the dentist.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040
Yeah.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.040
So that, yo, he can be relatable to us.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.040
Yeah, it's like great.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040
You have dental health care.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.040
Go beta.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.040
I mean, like, yo, good thing your last name ain't Max.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040
Hell yeah.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040
The old video format.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.040
Yes.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040
Yes.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.040
Yes.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.040
I've been getting back to the matter at hand.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040
Oh yeah.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.040
We got to keep this thing on rail.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.040
Oh no.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.040
But I mean, Jimmy Carter is still alive and if mental and physical health are linked

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.040
and you know, I believe we all know they are and having good energy in you.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.040
I mean, Jimmy Carter, he's alive way past 90.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
He's the real Clint Eastwood.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.040
You know what I mean?

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.040
Would you be willing to share Jesse?

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040
Like just, just, just say no.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040
I think I asked you this last week, but I was kind of in a blackout.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.040
I was like, Hey, next time you come out, could we, would you be okay talking about

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.040
the fact that recently like you were kind of off the grid for a little bit?

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040
Sure.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.040
Stuff like that.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.040
Yeah, absolutely.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.040
A lot of kids listen and like they go up and down and stuff.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.040
Oh, absolutely.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.040
You've been struggling with stuff and like you're, you're, you're, are you on the wagon

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.040
now?

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040
You want to talk about that stuff?

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040
Like where are you?

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040
Oh, by sobriety?

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.040
Yeah.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.040
Oh, I mean, like what you've done, where you've plummeted, where, what you're back from,

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040
where you are.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040
It's okay if where you are now.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.040
Oh boy.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040
Okay.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.040
Like also just say, no, I don't want to talk about that.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.040
I don't want to, I want to have fun and not do that.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.040
But if you,

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.040
No, no, no, absolutely.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.040
I mean, there's definitely, you know, some lows and some highs.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:36.360
I mean, talking about politicians for a brief moment, they're a crazy bunch these days.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:42.160
I am someone who I can say has slept with not only Camilla Harris, but also Lindsey Graham

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.040
and yo, there's some freaks in the Senate.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040
Yeah.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.040
That's what I was talking about.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040
Yeah.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040
Yeah.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040
Yes.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.040
But, but, but, but, but Lindsey Miller Graham, Lindsey Miller Graham.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040
Yeah.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.040
Lindsey Mellon camp.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:03.040
But listen, I want to say that, that no, no, Dan, from my heart, honestly, like, um,

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.800
life, that's what makes life life is that, you know, you have amazing highs and then the

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:13.040
rest is like lessons in humility and, you know, both are great and necessary.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:19.880
And so, um, no, I, and, and first off, one other thing, just as a human being, you,

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:26.360
I mean, Harmontown, the movie is such a courageous movie and you, if anything, have always, I

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.440
mean, just from the bottom of the heart and why, um, just want to say that you being such

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.200
a courageous person and just, you know, letting everything out there so people can learn from

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.880
it is such a beautiful thing.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880
I do.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.400
I'll be honored, you know, to really a selfless act.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400
Like I appreciate it.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:53.120
I'm, I'm, I'm like, I'm alive because I found out that I can, I can say what is on my mind

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.920
and like, I'll live longer than if I, than if I bottle it up.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.040
That's why I just, because you were, you were missing for a little bit, like, I, like, Jeff,

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.520
you, didn't you find him?

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.760
I mean, it's like, like, like, you were withdrawn and you were, and Jesse, like, tell me, like,

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.760
if you don't want to talk about it, but like, like your sister called me up and said, you,

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.280
you went off the grid and she said, like, where's Jesse and text him?

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.160
And I did, but you didn't have your phone.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.440
And then one day I got a fucking awesome text from you and you're like, Hey, man, and you

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:31.560
were just cracking jokes and you were back and, uh, with the story, the story about,

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.560
can we tell the story?

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.560
Draw a lot of value from that.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.800
If you've been to dark places, you don't want to talk about it and it takes you back to

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.200
dark places to talk about it, then it accomplishes the opposite of the,

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.840
I'm, I'm guys honest.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840
I'm honest.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.160
We were real fucking worried about you and, and we, we put the bat signal out and says,

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160
where's Jesse?

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160
Yes.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.800
And then you told me when you texted me, we, I called you, uh, and you said, it's like

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.200
finding out what it would be like to die because I find out how much people will care

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200
about me.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:03.160
And like, like, like, and you go, oh, like, like, these are the people that would care

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.160
if I died.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.760
And don't mistake that as advice for the youth or anything like, Hey, you know what?

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:08.760
You should try.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:12.600
But, but, but nobody, but you found out that like, like there are people, cause I, I think

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.440
of you, Jesse, as somebody, and my joke is always that you would give me the seven shirts

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440
off your back.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:24.360
Uh, but you, you're that kind of friend, you would, you would, you would do anything

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360
for a friend.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360
Yeah.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.800
And then you found out who your friends were when, when you went off the, uh, off the air

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800
for a while.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.360
As far as I understand, like it's pretty obvious from your personality.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.760
Sorry, I know we're explaining you to you, but, but like, I, like, I think it's the thing

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:43.040
that draws me to the reason I want to hear about any, any, any things that you've battled

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:49.160
just because of this, because, um, you're a really nice guy and I, I don't know you

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.080
that well, but I, I feel like it's like seawater where like, you know, from a drop, like what

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:59.160
the content of an ocean is and that you're not a judgmental person.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:04.160
You don't, you don't put a lot of energy out towards like, um, worrying about other people

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.440
and how they should be in order for you to be happy.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440
No, no, no, no.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.320
It's important for people to learn that there's a, I mean, or to, or to deal with the fact

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.960
that like people, like, like, if that hurts, like, like, like, like, I feel like there's

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.360
too many people in our society that like are like that, like, look, I don't want to judge

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360
other people and all this stuff.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.280
And there's like, that comes with a lot of self loathing, a lot of self torture, like

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.040
directing a lot of energy inward where you're like, I'm a piece of shit.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.840
So I'm just going to like medicate and like vanish and I'm, I'm sick of this.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:37.000
So anyways, that's why I'm like, that's why I think it could be so valuable to talk about

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
because

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Absolutely.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.680
I, um, so in order to, um, I'll tell you, I'll tell you guys the whole story in order

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:51.640
to put it, um, properly in perspective, um, oh, but I don't in any way, in any way want

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:58.360
to, um, throw my sister under the bus either because she, um, she is a fantastic person

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.000
with her own demons too.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:10.240
But, um, so basically, um, from like about, um, 2015 through like the end of 2016, I've

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.360
been working with my sister on, um, on a new series and it had been going amazing.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.760
I mean, we had, um, you know, and we still, you know, it's still all there and it can

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:28.320
and, and we're still working on, on, on putting it together, but we, we, um, basically I had

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:34.840
worked really hard on this project with my sister and for, um, you know, for some reasons

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:41.640
and to be really blunt, I was really kind of like on the, on the verge of making a comeback

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.400
that had been like 15 years in the making.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.760
But this is, this, um, what I'm trying to get to is that, you know, like, um, my sister

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.400
and I kind of had a falling out over some, some crazy stuff or she really went into a,

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.760
a dark patch and then, you know, um, we couldn't see the, the show to fruition for a moment

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:08.640
and I kind of just fell into a depression and I had been sober for about, um, and when

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:15.360
I say sober, I just mean like no hard substances, you know, and, um, I don't consider marijuana

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.320
and I don't consider, you know, like an alcohol, um, you know, to, to really be a drug, but

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.080
at the same time, you know, anything that you abuse and, and, um, you know, anything

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.200
that's, uh, basically just numbing you in your pain without allowing you to grow at

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.200
all.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.960
I mean, that's, that's an addiction and that's a drug and so what I'm getting into is that

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:42.040
I did kind of like fall into, um, a year and a half drug addiction with, um, a drug

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.760
that I hadn't touched in over like, uh, seven and a half years, because I was just, you

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:54.680
know, um, uh, the, the, the fallout from, well, uh, just things with my sister, um,

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.080
you know, and then, um, everything, you know, yeah, I just kind of fell into a depression,

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:07.600
but, um, where I'm going with all of that is, um, so then I, um, basically, so I was

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.680
using some heavy drugs for like almost a year and a half and then I ended up kind of just

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.800
like, you know, in Fontana, California, as one does, you know, nothing, nothing good

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:28.480
happens in Fontana, by the way, 24 hour auto zone, so think about what you need headphones

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.480
to live there.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480
Right.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480
I've the only time I've been to Fontana.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480
I had headphones on the entire time.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:40.000
Oh, well, if you want your car fixed, relatively dirt, as cheap, all you got to do is and wait

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.080
until it's about 10 because the frig's come out at night, but you go to the 24 hour auto

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:52.360
zone in Fontana after 10 and basically there are tons of people really high on supplements

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.880
in the parking lot, either working on their own car or just hoping that someone might need

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.120
work done on their car.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.120
So like, when you call me, you said, I'm telling you get four of these after hour auto zone,

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.480
like, you know, um, mechanics in the parking lot, like together and you'll have a new engine

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:15.240
in a car in like two hours for like a hundred bucks and maybe a bag of flaming hot Cheetos,

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.240
you know.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.160
So I'm telling you when you call me, you're at a pick apart in Fontana, right?

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.200
Oh, that was way after that was that is a couple of years into things.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.440
I mean, so this is where the story gets good is that I think that, um, and again, I don't

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:37.080
in any way mean to slag my sister and I, um, uh, you know, she would just use your I

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080
statements.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.080
That's what I've learned.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:42.680
If she's a part of the story, but you can still say, look, I was, I was, I felt, I felt

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680
bad or whatever.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.680
That's great.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.680
You don't have to worry about slagging her.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.680
That's great.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.680
Well, exactly.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.000
I mean, um, well, during, during my time at depression, you know, I didn't have much,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.520
um, you know, uh, uh, of a relationship, you know, with my sister much either and she

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.240
was kind of in her own dark place too.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.600
And so I think, you know, that's why I really kind of become despondent and, um, because

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:10.320
you know, uh, you know, this was my creative partner, my, my, my best friend and my sister.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.040
And so, you know, I, I really missed her so much and we were really on the verge of,

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.720
um, some really cool things.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:25.720
And so I mean, like, um, uh, so what I was going to say is, um, this, is that, uh, wow,

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:30.120
I know that this does sound like not many brain cells are in here, but I'm really trying

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120
to just, uh,

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.600
It sounds like it's important and people are listening and they've been through way

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.800
worse, believe me, as far as quality of show, like they're, they're, they're listening

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.800
and they're fine.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.800
And you can take your time and find the words.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:47.720
I just, you know, met this Anita Baker impersonator named Tito and, um, that's a whole other

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:55.160
chapter for another podcast, but I'll tell you this, um, that, um, oh Jeff, by the way,

01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:00.480
um, uh, Tony, um, what's your friend, the friend that works at the car wash with the

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:04.160
obnoxious mustache that puts a turtle wax in it.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160
Oh no.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.240
This is how Jeff finds out the bus that we're going back.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.240
We're going back.

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.240
We're going back.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.680
But, um, I, I hope we have a friend.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680
He loves that.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.680
We do.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.920
I would love to have a friend with a, uh, his name is Tommy Tango and he says hello.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.280
I know Tommy T.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.240
I, I, I don't, but thank you.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.440
Yo, the mustache, but guys getting, getting, oh wow.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.440
You see, that's myself.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:32.400
Honestly, that's a defense mechanism because it's easier to joke and I'm going to get into

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400
the real heavy stuff.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.440
And so, um, you can also, you can also pull up and out and we'll touch back on it another

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.440
day.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.440
Okay.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:43.560
But, but, but I think, I think like we're almost right at the end.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.200
And so, you know, just two more seconds, guys, over the waterfall and in our own.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.200
We're doing it.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:56.400
Do you, like, like you tell us as much as you want because, um, first of all, I'm happy

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.400
you're back.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.400
Yeah.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.400
Because I was worried about you.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.400
And also America is happy.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.400
I'm back.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.400
Yeah.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.400
Oh man.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.400
Thank you.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:11.680
But, but, but as, as definitely didn't have to coax that one as, as, as Dan said, uh,

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:16.960
and quite rightly, the, uh, like to the extent that you are willing to share what you went

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.960
through, I think is helpful to people that listen to our show.

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:26.360
So like, like, like, not to sell corny, but like 16 year olds, I'd really, you know,

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:32.360
um, without sounding corny about this, I mean, like just to put it in, in real, like, um,

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.200
you know, black and white, cliff note terms, you know, um, I'd been working with my sister

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:41.000
who I still love and adore, um, and, and we made this insane project where, you know,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.960
we have, um, of course, the Jeff Davis appearance, but everything from, you know, Miley Cyrus

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:53.200
to George Clinton to Alice Cooper, um, lots of really cool interviews and crazy sketches

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.840
and, you know, me at Charlotte Hornets games and, you know, and, um, in West Virginia,

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:02.800
Appalachia, it's like just a whole crazy show project that would make it.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.880
And then we had this big fallout.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.960
And so, you know, I, I just equate it like to, like, if you were part of a band, you

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.120
guys had been through like this journey and we're about to like, you know, finally release

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.760
your record, the band, you know, breaks up and the record is shelved.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.760
That's just the head state.

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.600
And, and, and, but you know what, the, the more I'm talking about this, I just want to

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.720
say, you know, like, fuck me, because I mean, these are really quality problems to have,

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.720
you know what I mean?

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:30.200
But at the same time, it's not so much about the project.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:35.840
It's about, um, just losing, you know, my sister, who, you know, I, uh, you guys just,

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.760
you know, it's like my right arm, you know, right?

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.240
What's your status with her right now?

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:45.440
No, we, we, um, we don't really talk at all, you know, and she was freaked out, man, because

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:49.040
she's like, like, I barely know her.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.840
And she, she was texting me.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:58.360
This is the, when I was in Fontana, I had actually left my phone in, um, a car of a,

01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.600
of a dude.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.560
And then I didn't really, um, exactly know how to get it back.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.960
And, um, kind of was just, you know, again, in a depressed state.

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.720
So I kind of like was like, you know, all right, I'm going to enjoy not having a phone.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.280
And this was only about like nine days.

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:19.120
And then, um, but it was, honestly, it felt kind of cool, like, to not have a phone.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.720
And I was just really sorting through, you know, my problems.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.800
And, uh, and so I had also kind of during that time without the phone, I made a decision

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:34.000
mentally to be like, okay, I'm stopping, um, doing the drugs that I was doing completely.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.200
And, um, you know, I, because at the end of the day, you know, I was doing that to, to

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.440
get myself through a hurdle.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:50.720
I was doing like a upper type of drug and when I'm getting that is, um, you know, if

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.440
you all of a sudden, you know, you, you find yourself alone, but you'd made all this, you

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.440
know, great progress and you didn't want to lose everything, but you were just really

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.040
confused how to move on without your band.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.240
You know, my thinking is, well, let me do this drug that will like, you know, kind of

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.560
like help focus me and numb, you know, my sadness over what happened.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:16.000
Because it was a really, um, you know, like emotional thing and, um, you know, you first

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.200
turned to a project oriented, uh, narcotic.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.200
Yes.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.200
Yes.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200
Yes.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.200
Exactly.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.200
Exactly.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200
That makes a lot of sense.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.200
I got that.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.160
That's, that's an interesting like explanation of that.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.560
Like, uh, yes, definitely, because it is the project, the thing that like when I, when

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:40.400
you invited me to the whiskey to meet LA guns, do you still have all that footage?

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.400
Oh, it's all there.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.400
Yeah.

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.400
It's going to be great.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.480
I just, I'm learning how to, how to, to edit it now.

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:52.200
I got, I got like years of content back stage to a rock show with Jesse camp and, uh, guess

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200
what?

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.680
Everybody is happy that Jesse's there and he has all this awesome footage of him and

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.280
his sister interviewing people and just talking backstage and that is something that I would

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.280
absolutely need to see.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280
Oh yeah.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.280
It's amazing.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.280
Is it still extant?

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.280
Like it'll happen still or not?

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.280
Oh, absolutely.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.360
And I mean, it's, it's a really cool project.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.600
It's kind of like, you know, like Mike judge, Mike judges tales from the tour bus, you know,

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.880
in that, um, you know, you have crazy rock stuff interweaving with just, um, basically

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:29.640
like, you know, uh, fun travel segments, like, you know, go into weird, uh, flea markets

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.800
in like Knoxville, Tennessee and helping out in the wig department there with, you know,

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:41.880
senior ladies watching, watching famous rockers meet you like, I, because I've, I've seen

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880
that.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880
Yeah.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880
And it's, it's pretty magical.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.760
Like, like that's something that should happen because like, like to know you is to love

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:55.280
you and to know who's also like to know that like you would like always make things happy

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.280
and fun.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.680
So like you have to finish this thing.

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.240
Well, let me, oh yeah.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.240
Yeah.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.160
And, and just super, just super quick, you guys, what I want to say is that basically

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:09.840
like during those, so this is the, the, the funny part about me, this is the part of the

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.400
story where I find out that I was a missing person because I had no idea.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.400
Okay.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.400
Cause like, I guess, you know, like my, so like I had emailed, oh, get this.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.400
Okay.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.280
Cause I'm, I'm very, I am very close with my mom.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.280
So just about your nine days gone, nine days gone.

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:34.560
And you're like, no, no, it was a good thing and yeah, nine days gone to paint the picture.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560
Now, so I'm in Fontana.

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.560
Are you editing?

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:43.760
Are you like, are you like working on a laptop on, they're like, and you're like, no, okay.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.400
No, just living life.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.840
Just like, you're just focused.

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.840
Yeah.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840
You're experiencing focus.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.320
Well, we talk about the fashion and I'm not bragging out of school here, but Jeff knows

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.320
this too.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.960
I'm a big, I'm a, I'd have to cross diagnose myself with another addiction and that's,

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.320
I'm a, I'm a thrift store junkie and like, you know, you're, you're wearing a jacket

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.960
right now that can only be described as like any get your gun meets, uh, wild, wild Bill

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960
Hickok.

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960
Yeah.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960
With a little Nell in there.

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.960
Yeah.

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.480
I thought Jody Foster, I mean, who wouldn't want to be the costume designer on Nell.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.760
It's just like bed sheets.

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.760
Okay.

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760
The thread.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760
John Bon Jody.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760
Yes.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.760
Yes.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.200
Oh, great story here.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.360
Great shout out.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.400
And here's another thing if, if, if, and I want, I really want to put my services out

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.400
there.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:39.640
If you guys, cause I, when I was here, um, right before Christmas, you guys had P homes

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.880
on that was, that was epic, brilliant show.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.880
I do.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.640
I, I love one other talent is that I think of myself as a mini booker and I'm not talking

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:56.120
about Richard Greco's character on the last season of 21 Jump Street, whose name is Booker.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120
Okay.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:04.480
A lot of, a lot of, uh, a reference for two people here on mis misread the crowd there.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480
Okay.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:11.680
But no, I mean, you guys are more of a Gilmore girls kind of bunch and that's cool with me.

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:17.040
You know, do you guys know that Dan gets starred as mailman Jerry on two unerred episodes

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.280
of Gilmore girls, very, very cool stuff.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:29.400
You know, it's only shown in Japan for reasons Dan knows a little about and, um, and, and

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400
so does Lauren Graham.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.400
Do you want to talk about that?

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:34.720
Hey, no, let me, let me, let me get back on track.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.720
Back on track.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.080
Is this, is this so, so I am, um, six, um, basically it's nine days after I had lost

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:46.000
my phone and said, just fuck it, you know, in that and, and then like three days sober

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
from that.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.560
But then, so I was three days sober, um, I started to get a bit of a sinus infection.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:39:00.800
And so I went to a hospital, yeah, I shouldn't say, but it's very close to Fontana and has

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.800
its own hospital and two good wills and the savers and it starts with the R and it's its

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800
own county.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800
Okay.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.800
Iverside.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.800
I was in Riverside.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.960
I go into the hospital and like, um, and you, you had been missing for months.

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.960
As far as I knew.

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.920
No, no, oh, we should suffix this.

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.000
So basically my sister had only briefly talked with my mom that I had been, that she hadn't

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.640
heard from me, my mom and I do talk on the reg.

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.360
And so then I think my sister did, I think her imagination, but maybe genuine concern,

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.760
maybe, maybe some guilt, maybe whatever.

01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.240
She was, she was really worried that cause she knew I was depressed.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.800
I mean, like she didn't know that.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:48.720
And so I mean, I think that she maybe genuinely was worried that I maybe did something rash

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:54.880
because I was so broken up about, you know, like, um, you know, just, uh, it's a really

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880
rough situation.

01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.160
You know, people that want to hurt you, like, like no business in your, your relationship,

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.960
but people that want to hurt you, um, and have the choice between soliciting finding

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.960
you.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.200
And one thing to say, I come from a big line of like, well, let's be dramatic about so

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.600
and so's problem and like want to help them because actually what we're doing is we're

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.240
weaponizing our like concern because they're, they're here every Christmas and let's fuck

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.400
with them.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:28.720
But, um, it's another thing for you to be off the, I don't, not knowing your sister,

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.560
I can safely say, I don't think it was her animosity that provoked her to explain to

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.680
people how dire it was that you were missing.

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.480
She was very concerned with me.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:43.360
She texted me and let me know, let me know that she was really worried.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.160
I think, I think if you, I think if you wanted to hurt somebody and they're, and they're

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.920
off the grid, whether it's nine days or three months, like you, you're, it's not the part

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:56.040
of you that hates them that makes you go, this is really serious.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.480
I, even if it's not really serious from your point of view, it's not the part of them

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.240
that hates you that makes them go to that high note.

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.680
That's the part of them that wants you found because maybe even the part of her that feels

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.560
a little bit of responsibility and I think that's very salvageable as much as this project

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:17.880
too, and, and, and easily salvageable and, and, and like, what, if not to like conduct

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:23.400
your fucking story, but like the feeling of that rope coming back out of that, like,

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.440
and, and, like, this idea of like, you didn't know you were missing content.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:34.760
And then, and then, and then absolutely, so, um, so I'm in this hospital and, um, you know,

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:39.120
I think I gave my, um, you know, a variation on my name.

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:45.960
I don't remember, I was not, oh man, um, I love a good emergency room and so I was in

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:54.120
one and, um, basically like, you know, they were the, you know what, screw that.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.680
This hospital was really a beautiful place.

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.680
There's a hospital.

01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.680
I don't know how many.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.720
And they had, they had one, they asked one thing of you, don't name our county.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:03.720
Right, right.

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:08.320
You've got two good wills and a great emergency room and you're like Riverside and now every

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320
fucking asshole.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:14.120
You got rumbled in there because you said the other name, but they go, but you're Jesse.

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120
Yes.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.120
Yes, exactly.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.200
So basically I told the nurse that my name was, you know, maybe, um, John Camp, I don't

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.200
even know.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:25.920
Um, not again, just for, you know, like, just because you, you know what I mean, he wants

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.360
to give you a real info and social security number to a hospital.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.200
You told them they're your actual name, but they're like, but aren't you right?

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:34.200
Right.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.200
Right.

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.200
Right.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.200
Right.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.200
Right.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.200
Right.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.200
So I said probably that, um, cause my full, you know, my full name is Tito camp.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:44.560
And so basically set him Tito camp and then they're like, okay, Tito, but like the nurse

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.880
looked at me like she kind of like knew who I was, which was really weird because I was,

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:56.760
you know, um, yeah, a little disheveled perhaps or then again, I don't look much different

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.760
than now.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.880
I'm not very much a kindred spirit with a drunk Gary Busey, but, um, whereas going with

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.760
this is that so basically then the nurse is like, okay, all right, you know, Josh, I think

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.960
I said I was Josh cause that's, that's very close to my, um, my full name, which is

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.960
Chad would have been believable.

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:16.960
Yeah.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:22.760
I'm a, I look like Chad so much like a Chad, a Chad wick is also what they call, um, the

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.120
part of a candle that you like called Chad, stay on target.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:34.360
So, um, basically then I'm sitting to the nurse is like, okay, Josh, you know, and then

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.960
the, then, and then the doctor comes in and he's like, Jesse, what's going on?

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.040
And I'm like, what the fuck?

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.040
How did he know?

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.720
Jesse, I've been telling people I was Josh and so I said, oh, Jesse, but then I knew

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720
the J was up.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.720
They knew who I was.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:53.560
And so I was just like, like trying to put the pieces together, like I know that I'm

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.760
a national treasure.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:44:01.440
I know that the U S has made several, not just one stamp with my face on it, but like

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.840
10 different, you know, stamps by annually with my head on it.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.840
It's great.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.760
Um, the new 34 stent Jesse camp stamp is Jesse camp stamp for all you tramps.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760
Okay.

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760
Enough rhyming.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.800
I have a camp stamp over my butt.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:24.600
Jeff does have a camp stamp from the time he, um, he was with my mom and I didn't understand

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.600
the relationship at the time.

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.600
Now I do.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.080
It was a very beautiful Herald and then mod type of deal back on target, back on track.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.080
Okay.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.600
So, um, to the doctor was like, you know, like, just, you know, like, okay, Jess.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:42.120
So I, I, so again, I had said that my name was Josh to the nurse and then the nurse was

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:47.160
like, Josh, okay, Josh, why don't you come back here with me?

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:50.520
And then she came in, Josh, the doctor will see you now.

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.520
Oh, okay.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.520
Cool.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.520
Hey, I'm Josh.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.160
I have a sinus infection.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.040
You know, I just need some antibiotics.

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.880
I didn't rush to that part yet.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.280
Never self-diagnose yourself at the doctor's office.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.640
That is a sure way to not get the prescription you're trying to get filled.

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.400
You know, like, don't go in there and be like, oh, you know, like, let them assess your back

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400
pain.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.640
Just look real grimacing in the face so they really believe you're in pain.

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.640
Don't oversell it.

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.640
Okay.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.560
That's to my homes in New Hampshire and West Virginia.

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:21.960
You know who you are at the pill mill, but back on track.

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.080
I'm just kidding.

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.280
Who am I to throw stones?

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:32.280
What I'm really getting at is that, yo, I'm like lost in Fontana, F in California, end

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.880
up at a hospital in the Riverside.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.240
Basically the doctor had like seen something about me being missing on TMZ.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:48.040
I had no clue in the nine days since I had lost my phone that somehow like I had been

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:56.840
reported on like, you know, on like people.com, you know, does the dick meet the expectations

01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:01.040
of the foot size website, you know, dick it or stick it.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.960
I mean, no, what am I talking about?

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960
I'm sorry guys.

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.240
Stick it or stick it is something.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.720
I think we can make some money.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:08.720
Dicker is sticker.

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.760
I think it's definitely like a, you know, your doctor swiped left or right.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:18.000
Your doctor is at the ER had seen you on TMZ and so they were so actually really

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.480
really super cool.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.760
They brought me like two meals of hospital food on.

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.760
I didn't ask.

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.360
They were just like, they were like super cool.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.120
Like they were like basically like they owned a sports bar and kid rock came in there.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.120
Yeah.

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.000
They're like, you know, they're dope.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.920
They were just like, you want some Delotin's and I was just like, no, you know, all right.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:39.920
Sure.

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:41.920
What's the street value?

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.880
Yes, I'll take it, but they were really, really cool and really sweet and really encouraging

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:54.600
and they said, you know, um, honestly, something along the lines of, you know, that, that,

01:46:54.600 --> 01:47:01.040
you know, you have a good soul and you're a good kid and not kid because I am definitely

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.040
now like, um, I'm in the halftime show, but yo, I'm 39 years old.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.080
So 40 is the halftime and then, you know what I mean?

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.920
If life is a football game or a Super Bowl, but, um, back at the matter at hand and again,

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:22.280
I'm totally be honest, that's a self defense mechanism to kind of like, you know, to try

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:27.240
to put some humor on this cause, cause these, yeah, it's, it is rough talking about this

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:34.320
is necessary, but these, these were beyond humbling times, growing times and times when

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.760
you know, um, yeah, you, you, you, you just, you are all of this in the end is, is, is

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.880
good because, you know, it, but in that moment where you, where you irritated, it's okay.

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:46.880
But the answer is yes.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:51.680
Because at the time it was like, like, I was a little, well, you know, I'm here by choice

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.520
and I don't want to be rescued and it's embarrassing that people like, I can imagine that would

01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:01.200
be very humiliating and, and maybe angry when you, when you find out you're a missing person

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:08.200
when you were just, you know, um, at the, you know, end of a year and a half drug odyssey

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:14.800
and that ends in again, Fontana, it's right off the 10 by the way, Fontana is that beautiful

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:21.760
hamlet between Ontario and San Bernardino. Okay. So again, if you want to go to Fontana,

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:29.200
take the ten freeway fun about it. It's a lot heavier on the fawn as in dude. Fondue

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:36.480
is if chocolate and cheese and fondue is like, and it has some, I know that that okay. Final

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.120
thought we have to wrap up here though. We do have to wrap up. I know and I will like

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:44.880
a fucking condom about to go into Heidi flight. I don't want to write your story for you,

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.880
but we're looking for that moment of like the crossing and return threshold where you

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.160
were like, okay, I'm coming back. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I got that moment for

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.840
you and more Jesse. I'm going to pull a Stefan Jesse redemption isn't lower East Side New

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:04.120
York bar where there are lots of midgets that wear Fanny packs. Jesse, I have to say the

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.200
day that you called me up and you had been gone for a while and you called me up, I,

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:13.000
you couldn't, I got to say, yeah, the feeling that hit me. I think I know where you're getting

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.840
at Jeff is that when the doctors, they really showed a lot of love and that's, I had no

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:26.280
idea that I was missing when I had checked out of the planet or lost my phone. I definitely

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.920
wasn't wasn't in the headspace of thinking that there's a big world out there that that

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.000
cares about you or that you're significant. You know what I mean? I definitely felt like

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:43.320
broken. I felt, you know, almost to the point of here's the thing is that if you have nothing

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.200
to lose, there's a real freedom with that. I mean, like, like Kris Kristofferson freedoms,

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:51.120
just another word for nothing left to lose. You probably thought you were doing yourself

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.680
and other people a favor. Yeah, I mean, I didn't care anymore. And I just more honest

01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:02.000
than you had been, you felt, but you felt like that's the riveting part of this. Like,

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.320
I feel this way so much. And like, I want to hear from people that have gone and come

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:12.160
back. Yeah. So sorry, sorry to interrupt. But no, not at all. I mean, that's definitely

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:22.400
a sign of, you know, of not being. No, let's just call it what it is. I mean, you're depressed.

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:27.320
If you're not, if you lose your phone and you don't want to like immediately go to an

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:36.600
Apple store or ATT or Sprint or whomever you get your phone from. Again, if you want a

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:43.400
good phone at a relatively cheaper price than even offer up the 24 hour auto zone in Fontana

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:52.040
has all your needs mobile mechanics, Pays to grind with transgender. They got mechanics

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:57.040
to go as you felt that feeling when you felt that very complicated layered feeling of a

01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.120
lost my phone. And for the first time in my life, I feel like actually maybe that's the

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:08.320
way to go. I feel good. My life is there. Is there a return threshold equivalent? I'm

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:14.960
just a screenwriter from the Sidfield school. Like, is there a picture to really be just

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:21.440
just blunt about where I was prior to this? Did you save a cat at any point? No, that's

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.760
a screenwriting joke. Okay, continue. Sorry. No, I mean, no, no, no, sorry. I don't get

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.960
distracted by that. It didn't even get a laugh. So not worth it. Well, to add to that, you

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:37.240
know, I I'd like to think I didn't save a cat. No, you shouldn't have you shouldn't

01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:41.240
have and that's not story structure. That's a different thing. It's a dialectic about

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:49.240
okay. Not bad. But um, but here's the thing and believe me, man, like Bruce, do not even

01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:57.600
I don't even mean to even remotely think that I'm like, on the level of like a beautiful

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:03.040
soul like a Bruce Springsteen. But to be really honest, I was just so broken that I was kind

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.760
of wandering the streets of Fontana, kind of like Bruce Springsteen in the streets of

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:14.120
Philadelphia video, you know, where I believe, you know, from the movie where where Tom Hanks

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:22.000
has AIDS and he knows he's not gonna survive that and then you you know, you're just pulling

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.600
back from life in a way. I mean, I was just at a point where I was almost I don't I don't

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:33.800
man, I was just at my threshold of what I could endure. But the thing is, is that having

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.040
the strength to enter, I want to let everyone in this room know that like, you know, I was

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:43.960
just depressed, but never in a bazillion years would I ever no matter the level of

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:49.400
depression. And this is not also me passing judgment on people that that that check out

01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:55.440
and can't take it. But I still know, even in my darkest hours, what a blessing it is

01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:03.680
to be alive. And, you know, I'm very much, you know, of the opinion of if you've they

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:07.560
say this about successful people that when you realize something's not going right, you

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:11.520
know, you can abandon it quickly. And that, you know, the longer we that if you're in

01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:15.680
a toxic relationship, you know, but you put a lot of time in it, you're apt to stay in

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.400
it longer because you've already invested this time. So you don't want to lose the time

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:23.280
you already have. And that's why bad relationships kind of go on and on and on forever.

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:25.040
And what if you feel that about your life?

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:31.160
Well, I'll say I'll say this just for myself. And I think for everybody, I love you.

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:37.720
Yeah. And no, I know that. And I and it's, I didn't mean to shut you off on that, Jeff,

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.840
I know that. And but I mean, to hear that from you that that that that's a heavy emotion.

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:49.920
But I mean, that was it was it was what this it was a really this is beyond the life changing

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:53.920
experience. Because I mean, I'm not saying that I was like a guy who jumped off the Golden

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:59.200
Bridge Golden Gate Bridge and like survived. And now that's the danger to me. That's the

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:04.200
thing is that we a lot of us associate like the idea of these thoughts with I was never

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.480
ever going to put a gun in your mouth, all that stuff. But like, the these decisions

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.280
can be made in the I know exactly the feeling that you're talking about when you're like,

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:18.280
you know what? What if I was a fucking ghost? What if I didn't exist? That's different from

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.680
saying, I'm going to take proactive action to do this dramatic thing because you're

01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:29.160
feeling the opposite of dramatic. You're feeling worthless. You're feeling like like just like

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:39.160
it feels in those moments like not just liberation, but like a weird medicinal kind of like, yeah,

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.720
this is it. This is what I need. This feels good. Totally. It's I'm not going to say no,

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:50.080
it's not good, but I'm also going to say it's incredibly dangerous because you're alone.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:57.920
And so yeah, it was there. Was there a I mean, I mean, or have you been dragged back and

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:04.160
we're going to lose you again to that? Never. No, no, no, no, this. No, to be really blunt

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.440
about that. And that and the other thing too is that I'm not I'm not anything coming out

01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.200
my mouth. I'm not trying to to pet myself on the back. But I mean, like, there's definitely,

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:23.800
you know, the fun love inside of me. But I mean, I'm, you know, I'm experienced as far

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.800
as like that you could, you know what? No, I'm not even going to say what I was going

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.120
to say, but I could definitely just say that, you know, like if I'm walking the streets

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:40.880
in Fontana, you know, I mean, like, I love to to bring I live like to put positive energy

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:46.880
out there into the world. That's that's my that that's really the only reason to live

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:53.880
life where I'm going with this all is that this this is really heavy. But I promise I

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.080
didn't take you guys this far to abandon it. But what I the point I was trying to get at

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.200
when I brought up that whole thing about successful people and then knowing how to quit early,

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.400
but like that that really if you're following your heart and you've invested so much time

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:14.240
in a bad relationship, you know, you want to hang in there. Well, I mean, I'm very much

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.080
like that in life, you know, I didn't put in these 39 years to not, you know, now I've

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:24.480
been in it that I'm definitely wanting to see it all the way till 80, maybe 90, or you

01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:31.800
know, with, yeah, head transplants, maybe 110, you know, who knows. But where I'm really

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:37.480
going with all this is that it was two things. And then I promise I'll wrap this up. But

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:46.200
it was really, I think that what our subconscious is, our subconscious do for us is sometimes

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:53.720
incredibly protective. Because I thought that I think in a lot of ways that I don't know

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:59.360
this is going to sound crazy, but you know, like, I wanted to lose that phone. And I wanted

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:05.400
to go off the grid, because I ultimately wanted to get to that place. I wanted to make a

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:11.120
low for myself and make that low as fast as I could, because I wanted to land. And I didn't

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:19.160
want to live the way that I had been living. And I just didn't, you know, and, and, and

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:25.480
I didn't, I, I didn't want to numb the pain. That's basically all I did for like a year

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:31.680
and a half was just numb this emotional pain, didn't grow from it. My body was just in subconscious

01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:37.240
and mind was just, you know, telling me to let go. Because one thing I completely do

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:44.240
believe in is that I think and obviously if you were at 9 11 and you were with all that

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:48.840
the debris that was so cancerous, you're going to get cancer. But I do think sorry, sorry,

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:54.400
that's probably a weird time to break that to you. Oh, yeah. But that anger is a cancer.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.000
And so I really think that long story short that I needed to kind of like, you know, go

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.320
off the grid, but my thinking was just that I was going to do this. I was going to then,

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.000
you know, get a couple of days sober and then just continue on my journey. It was almost

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.960
like wanting to get clean and like a cocoon. And so I just, and I came out and, and I had

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:21.120
no idea what I told Jeff is true that, that, that, that basically you would go on like,

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:24.880
you know, Instagram and you'd see like, you know, like people would be like, Oh, Nikki

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:30.360
six was, you know, looking for you. And you know, when President Barack Obama was looking

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:34.960
for you, you know what I mean? And Rex Tillerson was looking for you. What's the connection

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:40.600
there? And I'm just like, I don't know. I mean, like, Rex, he was always a big fan.

01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.520
You know, I mean, it was just like, he would be like, yo, Jess, get on the big Exxon Valdez

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:51.320
cruise boat thing and let's party. I mean, but Rex Tillerson was looking for you. Oh

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:56.560
man, man, it's a hacky part of me that's like pushing through this weird return threshold

01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.360
thing. I think the incredibly valuable thing is the resonance of like everybody, whether

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:04.840
or not they drop off the grid and go to Fontana, lose their phone or not. We constantly are

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:10.360
combating this feeling of like, I'm a fucking ghost. I would be better focused and doing

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:17.000
a better job. It's like, it is possible to kill yourself with everyone's permission

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.840
because you'd never checked with them because you didn't talk about it. You can you can

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:27.760
slip away into shadow and you don't perceive it as shadow. I'm not. And I know that the

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:32.640
whole time you're like, look, I never intended to do any of this. And I am not telling you,

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:38.760
no, you're perceived it wrong. I'm I'm saying the reason that story is so valuable is because

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:44.360
I think everybody listening is constantly going like, well, what if I what if I what

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.120
if I what if I and it's not always what if I did something dangerous? What if I did

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:53.480
something? It's sort of just sort of like, like, like, would anyone miss me? Like, like,

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:57.840
like, shouldn't I just shouldn't I just be by myself? And there's a really fine line

01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:08.400
between that like self help and like the opposite. Yeah. And here's the thing is that I mean,

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:15.600
I think what it really boils completely down to in the soul and the spirit of us of people

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:22.960
is that is having hope. Hope is everything. If you have hope, hope will fuel positivity.

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:28.640
I mean, one big lesson I learned from all of this is that mental health is the most important

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:34.800
thing we have. And that, like your physical health, like you do have to exercise and and

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.800
be conscious of what you're eating, you know, mental health, I just always took it for granted

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:47.320
before the last couple of years. And I realized that it's incredibly important to to be social,

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:52.840
to not self isolate and to be with all your friends and and to live a full life and and

02:00:52.840 --> 02:01:00.760
to say yes. And just but but more than that, I mean, it's a battle out there. And there's

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:07.360
never been a harder time to be a human being. No scratch that statement. I can't believe

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.600
I was about to say there was never a harder time to be a human than 2019. What am I thinking

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:18.640
caveman? You know, I'm going to get by a buffalo.

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.120
Let's give it up everybody. Thank you for coming to heart.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:28.440
She can't everybody. Thank you for being vulnerable sharing your before I go out on the music.

02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:34.960
I want to say, Jesse, I fucking love you. I'm a lucky man to have quality and anybody

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.280
listening. If you ever get the lucky break to hang out with Jesse camp, you are a fucking

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.920
lucky human. Well, a couple of things to plug if I may. Yes.

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:53.440
All right. I got a to hear who here is a big salt and pepper fan. Well, yo, get this. It's

02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.720
not a competing podcast, but I have a pepper cast. That's right. Me and pepper from salt

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:06.760
and pepper. We are just everybody. Yeah, this has been a chance for David's dad. I mean,

02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:15.000
but for real, maybe you're a joy to know you're a joy to be around. And I appreciate you so

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.400
much to the bottom of my boots, man. Thank you all.

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.400
Try it fast and take chance. Thank you.

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:43.400
Did you get any of that?
