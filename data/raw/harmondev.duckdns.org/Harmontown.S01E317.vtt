First order of business, let's do apologies and then corrections.\n\n01:20.040 --> 01:21.040\nYay.\n\n01:21.040 --> 01:25.040\nSorry for last week. My part of it. Not anybody else's.\n\n01:25.040 --> 01:26.040\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:32.040\nI was blackout drunk, so I had to listen. It's a fitting punishment when I'm like,\n\n01:32.040 --> 01:37.040\nlook, we got together, we did some ad reads at like 2.30 p.m. that day.\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:38.040\nYeah.\n\n01:38.040 --> 01:40.040\nAnd I knew what I was doing. I talked to my therapist all about it.\n\n01:40.040 --> 01:43.040\nI'm like, she's like, you know, it's like, well, yeah, we got everything else squared away.\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:45.040\nNow that you're almost a perfect person, you know,\n\n01:45.040 --> 01:49.040\nstarting to talk about the drinking and talking about the drinking means just that, you know,\n\n01:49.040 --> 01:54.040\njust doesn't have to be a movie of the week or demonized or binary decisions or anything.\n\n01:54.040 --> 01:56.040\nJust talk about your relationship with it.\n\n01:56.040 --> 02:01.040\nAnd I was very personally embarrassed by my own definitions.\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:03.040\nLast week, I couldn't put a thought together.\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:11.040\nI trampled all over the rose garden of a new engagement by trying to say something about it\n\n02:11.040 --> 02:15.040\nthat I just came out as me going like, what if I was a slave?\n\n02:15.040 --> 02:18.040\nI don't even know what I was trying to say.\n\n02:18.040 --> 02:22.040\nIt's a fitting punishment that I have to listen to the episodes where I don't remember them\n\n02:22.040 --> 02:28.040\nbecause then it's like, yeah, nose and shit kind of like, listen to what you said.\n\n02:28.040 --> 02:32.040\nI mean, yeah, airlines are criminal organizations.\n\n02:32.040 --> 02:34.040\nThere I said it.\n\n02:34.040 --> 02:37.040\nIt doesn't need to be 70 minutes.\n\n02:37.040 --> 02:40.040\nI don't know why I think no one agrees with me,\n\n02:40.040 --> 02:47.040\nbut apparently there's a certain line of alcohol where I just don't know anyone has heard me\n\n02:47.040 --> 02:50.040\nand that I've said the thing.\n\n02:50.040 --> 02:55.040\nBut it's like just, I'm already normally when I'm sober or a little tipsy,\n\n02:55.040 --> 03:02.040\nlike I'm naturally stammery and babbly and embarrassing and confessional and awkward.\n\n03:02.040 --> 03:09.040\nBut I think there's a deal is broken when I come out so incoherent\n\n03:09.040 --> 03:13.040\nthat I may as well be like anybody.\n\n03:13.040 --> 03:18.040\nThere's times that Dan, like as I've known you for a thousand years, that you're...\n\n03:18.040 --> 03:20.040\nLet me get a drink while you're talking.\n\n03:20.040 --> 03:29.040\nThere's times when you're really drunk.\n\n03:29.040 --> 03:32.040\nLike when I get really drunk, I cannot talk.\n\n03:32.040 --> 03:34.040\nYou can talk drunk.\n\n03:34.040 --> 03:39.040\nAnd sometimes when you're saying things drunk, drunkenly to adverbize that,\n\n03:39.040 --> 03:43.040\nyou still are kind of making sense.\n\n03:43.040 --> 03:45.040\nAnd I wonder, am I just being dumb right now?\n\n03:45.040 --> 03:50.040\nAre you making a profound thought or are you just...\n\n03:50.040 --> 03:52.040\nNo, I probably make no sense.\n\n03:52.040 --> 03:55.040\nAnd you're probably drunk too when I'm drunk because we're probably drinking together.\n\n03:55.040 --> 03:58.040\nBecause why else would you and I be so shit-faced?\n\n03:58.040 --> 04:02.040\nThe answer is each other. Bad for each other.\n\n04:02.040 --> 04:04.040\nWe're like the opposite of a mongoose and a cobra.\n\n04:04.040 --> 04:06.040\nAnd no, I don't mean a cobra and a mongoose.\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:13.040\nSee, you're drunk. I have no idea what you're talking about right now.\n\n04:13.040 --> 04:19.040\nWhat happens is your metaphors get mixed into a jambalaya...\n\n04:19.040 --> 04:21.040\nYeah, that only happens when he's drunk.\n\n04:21.040 --> 04:23.040\nYour metaphors are great.\n\n04:23.040 --> 04:25.040\nNo, this is a very pithy observation.\n\n04:25.040 --> 04:27.040\nYou can't just invert the cobra-mongoose relationship.\n\n04:27.040 --> 04:29.040\nYou end up with the exact same thing.\n\n04:29.040 --> 04:31.040\nRight?\n\n04:31.040 --> 04:34.040\nYou're just going to turn one person into the mongoose.\n\n04:34.040 --> 04:36.040\nI still hate each other.\n\n04:36.040 --> 04:39.040\nSo how drunk are you right now, like one to a hundred?\n\n04:39.040 --> 04:42.040\nSober as a non-supreme court justice.\n\n04:42.040 --> 04:45.040\nYou know, when in...\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:47.040\nSober as a Kavanaugh.\n\n04:47.040 --> 04:52.040\nSee, so sober that I'm doing boring, semi-topical, non-applicable humor.\n\n04:52.040 --> 04:55.040\nLike, oh, he's famous for beer, right?\n\n04:55.040 --> 04:59.040\nMadonna's a whore and Kevorkian kills people.\n\n04:59.040 --> 05:01.040\nYeah, I'm sober.\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:03.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:05.040\nRemember Dr. Kevorkian?\n\n05:05.040 --> 05:07.040\nThere is a saying when people say I'm sober as a judge,\n\n05:07.040 --> 05:09.040\nand I don't know if that's meant to be...\n\n05:09.040 --> 05:11.040\nThat's what I meant. Ironic or, yeah.\n\n05:11.040 --> 05:13.040\nI was going to say sober as a judge, and then I was like,\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:17.040\noh, fun thing to do.\n\n05:17.040 --> 05:19.040\nIt's dumb.\n\n05:19.040 --> 05:21.040\nLike, I'm not saying I'm funny when I'm sober,\n\n05:21.040 --> 05:24.040\nor interesting or entertaining.\n\n05:24.040 --> 05:28.040\nI'm just saying, for me, it's like $5, $10, whatever you pay\n\n05:28.040 --> 05:31.040\nto listen to me talk for a little while.\n\n05:31.040 --> 05:35.040\nLike, my definition of malpractice is\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:39.040\nI don't understand what you're even trying to say.\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:44.040\nLike, you're just, like, figure-aiding in non-sensities.\n\n05:44.040 --> 05:49.040\nLike, even Jeff Bridges figured out what he meant\n\n05:49.040 --> 05:52.040\nat the Golden Globes, like, he eventually.\n\n05:52.040 --> 05:54.040\nSomebody asked me recently, like, what is Harmontown?\n\n05:54.040 --> 05:56.040\nIs it improv?\n\n05:56.040 --> 06:01.040\nI would just define it more as drunken malfeasance.\n\n06:01.040 --> 06:04.040\nYeah, it's self-destruction, I think, you know,\n\n06:04.040 --> 06:07.040\nlike a little confession, a little transparency\n\n06:07.040 --> 06:09.040\nat the risk of, you know, a little,\n\n06:09.040 --> 06:15.040\nit's like a rich man's NASCAR.\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:17.040\nYou technically, supposedly, you don't want to see me\n\n06:17.040 --> 06:20.040\nburn to death, but let's face it,\n\n06:20.040 --> 06:25.040\nwhat are you, like, watching me go in circles?\n\n06:25.040 --> 06:29.040\nYeah, rich man's NASCAR.\n\n06:29.040 --> 06:34.040\nOkay, so that's my apology.\n\n06:34.040 --> 06:37.040\nAnd I don't mean I owe you an apology.\n\n06:37.040 --> 06:39.040\nI owe anybody, well, I owe you an apology\n\n06:39.040 --> 06:41.040\nif you guys came here last week.\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:43.040\nI think if you come out, you come out in the rain\n\n06:43.040 --> 06:46.040\nor a shine or whatever, you leave your apartment,\n\n06:46.040 --> 06:48.040\nyou're risking your life for me.\n\n06:48.040 --> 06:50.040\nIt's Logan's run out there.\n\n06:50.040 --> 06:52.040\nNo, wait, Logan's run is a totally peaceful society.\n\n06:52.040 --> 06:54.040\nYou just have to voluntarily die at 30.\n\n06:54.040 --> 06:56.040\nZardaz out there.\n\n06:56.040 --> 06:59.040\nZardaz out there.\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:03.040\nTomorrow is a 70% chance of Zardaz.\n\n07:03.040 --> 07:05.040\nIt's Rollerball out there.\n\n07:05.040 --> 07:07.040\nAnd you're not a professional rollerballer.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:09.040\nYou're one of the audience whose lives\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:10.040\nwe don't really get to see.\n\n07:10.040 --> 07:12.040\nOne day they will come out with a sequel to Rollerball\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:14.040\nthat's like a Rosencransey-Gildensterni\n\n07:14.040 --> 07:18.040\nlike, look at what it's like to be a Rollerball fan.\n\n07:18.040 --> 07:21.040\nNobody knows what you're fucking talking about.\n\n07:21.040 --> 07:22.040\nI don't know about Rollerball.\n\n07:22.040 --> 07:24.040\nAnd yet, Sober as a senator.\n\n07:24.040 --> 07:27.040\nSober as a Kavanaugh.\n\n07:27.040 --> 07:29.040\nOkay, those are the apologies.\n\n07:29.040 --> 07:31.040\nCorrections.\n\n07:31.040 --> 07:34.040\nThe BBC tweeted somebody.\n\n07:34.040 --> 07:36.040\nI think they tweeted Cody.\n\n07:36.040 --> 07:39.040\nNo, not Big Black Cock.\n\n07:39.040 --> 07:42.040\nThe news.\n\n07:42.040 --> 07:44.040\nIt's a porn abrieve.\n\n07:44.040 --> 07:46.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n07:46.040 --> 07:49.040\nWe were all thinking it.\n\n07:49.040 --> 07:51.040\nYeah, who among us heard BBC\n\n07:51.040 --> 07:53.040\nand didn't think Big Black Cock?\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:55.040\nCome on.\n\n07:55.040 --> 07:57.040\nYeah, we're all people.\n\n07:57.040 --> 07:59.040\nLet's move on.\n\n07:59.040 --> 08:03.040\nThe posh is not an acronym.\n\n08:03.040 --> 08:05.040\nThat's another bullshit thing.\n\n08:05.040 --> 08:07.040\nEverything you hear that you hear is an acronym.\n\n08:07.040 --> 08:08.040\nIt's all bullshit.\n\n08:08.040 --> 08:09.040\nI should have known better.\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:11.040\nBecause it was British, I fell for it.\n\n08:11.040 --> 08:13.040\nI perpetuated a thing.\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:15.040\nHopefully new friends, maybe if they come on the show.\n\n08:15.040 --> 08:17.040\nBut if they listen to last week's episode,\n\n08:17.040 --> 08:19.040\nthey probably won't come.\n\n08:19.040 --> 08:21.040\nI think they're coming.\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:23.040\nI think they emailed the ladies I was referring to\n\n08:23.040 --> 08:25.040\nfor the red-handed podcast.\n\n08:25.040 --> 08:27.040\nSo maybe they'll come, but then I thought,\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:29.040\nthey probably listened to.\n\n08:29.040 --> 08:31.040\nWhoa!\n\n08:31.040 --> 08:33.040\nBut I heard from them,\n\n08:33.040 --> 08:36.040\nand they speak with such dignified grace and poise,\n\n08:36.040 --> 08:39.040\nthat I just kind of swallowed it and repeated it,\n\n08:39.040 --> 08:42.040\nthat posh was an acronym for port out starboard home.\n\n08:42.040 --> 08:44.040\nNo, it's not.\n\n08:44.040 --> 08:47.040\nIt's a myth in the great kingdom.\n\n08:47.040 --> 08:50.040\nAnd it's like, I remember my dad telling me\n\n08:50.040 --> 08:53.040\nthat fuck stood for for use of carnal knowledge.\n\n08:53.040 --> 08:55.040\nYeah.\n\n08:55.040 --> 08:57.040\nIt's the truth.\n\n08:57.040 --> 08:59.040\nThere's only two words that are actually acronyms.\n\n08:59.040 --> 09:01.040\nIt's laser and scuba.\n\n09:01.040 --> 09:03.040\nEverything else is like everything else is an urban legend.\n\n09:03.040 --> 09:05.040\nThere's nothing.\n\n09:05.040 --> 09:07.040\nHey, did you know nothing's an acronym?\n\n09:07.040 --> 09:09.040\nIt stands for non-official thing.\n\n09:09.040 --> 09:11.040\nTactical harmony involving no.\n\n09:11.040 --> 09:13.040\nThat's what I like.\n\n09:13.040 --> 09:15.040\nI like snafu and food bar, though.\n\n09:15.040 --> 09:17.040\nYeah, those are real.\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:19.040\nOkay.\n\n09:19.040 --> 09:21.040\nNo, but those are also just acronyms and not words.\n\n09:21.040 --> 09:23.040\nBut that's what sucks about linguistics.\n\n09:23.040 --> 09:25.040\nLike the unlike, I mean, obviously in history,\n\n09:25.040 --> 09:27.040\nthere's like conflicting theories and stuff,\n\n09:27.040 --> 09:29.040\nbut there's generally prevailing opinions.\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:31.040\nBut in linguistics is like,\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:35.040\nwell, the top five things that could be the words are these,\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:38.040\nand they're all like, oh, it could be this guy's shoe fell off\n\n09:38.040 --> 09:41.040\nand it became the word or it could be it used to be logos,\n\n09:41.040 --> 09:43.040\nwhich meant this guy's shoe that fell off.\n\n09:43.040 --> 09:46.040\nAnd it's just like really weird because they're all like treated as\n\n09:46.040 --> 09:48.040\nlike the real one, but it's like, well,\n\n09:48.040 --> 09:50.040\nit's probably not even any of these.\n\n09:50.040 --> 09:53.040\nI really, from what we really know of language,\n\n09:53.040 --> 09:56.040\nwhat we know is that the, what would you call it,\n\n09:56.040 --> 09:59.040\nthe refraction, if that's, I don't know if that's what you'd call it,\n\n09:59.040 --> 10:01.040\nlike what is light going through glass?\n\n10:01.040 --> 10:02.040\nIs that refraction?\n\n10:02.040 --> 10:03.040\nDiffraction?\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:08.040\nDiffraction, whatever the medium of time\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:10.040\nas language moves forward,\n\n10:10.040 --> 10:14.040\nit causes so much chaos in ratio to linear,\n\n10:14.040 --> 10:17.040\nlogical evolution of words.\n\n10:17.040 --> 10:20.040\nOh, did you know, I can't even riff an example,\n\n10:20.040 --> 10:22.040\nI'll just confuse and embarrass,\n\n10:22.040 --> 10:25.040\nbut it just, the real stuff that we do know about,\n\n10:25.040 --> 10:31.040\nit only serves to show you that the logic is not linear at all\n\n10:31.040 --> 10:33.040\nin terms of how language develops.\n\n10:33.040 --> 10:37.040\nI'll riff probably a really embarrassing example because it probably,\n\n10:37.040 --> 10:41.040\nbut just the idea that Bill is an abbreviation for William,\n\n10:41.040 --> 10:44.040\nand every example that's not a guy's name,\n\n10:44.040 --> 10:47.040\nlike within our language, like how, you know,\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:50.040\nwell, yoke became joke, became toke, became bloke,\n\n10:50.040 --> 10:53.040\nlike it doesn't, there is no logic to it.\n\n10:53.040 --> 10:56.040\nNone of that is real, yoke never became joke,\n\n10:56.040 --> 10:58.040\nthere's no, I'm just, if you, but,\n\n10:58.040 --> 11:01.040\nso that suggests that the things that we have theories about\n\n11:01.040 --> 11:03.040\nare probably wrong, right?\n\n11:03.040 --> 11:06.040\nYeah, they're probably just the best stories that kept persisting.\n\n11:06.040 --> 11:07.040\nYeah.\n\n11:07.040 --> 11:13.040\nThere's a series, I think it's by, is it Earl Funk from Funkin' Waggles?\n\n11:13.040 --> 11:15.040\nIt is.\n\n11:15.040 --> 11:18.040\nI don't know if I'm getting the name right if it's Earl or not.\n\n11:18.040 --> 11:22.040\nThere's four books, I think, that are about etymology of idioms.\n\n11:22.040 --> 11:25.040\nLike why do we say, bury the hatchet,\n\n11:25.040 --> 11:28.040\nwhy do we say break a leg, all these things,\n\n11:28.040 --> 11:30.040\nand most of them are like, we don't,\n\n11:30.040 --> 11:33.040\nthe jury is still out on that one.\n\n11:33.040 --> 11:36.040\nWe think it's because of this,\n\n11:36.040 --> 11:38.040\nbut here's the first time it was ever used in print,\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:40.040\nand I can't get enough of that,\n\n11:40.040 --> 11:43.040\nbecause there's a big debate about why to break a leg.\n\n11:43.040 --> 11:44.040\nRight.\n\n11:44.040 --> 11:47.040\nAnd I love that, because we really don't know.\n\n11:47.040 --> 11:49.040\nI grew up with people saying,\n\n11:49.040 --> 11:51.040\noh, it's the opposite of good luck,\n\n11:51.040 --> 11:53.040\nbecause you're not supposed to be superstitious in the theater.\n\n11:53.040 --> 11:56.040\nThey say, they're saying have the opposite of a great show,\n\n11:56.040 --> 11:58.040\nso you have a good show, but then you told me,\n\n11:58.040 --> 12:00.040\nyou break a leg when you bow,\n\n12:00.040 --> 12:03.040\nso they're like, and you would bow if they were applauding at all.\n\n12:03.040 --> 12:06.040\nIt's saying make it to the end, like get to the bow.\n\n12:06.040 --> 12:09.040\nSurvive, be more interesting than the bear stabbing down the street.\n\n12:09.040 --> 12:14.040\nHard to beat to the point where you have to actually do something\n\n12:14.040 --> 12:16.040\nat the end of your play.\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:18.040\nReading these books, because they're so old,\n\n12:18.040 --> 12:22.040\nI think I used one like, you know, episode seven of Harmon 10,\n\n12:22.040 --> 12:25.040\nwhere I said, porous Job's turkey.\n\n12:25.040 --> 12:26.040\nDamn.\n\n12:26.040 --> 12:29.040\nJob's turkey, you know that turkey was broke,\n\n12:29.040 --> 12:31.040\nbecause Job lost everything.\n\n12:31.040 --> 12:33.040\nIf he had a turkey.\n\n12:33.040 --> 12:38.040\nJob's most prized family members were fodder for a jealous god.\n\n12:38.040 --> 12:42.040\nSo, of course, his turkey probably was pretty stringy.\n\n12:42.040 --> 12:43.040\nYeah.\n\n12:43.040 --> 12:45.040\nPretty untended too.\n\n12:45.040 --> 12:51.040\nAnd I think that Mr. Funk said that the first time in print is that\n\n12:51.040 --> 12:54.040\nJob's turkey was so poor, it only had one leg,\n\n12:54.040 --> 12:57.040\nno feathers, and had to lean against a fence to stand up.\n\n12:57.040 --> 12:59.040\nThat's a broke turkey.\n\n12:59.040 --> 13:03.040\nWhy is Mr. Funk explaining the actual, he's the idiom man.\n\n13:03.040 --> 13:05.040\nHe's the guy that writes the book that says,\n\n13:05.040 --> 13:08.040\nwhy do we say horse feathers? Why do we say heavens to Betsy?\n\n13:08.040 --> 13:09.040\nRight.\n\n13:09.040 --> 13:12.040\nSo he's just being colorful, imagining Job's turkey?\n\n13:12.040 --> 13:15.040\nNo, he's saying, here's the first evidence of this in print,\n\n13:15.040 --> 13:18.040\nbeing porous Job's turkey, where he had no feathers,\n\n13:18.040 --> 13:20.040\none leg, and had to lean against a fence to stand up.\n\n13:20.040 --> 13:21.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n13:21.040 --> 13:22.040\nWho?\n\n13:22.040 --> 13:23.040\nJob's turkey.\n\n13:23.040 --> 13:26.040\nFunk is referring to the first printed use of the phrase,\n\n13:26.040 --> 13:27.040\nporous Job's turkey, right?\n\n13:27.040 --> 13:28.040\nYes, correct.\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:32.040\nSo that person who used the phrase was explaining Job's turkey?\n\n13:32.040 --> 13:33.040\nYes.\n\n13:33.040 --> 13:35.040\nHe was saying, yeah.\n\n13:35.040 --> 13:38.040\nHe was letting you know that this is the first time\n\n13:38.040 --> 13:39.040\nanyone's ever thought.\n\n13:39.040 --> 13:40.040\nI know what he's doing.\n\n13:40.040 --> 13:42.040\nWho the fuck is explaining what,\n\n13:42.040 --> 13:46.040\nI would have assumed that the person that coined it\n\n13:46.040 --> 13:48.040\nwas just coining it as an idiom.\n\n13:48.040 --> 13:49.040\nRight.\n\n13:49.040 --> 13:52.040\nNot going, not writing an essay about how ill taken care of.\n\n13:52.040 --> 13:54.040\nNow let me tell you about Job's boat.\n\n13:54.040 --> 13:56.040\nLet's say, let's say,\n\n13:56.040 --> 13:57.040\nThis thing was small.\n\n13:57.040 --> 14:00.040\nIf you were reading a newspaper in 1745,\n\n14:00.040 --> 14:04.040\nand somebody referred to somebody being porous Job's turkey.\n\n14:04.040 --> 14:05.040\nRight.\n\n14:05.040 --> 14:07.040\nYou would have just let that pass by and that you,\n\n14:07.040 --> 14:09.040\nokay, that sounds like a broke ass turkey.\n\n14:09.040 --> 14:11.040\nI feel like we're having two different conversations here.\n\n14:11.040 --> 14:12.040\nYeah.\n\n14:12.040 --> 14:16.040\nWho said, Job, who went into this lengthy description\n\n14:16.040 --> 14:18.040\nof the turkey though?\n\n14:18.040 --> 14:19.040\nA mystery person.\n\n14:19.040 --> 14:22.040\nI think Earl Funk says that the first guy that ever used it\n\n14:22.040 --> 14:24.040\nsaid porous Job's turkey, comma.\n\n14:24.040 --> 14:27.040\nSo when you, when you coin an idiom,\n\n14:27.040 --> 14:32.040\nyou have to actually show your math.\n\n14:32.040 --> 14:34.040\nYou have to, you have to be like,\n\n14:34.040 --> 14:35.040\nThis is this.\n\n14:35.040 --> 14:36.040\nThis is this.\n\n14:36.040 --> 14:40.040\nThis is colder than a witch's tit, comma, semi-colon.\n\n14:40.040 --> 14:41.040\nA very cold tit.\n\n14:41.040 --> 14:43.040\nA witch tit.\n\n14:43.040 --> 14:45.040\nThe flesh being furthest from the body\n\n14:45.040 --> 14:49.040\nof an already unaccommodating creature.\n\n14:49.040 --> 14:55.040\nEqually unused, unused as witches are famously\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:58.040\na non-maternal.\n\n14:58.040 --> 15:01.040\nYou just keep, and then if it catches,\n\n15:01.040 --> 15:03.040\nif your explanation is good,\n\n15:03.040 --> 15:06.040\nthe peer review in the New England Journal of Idioms goes like,\n\n15:06.040 --> 15:07.040\nEarl Funk comes in.\n\n15:07.040 --> 15:10.040\nAh, colder than a witch's tit.\n\n15:10.040 --> 15:11.040\nIt scans.\n\n15:11.040 --> 15:13.040\nI'll write it down.\n\n15:13.040 --> 15:16.040\nYou read Per Richard's Almanac.\n\n15:16.040 --> 15:18.040\nHe'll explain what I'm talking about.\n\n15:18.040 --> 15:22.040\nTrust me, witches' tits, freezing.\n\n15:22.040 --> 15:25.040\nI don't have to explain it.\n\n15:25.040 --> 15:26.040\nLook it up.\n\n15:26.040 --> 15:27.040\nIt's in the book.\n\n15:27.040 --> 15:30.040\nDo the medieval equivalent of Googling it.\n\n15:30.040 --> 15:33.040\nYou know cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey?\n\n15:33.040 --> 15:34.040\nOh yeah.\n\n15:34.040 --> 15:37.040\nFreeze the balls off a brass monkey?\n\n15:37.040 --> 15:38.040\nYeah.\n\n15:38.040 --> 15:39.040\nYeah.\n\n15:39.040 --> 15:40.040\nSpencer knows.\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:42.040\nOh, we all do.\n\n15:42.040 --> 15:47.040\nBut what, so you're saying that beyond that just being a clever way of saying it's cold,\n\n15:47.040 --> 15:49.040\nlike there's actually some logic to it?\n\n15:49.040 --> 15:50.040\nYeah.\n\n15:50.040 --> 15:51.040\nLike a brass monkey is typically hot?\n\n15:51.040 --> 15:52.040\nOh yeah.\n\n15:52.040 --> 15:53.040\nSuper hot.\n\n15:53.040 --> 15:55.040\nBecause they're more conductive?\n\n15:55.040 --> 16:00.040\nBecause they're way more, no, they're just not kept cold enough to be frozen, the balls\n\n16:00.040 --> 16:01.040\noff of.\n\n16:01.040 --> 16:02.040\nNo, it's brass.\n\n16:02.040 --> 16:03.040\nGo for it, Jeff.\n\n16:03.040 --> 16:08.040\nIt's on a sailing ship where there's cannonballs and there's a rack that you keep the cannonballs\n\n16:08.040 --> 16:09.040\nin.\n\n16:09.040 --> 16:10.040\nIn a pyramid.\n\n16:10.040 --> 16:15.040\nAnd if it's cold enough, the balls, the cannonballs in the rack in a pyramid fashion\n\n16:15.040 --> 16:20.040\nwill expand and crack and fly all over the deck.\n\n16:20.040 --> 16:24.040\nSo it's so cold, it froze the balls off the brass monkey and for some reason.\n\n16:24.040 --> 16:25.040\nWhere's the monkey?\n\n16:25.040 --> 16:27.040\nThat's what it's the pyramid of balls.\n\n16:27.040 --> 16:29.040\nThe monkey is the rack of where they keep the cannonballs.\n\n16:29.040 --> 16:30.040\nOh, I didn't know that.\n\n16:30.040 --> 16:31.040\nI didn't know that was cold.\n\n16:31.040 --> 16:32.040\nNo, I didn't.\n\n16:32.040 --> 16:33.040\nBut also, there is some debate about this.\n\n16:33.040 --> 16:35.040\nWe don't know if that's actually why we say that.\n\n16:35.040 --> 16:37.040\nRight, because all linguist history is just made up.\n\n16:37.040 --> 16:38.040\nYeah.\n\n16:38.040 --> 16:39.040\nIt's weird.\n\n16:39.040 --> 16:40.040\nI always assume, well what time is it?\n\n16:40.040 --> 16:42.040\nHalf past the monkey's ass quarter to his balls.\n\n16:42.040 --> 16:47.040\nLike I always just assume that a lot of our language is just made up by kids who are like\n\n16:47.040 --> 16:49.040\nfinding out how to say stuff.\n\n16:49.040 --> 16:54.040\nThey're kind of like, there was a guy in MSNBC that was a linguist that was talking about\n\n16:54.040 --> 17:00.040\nDonald Trump's use of language and he was like, yeah, it's a surprisingly juvenile\n\n17:00.040 --> 17:06.040\nuse of language for a senior citizen and that's sort of like part of his appeal to people\n\n17:06.040 --> 17:11.040\nbecause it's like he talks the way, not only the way that we start talking when we're learning\n\n17:11.040 --> 17:18.040\nto talk, but he also talks the way our species talked when it was learning to talk.\n\n17:18.040 --> 17:24.040\nAnd before it learned to speak, speaking and talking being two different things, but him\n\n17:24.040 --> 17:29.040\nbeing like a pioneer politician who's just like, kind of like, Duncan Trussell said something\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:32.040\nterrifying at one point about Trump, which is like, I think he's just the first of a\n\n17:32.040 --> 17:39.040\nnew breed of like politicians who are going to be like your local town's carpet king,\n\n17:39.040 --> 17:40.040\nyou know?\n\n17:40.040 --> 17:44.040\nLike you're not going to, the question is he doing a bit or not?\n\n17:44.040 --> 17:45.040\nIt's never going to matter anymore.\n\n17:45.040 --> 17:48.040\nIt's going to be like part of the job, part of the electability.\n\n17:48.040 --> 17:52.040\nYou won't be able to be elected by, you know, by having poise.\n\n17:52.040 --> 18:01.040\nThat would be a silly person's gambit when you can just stick out and then only a wise\n\n18:01.040 --> 18:06.040\nperson would make an ass of themselves while running for president and et cetera, et cetera.\n\n18:06.040 --> 18:11.040\nIt's sort of like, if you can forecast the way, I think that's a very optimistic prediction\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:16.040\nbecause it sort of says that our country is going to be around long enough that like we're\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:20.040\ngoing to keep having regular elections every four years of this.\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:22.040\nWe're Venezuela now.\n\n18:22.040 --> 18:23.040\nBut we're not Poland.\n\n18:23.040 --> 18:27.040\nI don't want to bring people down, but I got to share the things that bring me down.\n\n18:27.040 --> 18:28.040\nIt's just such a fucking bummer.\n\n18:28.040 --> 18:34.040\nThis mayor in Poland is like doing a charity event and that dude jumped up on stage and\n\n18:34.040 --> 18:36.040\nstabbed him to death on the stage.\n\n18:36.040 --> 18:40.040\nAnd why am I bringing this up?\n\n18:40.040 --> 18:45.040\nIt's a comedy show.\n\n18:45.040 --> 18:48.040\nThere, but for the grace of God?\n\n18:48.040 --> 18:49.040\nI don't know.\n\n18:49.040 --> 18:52.040\nWe saw there were swastikas burning in the street in Poland like a year ago.\n\n18:52.040 --> 18:57.040\nLook, we're in a worldwide right slide.\n\n18:57.040 --> 19:01.040\nAmerica no longer has all three branches of government on the right.\n\n19:01.040 --> 19:02.040\nHow long it will last?\n\n19:02.040 --> 19:03.040\nI don't know.\n\n19:03.040 --> 19:09.040\nBut all of this rhetoric, all of this shit, I believe truly that whereas traditionally\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:14.040\nhere to four, fascism's potting soil has been multicultural shifts and economic like\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:15.040\nroller coasters.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:22.040\nThat's when people get their cravings for authoritarianism start to get tempted.\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:30.040\nAnd I think that plus Facebook is going to destroy the planet because we were really\n\n19:30.040 --> 19:33.040\nnot in economic bad shape.\n\n19:33.040 --> 19:40.040\nBut the arrival of the internet or rather the arrival of dumb people to the internet,\n\n19:40.040 --> 19:44.040\nthey kind of like they'd never seen the world before.\n\n19:44.040 --> 19:51.040\nAnd the first thing they see is, oh my God, there's so much more brown skin or so much\n\n19:51.040 --> 19:57.040\nmore like opedy vagina or so much more than they were used to because their world is going\n\n19:57.040 --> 19:58.040\nfrom everything they can see.\n\n19:58.040 --> 20:03.040\nAnd trust me, as a guy who's left Twitter, I've become much more provincial and simplified.\n\n20:03.040 --> 20:05.040\nIt really happens pretty quickly.\n\n20:05.040 --> 20:11.040\nI don't know nothing about nothing and I'm really happy about it.\n\n20:11.040 --> 20:16.040\nSo assuming it works in reverse as well is when our parents got on the internet, my\n\n20:16.040 --> 20:24.040\nparents, Trump's generation, love you mom, love you dad, but Jesus Christ, the baby boomer\n\n20:24.040 --> 20:30.040\nplus the internet, they reacted to it as if it was our fault that they were racist.\n\n20:30.040 --> 20:35.040\nThey were kind of like, where are all these black people doing on my phone?\n\n20:35.040 --> 20:37.040\nAnd I think that happened all over the world.\n\n20:37.040 --> 20:40.040\nI can't call the police on my phone.\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:48.040\nIn high school history class, you can trace the global rises of militarism, nationalism,\n\n20:48.040 --> 20:53.040\nisolationism, economic depression and things that lead to both of the great world wars.\n\n20:53.040 --> 20:59.040\nWe didn't have that and yet we're repeating that blueprint without the parts that actually\n\n20:59.040 --> 21:02.040\ncaused it.\n\n21:02.040 --> 21:10.040\nIt's like we invented a weird invisible plexiglass ramp to antisemitism and scapegoating immigrants\n\n21:10.040 --> 21:14.040\nand all these things that traditionally happen because your country has gotten to a point\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:18.040\nwhere it's using your currency as a doorstop or toilet paper and is using like bottle caps\n\n21:18.040 --> 21:19.040\nfor money.\n\n21:19.040 --> 21:23.040\nAnd we never got there.\n\n21:23.040 --> 21:29.040\nThere was a housing crisis and a global economic crisis and all this stuff, but we didn't.\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:32.040\nWe had YouTube autoplay.\n\n21:32.040 --> 21:33.040\nIt really is.\n\n21:33.040 --> 21:35.040\nIt's the internet's fault, God darn it.\n\n21:35.040 --> 21:36.040\nThat's my point.\n\n21:36.040 --> 21:38.040\nNo, it's the algorithms they like.\n\n21:38.040 --> 21:44.040\nThey want clicks and Nazis click, unfortunately, and so it's like, yeah, you know what sells\n\n21:44.040 --> 21:46.040\nmaking people Nazis on accident.\n\n21:46.040 --> 21:53.040\nSo this Polish mayor, 53 years old, a mayor like myself, he was a liberal.\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:54.040\nHe was outspoken.\n\n21:54.040 --> 21:56.040\nHe loved his gay rights.\n\n21:56.040 --> 21:57.040\nHe was Polish.\n\n21:57.040 --> 21:58.040\nIt's not a great time to be liberal.\n\n21:58.040 --> 22:00.040\nI think Jeff's going to stab you, Dan.\n\n22:00.040 --> 22:01.040\nThat's not funny.\n\n22:01.040 --> 22:05.040\nThat really happened.\n\n22:05.040 --> 22:12.040\nHe was doing this charity event and a crazy guy that, of course, they're calling a lone\n\n22:12.040 --> 22:13.040\nwolf and he's crazy.\n\n22:13.040 --> 22:14.040\nHe's crazy.\n\n22:14.040 --> 22:15.040\nYes, I agree.\n\n22:15.040 --> 22:16.040\nWhat are you saying?\n\n22:16.040 --> 22:20.040\nI'm going to cut you.\n\n22:20.040 --> 22:22.040\nThis isn't the funny portion of the show.\n\n22:22.040 --> 22:25.040\nI'm doing my Springer's first thoughts.\n\n22:25.040 --> 22:32.040\nSpringer's opening arguments.\n\n22:32.040 --> 22:36.040\nI have no solutions and I have no appeal.\n\n22:36.040 --> 22:38.040\nI would die for my freedom of speech.\n\n22:38.040 --> 22:40.040\nI would die for other people's freedom of expression.\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:45.040\nI do not believe that laws need to be created to mitigate the way people speak.\n\n22:45.040 --> 22:49.040\nI believe that free speech, have we noticed, has consequences anyway.\n\n22:49.040 --> 22:54.040\nLet's talk about that weatherman that got fired for accidentally making the sound coon\n\n22:54.040 --> 22:56.040\nwhile he was saying Martin Luther King's name.\n\n22:56.040 --> 22:58.040\nLet's just talk about that in a second.\n\n22:58.040 --> 23:01.040\nWe love firing people.\n\n23:01.040 --> 23:05.040\nBut unless you're a Nazi.\n\n23:05.040 --> 23:13.040\nWe're in trouble if we continue to ostracize each other and divide each other based on\n\n23:13.040 --> 23:14.040\nlanguage.\n\n23:14.040 --> 23:21.040\nWe're basically handing the opposite of Kryptonite to the more nihilistic, more sociopathic of\n\n23:21.040 --> 23:24.040\ntwo sides of a political spectrum.\n\n23:24.040 --> 23:33.040\nThe party that this poor mayor was the most outspoken against in his right-leaning Poland,\n\n23:33.040 --> 23:37.040\nthey had issued death certificates for liberal politicians.\n\n23:37.040 --> 23:40.040\nHe was very outspoken about that in particular.\n\n23:40.040 --> 23:41.040\nCan you imagine the irony?\n\n23:41.040 --> 23:45.040\nCan you imagine this guy's final thoughts as he's being stabbed in the fucking heart\n\n23:45.040 --> 23:49.040\nin front of his constituency and all the cell phones are just out?\n\n23:49.040 --> 23:57.040\nThe pictures are so disturbing and confusing.\n\n23:57.040 --> 24:04.040\nThe guy was the most outspoken about the rhetoric and how violent it was getting and how disgusting.\n\n24:04.040 --> 24:11.040\nThese people who have nothing to lose and only the mentally ill to play with, they have\n\n24:11.040 --> 24:15.040\nnothing to lose and everything to gain from triggering a fucking psychopath.\n\n24:15.040 --> 24:18.040\nBy the way, one in 100 people is so out of their gourd.\n\n24:18.040 --> 24:19.040\nGod bless you.\n\n24:19.040 --> 24:23.040\nProbably a disproportionate number of them in my listenership.\n\n24:23.040 --> 24:27.040\nWe love you. Welcome. If you're psychotic, you're not automatically a murderer.\n\n24:27.040 --> 24:34.040\nBut one in 100 people is vulnerable to fucking messaging.\n\n24:34.040 --> 24:42.040\nWe just got this weird ability to all talk to each other all the time about whatever we want.\n\n24:42.040 --> 24:48.040\nThe politicians have arrived in that arena and the thugs among them are going like,\n\n24:48.040 --> 24:55.040\nyes, someone should kill that bitch. Well, if that bitch then gets killed, we're going to keep having this conversation.\n\n24:55.040 --> 24:57.040\nThis isn't clearly about gun control.\n\n24:57.040 --> 25:00.040\nThe guy crawled up on a stage with a knife.\n\n25:00.040 --> 25:04.040\nThe government was trying to say it wasn't political.\n\n25:04.040 --> 25:05.040\nWe didn't understand his motivation.\n\n25:05.040 --> 25:12.040\nHe literally waved the knife around and said, I did this because this guy's political party locked me up.\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:18.040\nHe was a mentally ill guy who had his mentally ill life that was in and out of prison and stuff.\n\n25:18.040 --> 25:28.040\nHe decided to blame this political party that was also being told to die by the opposition who were issuing\n\n25:28.040 --> 25:32.040\nhilarious death certificates for liberal politicians.\n\n25:32.040 --> 25:37.040\nOur now deceased mayor of this Polish town was among the few who was going,\n\n25:37.040 --> 25:45.040\nguys, he went to his government and said, you should look at this as incitement of violence in a very dangerous time.\n\n25:45.040 --> 25:49.040\nAnd the government said to him, no, it's freedom of expression.\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:54.040\nIt's a way of saying you disagree with someone politically to say they should die.\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:56.040\nAnd then he died.\n\n25:56.040 --> 25:58.040\nHe was stabbed in front of everyone.\n\n25:58.040 --> 26:02.040\nSo I am never going to let anybody tell me what to say.\n\n26:02.040 --> 26:07.040\nBut what the fuck, man, we get fired for saying the wrong shit.\n\n26:07.040 --> 26:12.040\nAnd we're extending that to everyone but politicians.\n\n26:12.040 --> 26:16.040\nThe only thing I wanted to say about that weatherman guy, by the way, I'm sure you've read that story.\n\n26:16.040 --> 26:18.040\nIf I've read it, you've read it.\n\n26:18.040 --> 26:20.040\nBut there was this weatherman.\n\n26:20.040 --> 26:21.040\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n26:21.040 --> 26:23.040\nHe was speeding through.\n\n26:23.040 --> 26:25.040\nI actually didn't watch the clip.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:28.040\nI'm inclined to take his word for it because I don't believe.\n\n26:28.040 --> 26:30.040\nBecause you talk on microphones.\n\n26:30.040 --> 26:38.040\nYeah, I mean, I just don't believe that the way you find out someone's racist is like a sound coming out of their mouth.\n\n26:38.040 --> 26:39.040\nI really don't.\n\n26:39.040 --> 26:43.040\nI mean, that's different from saying like a speech on the corner where you reveal like,\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:48.040\nI think that if your skin is this color, you're a worse person than this person.\n\n26:48.040 --> 26:50.040\nI just don't.\n\n26:50.040 --> 26:52.040\nI think it's a dangerous way of thinking.\n\n26:52.040 --> 26:57.040\nBut also, it's not like somebody led that pack.\n\n26:57.040 --> 27:00.040\nIt's sort of like, this is what we make people vulnerable to.\n\n27:00.040 --> 27:02.040\nI put the blame on corporations.\n\n27:02.040 --> 27:10.040\nMedia corporations need to stop firing people within eight hours of Twitter trending them.\n\n27:10.040 --> 27:11.040\nIt has to stop.\n\n27:11.040 --> 27:12.040\nRight.\n\n27:12.040 --> 27:13.040\nThat's what Gamergate did.\n\n27:13.040 --> 27:16.040\nI'm sure it's regrettable within 16 hours.\n\n27:16.040 --> 27:18.040\nI almost got fired.\n\n27:18.040 --> 27:21.040\nI mean, if I had gotten fired, Rick and Morty would have been over.\n\n27:21.040 --> 27:28.040\nIt was like, we went from, yay, 70 episodes to like, I had to spend three months wondering whether there was ever going to be a show again.\n\n27:28.040 --> 27:42.040\nBecause in 2009, I humped a doll in a video that somebody called a number at Turner because they associated it with a blog entry they saw about someone else anonymously.\n\n27:42.040 --> 27:49.040\nAnd I was being investigated for fucking child sex trafficking because AT&T didn't want to take any chances.\n\n27:49.040 --> 27:57.040\nLike, we have to, I'm not personalizing this, or if I did, it would sound a lot like that.\n\n27:57.040 --> 28:03.040\nBut I'm saying, I'm having this experience and I'm not accidentally saying anything.\n\n28:03.040 --> 28:06.040\nI accidentally humped a doll in 2009.\n\n28:06.040 --> 28:08.040\nProbably not a great idea.\n\n28:08.040 --> 28:10.040\nIt doesn't seem too funny these days.\n\n28:10.040 --> 28:21.040\nBut like, the parallel universe that almost got created because I did that 10 years ago is pretty extreme stuff.\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:33.040\nAnd it's not the Nazis that have a right within our country to operate within the dark bowels for no money and try to make people mad and racist at each other.\n\n28:33.040 --> 28:39.040\nThey're pretty underfunded and pretty hard to, they don't show up to a lot of meetings after a while.\n\n28:39.040 --> 28:43.040\nLike, it left to their own devices, they are not the threat.\n\n28:43.040 --> 28:55.040\nI believe that when their antagonism meets, it has its handshaken by timid, cowardly, weird, reactive, scary insurance companies and corporations.\n\n28:55.040 --> 28:57.040\nThat's when we're in trouble.\n\n28:57.040 --> 29:07.040\nSomebody's got to realize that this new world means a new policy is necessary and that all of us, like, Andy Warhol's wrong now.\n\n29:07.040 --> 29:15.040\nLike, we're all not going to be famous for 15 minutes, we're all in constant rotation, going to get fucking crop dusted with viral parasites.\n\n29:15.040 --> 29:23.040\nLike, we're all going to, every once in a while, find ourselves in the midst of a crazy and tropic, weird social phenomenon.\n\n29:23.040 --> 29:29.040\nAnd corporations owe it to us to not base whether they, we show up to work the following morning on that.\n\n29:29.040 --> 29:41.040\nWell, the only thing I want to say about that is, now, assuming that, assuming that, forget it for a second, whether or not that guy is more or less racist than any weatherman.\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:44.040\nI was on a challenge. Say it again.\n\n29:44.040 --> 29:49.040\nOkay, sorry, sorry. The guy was saying something, I don't know, he's doing his weather report and he must have been, he was trying to say Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n29:49.040 --> 29:52.040\nOr is there was an event that was going to be at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park?\n\n29:52.040 --> 29:55.040\nAnd I think he said something like, Martin Luther Coon, King, Jr. or something like that.\n\n29:55.040 --> 30:03.040\nHe stumbled and it sounded like the word Coon in the midst of civil rights leader that was, yeah, it's really not ideal.\n\n30:03.040 --> 30:12.040\nAnd they didn't catch it or do anything about it at the time and it went viral and then he got fired.\n\n30:12.040 --> 30:23.040\nAnd last couple days, I've been seeing within the news cycle, he's that lower left kind of story where he continued, oh, Al Roker says he believes this guy or whatever.\n\n30:23.040 --> 30:31.040\nIt's as ridiculous as it should be, the situation when we're talking about something so silly and the only thing that I wanted to say about it,\n\n30:31.040 --> 30:38.040\nbecause I'm sure everyone's capable of having their own conversation about it and I'm not going to add anything to it, except this.\n\n30:38.040 --> 30:47.040\nAssuming he is no more or less racist than any other weatherman, assuming that you can tell whether he is or isn't by sound eruptions that come out of his mouth.\n\n30:47.040 --> 30:53.040\nI only asked this question, this is not a political or philosophical stance I'm taking.\n\n30:53.040 --> 31:02.040\nI just thought of this and it was like, you know, I think I might be right about this, I want to check.\n\n31:02.040 --> 31:09.040\nIsn't weatherman the only job you could do capably while racist?\n\n31:09.040 --> 31:20.040\nLike, if you gave me the ability to eliminate racism from any field and it had like 10 charges in it, I would get to food service way before,\n\n31:20.040 --> 31:26.040\nI tried running on my list, I was like, carpentry, no, no, I don't want a racist making my chairs.\n\n31:26.040 --> 31:32.040\nI just feel like it's probably like the one thing you could do without hurting anybody and be totally racist.\n\n31:32.040 --> 31:40.040\nHey, who is that guy with the swastika on his face in the cafeteria? He's not touching my food, is he? No, he's the weatherman, okay.\n\n31:40.040 --> 31:51.040\nHe can't control the weather, can he? No, no, that would be, then make sure let's police that field for racism if you can make it rain on certain neighborhoods.\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:54.040\nYou're saying, we're finding out that you're soft on racist weathermen.\n\n31:54.040 --> 32:09.040\nI am either incredibly disrespectful towards meteorology, or I am biased about the idea that the first people that are getting fired\n\n32:09.040 --> 32:26.040\nhappen to be the people who have to talk into microphones every day for, it's like, okay, come on. It would be kind of fun if Channel 5 and KTLA in Los Angeles had just racist weathermen.\n\n32:26.040 --> 32:30.040\nHe gave you the weather and he was really good at it.\n\n32:30.040 --> 32:33.040\nThis is an experiment, just to see if it hurts anybody.\n\n32:33.040 --> 32:36.040\nHe also just slipped in some just full-on racism during it.\n\n32:36.040 --> 32:46.040\nYeah, I don't know. You could try different things each week. Here's our misogynist weatherman, like, oh, there's a cold front coming in, not as cold as women can be toward me.\n\n32:46.040 --> 32:59.040\nI deserve sex, but lower socal deserves this cold front coming in, and we'll be back with sports with our Scientologists. Let's see what hurts.\n\n32:59.040 --> 33:02.040\nJust for fun, and this is a comedy, but do racist weathermen.\n\n33:02.040 --> 33:09.040\nI just did enough frenemy.\n\n33:09.040 --> 33:16.040\nDo a weatherman who hates Turks.\n\n33:16.040 --> 33:18.040\nWhy? To what end?\n\n33:18.040 --> 33:23.040\nFor comedy, and for memes, and for you to get fired.\n\n33:23.040 --> 33:34.040\nMy quote-unquote joke was, isn't weatherman the one occupation that you could do while being racist? I did not get the laugh I expected.\n\n33:34.040 --> 33:37.040\nI was just working out new material.\n\n33:37.040 --> 33:44.040\nThe laugh I thought I might get would be like a creeping one where everyone thought about it like I had.\n\n33:44.040 --> 33:58.040\nActually, if you ranked every job in the entire planet, and you had to put your most racist person on your island community, if you had to put him in one place,\n\n33:58.040 --> 34:04.040\nWeatherman seems like the safest place, and that's if the guy's racist.\n\n34:04.040 --> 34:07.040\nBut is he a great weatherman?\n\n34:07.040 --> 34:09.040\nOh, he's the best.\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:11.040\nOh, thank God.\n\n34:11.040 --> 34:18.040\nEven watch the clip. I'm sure he's just a guy that, I mean, well, now we know he's a guy whose life is probably ruined.\n\n34:18.040 --> 34:24.040\nI'm sure there's a lot of people listening for very good reasons who are going boo-hoo, smallest violin playing for that guy when blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n34:24.040 --> 34:32.040\nSo I'm not like, oh my God, the world's going to go to hell because you fired a fucking white weatherman.\n\n34:32.040 --> 34:45.040\nI don't want to bat for that team, but I am once again, as I will continue to do, I am saying as a fellow leftist barbarian,\n\n34:45.040 --> 34:56.040\nman, we got to get our tribes together because the only people that don't follow this fucking weirdly stringent book of rules are the people that are the most hateful in their hearts,\n\n34:56.040 --> 35:07.040\nall hearts, the people who actually want to tear us asunder and trample us and remove us, they often know exactly which words not to say.\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:19.040\nCase not in point, our president, but it's like look at the passes you get if you bat for the other team and like can we just, boy, why?\n\n35:19.040 --> 35:27.040\nThat's why I'm saying corporations help us out because people can't, if I retweet somebody saying something embarrassing on the news,\n\n35:27.040 --> 35:32.040\nwe can't legislate that, it's not my fault that that person gets fired.\n\n35:32.040 --> 35:39.040\nEven if I see it out of context and I'm like hashtag fire that fucker, I should be able to do that.\n\n35:39.040 --> 35:50.040\nIf you can buy a gun in our society and not be a part of the problem, then you should be able to lose yourself in a crazy viral uproar and adamantly say,\n\n35:50.040 --> 35:59.040\nfuck this racist fucker, he should be stripped of all of his rights and paraded into the ocean on Twitter as a private citizen,\n\n35:59.040 --> 36:08.040\nand then six hours later be like, Jesus Christ, he's a human being, what the fuck, I was drunk, and not find out that you were part of getting him fired.\n\n36:08.040 --> 36:20.040\nAnd the only way to change that is if the actual fire, firing people, the dragons with the fucking fire breath, they've got to change.\n\n36:20.040 --> 36:23.040\nAnd I don't know, so I don't know, I don't want to do.\n\n36:23.040 --> 36:29.040\nOkay, our next segment is called, nope, just racist weatherman.\n\n36:29.040 --> 36:32.040\nOkay, a few more thoughts about that.\n\n36:32.040 --> 36:35.040\nRacist weatherman.\n\n36:35.040 --> 36:38.040\nSo God bless you Polish mayor.\n\n36:38.040 --> 36:43.040\nAdd a demo which, okay, Pavel Pavel a demo which I think that was his name.\n\n36:43.040 --> 36:51.040\nI think there was a British MP named Joe Cox or someone who also got murdered in a similar situation where someone one of her political opponents was like,\n\n36:51.040 --> 37:00.040\nah, yeah, someone should kill this person or she's she's so dangerous that someone should stop her or something and then someone like shot her with an improvised gun or something and she died.\n\n37:00.040 --> 37:04.040\nIt's no good bullies man.\n\n37:04.040 --> 37:05.040\nIt's like it's the thing.\n\n37:05.040 --> 37:08.040\nIt's like we got to we got to stand up against bullies.\n\n37:08.040 --> 37:17.040\nLike if the person that you're challenging, hurting, whatever, like just run it through the witness test of am I doing anything risky?\n\n37:17.040 --> 37:18.040\nAm I risking anything?\n\n37:18.040 --> 37:26.040\nAnd is this other person like so much more powerful than me that I can't hurt them by by doing this and like run it run it through that test.\n\n37:26.040 --> 37:39.040\nLike because we need to all be united against the people that punched down and that can actually hurt us because it could get bad so fast.\n\n37:39.040 --> 37:42.040\nLike these are our cousins abroad.\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:46.040\nThese are the societies that are going through the same shit for whatever creepy reason.\n\n37:46.040 --> 37:47.040\nI blame Facebook.\n\n37:47.040 --> 37:48.040\nEveryone's like, well, it is Facebook.\n\n37:48.040 --> 37:51.040\nThis is an issue and they're everyone's everyone's in these right slants.\n\n37:51.040 --> 38:07.040\nSo like God, please let us let us emerge as the weirdly ironic like sensible one in this thing and lead everyone to back to regular ass gridlocked bureaucracy where I was so comfortable.\n\n38:07.040 --> 38:09.040\nI just want to die in peace.\n\n38:09.040 --> 38:13.040\nI don't want to I don't want to die screaming in fear.\n\n38:13.040 --> 38:16.040\nI don't want to die by racist.\n\n38:16.040 --> 38:17.040\nYeah, man.\n\n38:17.040 --> 38:19.040\nActually, that's better than colon cancer though, right?\n\n38:19.040 --> 38:28.040\nI just it maybe if I could if you could pick your age you could go like, well, when was I going to die of colon cancer?\n\n38:28.040 --> 38:31.040\n67 you get a bad colon.\n\n38:31.040 --> 38:32.040\nOkay.\n\n38:32.040 --> 38:42.040\nCan you can you I'll pay you a million dollars to make me colon cancer free until 67 and I will agree to be killed by racist.\n\n38:42.040 --> 38:45.040\nWell, I mean, yeah, that sounds great.\n\n38:45.040 --> 38:52.040\nLike, yeah, especially if you could be in the you could be like, okay, so now I'm going to since I'm going to get killed by racist.\n\n38:52.040 --> 38:57.040\nI'm going to I'm going to speak my mind at this rally and like, okay, send them up.\n\n38:57.040 --> 39:03.040\nAnd then like you you you set a price that you're willing to pay and then other people can like try and outbid you for that death.\n\n39:03.040 --> 39:04.040\nRight.\n\n39:04.040 --> 39:06.040\nBecause your death won't go viral after a while.\n\n39:06.040 --> 39:07.040\nRight.\n\n39:07.040 --> 39:12.040\nIt'll be like the new colon cancer is being an upstanding person.\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:19.040\nIt'll enter an arms race of being like profound people with integrity.\n\n39:19.040 --> 39:22.040\nIrish elections.\n\n39:22.040 --> 39:25.040\nYeah.\n\n39:25.040 --> 39:28.040\nIrish elections.\n\n39:28.040 --> 39:36.040\nIt's a new segment about Irish elections.\n\n39:36.040 --> 39:42.040\nI feel bad for the people that listen to this show and Radio Lab because they're like all he does is repeat everything from Radio Lab.\n\n39:42.040 --> 39:44.040\nApparently the Irish.\n\n39:44.040 --> 39:46.040\nLet me know what you think about this system, Jeff.\n\n39:46.040 --> 39:47.040\nAll right.\n\n39:47.040 --> 39:48.040\nThe Irish have this ranked voting system.\n\n39:48.040 --> 39:50.040\nOh, yeah, we use that in Maine.\n\n39:50.040 --> 39:53.040\nYeah, we're starting to experiment with it in local communities.\n\n39:53.040 --> 40:00.040\nYeah, that will like a leftist like person or something one in America and a race because we use that the last midterm.\n\n40:00.040 --> 40:07.040\nYeah, of not one person, one vote, but you rank your top five choices in order from one to five.\n\n40:07.040 --> 40:09.040\nNow you're already going too complicated.\n\n40:09.040 --> 40:10.040\nIt'll never work.\n\n40:10.040 --> 40:11.040\nIt has to be simple.\n\n40:11.040 --> 40:12.040\nYou're allowed to just mark one person.\n\n40:12.040 --> 40:13.040\nNumber one.\n\n40:13.040 --> 40:14.040\nBurning Sanders.\n\n40:14.040 --> 40:16.040\nYou can do the same thing you've been doing.\n\n40:16.040 --> 40:20.040\nNumber two, Hillary Clinton.\n\n40:20.040 --> 40:25.040\nBut in this version, everyone goes one through five.\n\n40:25.040 --> 40:28.040\nSo they count the number ones first.\n\n40:28.040 --> 40:32.040\nAnd then they start eliminating from the bottom of the number ones.\n\n40:32.040 --> 40:33.040\nJoe Biden.\n\n40:33.040 --> 40:38.040\nSo everyone that had a number of everyone who everyone who voted for Bernie Sanders.\n\n40:38.040 --> 40:39.040\nWhat is the bit?\n\n40:39.040 --> 40:50.040\nNo, I'm trying to help explain every everyone who everyone who's number one candidate gets eliminated in the beginning of the counting process.\n\n40:50.040 --> 40:56.040\nTheir number two choice goes back into the pool and starts getting counted as if it's another ballot.\n\n40:56.040 --> 40:57.040\nRight.\n\n40:57.040 --> 41:03.040\nIf you voted, so there's no like nader complex thing there where people are blaming each other.\n\n41:03.040 --> 41:16.040\nAnd there's no disenfranchisement of voting because your conscience as a voter is being reflected as a kind of like more modern kind of hash array of tastes and choices.\n\n41:16.040 --> 41:22.040\nSo it's like a bell curve of like, oh, there was more twos and three choices than there were number one.\n\n41:22.040 --> 41:33.040\nIn the event of a huge division among people of splintering, then what's going to come to the rise to the top is everyone's second or third choice, which means that you can't.\n\n41:33.040 --> 41:38.040\nIt de-incentivizes the idea of shutting people out.\n\n41:38.040 --> 41:52.040\nAnd which which really is a, in my opinion, that's like a great cure for for the virus of fascism because it really you can't run on the ticket of, come on, everyone wants to say it.\n\n41:52.040 --> 41:57.040\nBut no one's saying it, even though 30% of us are the ones saying it, everyone else is so fucked right now.\n\n41:57.040 --> 42:06.040\nIf we all 30% of us are getting real fucking loud and scary will outnumber everyone else because they're so splintered and arguing with each other.\n\n42:06.040 --> 42:20.040\nThat would never happen because not only do candidates need to consider how how they're perceived by the people that won't vote for them, because you want that edge of being a people's second choice at least.\n\n42:20.040 --> 42:24.040\nIt's going to change the behavior of campaigns and candidates really fast.\n\n42:24.040 --> 42:31.040\nOnly an idiot would be so rhetorically exclusive that they would be making this huge gamble, an appropriate gamble.\n\n42:31.040 --> 42:46.040\nYou'd have to really believe in white nationalism, for instance, if you really like refused to bend a little bit about it rhetorically during your campaign, because you would be betting that if everyone made me their last fucking choice except for 30% of the people who made me their number one,\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:49.040\nI'll still win because you know what, no, there's no leadership here.\n\n42:49.040 --> 42:55.040\nThat's a good that's an appropriate proportionately a gamble for you to make as a candidate.\n\n42:55.040 --> 43:01.040\nAnd it just it just causes this like, it's like a nice little Nyquil on your election.\n\n43:01.040 --> 43:04.040\nSo Ireland does this already and Maine is also doing it.\n\n43:04.040 --> 43:09.040\nThey're doing it for, I think, Senate races or congressional races in Maine, but yeah, Ireland everywhere.\n\n43:09.040 --> 43:18.040\nThere was an election nerd on this radio lab who was saying like, you know, the way the Irish look at the American electoral system is they look at it like an IBM laptop from the 90s.\n\n43:18.040 --> 43:33.040\nLike, you guys got your democracy in the 1700s and it was like, it's it's this symbol of how everything was going to end up being and it's the most and it's the thing that everyone covets and and and it's so powerful and so amazing.\n\n43:33.040 --> 43:44.040\nBut from back then and has and is now in danger of becoming absolutely symbolic of clunkiness and oppression and disenfranchisement like not it's got viruses and bugs and worms because.\n\n43:44.040 --> 43:49.040\nOh, it was so perfect in some state of the art that it's not changing as fast with the Irish.\n\n43:49.040 --> 43:52.040\nThey got their democracy in the 1920s.\n\n43:52.040 --> 43:55.040\nSo they were like, I don't know.\n\n43:55.040 --> 44:00.040\nFuck like can't really fuck fuck this up.\n\n44:00.040 --> 44:02.040\nRight. Let's try some different shit.\n\n44:02.040 --> 44:04.040\nSorry, Irish friends.\n\n44:04.040 --> 44:05.040\nThat was a horrible accent.\n\n44:05.040 --> 44:08.040\nAlso, the sentiment was awful too.\n\n44:08.040 --> 44:16.040\nBut but no, but they're they're lean and mean and they didn't they didn't they they they're like, OK, let's how do we do this right.\n\n44:16.040 --> 44:21.040\nAnd they came up this kind of weird Channel 101 voting system where you like your your ballot is five choices.\n\n44:21.040 --> 44:26.040\nThe more I think about it, the more the more sense it actually makes the problem with our system, right?\n\n44:26.040 --> 44:32.040\nThe problem with our system is that it's counterintuitive because what you think you're doing is voting for the person you want.\n\n44:32.040 --> 44:37.040\nBut because of the election dynamics, you're actually just voting against the person that you don't want.\n\n44:37.040 --> 44:40.040\nSo you vote for Hillary Clinton because you don't want Donald Trump to win.\n\n44:40.040 --> 44:43.040\nBut a vote for Hillary Clinton doesn't make her win.\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:45.040\nIt actually just prevents Donald Trump from winning.\n\n44:45.040 --> 44:48.040\nSo you're you're only voting against your least preferred candidate.\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:54.040\nBut in ranked choice voted voting, you actually are voting for your favorite person and then your next favorite person.\n\n44:54.040 --> 44:58.040\nYou're never voting against someone or you can you put them as the last rank.\n\n44:58.040 --> 45:00.040\nSo you would put Donald Trump as like seven.\n\n45:00.040 --> 45:08.040\nIf there's a hundred people on an island and 30 of them want Elizabeth Warren and 30 of them want Hillary Clinton and 20 of them want Bernie Sanders,\n\n45:08.040 --> 45:10.040\nlike Donald Trump shouldn't win.\n\n45:10.040 --> 45:11.040\nRight.\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:15.040\nWe don't know who will win on the other side, but it's like it should be a no brainer.\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:17.040\nBut like this one person one vote thing.\n\n45:17.040 --> 45:19.040\nIt's counterintuitive disenfranchisement.\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:20.040\nIt creates nihilism.\n\n45:20.040 --> 45:22.040\nIt creates like this idea of like, why am I going to go to the polls?\n\n45:22.040 --> 45:24.040\nI'm not going to get counted anyway.\n\n45:24.040 --> 45:25.040\nHoly shit.\n\n45:25.040 --> 45:28.040\nEverybody gets counted in like a really weird way when you do this voting system.\n\n45:28.040 --> 45:33.040\nLike you're you're no matter how outside the fucking game you are.\n\n45:33.040 --> 45:39.040\nRepresentative Lee, like you you're you're you're you can watch this thing like a horse race and you're like, that's mine.\n\n45:39.040 --> 45:42.040\nThat's that's because I picked her for third.\n\n45:42.040 --> 45:44.040\nYou're you're you're invested the whole time.\n\n45:44.040 --> 45:46.040\nI think you feel represented.\n\n45:46.040 --> 45:48.040\nWe're never going to change anything.\n\n45:48.040 --> 45:52.040\nWe're going to go down fucking maybe not in flames.\n\n45:52.040 --> 45:57.040\nMaybe we'll go down like singing a song or something.\n\n45:57.040 --> 45:59.040\nI don't know.\n\n45:59.040 --> 46:00.040\nIt's weird.\n\n46:00.040 --> 46:03.040\nI said we're going to go down dot dot dot and you were like in flames.\n\n46:03.040 --> 46:06.040\nNo, I don't know.\n\n46:06.040 --> 46:10.040\nIt's like you're having trouble in flames.\n\n46:10.040 --> 46:12.040\nThat's it.\n\n46:12.040 --> 46:15.040\nHow are we going to go down?\n\n46:15.040 --> 46:23.040\nI did like I've talked too many politics, but I did as an exercise today.\n\n46:23.040 --> 46:27.040\nI was a weird.\n\n46:27.040 --> 46:31.040\nI can't I can't zoom in on these things.\n\n46:31.040 --> 46:38.040\nWhat are you trying to zoom in on a screen grabs that I took because I was like my experiment today was I was like.\n\n46:38.040 --> 46:40.040\nI'm feeling so satisfied right now.\n\n46:40.040 --> 46:43.040\nI'm like not as phobic Poland not withstanding the world.\n\n46:43.040 --> 46:47.040\nI'm still scared about the world, but I'm I'm feeling comfortable right now.\n\n46:47.040 --> 46:52.040\nI'm reading the news on the toilet because I like it when Trump's in a bad mood.\n\n46:52.040 --> 46:55.040\nIt's funny and like it makes me feel comfortable.\n\n46:55.040 --> 47:01.040\nI like an embattled like like government who's like, you know, where everything's in gridlock and stuff.\n\n47:01.040 --> 47:03.040\nAnd like it makes me feel comfortable.\n\n47:03.040 --> 47:09.040\nIt makes me feel like maybe I'll live to see my 60s and like when things are like impossible to happen.\n\n47:09.040 --> 47:14.040\nAnd the worst among us are so frustrated by that that our true colors come out and actually people judge them for it.\n\n47:14.040 --> 47:17.040\nSo I'm in a good mood lately about politics domestically.\n\n47:17.040 --> 47:23.040\nBut it also then made me go, why are you such an elitist snob?\n\n47:23.040 --> 47:26.040\nLike, like, what do you like?\n\n47:26.040 --> 47:31.040\nLike, like now that you feel comfortable, why don't you think about other people?\n\n47:31.040 --> 47:36.040\nIt was like, like we're learning a lot about narcissism and stuff from like studying the president.\n\n47:36.040 --> 47:41.040\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of myself in him and like trying to use it as like teachable moments.\n\n47:41.040 --> 47:48.040\nAnd I'm like, you know, that's that's a lot like me, the way he's reacting to that or or I'm better than that because of this.\n\n47:48.040 --> 47:51.040\nAnd like, maybe I can be even better than that by not judging it.\n\n47:51.040 --> 48:00.040\nAnd I was like, I became determined today to find like inspiring Donald Trump quotes.\n\n48:00.040 --> 48:02.040\nThat's that's thirsty work.\n\n48:02.040 --> 48:12.040\nI was like, I was like, I was like, now that there's not this like kind of rabid fear, this echo chamber, you kind of like, he's the worst and I refuse to accept that he's not the worst.\n\n48:12.040 --> 48:20.040\nLike, it was just enough that I was like, what if I recreationally, what if I was like, I stepped into the shoes of a fan and I want to find him saying some cool stuff.\n\n48:20.040 --> 48:25.040\nWhat if my only modifier was the word very, but I can't I can't.\n\n48:25.040 --> 48:27.040\nI didn't I didn't anticipate this.\n\n48:27.040 --> 48:28.040\nOh, okay, double click it.\n\n48:28.040 --> 48:31.040\nIt was a very funny joke by a very funny guy.\n\n48:31.040 --> 48:34.040\nI'm the very funniest.\n\n48:34.040 --> 48:40.040\nSo I literally googled like, Trump smart quotes.\n\n48:40.040 --> 48:41.040\nOkay.\n\n48:41.040 --> 48:42.040\nNo, good.\n\n48:42.040 --> 48:46.040\nNo, I'm in.\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:48.040\nIf the word varies in there, I get $100.\n\n48:48.040 --> 48:49.040\nIt was funny.\n\n48:49.040 --> 48:53.040\nThe first thing that came up was that like, like there's a couple of funny things happen is here's a quote.\n\n48:53.040 --> 48:56.040\nIt is a real honor and privilege to endorse Mitt Romney.\n\n48:56.040 --> 48:57.040\nMitt is tough.\n\n48:57.040 --> 48:58.040\nHe's smart.\n\n48:58.040 --> 48:59.040\nHe's sharp.\n\n48:59.040 --> 49:02.040\nHe allows bad things to continue to happen to this country we all love.\n\n49:02.040 --> 49:04.040\nThat's the first that's the first one at the top of the thing.\n\n49:04.040 --> 49:05.040\nI'm like, that's not really very smart.\n\n49:05.040 --> 49:07.040\nHe loves himself some Mitt Romney.\n\n49:07.040 --> 49:15.040\nAnd then the second quote was, but I have to say probably when I'm about 30, I'll be pretty not settled, but happy with what I've accomplished so far.\n\n49:15.040 --> 49:17.040\nI'm happy where I am now.\n\n49:17.040 --> 49:19.040\nThat's an Amy smart quote.\n\n49:19.040 --> 49:23.040\nSo I already that's how few smart quotes Donald Trump has.\n\n49:23.040 --> 49:31.040\nI Googled Trump smart quotes, got one quote from Trump about Mitt Romney that didn't involve dyslexia.\n\n49:31.040 --> 49:39.040\nAnd then the second thing down was someone named smart saying something.\n\n49:39.040 --> 49:41.040\nHe's good fun though.\n\n49:41.040 --> 49:46.040\nBut I did, I did find some stuff where I was like, you know, do you want to play a game?\n\n49:46.040 --> 49:48.040\nIt's like, I love games.\n\n49:48.040 --> 50:00.040\nI'm going to play a game called, did I did I save this quote, because I thought it was dumb, gross, or reminded me too much of myself.\n\n50:00.040 --> 50:02.040\nI think those are the three categories.\n\n50:02.040 --> 50:08.040\nTrump quotes.\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:12.040\nDumb, gross, or too close to home for me.\n\n50:12.040 --> 50:15.040\nSpencer and I, does the audience get to guess on these or?\n\n50:15.040 --> 50:18.040\nLet's not give the audience any power.\n\n50:18.040 --> 50:20.040\nYeah, I like this.\n\n50:20.040 --> 50:22.040\nPower not to the people.\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:27.040\nWe don't want to tell them, hey, so you either need to shout out dumb, gross, or this long sentence.\n\n50:27.040 --> 50:28.040\nThat's good.\n\n50:28.040 --> 50:30.040\nEven they're not going to like that.\n\n50:30.040 --> 50:31.040\nDumb, gross, or.\n\n50:31.040 --> 50:33.040\nDumb, gross, or too close to home.\n\n50:33.040 --> 50:34.040\nToo close to home.\n\n50:34.040 --> 50:39.040\nMeaning, meaning I saved it because I'm like, you know what, be honest, Harmon, this sounds like something you'd say.\n\n50:39.040 --> 50:40.040\nThat's why you don't like it.\n\n50:40.040 --> 50:42.040\nSo dumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n50:42.040 --> 50:44.040\nYeah, dumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n50:44.040 --> 50:47.040\nHere's our new segment, dumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n50:47.040 --> 50:50.040\nDumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n50:50.040 --> 50:52.040\nOkay, wait.\n\n50:52.040 --> 50:55.040\nCan you start it over?\n\n50:55.040 --> 51:01.040\nDumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n51:01.040 --> 51:05.040\nThat seemed like it was just in the middle of the, can you start it?\n\n51:05.040 --> 51:07.040\nThat's definitely the middle.\n\n51:07.040 --> 51:13.040\nYou don't want me to succeed because you get paid to make up songs on the road, so you're afraid.\n\n51:13.040 --> 51:16.040\nThey're going to hire Dan, they're going to scoop Jeff.\n\n51:16.040 --> 51:19.040\nYou're afraid Drew Carey is going to take me to Florida.\n\n51:19.040 --> 51:26.040\nDumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n51:26.040 --> 51:29.040\nThese are things our president said.\n\n51:29.040 --> 51:33.040\nAll right, that's enough.\n\n51:33.040 --> 51:39.040\nSo these are Donald Trump quotes, and we have to judge whether they're dumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n51:39.040 --> 51:40.040\nOkay, yeah.\n\n51:40.040 --> 51:42.040\nI don't make deals for the money.\n\n51:42.040 --> 51:45.040\nI've got enough, much more than I'll ever need.\n\n51:45.040 --> 51:47.040\nI do it to do it.\n\n51:47.040 --> 51:48.040\nHarmon.\n\n51:48.040 --> 51:49.040\nYeah, Harmon.\n\n51:49.040 --> 51:51.040\nNow, gross.\n\n51:51.040 --> 51:52.040\nDarn.\n\n51:52.040 --> 51:54.040\nBecause I do things for the money.\n\n51:54.040 --> 51:55.040\nYou get to vote too?\n\n51:55.040 --> 51:56.040\nWhat?\n\n51:56.040 --> 51:57.040\nYou get to vote as well?\n\n51:57.040 --> 51:58.040\nWell, yeah, I'm going to tell you why.\n\n51:58.040 --> 52:00.040\nI have the answer.\n\n52:00.040 --> 52:02.040\nYou don't get to decide.\n\n52:02.040 --> 52:03.040\nWell, what if we outvote you?\n\n52:03.040 --> 52:04.040\nIt's your opinion.\n\n52:04.040 --> 52:07.040\nYou can tell me your opinion, but it won't be my opinion.\n\n52:07.040 --> 52:08.040\nMajority rules.\n\n52:08.040 --> 52:10.040\nWhat if we all say that sounds like a Harmon?\n\n52:10.040 --> 52:13.040\nWell, then you guys are assholes.\n\n52:13.040 --> 52:17.040\nNo, you guys can make your own decision.\n\n52:17.040 --> 52:21.040\nBy applause, who votes dumb on that one?\n\n52:21.040 --> 52:22.040\nWho votes gross.\n\n52:22.040 --> 52:23.040\nThis just wants to hurt you.\n\n52:23.040 --> 52:25.040\nWho votes Harmon?\n\n52:25.040 --> 52:28.040\nOkay, so that's a Harmon quote.\n\n52:28.040 --> 52:31.040\nI don't think this is how the game works.\n\n52:31.040 --> 52:32.040\nIt is now.\n\n52:32.040 --> 52:33.040\nThat's fair.\n\n52:33.040 --> 52:38.040\nMoney was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score.\n\n52:38.040 --> 52:40.040\nReal excitement is playing the game.\n\n52:40.040 --> 52:41.040\nGross.\n\n52:41.040 --> 52:42.040\nGross.\n\n52:42.040 --> 52:47.040\nYeah, I also thought that was gross.\n\n52:47.040 --> 52:48.040\nHere's a quote.\n\n52:48.040 --> 52:52.040\nI make money because I have to pay for everything apart from my school fees.\n\n52:52.040 --> 52:55.040\nMy mother even makes me pay my own telephone bill.\n\n52:55.040 --> 52:56.040\nWhat?\n\n52:56.040 --> 52:59.040\nThat's an Ivana Trump quote.\n\n52:59.040 --> 53:02.040\nThat's an Ivana Trump quote.\n\n53:02.040 --> 53:03.040\nFrom when?\n\n53:03.040 --> 53:05.040\nThe past?\n\n53:05.040 --> 53:11.040\nAs long as you're going to be thinking anyway, think big.\n\n53:11.040 --> 53:12.040\nDumb.\n\n53:12.040 --> 53:13.040\nDumb.\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:14.040\nDumb.\n\n53:14.040 --> 53:15.040\nYeah.\n\n53:15.040 --> 53:17.040\nWithout passion, you don't have energy.\n\n53:17.040 --> 53:20.040\nWithout energy, you have nothing.\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:21.040\nDumb.\n\n53:21.040 --> 53:22.040\nDumb.\n\n53:22.040 --> 53:25.040\nA little more moderation would be good.\n\n53:25.040 --> 53:29.040\nOf course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation.\n\n53:29.040 --> 53:30.040\nHarmon.\n\n53:30.040 --> 53:31.040\nOh.\n\n53:31.040 --> 53:38.040\nAlso, the Harmon category can also be kind of like, you know, if he only said this stuff,\n\n53:38.040 --> 53:40.040\nhe might be my guy.\n\n53:40.040 --> 53:45.040\nBecause for better or for worse, I'd be like, because it would be minus the, well, I'm\n\n53:45.040 --> 53:48.040\nnot going to give you a key to solve the riddle.\n\n53:48.040 --> 53:54.040\nThis is one that I truly just don't understand.\n\n53:54.040 --> 54:00.040\nThis one I just screen grabbed because it was like, first of all, what the, the first\n\n54:00.040 --> 54:04.040\nthing the secretary types is the boss.\n\n54:04.040 --> 54:05.040\nHell yeah.\n\n54:05.040 --> 54:06.040\nThat's fucking badass.\n\n54:06.040 --> 54:08.040\nAnd I screen grabbed it because it's from this.\n\n54:08.040 --> 54:09.040\nThat's an alpha male.\n\n54:09.040 --> 54:14.040\nIt's from this website where you get quotes and they're like tag clouded.\n\n54:14.040 --> 54:21.040\nThe tags for this quote are boss, first, secretary, thing, types.\n\n54:21.040 --> 54:22.040\nFair.\n\n54:22.040 --> 54:23.040\nYeah.\n\n54:23.040 --> 54:25.040\nSometimes you're looking for a quote.\n\n54:25.040 --> 54:27.040\nThe first thing the secretary types is the boss.\n\n54:27.040 --> 54:28.040\nWhat does that mean?\n\n54:28.040 --> 54:31.040\nThe boss said, give me a taco bowl.\n\n54:31.040 --> 54:33.040\nLike the boss said.\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:37.040\nSo if I type you, I'm getting your taco bowl or what?\n\n54:37.040 --> 54:39.040\nThe secretary takes notes of what you're saying.\n\n54:39.040 --> 54:42.040\nLike by saying, like, oh, the boss is saying this.\n\n54:42.040 --> 54:44.040\nMaybe the boss, the boss, the boss, the boss, the boss.\n\n54:44.040 --> 54:45.040\nHe starts everything.\n\n54:45.040 --> 54:46.040\nOh, the boss, really?\n\n54:46.040 --> 54:48.040\nThe secretary is taking notes of the conversation.\n\n54:48.040 --> 54:50.040\nThe first thing the secretary takes is the boss.\n\n54:50.040 --> 54:51.040\nI don't know.\n\n54:51.040 --> 54:52.040\nI'm going to go harming with that.\n\n54:52.040 --> 54:53.040\nOh, oh, oh, wait.\n\n54:53.040 --> 54:54.040\nNo.\n\n54:54.040 --> 54:59.040\nMaybe what that means is the first thing the secretary types\n\n54:59.040 --> 55:03.040\nis the thing that decides the policy at the office or whatever.\n\n55:03.040 --> 55:07.040\nIt's the first thing that he dictates to he or she and says,\n\n55:07.040 --> 55:08.040\nthe boss wants this.\n\n55:08.040 --> 55:09.040\nThe boss says that.\n\n55:09.040 --> 55:12.040\nBut isn't there kind of like behind every great boss?\n\n55:12.040 --> 55:14.040\nIsn't that sort of like giving like, isn't that sort of like.\n\n55:14.040 --> 55:15.040\nThat's right.\n\n55:15.040 --> 55:17.040\nThe secretary's really running the show?\n\n55:17.040 --> 55:20.040\nOr am I, I don't know why you would say the first thing.\n\n55:20.040 --> 55:21.040\nI get that interpretation.\n\n55:21.040 --> 55:24.040\nIt almost seems like it's just like badly improvised porn dialogue.\n\n55:24.040 --> 55:25.040\nOh, for sure.\n\n55:25.040 --> 55:27.040\nLike, oh, she came in and she typed me, if you know what I mean.\n\n55:27.040 --> 55:28.040\nI don't know what you mean.\n\n55:28.040 --> 55:32.040\nThere's nothing even remotely phallic about typing.\n\n55:32.040 --> 55:35.040\nLike my dick's like a key.\n\n55:35.040 --> 55:38.040\nYeah, it's the kind of thing an idiot would say.\n\n55:38.040 --> 55:43.040\nI have an attention span that's as long as it has to be.\n\n55:43.040 --> 55:47.040\nI like that one.\n\n55:47.040 --> 55:51.040\nOne of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace.\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:54.040\nGood people don't go into government.\n\n55:54.040 --> 55:56.040\nDumb.\n\n55:56.040 --> 56:00.040\nDumb and gross, but also, I agree.\n\n56:00.040 --> 56:04.040\nI'm the earnest Hemingway of 140 characters.\n\n56:04.040 --> 56:05.040\nHarmon.\n\n56:05.040 --> 56:07.040\nHarmon.\n\n56:07.040 --> 56:08.040\nThat's a fucking.\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:09.040\nI also saved that one.\n\n56:09.040 --> 56:11.040\nIt's probably, this joke's in poor taste,\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:13.040\nbut the first thing I thought when I read that,\n\n56:13.040 --> 56:18.040\nI was like, well, let's hope that metaphor follows through.\n\n56:18.040 --> 56:25.040\nHey, oh.\n\n56:25.040 --> 56:26.040\nHere's one that's interesting.\n\n56:26.040 --> 56:28.040\nSome of these I just grabbed because I'm interesting,\n\n56:28.040 --> 56:29.040\nbecause I'm interesting.\n\n56:29.040 --> 56:30.040\nHarmon.\n\n56:30.040 --> 56:31.040\nHarmon.\n\n56:31.040 --> 56:32.040\nI'm like very, very interesting.\n\n56:32.040 --> 56:34.040\nI'm like the most interesting.\n\n56:34.040 --> 56:38.040\nNo, apparently he said at one point, who knows when,\n\n56:38.040 --> 56:43.040\nif I don't get along with Democrats, I'm sort of like out of business.\n\n56:43.040 --> 56:46.040\nWhere's that guy?\n\n56:46.040 --> 56:48.040\nThat sounds presidential.\n\n56:48.040 --> 56:50.040\nThat's neither dumb, gross, or Harmon.\n\n56:50.040 --> 56:51.040\nI know.\n\n56:51.040 --> 56:53.040\nThat sounds like a president, doesn't it?\n\n56:53.040 --> 56:56.040\nSounds like a grassroots, like working class, like actual.\n\n56:56.040 --> 56:57.040\nYes.\n\n56:57.040 --> 56:59.040\nIt sounds like Calvin Coolidge.\n\n56:59.040 --> 57:02.040\nLike Harry Truman, like desegregating the army.\n\n57:02.040 --> 57:03.040\nWhy?\n\n57:03.040 --> 57:04.040\nBecause he was so woke?\n\n57:04.040 --> 57:06.040\nNo, because it saves money.\n\n57:06.040 --> 57:08.040\nAll paths lead to Rome.\n\n57:08.040 --> 57:10.040\nLike that grassroots fucking Midwest capitalist,\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:14.040\nlike let's stop hating each other because we can make more money.\n\n57:14.040 --> 57:16.040\nNow you're making it gross.\n\n57:16.040 --> 57:18.040\nWell, gross away.\n\n57:18.040 --> 57:20.040\nI mean, that's part of Harmon and part of him.\n\n57:20.040 --> 57:24.040\nAnd it's like, I just spent today looking through these numbers.\n\n57:24.040 --> 57:29.040\nWhat about the him that might have existed if someone hadn't come to him\n\n57:29.040 --> 57:32.040\nand shown him Cambridge Analytica figures that said,\n\n57:32.040 --> 57:37.040\nyou know, if you wear a fucking figurative turquoise belt buckle out there\n\n57:37.040 --> 57:42.040\nand start getting a little like fucking like a race baby,\n\n57:42.040 --> 57:45.040\nlike that's going to take you up 10% in this district.\n\n57:45.040 --> 57:48.040\nLike, because obviously what we know about the guy is that he says,\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:50.040\nall he wants is to be liked.\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:55.040\nI mean, it wasn't, I don't even, I think he's as racist as everybody his age.\n\n57:55.040 --> 58:01.040\nAnd probably like, and that's really racist because racism doesn't age well.\n\n58:01.040 --> 58:04.040\nIt doesn't even, it's not even cool when it's freshly born.\n\n58:04.040 --> 58:10.040\nBut it's like, it really gets its ugliest right before you shake your cane into the tomb.\n\n58:10.040 --> 58:15.040\nAnd say la vie, that's why we don't tend to listen to old people's opinions\n\n58:15.040 --> 58:20.040\nabout whether or not you should marry somebody or what you should do at your wedding.\n\n58:20.040 --> 58:25.040\nAnd like, it's like, I think that the guy is just like, he was a Democrat\n\n58:25.040 --> 58:27.040\nand then he was an independent and then he was a Republican\n\n58:27.040 --> 58:31.040\nand he's just like, just want to win and like somebody was like, you know,\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:34.040\nyou should be racist and he's like, that's easy.\n\n58:34.040 --> 58:38.040\nJust trying to be on his side, that's as best I can do.\n\n58:38.040 --> 58:44.040\nWhat my father gave me more than anything else is great tutoring and a great brain, frankly.\n\n58:44.040 --> 58:49.040\nYou know, my father's brother was a top person at MIT, went to MIT,\n\n58:49.040 --> 58:55.040\ngraduated from MIT, was a teacher at MIT, a professor at MIT, a great engineer.\n\n58:55.040 --> 58:58.040\nI mean, you know, I have very good genes.\n\n58:58.040 --> 59:00.040\nThat was his father's brother.\n\n59:00.040 --> 59:02.040\nYeah.\n\n59:02.040 --> 59:04.040\nI'm going to go harm another one.\n\n59:04.040 --> 59:06.040\nNo, just dumb, dumb, absolutely dumb.\n\n59:06.040 --> 59:10.040\nLike, you just told me your uncle's smart and that you have good genes.\n\n59:10.040 --> 59:12.040\nLike, you go to MIT.\n\n59:12.040 --> 59:14.040\nHe went to MIT.\n\n59:14.040 --> 59:19.040\nTrump has the intellectual wattage of half a saltine cracker.\n\n59:19.040 --> 59:24.040\nThat's dumb with a big whipped cream of gross on top\n\n59:24.040 --> 59:29.040\nand underneath that he's revealing that he truly thinks that where you get into school is actually the\n\n59:29.040 --> 59:32.040\nit's the it's the ribbon that the pig gets at the state fair.\n\n59:32.040 --> 59:34.040\nIt's like it's a it's a it's a ribbon for genetics.\n\n59:34.040 --> 59:38.040\nReally actually dangerously gross without even knowing it.\n\n59:38.040 --> 59:42.040\nPeople people assume I'm a boiler ready to explode,\n\n59:42.040 --> 59:46.040\nbut I actually have very low blood pressure, which is shocking to people.\n\n59:46.040 --> 59:49.040\nWait, that's Stephen Tyler.\n\n59:49.040 --> 59:53.040\nWell, I was I picked Alex as I was actually that's so me.\n\n59:53.040 --> 59:56.040\nThat sounds like an aerospace lyric.\n\n59:56.040 --> 59:58.040\nThat seems like something I'd be like bragging about.\n\n59:58.040 --> 59:59.040\nEverybody thinks I throw tantrums.\n\n59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040\nYou haven't seen me throw tantrum.\n\n01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040\nYou know, the crazy thing is I'm fucking too low key.\n\n01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040\nI'm too low key.\n\n01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040\nRead that one.\n\n01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.040\nRead that one again for me because that's like a rock and roll lyric.\n\n01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040\nPeople assume I'm a boiler ready to explode,\n\n01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.040\nbut I actually have very low blood pressure, which is shocking to people.\n\n01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040\nEasy, easy.\n\n01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.040\nI mean, that's a that's a that's a version of me that I really don't like about myself.\n\n01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.040\nI kind of like my version of that is like,\n\n01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.040\nlike I don't I don't I'm more shocking to me because I actually\n\n01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.040\nit's it's like the worst AC DC song.\n\n01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.040\nI'm like a boiler.\n\n01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:40.040\nPeople assume I'm a boiler ready to explode, but I'm not.\n\n01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.040\nI don't eat enough salt.\n\n01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.040\nNo, but I kind of my pre therapy self like really prides himself on like,\n\n01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.040\nyou know, I'm very comfortable.\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:01:01.040\nLike I'm a very like, like I had to recognize through therapy that a thing that I was doing to people that I like,\n\n01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:08.040\nthen I was like, if I've perceived myself as being in a conflict with somebody or if I've perceived someone as a threat to me or something like,\n\n01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:14.040\nlike I kind of like had this pride in the fact that I, yeah, but I can withstand like,\n\n01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:26.040\nI can see the only way I characterize it is like an airlock like I'll step you over to where I know there's like noxious gases like coming out that are just like enough to make you turn green.\n\n01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040\nBut I've breathed them my whole life.\n\n01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.040\nLike I'm kind of like, what's wrong?\n\n01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.040\nYou look like you're uncomfortable.\n\n01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.040\nYou know, like I was really proud of that.\n\n01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.040\nLike, like for a while, I thought that made me Wolverine.\n\n01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.040\nAnd I don't like that guy anymore.\n\n01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.040\nAnd that's that's that I think that's really what's behind that.\n\n01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.040\nHe's like, yeah, he got everybody thinks I'm like a big maniac.\n\n01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.040\nBut the truth is I'm fucking cool as a cucumber.\n\n01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040\nAnd that's my secret.\n\n01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040\nLike everybody else is like, let's get to him.\n\n01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.040\nIt's like, no, you're everyone is letting you get to them.\n\n01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.040\nYou're cool as a cucumber because you're always a baby that's throwing its own shit.\n\n01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.040\nLike you have, of course, you're not upset about it.\n\n01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:10.040\nLike you're already upset about your fucking pudding that you didn't get so many people are on television that don't know me and they're like experts on me.\n\n01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040\nThat's me is bitching about.\n\n01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040\nI wouldn't mind a little bow in Japan.\n\n01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040\nThey bow.\n\n01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040\nI love it.\n\n01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040\nOnly thing I love about Japan.\n\n01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040\nHarmon.\n\n01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040\nThat's so mean.\n\n01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.040\nLike I would and I would think like, man, I can't wait for the Japanese to hear that podcast because you don't like travel that much.\n\n01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040\nYou don't like Paris.\n\n01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040\nYou don't like Rome.\n\n01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.040\nYou don't like.\n\n01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.040\nYeah, and I would think like, you know, I got that like, like that Dan explaining thing.\n\n01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040\nI'm like, here's the thing about like the Japanese will love this observation.\n\n01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.040\nLike, I love the bowing.\n\n01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.040\nIt's the only thing I like, you know, and then I would, I would be like, why are they mad?\n\n01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.040\nJimmy Carter used to walk off the airplane carrying his own luggage.\n\n01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040\nDo you remember that?\n\n01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.040\nI don't want my president carrying.\n\n01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.040\nI want the freaking Marines to be carrying his luggage and they want to carry his luggage.\n\n01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.040\nHarmon.\n\n01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040\nNo.\n\n01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040\nDumb and gross, dumb and gross.\n\n01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.040\nThat's you, like when you travel and you fly now, you hate the airline.\n\n01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.040\nYou keep calling the Marines to carry your luggage.\n\n01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040\nI want to be treated like a human being.\n\n01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040\nThat's dumb and gross.\n\n01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040\nThat's what do you mean?\n\n01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.040\nYou like Jimmy Carter less because he carried his own luggage?\n\n01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040\nDumb and gross.\n\n01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040\nLike what do you mean?\n\n01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040\nThat's fucking awesome.\n\n01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.040\nIf John Wayne carried his own luggage and was president, you'd be sucking his dick.\n\n01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.040\nFuck you.\n\n01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.040\nLike this idea that Jimmy Carter is a pariah because he like, fuck it.\n\n01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:31.040\nIt's just like, like, wait, I'm now learning from you that he carried his own luggage.\n\n01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.040\nCan I go back and vote for him when I'm 10?\n\n01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040\nPoor fucking guy.\n\n01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040\nAll I knew about him was that he was a peanut farmer.\n\n01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040\nEveryone just decided like to just rail on this guy.\n\n01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.040\nI bet he was the best president ever.\n\n01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040\nExperience taught me a few things.\n\n01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.040\nOne is to listen to your gut no matter how good something sounds in paper.\n\n01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.040\nThe second is that you're generally better off sticking with what you know.\n\n01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.040\nAnd the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.\n\n01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040\nDumb.\n\n01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040\nYeah, dumb.\n\n01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.040\nLike what does that even mean?\n\n01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040\nAnd that's probably...\n\n01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040\nIt means nothing.\n\n01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.040\nHe talks in circles.\n\n01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.040\nIt means that he bankrupted the business.\n\n01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:15.040\nI think I was born with the drive for success because I have a certain gene.\n\n01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040\nDumb, gross, and harm.\n\n01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040\nNah, come on.\n\n01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040\nRacist.\n\n01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.040\nWhere do you put it?\n\n01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040\nYeah, no, so gross.\n\n01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.040\nThat's fucking like you're a Nazi.\n\n01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040\nLike what do you mean?\n\n01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040\nThat's a fundamental...\n\n01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.040\nNow, in his defense, the guy, yeah, he's talking nonstop.\n\n01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040\nSo who knows when he said that?\n\n01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.040\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040\nBut his dad is in the KKK.\n\n01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.040\nThe people that like him because he represents the idea that, oh, gone are the days when\n\n01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.040\npoise is what makes the difference.\n\n01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.040\nA certain demographic has come to connect the dots of poise and diplomacy with the dots\n\n01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:55.040\nof elitism and your boxed out of the system because you're a grody person.\n\n01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:02.040\nSo he's like a fire hose of garbage and people are like, oh, that means I don't have to be\n\n01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040\nashamed of myself.\n\n01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040\nShame's a hell of a fucking thing to overcome.\n\n01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.040\nLike, I bet it feels really good.\n\n01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.040\nMust be nice.\n\n01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.040\nWish I could be a fucking idiot that all of a sudden wakes up one day, reads a fucking\n\n01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.040\narticle, and decides they're proud of themselves.\n\n01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.040\nJesus Christ, where do I buy that fucking drug?\n\n01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:25.040\nYeah.\n\n01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.040\nI mean, it's $26 a bottle.\n\n01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.040\nBut my doctor is awful.\n\n01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.040\nThis is overprescribes regularly.\n\n01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.040\nSo is our friend here?\n\n01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040\nJesse, are you

differ.\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040\nOh, no.\n\n01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040\nDon't worry about it, Dan.\n\n01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040\nWhat's your shoe size?\n\n01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040\nCome on.\n\n01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040\nHit him with the shoe size.\n\n01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040\nI'm 11 and a half.\n\n01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.040\nHe's 11 and a half.\n\n01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040\n11 and a half.\n\n01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.040\nAnd my penis is 11 and a half.\n\n01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.040\nThat just means it's going to grow later in life.\n\n01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040\nLike the baby.\n\n01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.040\nDon't think that that way you have now is your final\n\n01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040\npenis size.\n\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040\nOh, no.\n\n01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.040\nEveryone knows that the penis just grows older.\n\n01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.040\nIf you go to a nursing home, there are a lot of long John\n\n01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.040\nSilvers in the place, you know, I think you're mistaken.\n\n01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040\nYeah.\n\n01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.040\nWell, your balls start to hang down to your ankles.\n\n01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040\nYes.\n\n01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040\nThat awaits all of us.\n\n01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.040\nYou need to buy a second pair of socks for the balls.\n\n01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.040\nBut yeah, I mean, you know, we're for, you know, your hands\n\n01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040\nif they're made.\n\n01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.040\nYou have bigger feet than Jesse, but he's bragging about\n\n01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.040\na giant penis.\n\n01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.040\nNo, I wasn't 10 and a half.\n\n01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.040\nI'm a moderately average, average penis.\n\n01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040\nThat's just average.\n\n01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.040\nIf you went by my shoe size.\n\n01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.040\nWhich is the way to go.\n\n01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.040\nDefinitely.\n\n01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.040\nI mean, Jeff, you everyone know is a my dick is shaped\n\n01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.040\nexactly like a candy cane ampersand or an ampersand.\n\n01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.040\nThat is one not in the vocab banks.\n\n01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.040\nSpencer's are shaped like one of those Dungeons and Dragons\n\n01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040\nampersands.\n\n01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.040\nIt's like a dragon.\n\n01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.040\nDragon head.\n\n01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.040\nI gotta, I gotta say this.\n\n01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.040\nAll the ladies after a night with Spencer say, damn, thank you\n\n01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040\nfor Spencer's gifts.\n\n01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040\nOh, damn.\n\n01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040\nAll of the ladies.\n\n01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.040\nThat was, yeah.\n\n01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040\nThere were multiple.\n\n01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040\nYeah.\n\n01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040\nAll right.\n\n01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040\nSo now that's not zero.\n\n01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.040\nLet's talk about your trousers now.\n\n01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040\nWhat do you got?\n\n01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040\nYou got some stretchy, stretchy tights going up.\n\n01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040\nOh, wow.\n\n01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.040\nWell, it is rainy season here in LA.\n\n01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.040\nAnd so, you don't need to delve under the car hood, but I\n\n01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.040\nhave three pairs of leggings, jaggings, if you will.\n\n01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.040\nAnd then the armor, these are a pair of Massimo supply\n\n01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040\ncompany.\n\n01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.040\nYo, but they're women's jeans.\n\n01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.040\nI will admit, but I'll tell you guys this.\n\n01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040\nI'm a very tall man.\n\n01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.040\nSo I always wear cowboy boots because then, you know, you can\n\n01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.040\nalways, it doesn't matter if your pants are too short, you\n\n01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.040\nknow, that's your secret.\n\n01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.040\nAnd like Stevie Nicks, I wear my boots all summer long.\n\n01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040\nNow, is there a fanny pack happening?\n\n01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.040\nWhat do you got?\n\n01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.040\nWhat do you got?\n\n01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.040\nNo fanny pack tonight.\n\n01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.040\nBy the way, guys, to be honest, the reason I was a little\n\n01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.040\nlate tonight is because I went to the Szechuan fax\n\n01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040\nmachine theater.\n\n01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040\nWhat?\n\n01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.040\nThis is the dynasty typewriter.\n\n01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040\nAcross town.\n\n01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.040\nThere's a Szechuan fax machine.\n\n01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040\nAll right.\n\n01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.040\nOkay.\n\n01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040\nCrickets.\n\n01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.040\nHe's trying, he's trying, trying stuff out.\n\n01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.040\nJust trying some stuff out.\n\n01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040\nYou're wearing four layers of pants.\n\n01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.040\nAnd then a pair of boxer briefs.\n\n01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040\nJust one T-shirt.\n\n01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040\nOne.\n\n01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.040\nWell, this is an interesting garment.\n\n01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.040\nThat's what I want to know about.\n\n01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.040\nThat's somewhere between bathrobe, dashiki and cape.\n\n01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040\nIt defies description.\n\n01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040\nYo, bathrobe, it is a bathrobe.\n\n01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.040\nBut dashiki, this was until I cut it down the middle.\n\n01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.040\nTo be honest with you, a lot of times what I do, if there's\n\n01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.040\na dress with a really cool fabric, I'll just, you know, cut it\n\n01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.040\ndown the middle because a dress is just really a trench coat\n\n01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.040\nwith a seam up it, you know?\n\n01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040\nYeah.\n\n01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.040\nI mean, that's the truth, you know?\n\n01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040\nLid blown.\n\n01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040\nLid blown.\n\n01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040\nOff of dresses and trench coats.\n\n01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040\nHappy to blow off that lid.\n\n01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040\nThat's one thing I am happy to blow.\n\n01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040\nAnd also my piccolo.\n\n01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.040\nBut yo, not just one cut down the middle, dashiki.\n\n01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.040\nOne dashiki, two dashiki.\n\n01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.040\nThere's no three dashiki for.\n\n01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.040\nBut then, you know, just a good flannel.\n\n01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:32.040\nSo I have something to keep my important cards, papers,\n\n01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.040\nand rolling papers.\n\n01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040\nBut then on top, you have what?\n\n01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040\nThis is a epi pen.\n\n01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040\nEpy pen.\n\n01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040\nYes.\n\n01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040\nYou're terrified of bee stings.\n\n01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040\nBee stings.\n\n01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.040\nI got bad peanut allergies and then I'm addicted to eating them.\n\n01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040\nWhoa.\n\n01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.040\nThat's an expensive habit.\n\n01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.040\nHold on, but guys, I didn't want to look.\n\n01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040\nIf there's one thing I got to just put out there,\n\n01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.040\nI'm here because I love Jeff forever.\n\n01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040\nDan is the coolest.\n\n01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.040\nAnd I'm a huge Harmontown fan.\n\n01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.040\nAnd so I did just want to say that something I heard Dan say\n\n01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.040\ntonight about Jimmy Carter, that was really, really dope.\n\n01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040\nI mean, if we're going to think about presidents and stuff,\n\n01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.040\nJimmy Carter has built literally over like 300, 400 houses\n\n01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.040\nfor Habitat for Humanity with his wife.\n\n01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.040\nYou know, since leaving office.\n\n01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040\nI mean, he's a guy that will go, you know,\n\n01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.040\nlike to Katrina and build a house just with other volunteers.\n\n01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040\nHe's been doing that.\n\n01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040\nAnd I mean, you know, I don't definitely mean to get political,\n\n01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.040\nbut his vibes that he sent out were peace and love and good.\n\n01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040\nAnd yeah.\n\n01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.040\nAnd then, you know, who knows.\n\n01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.040\nIt's supposedly that they wrinked IQs of presidents,\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.040\nand then Jimmy Carter is like probably our most intelligent\n\n01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040\npresident we've ever had.\n\n01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.040\nYeah.\n\n01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040\nThat doesn't surprise me.\n\n01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040\nNo.\n\n01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040\nI grew up in the Midwest.\n\n01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.040\nSo all I remember from that time, I was like eight, nine,\n\n01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040\n10 years old, something around there.\n\n01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.040\nAnd I just remember this like hysteria for Reagan.\n\n01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.040\nAnd like, like, yeah, like everybody was like,\n\n01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.040\nI was, I was socially conditioned to like, oh,\n\n01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.040\nJimmy Carter is such a fuzz nut.\n\n01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.040\nLike, you know, like it was like, I don't even know what a president is,\n\n01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.040\nbut I know I hate Jimmy Carter.\n\n01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.040\nHe sucks.\n\n01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.040\nHe's such a terrible president.\n\n01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.040\nAnd like, I'm just fascinated by that because I'm like,\n\n01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.040\nwhat did he, like, like it seems like such a quiet, you know,\n\n01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.040\nand no one typically doesn't talk about it.\n\n01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.040\nAnd I have a sneaking suspicion that's because there is nothing\n\n01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.040\nto talk about because he did a really good job.\n\n01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040\nI'm assuming.\n\n01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.040\nAnd because he was so progressive that they destabilized him.\n\n01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.040\nThey say like the, like the whole hostage crisis thing,\n\n01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.040\nit was set up for him to fail so that,\n\n01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.040\nso that he would not get reelected and he'd be a one-term president.\n\n01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.040\nThere was an oil crisis back then.\n\n01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.040\nI'm really going to show my ass if I start talking about this stuff\n\n01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.040\nbecause I don't know, but I have a feeling,\n\n01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.040\nI have a weird feeling that there was an oil crisis\n\n01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.040\nbecause OPEC was forming and like it was like the idea was that,\n\n01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040\noh, we had a little crossroads there.\n\n01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.040\nIt was like we could have committed to our rhetoric about wanting democracy\n\n01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040\nand all this stuff.\n\n01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.040\nBut then you get a little tough choice there where the people that are sitting\n\n01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.040\non top of the things that you want start to get votes and stuff\n\n01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040\nand they're going to vote for people that you don't like.\n\n01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.040\nAnd I have a feeling that there was probably a,\n\n01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.040\nthere probably existed some kind of like weird back to the future maelstrom\n\n01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.040\nwhere, oh, either Biff goes, you know,\n\n01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040\nstarts washing your car or has a museum.\n\n01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.040\nI think he's done more after his presidency\n\n01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.040\nthan most presidents did during their presidency.\n\n01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.040\nYeah.\n\n01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.040\nBecause he's a humanitarian and he's an intellect\n\n01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.040\nand those were the days when people that could actually complete a sentence\n\n01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.040\nand be thoughtful and care about each other.\n\n01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040\nYeah.\n\n01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040\nYeah.\n\n01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.040\nI mean, it's, I'll tell you this really quick thing.\n\n01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.040\nLike about maybe like 15 years ago I was on a road trip\n\n01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.040\njust kind of driving randomly through Georgia.\n\n01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.040\nAnd I ended up in Plains, Georgia,\n\n01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.040\nwhich is literally the town in Georgia where he grew up\n\n01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.040\nand still lives to this day.\n\n01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.040\nAnd there's maybe like 20 people in the town.\n\n01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.040\nIt's dirt poor, but it's still where he never stopped living there.\n\n01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040\nHe grew up there.\n\n01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040\nI mean, this is the one thing I want to say to that.\n\n01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.040\nI don't think that as a country we should ever elect a president\n\n01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.040\nwho has never been poor a day in their life because, you know,\n\n01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040\nthat's going to be, I'm sorry to say,\n\n01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.040\nbut someone that's going to lack empathy.\n\n01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.040\nAnd I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, just, you know.\n\n01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.040\nI don't know anybody cool, like my circle of friends,\n\n01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:32.040\nall the people that I look up to and respect and think highly of\n\n01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.040\nare people that know the value of what it means to have $1.\n\n01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040\nWell, how about an easier choice though?\n\n01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.040\nJust say that the title of president shouldn't be a thing\n\n01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.040\nthat's like a reward or anything.\n\n01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.040\nIt used to be a shit like a clerk job.\n\n01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.040\nIn Ireland, this I learned from my ex-wife when we were just,\n\n01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.040\nshe was just here for Harmon Quest.\n\n01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.040\nShe was explaining that they have this thing that I, you know,\n\n01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040\nI've been saying since the Trump election,\n\n01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.040\nwhen you look at like what people like about him\n\n01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.040\nand what people like the only conflicts is like,\n\n01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.040\nyou could solve this in the blink of an eye by going,\n\n01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.040\nokay, if we're going to keep insisting that the title of president\n\n01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.040\nbasically means American King, then make it a title worth that.\n\n01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.040\nIn other words, just let him, like he said himself,\n\n01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040\nall he wants to do is run around and say,\n\n01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.040\nHallelujah, like love it, like Louisiana,\n\n01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.040\npeace out and have everybody like with the hats and the things.\n\n01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040\nIreland has a president that does that.\n\n01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040\nThat's, that's all they do.\n\n01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.040\nThey elect the most Irish guy in Ireland and they call him president.\n\n01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040\nAnd then they have like, I don't know what his title is.\n\n01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040\nI don't know if it's Prime Minister or something else,\n\n01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.040\nbut it's like, it's function, it's just like, yeah.\n\n01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.040\nAnd then there's this person that rolls up their sleeves\n\n01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.040\nand probably went to law school and like runs a fucking country,\n\n01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.040\nlike in cooperation with the bureaucracy that you need.\n\n01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.040\nIf you're going to have hundreds of millions of people like,\n\n01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.040\nlike under you that need your,\n\n01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.040\ntheir lives to not fall under the whims of things.\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.040\nLike I, I, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.040\nSo, and also though, definitely.\n\n01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.040\nAnd also someone that could actually build a all inclusive society,\n\n01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:04.040\nyou know, where, where the goal is for everyone to prosper and do well.\n\n01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040\nAnd I mean, and in order for that to happen,\n\n01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.040\nyou can't have someone who's corrupt.\n\n01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.040\nIt should be a thankless job.\n\n01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.040\nYou should like dread being any kind of politician,\n\n01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.040\nbecause your life should be under a microscope every minute of every day.\n\n01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.040\nEverything you say should be checked and double checked.\n\n01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:26.040\nAnd it should be, it should be a job that attracts fetishists for organization.\n\n01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.040\nFetishists for organization.\n\n01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.040\nYeah.\n\n01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.040\nPeople who, there are people in the world who tend in our society\n\n01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.040\nto become accountants and certain kinds of lawyers and things,\n\n01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.040\ncivil rights lawyers and people that, those should be our politicians.\n\n01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.040\nThe people who would be like, yeah, no, that's not a job for me.\n\n01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.040\nThe reason they're saying that is because it's a disgraceful occupation\n\n01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.040\nfor narcissists and blowhards.\n\n01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.040\nAnd they don't want people to look at how they smoked pot in college\n\n01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.040\nand like call or what, you know, look, there's search histories up for debate\n\n01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.040\nor if they ever had an affair and stuff.\n\n01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.040\nCould we just strip that stuff out and make it a, a graceless occupation.\n\n01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.040\nAnd now they're all trying to do Instagram stories too.\n\n01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.040\nLike beta or Royce, like trying to live tweet from the dentist.\n\n01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040\nYeah.\n\n01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.040\nSo that, yo, he can be relatable to us.\n\n01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.040\nYeah, it's like great.\n\n01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040\nYou have dental health care.\n\n01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.040\nGo beta.\n\n01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.040\nI mean, like, yo, good thing your last name ain't Max.\n\n01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040\nHell yeah.\n\n01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040\nThe old video format.\n\n01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.040\nYes.\n\n01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040\nYes.\n\n01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.040\nYes.\n\n01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.040\nI've been getting back to the matter at hand.\n\n01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040\nOh yeah.\n\n01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.040\nWe got to keep this thing on rail.\n\n01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.040\nOh no.\n\n01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.040\nBut I mean, Jimmy Carter is still alive and if mental and physical health are linked\n\n01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.040\nand you know, I believe we all know they are and having good energy in you.\n\n01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.040\nI mean, Jimmy Carter, he's alive way past 90.\n\n01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040\nHe's the real Clint Eastwood.\n\n01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.040\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.040\nWould you be willing to share Jesse?\n\n01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040\nLike just, just, just say no.\n\n01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040\nI think I asked you this last week, but I was kind of in a blackout.\n\n01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.040\nI was like, Hey, next time you come out, could we, would you be okay talking about\n\n01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.040\nthe fact that recently like you were kind of off the grid for a little bit?\n\n01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040\nSure.\n\n01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.040\nStuff like that.\n\n01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.040\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.040\nA lot of kids listen and like they go up and down and stuff.\n\n01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.040\nOh, absolutely.\n\n01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.040\nYou've been struggling with stuff and like you're, you're, you're, are you on the wagon\n\n01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.040\nnow?\n\n01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040\nYou want to talk about that stuff?\n\n01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040\nLike where are you?\n\n01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040\nOh, by sobriety?\n\n01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.040\nOh, I mean, like what you've done, where you've plummeted, where, what you're back from,\n\n01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040\nwhere you are.\n\n01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040\nIt's okay if where you are now.\n\n01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.040\nOh boy.\n\n01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040\nOkay.\n\n01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.040\nLike also just say, no, I don't want to talk about that.\n\n01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.040\nI don't want to, I want to have fun and not do that.\n\n01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.040\nBut if you,\n\n01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.040\nNo, no, no, absolutely.\n\n01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.040\nI mean, there's definitely, you know, some lows and some highs.\n\n01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:36.360\nI mean, talking about politicians for a brief moment, they're a crazy bunch these days.\n\n01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:42.160\nI am someone who I can say has slept with not only Camilla Harris, but also Lindsey Graham\n\n01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.040\nand yo, there's some freaks in the Senate.\n\n01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.040\nThat's what I was talking about.\n\n01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040\nYes.\n\n01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.040\nBut, but, but, but, but Lindsey Miller Graham, Lindsey Miller Graham.\n\n01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040\nYeah.\n\n01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.040\nLindsey Mellon camp.\n\n01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:03.040\nBut listen, I want to say that, that no, no, Dan, from my heart, honestly, like, um,\n\n01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.800\nlife, that's what makes life life is that, you know, you have amazing highs and then the\n\n01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:13.040\nrest is like lessons in humility and, you know, both are great and necessary.\n\n01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:19.880\nAnd so, um, no, I, and, and first off, one other thing, just as a human being, you,\n\n01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:26.360\nI mean, Harmontown, the movie is such a courageous movie and you, if anything, have always, I\n\n01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.440\nmean, just from the bottom of the heart and why, um, just want to say that you being such\n\n01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.200\na courageous person and just, you know, letting everything out there so people can learn from\n\n01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.880\nit is such a beautiful thing.\n\n01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880\nI do.\n\n01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.400\nI'll be honored, you know, to really a selfless act.\n\n01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400\nLike I appreciate it.\n\n01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:53.120\nI'm, I'm, I'm like, I'm alive because I found out that I can, I can say what is on my mind\n\n01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.920\nand like, I'll live longer than if I, than if I bottle it up.\n\n01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.040\nThat's why I just, because you were, you were missing for a little bit, like, I, like, Jeff,\n\n01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.520\nyou, didn't you find him?\n\n01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.760\nI mean, it's like, like, like, you were withdrawn and you were, and Jesse, like, tell me, like,\n\n01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.760\nif you don't want to talk about it, but like, like your sister called me up and said, you,\n\n01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.280\nyou went off the grid and she said, like, where's Jesse and text him?\n\n01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.160\nAnd I did, but you didn't have your phone.\n\n01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.440\nAnd then one day I got a fucking awesome text from you and you're like, Hey, man, and you\n\n01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:31.560\nwere just cracking jokes and you were back and, uh, with the story, the story about,\n\n01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.560\ncan we tell the story?\n\n01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.560\nDraw a lot of value from that.\n\n01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.800\nIf you've been to dark places, you don't want to talk about it and it takes you back to\n\n01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.200\ndark places to talk about it, then it accomplishes the opposite of the,\n\n01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.840\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.\n\n01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.840\nI'm, I'm guys honest.\n\n01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840\nI'm honest.\n\n01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.160\nWe were real fucking worried about you and, and we, we put the bat signal out and says,\n\n01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160\nwhere's Jesse?\n\n01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160\nYes.\n\n01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.800\nAnd then you told me when you texted me, we, I called you, uh, and you said, it's like\n\n01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.200\nfinding out what it would be like to die because I find out how much people will care\n\n01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200\nabout me.\n\n01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:03.160\nAnd like, like, like, and you go, oh, like, like, these are the people that would care\n\n01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.160\nif I died.\n\n01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.760\nAnd don't mistake that as advice for the youth or anything like, Hey, you know what?\n\n01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:08.760\nYou should try.\n\n01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:12.600\nBut, but, but nobody, but you found out that like, like there are people, cause I, I think\n\n01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.440\nof you, Jesse, as somebody, and my joke is always that you would give me the seven shirts\n\n01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440\noff your back.\n\n01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:24.360\nUh, but you, you're that kind of friend, you would, you would, you would do anything\n\n01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360\nfor a friend.\n\n01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360\nYeah.\n\n01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.800\nAnd then you found out who your friends were when, when you went off the, uh, off the air\n\n01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800\nfor a while.\n\n01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.360\nAs far as I understand, like it's pretty obvious from your personality.\n\n01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.760\nSorry, I know we're explaining you to you, but, but like, I, like, I think it's the thing\n\n01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:43.040\nthat draws me to the reason I want to hear about any, any, any things that you've battled\n\n01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:49.160\njust because of this, because, um, you're a really nice guy and I, I don't know you\n\n01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.080\nthat well, but I, I feel like it's like seawater where like, you know, from a drop, like what\n\n01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:59.160\nthe content of an ocean is and that you're not a judgmental person.\n\n01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:04.160\nYou don't, you don't put a lot of energy out towards like, um, worrying about other people\n\n01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.440\nand how they should be in order for you to be happy.\n\n01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.320\nIt's important for people to learn that there's a, I mean, or to, or to deal with the fact\n\n01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.960\nthat like people, like, like, if that hurts, like, like, like, like, I feel like there's\n\n01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.360\ntoo many people in our society that like are like that, like, look, I don't want to judge\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360\nother people and all this stuff.\n\n01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.280\nAnd there's like, that comes with a lot of self loathing, a lot of self torture, like\n\n01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.040\ndirecting a lot of energy inward where you're like, I'm a piece of shit.\n\n01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.840\nSo I'm just going to like medicate and like vanish and I'm, I'm sick of this.\n\n01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:37.000\nSo anyways, that's why I'm like, that's why I think it could be so valuable to talk about\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nbecause\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.680\nI, um, so in order to, um, I'll tell you, I'll tell you guys the whole story in order\n\n01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:51.640\nto put it, um, properly in perspective, um, oh, but I don't in any way, in any way want\n\n01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:58.360\nto, um, throw my sister under the bus either because she, um, she is a fantastic person\n\n01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.000\nwith her own demons too.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:10.240\nBut, um, so basically, um, from like about, um, 2015 through like the end of 2016, I've\n\n01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.360\nbeen working with my sister on, um, on a new series and it had been going amazing.\n\n01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.760\nI mean, we had, um, you know, and we still, you know, it's still all there and it can\n\n01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:28.320\nand, and we're still working on, on, on putting it together, but we, we, um, basically I had\n\n01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:34.840\nworked really hard on this project with my sister and for, um, you know, for some reasons\n\n01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:41.640\nand to be really blunt, I was really kind of like on the, on the verge of making a comeback\n\n01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.400\nthat had been like 15 years in the making.\n\n01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.760\nBut this is, this, um, what I'm trying to get to is that, you know, like, um, my sister\n\n01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.400\nand I kind of had a falling out over some, some crazy stuff or she really went into a,\n\n01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.760\na dark patch and then, you know, um, we couldn't see the, the show to fruition for a moment\n\n01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:08.640\nand I kind of just fell into a depression and I had been sober for about, um, and when\n\n01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:15.360\nI say sober, I just mean like no hard substances, you know, and, um, I don't consider marijuana\n\n01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.320\nand I don't consider, you know, like an alcohol, um, you know, to, to really be a drug, but\n\n01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.080\nat the same time, you know, anything that you abuse and, and, um, you know, anything\n\n01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.200\nthat's, uh, basically just numbing you in your pain without allowing you to grow at\n\n01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.200\nall.\n\n01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.960\nI mean, that's, that's an addiction and that's a drug and so what I'm getting into is that\n\n01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:42.040\nI did kind of like fall into, um, a year and a half drug addiction with, um, a drug\n\n01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.760\nthat I hadn't touched in over like, uh, seven and a half years, because I was just, you\n\n01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:54.680\nknow, um, uh, the, the, the fallout from, well, uh, just things with my sister, um,\n\n01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.080\nyou know, and then, um, everything, you know, yeah, I just kind of fell into a depression,\n\n01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:07.600\nbut, um, where I'm going with all of that is, um, so then I, um, basically, so I was\n\n01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.680\nusing some heavy drugs for like almost a year and a half and then I ended up kind of just\n\n01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.800\nlike, you know, in Fontana, California, as one does, you know, nothing, nothing good\n\n01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:28.480\nhappens in Fontana, by the way, 24 hour auto zone, so think about what you need headphones\n\n01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.480\nto live there.\n\n01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480\nRight.\n\n01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480\nI've the only time I've been to Fontana.\n\n01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480\nI had headphones on the entire time.\n\n01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:40.000\nOh, well, if you want your car fixed, relatively dirt, as cheap, all you got to do is and wait\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.080\nuntil it's about 10 because the frig's come out at night, but you go to the 24 hour auto\n\n01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:52.360\nzone in Fontana after 10 and basically there are tons of people really high on supplements\n\n01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.880\nin the parking lot, either working on their own car or just hoping that someone might need\n\n01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.120\nwork done on their car.\n\n01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.120\nSo like, when you call me, you said, I'm telling you get four of these after hour auto zone,\n\n01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.480\nlike, you know, um, mechanics in the parking lot, like together and you'll have a new engine\n\n01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:15.240\nin a car in like two hours for like a hundred bucks and maybe a bag of flaming hot Cheetos,\n\n01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.240\nyou know.\n\n01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.160\nSo I'm telling you when you call me, you're at a pick apart in Fontana, right?\n\n01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.200\nOh, that was way after that was that is a couple of years into things.\n\n01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.440\nI mean, so this is where the story gets good is that I think that, um, and again, I don't\n\n01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:37.080\nin any way mean to slag my sister and I, um, uh, you know, she would just use your I\n\n01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080\nstatements.\n\n01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.080\nThat's what I've learned.\n\n01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:42.680\nIf she's a part of the story, but you can still say, look, I was, I was, I felt, I felt\n\n01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680\nbad or whatever.\n\n01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.680\nThat's great.\n\n01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.680\nYou don't have to worry about slagging her.\n\n01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.680\nThat's great.\n\n01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.680\nWell, exactly.\n\n01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.000\nI mean, um, well, during, during my time at depression, you know, I didn't have much,\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.520\num, you know, uh, uh, of a relationship, you know, with my sister much either and she\n\n01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.240\nwas kind of in her own dark place too.\n\n01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.600\nAnd so I think, you know, that's why I really kind of become despondent and, um, because\n\n01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:10.320\nyou know, uh, you know, this was my creative partner, my, my, my best friend and my sister.\n\n01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:14.040\nAnd so, you know, I, I really missed her so much and we were really on the verge of,\n\n01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.720\num, some really cool things.\n\n01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:25.720\nAnd so I mean, like, um, uh, so what I was going to say is, um, this, is that, uh, wow,\n\n01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:30.120\nI know that this does sound like not many brain cells are in here, but I'm really trying\n\n01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120\nto just, uh,\n\n01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.600\nIt sounds like it's important and people are listening and they've been through way\n\n01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.800\nworse, believe me, as far as quality of show, like they're, they're, they're listening\n\n01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.800\nand they're fine.\n\n01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.800\nAnd you can take your time and find the words.\n\n01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:47.720\nI just, you know, met this Anita Baker impersonator named Tito and, um, that's a whole other\n\n01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:55.160\nchapter for another podcast, but I'll tell you this, um, that, um, oh Jeff, by the way,\n\n01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:00.480\num, uh, Tony, um, what's your friend, the friend that works at the car wash with the\n\n01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:04.160\nobnoxious mustache that puts a turtle wax in it.\n\n01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160\nOh no.\n\n01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.240\nThis is how Jeff finds out the bus that we're going back.\n\n01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.240\nWe're going back.\n\n01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.240\nWe're going back.\n\n01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.680\nBut, um, I, I hope we have a friend.\n\n01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680\nHe loves that.\n\n01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.680\nWe do.\n\n01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.920\nI would love to have a friend with a, uh, his name is Tommy Tango and he says hello.\n\n01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.280\nI know Tommy T.\n\n01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.240\nI, I, I don't, but thank you.\n\n01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.440\nYo, the mustache, but guys getting, getting, oh wow.\n\n01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.440\nYou see, that's myself.\n\n01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:32.400\nHonestly, that's a defense mechanism because it's easier to joke and I'm going to get into\n\n01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400\nthe real heavy stuff.\n\n01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.440\nAnd so, um, you can also, you can also pull up and out and we'll touch back on it another\n\n01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.440\nday.\n\n01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.440\nOkay.\n\n01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:43.560\nBut, but, but I think, I think like we're almost right at the end.\n\n01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.200\nAnd so, you know, just two more seconds, guys, over the waterfall and in our own.\n\n01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.200\nWe're doing it.\n\n01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:56.400\nDo you, like, like you tell us as much as you want because, um, first of all, I'm happy\n\n01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.400\nyou're back.\n\n01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.400\nYeah.\n\n01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.400\nBecause I was worried about you.\n\n01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.400\nAnd also America is happy.\n\n01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.400\nI'm back.\n\n01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.400\nYeah.\n\n01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.400\nOh man.\n\n01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.400\nThank you.\n\n01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:11.680\nBut, but, but as, as definitely didn't have to coax that one as, as, as Dan said, uh,\n\n01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:16.960\nand quite rightly, the, uh, like to the extent that you are willing to share what you went\n\n01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.960\nthrough, I think is helpful to people that listen to our show.\n\n01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:26.360\nSo like, like, like, not to sell corny, but like 16 year olds, I'd really, you know,\n\n01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:32.360\num, without sounding corny about this, I mean, like just to put it in, in real, like, um,\n\n01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.200\nyou know, black and white, cliff note terms, you know, um, I'd been working with my sister\n\n01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:41.000\nwho I still love and adore, um, and, and we made this insane project where, you know,\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.960\nwe have, um, of course, the Jeff Davis appearance, but everything from, you know, Miley Cyrus\n\n01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:53.200\nto George Clinton to Alice Cooper, um, lots of really cool interviews and crazy sketches\n\n01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.840\nand, you know, me at Charlotte Hornets games and, you know, and, um, in West Virginia,\n\n01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:02.800\nAppalachia, it's like just a whole crazy show project that would make it.\n\n01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.880\nAnd then we had this big fallout.\n\n01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.960\nAnd so, you know, I, I just equate it like to, like, if you were part of a band, you\n\n01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.120\nguys had been through like this journey and we're about to like, you know, finally release\n\n01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.760\nyour record, the band, you know, breaks up and the record is shelved.\n\n01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.760\nThat's just the head state.\n\n01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.600\nAnd, and, and, but you know what, the, the more I'm talking about this, I just want to\n\n01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.720\nsay, you know, like, fuck me, because I mean, these are really quality problems to have,\n\n01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.720\nyou know what I mean?\n\n01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:30.200\nBut at the same time, it's not so much about the project.\n\n01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:35.840\nIt's about, um, just losing, you know, my sister, who, you know, I, uh, you guys just,\n\n01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.760\nyou know, it's like my right arm, you know, right?\n\n01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.240\nWhat's your status with her right now?\n\n01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:45.440\nNo, we, we, um, we don't really talk at all, you know, and she was freaked out, man, because\n\n01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:49.040\nshe's like, like, I barely know her.\n\n01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.840\nAnd she, she was texting me.\n\n01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:58.360\nThis is the, when I was in Fontana, I had actually left my phone in, um, a car of a,\n\n01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.600\nof a dude.\n\n01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.560\nAnd then I didn't really, um, exactly know how to get it back.\n\n01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.960\nAnd, um, kind of was just, you know, again, in a depressed state.\n\n01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.720\nSo I kind of like was like, you know, all right, I'm going to enjoy not having a phone.\n\n01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.280\nAnd this was only about like nine days.\n\n01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:19.120\nAnd then, um, but it was, honestly, it felt kind of cool, like, to not have a phone.\n\n01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.720\nAnd I was just really sorting through, you know, my problems.\n\n01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.800\nAnd, uh, and so I had also kind of during that time without the phone, I made a decision\n\n01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:34.000\nmentally to be like, okay, I'm stopping, um, doing the drugs that I was doing completely.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.200\nAnd, um, you know, I, because at the end of the day, you know, I was doing that to, to\n\n01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.440\nget myself through a hurdle.\n\n01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:50.720\nI was doing like a upper type of drug and when I'm getting that is, um, you know, if\n\n01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.440\nyou all of a sudden, you know, you, you find yourself alone, but you'd made all this, you\n\n01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.440\nknow, great progress and you didn't want to lose everything, but you were just really\n\n01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.040\nconfused how to move on without your band.\n\n01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.240\nYou know, my thinking is, well, let me do this drug that will like, you know, kind of\n\n01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.560\nlike help focus me and numb, you know, my sadness over what happened.\n\n01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:16.000\nBecause it was a really, um, you know, like emotional thing and, um, you know, you first\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.200\nturned to a project oriented, uh, narcotic.\n\n01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.200\nYes.\n\n01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.200\nYes.\n\n01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200\nYes.\n\n01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.200\nExactly.\n\n01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.200\nExactly.\n\n01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200\nThat makes a lot of sense.\n\n01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.200\nI got that.\n\n01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.160\nThat's, that's an interesting like explanation of that.\n\n01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.560\nLike, uh, yes, definitely, because it is the project, the thing that like when I, when\n\n01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:40.400\nyou invited me to the whiskey to meet LA guns, do you still have all that footage?\n\n01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.400\nOh, it's all there.\n\n01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.400\nYeah.\n\n01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.400\nIt's going to be great.\n\n01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.480\nI just, I'm learning how to, how to, to edit it now.\n\n01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:52.200\nI got, I got like years of content back stage to a rock show with Jesse camp and, uh, guess\n\n01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200\nwhat?\n\n01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.680\nEverybody is happy that Jesse's there and he has all this awesome footage of him and\n\n01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.280\nhis sister interviewing people and just talking backstage and that is something that I would\n\n01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.280\nabsolutely need to see.\n\n01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280\nOh yeah.\n\n01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.280\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.280\nIs it still extant?\n\n01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.280\nLike it'll happen still or not?\n\n01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.280\nOh, absolutely.\n\n01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.360\nAnd I mean, it's, it's a really cool project.\n\n01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.600\nIt's kind of like, you know, like Mike judge, Mike judges tales from the tour bus, you know,\n\n01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.880\nin that, um, you know, you have crazy rock stuff interweaving with just, um, basically\n\n01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:29.640\nlike, you know, uh, fun travel segments, like, you know, go into weird, uh, flea markets\n\n01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.800\nin like Knoxville, Tennessee and helping out in the wig department there with, you know,\n\n01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:41.880\nsenior ladies watching, watching famous rockers meet you like, I, because I've, I've seen\n\n01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880\nthat.\n\n01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880\nYeah.\n\n01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880\nAnd it's, it's pretty magical.\n\n01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.760\nLike, like that's something that should happen because like, like to know you is to love\n\n01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:55.280\nyou and to know who's also like to know that like you would like always make things happy\n\n01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.280\nand fun.\n\n01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.680\nSo like you have to finish this thing.\n\n01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.240\nWell, let me, oh yeah.\n\n01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.240\nYeah.\n\n01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.160\nAnd, and just super, just super quick, you guys, what I want to say is that basically\n\n01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:09.840\nlike during those, so this is the, the, the funny part about me, this is the part of the\n\n01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.400\nstory where I find out that I was a missing person because I had no idea.\n\n01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.400\nOkay.\n\n01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.400\nCause like, I guess, you know, like my, so like I had emailed, oh, get this.\n\n01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.400\nOkay.\n\n01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.280\nCause I'm, I'm very, I am very close with my mom.\n\n01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.280\nSo just about your nine days gone, nine days gone.\n\n01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:34.560\nAnd you're like, no, no, it was a good thing and yeah, nine days gone to paint the picture.\n\n01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560\nNow, so I'm in Fontana.\n\n01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.560\nAre you editing?\n\n01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:43.760\nAre you like, are you like working on

01:36:47.840\nYeah.\n\n01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840\nYou're experiencing focus.\n\n01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.320\nWell, we talk about the fashion and I'm not bragging out of school here, but Jeff knows\n\n01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.320\nthis too.\n\n01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.960\nI'm a big, I'm a, I'd have to cross diagnose myself with another addiction and that's,\n\n01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.320\nI'm a, I'm a thrift store junkie and like, you know, you're, you're wearing a jacket\n\n01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.960\nright now that can only be described as like any get your gun meets, uh, wild, wild Bill\n\n01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960\nHickok.\n\n01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960\nYeah.\n\n01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960\nWith a little Nell in there.\n\n01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.960\nYeah.\n\n01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.480\nI thought Jody Foster, I mean, who wouldn't want to be the costume designer on Nell.\n\n01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.760\nIt's just like bed sheets.\n\n01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.760\nOkay.\n\n01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760\nThe thread.\n\n01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760\nJohn Bon Jody.\n\n01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.760\nYes.\n\n01:37:23.760

and I want, I really want to put my services out\n\n01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.400\nthere.\n\n01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:39.640\nIf you guys, cause I, when I was here, um, right before Christmas, you guys had P homes\n\n01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.880\non that was, that was epic, brilliant show.\n\n01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.880\nI do.\n\n01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.640\nI, I love one other talent is that I think of myself as a mini booker and I'm not talking\n\n01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:56.120\nabout Richard Greco's character on the last season of 21 Jump Street, whose name is Booker.\n\n01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120\nOkay.\n\n01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:04.480\nA lot of, a lot of, uh, a reference for two people here on mis misread the crowd there.\n\n01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480\nOkay.\n\n01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:11.680\nBut no, I mean, you guys are more of a Gilmore girls kind of bunch and that's cool with me.\n\n01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:17.040\nYou know, do you guys know that Dan gets starred as mailman Jerry on two unerred episodes\n\n01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.280\nof Gilmore girls, very, very cool stuff.\n\n01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:29.400\nYou know, it's only shown in Japan for reasons Dan knows a little about and, um, and, and\n\n01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400\nso does Lauren Graham.\n\n01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.400\nDo you want to talk about that?\n\n01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:34.720\nHey, no, let me, let me, let me get back on track.\n\n01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.720\nBack on track.\n\n01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.080\nIs this, is this so, so I am, um, six, um, basically it's nine days after I had lost\n\n01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:46.000\nmy phone and said, just fuck it, you know, in that and, and then like three days sober\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nfrom that.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.560\nBut then, so I was three days sober, um, I started to get a bit of a sinus infection.\n\n01:38:53.560 --> 01:39:00.800\nAnd so I went to a hospital, yeah, I shouldn't say, but it's very close to Fontana and has\n\n01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.800\nits own hospital and two good wills and the savers and it starts with the R and it's its\n\n01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800\nown county.\n\n01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800\nOkay.\n\n01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.800\nIverside.\n\n01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.800\nI was in Riverside.\n\n01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.960\nI go into the hospital and like, um, and you, you had been missing for months.\n\n01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.960\nAs far as I knew.\n\n01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.920\nNo, no, oh, we should suffix this.\n\n01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.000\nSo basically my sister had only briefly talked with my mom that I had been, that she hadn't\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.640\nheard from me, my mom and I do talk on the reg.\n\n01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.360\nAnd so then I think my sister did, I think her imagination, but maybe genuine concern,\n\n01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.760\nmaybe, maybe some guilt, maybe whatever.\n\n01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.240\nShe was, she was really worried that cause she knew I was depressed.\n\n01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.800\nI mean, like she didn't know that.\n\n01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:48.720\nAnd so I mean, I think that she maybe genuinely was worried that I maybe did something rash\n\n01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:54.880\nbecause I was so broken up about, you know, like, um, you know, just, uh, it's a really\n\n01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880\nrough situation.\n\n01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.160\nYou know, people that want to hurt you, like, like no business in your, your relationship,\n\n01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:07.960\nbut people that want to hurt you, um, and have the choice between soliciting finding\n\n01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.960\nyou.\n\n01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.200\nAnd one thing to say, I come from a big line of like, well, let's be dramatic about so\n\n01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.600\nand so's problem and like want to help them because actually what we're doing is we're\n\n01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.240\nweaponizing our like concern because they're, they're here every Christmas and let's fuck\n\n01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.400\nwith them.\n\n01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:28.720\nBut, um, it's another thing for you to be off the, I don't, not knowing your sister,\n\n01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.560\nI can safely say, I don't think it was her animosity that provoked her to explain to\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.680\npeople how dire it was that you were missing.\n\n01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.480\nShe was very concerned with me.\n\n01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:43.360\nShe texted me and let me know, let me know that she was really worried.\n\n01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.160\nI think, I think if you, I think if you wanted to hurt somebody and they're, and they're\n\n01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.920\noff the grid, whether it's nine days or three months, like you, you're, it's not the part\n\n01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:56.040\nof you that hates them that makes you go, this is really serious.\n\n01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.480\nI, even if it's not really serious from your point of view, it's not the part of them\n\n01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.240\nthat hates you that makes them go to that high note.\n\n01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.680\nThat's the part of them that wants you found because maybe even the part of her that feels\n\n01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.560\na little bit of responsibility and I think that's very salvageable as much as this project\n\n01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:17.880\ntoo, and, and, and easily salvageable and, and, and like, what, if not to like conduct\n\n01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:23.400\nyour fucking story, but like the feeling of that rope coming back out of that, like,\n\n01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.440\nand, and, like, this idea of like, you didn't know you were missing content.\n\n01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:34.760\nAnd then, and then, and then absolutely, so, um, so I'm in this hospital and, um, you know,\n\n01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:39.120\nI think I gave my, um, you know, a variation on my name.\n\n01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:45.960\nI don't remember, I was not, oh man, um, I love a good emergency room and so I was in\n\n01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:54.120\none and, um, basically like, you know, they were the, you know what, screw that.\n\n01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.680\nThis hospital was really a beautiful place.\n\n01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.680\nThere's a hospital.\n\n01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.680\nI don't know how many.\n\n01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.720\nAnd they had, they had one, they asked one thing of you, don't name our county.\n\n01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:03.720\nRight, right.\n\n01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:08.320\nYou've got two good wills and a great emergency room and you're like Riverside and now every\n\n01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320\nfucking asshole.\n\n01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:14.120\nYou got rumbled in there because you said the other name, but they go, but you're Jesse.\n\n01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120\nYes.\n\n01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.120\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.200\nSo basically I told the nurse that my name was, you know, maybe, um, John Camp, I don't\n\n01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.200\neven know.\n\n01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:25.920\nUm, not again, just for, you know, like, just because you, you know what I mean, he wants\n\n01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.360\nto give you a real info and social security number to a hospital.\n\n01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.200\nYou told them they're your actual name, but they're like, but aren't you right?\n\n01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:34.200\nRight.\n\n01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.200\nRight.\n\n01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.200\nRight.\n\n01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.200\nRight.\n\n01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.200\nRight.\n\n01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.200\nRight.\n\n01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.200\nSo I said probably that, um, cause my full, you know, my full name is Tito camp.\n\n01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:44.560\nAnd so basically set him Tito camp and then they're like, okay, Tito, but like the nurse\n\n01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.880\nlooked at me like she kind of like knew who I was, which was really weird because I was,\n\n01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:56.760\nyou know, um, yeah, a little disheveled perhaps or then again, I don't look much different\n\n01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.760\nthan now.\n\n01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.880\nI'm not very much a kindred spirit with a drunk Gary Busey, but, um, whereas going with\n\n01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.760\nthis is that so basically then the nurse is like, okay, all right, you know, Josh, I think\n\n01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.960\nI said I was Josh cause that's, that's very close to my, um, my full name, which is\n\n01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.960\nChad would have been believable.\n\n01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:16.960\nYeah.\n\n01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:22.760\nI'm a, I look like Chad so much like a Chad, a Chad wick is also what they call, um, the\n\n01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.120\npart of a candle that you like called Chad, stay on target.\n\n01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:34.360\nSo, um, basically then I'm sitting to the nurse is like, okay, Josh, you know, and then\n\n01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.960\nthe, then, and then the doctor comes in and he's like, Jesse, what's going on?\n\n01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.040\nAnd I'm like, what the fuck?\n\n01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.040\nHow did he know?\n\n01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.720\nJesse, I've been telling people I was Josh and so I said, oh, Jesse, but then I knew\n\n01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720\nthe J was up.\n\n01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.720\nThey knew who I was.\n\n01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:53.560\nAnd so I was just like, like trying to put the pieces together, like I know that I'm\n\n01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.760\na national treasure.\n\n01:43:54.760 --> 01:44:01.440\nI know that the U S has made several, not just one stamp with my face on it, but like\n\n01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:05.840\n10 different, you know, stamps by annually with my head on it.\n\n01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.840\nIt's great.\n\n01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.760\nUm, the new 34 stent Jesse camp stamp is Jesse camp stamp for all you tramps.\n\n01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760\nOkay.\n\n01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760\nEnough rhyming.\n\n01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.800\nI have a camp stamp over my butt.\n\n01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:24.600\nJeff does have a camp stamp from the time he, um, he was with my mom and I didn't understand\n\n01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.600\nthe relationship at the time.\n\n01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.600\nNow I do.\n\n01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:31.080\nIt was a very beautiful Herald and then mod type of deal back on target, back on track.\n\n01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.080\nOkay.\n\n01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.600\nSo, um, to the doctor was like, you know, like, just, you know, like, okay, Jess.\n\n01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:42.120\nSo I, I, so again, I had said that my name was Josh to the nurse and then the nurse was\n\n01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:47.160\nlike, Josh, okay, Josh, why don't you come back here with me?\n\n01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:50.520\nAnd then she came in, Josh, the doctor will see you now.\n\n01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.520\nOh, okay.\n\n01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.520\nCool.\n\n01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.520\nHey, I'm Josh.\n\n01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.160\nI have a sinus infection.\n\n01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.040\nYou know, I just need some antibiotics.\n\n01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.880\nI didn't rush to that part yet.\n\n01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.280\nNever self-diagnose yourself at the doctor's office.\n\n01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.640\nThat is a sure way to not get the prescription you're trying to get filled.\n\n01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.400\nYou know, like, don't go in there and be like, oh, you know, like, let them assess your back\n\n01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400\npain.\n\n01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.640\nJust look real grimacing in the face so they really believe you're in pain.\n\n01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.640\nDon't oversell it.\n\n01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.640\nOkay.\n\n01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.560\nThat's to my homes in New Hampshire and West Virginia.\n\n01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:21.960\nYou know who you are at the pill mill, but back on track.\n\n01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.080\nI'm just kidding.\n\n01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.280\nWho am I to throw stones?\n\n01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:32.280\nWhat I'm really getting at is that, yo, I'm like lost in Fontana, F in California, end\n\n01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.880\nup at a hospital in the Riverside.\n\n01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.240\nBasically the doctor had like seen something about me being missing on TMZ.\n\n01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:48.040\nI had no clue in the nine days since I had lost my phone that somehow like I had been\n\n01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:56.840\nreported on like, you know, on like people.com, you know, does the dick meet the expectations\n\n01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:01.040\nof the foot size website, you know, dick it or stick it.\n\n01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:02.960\nI mean, no, what am I talking about?\n\n01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960\nI'm sorry guys.\n\n01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.240\nStick it or stick it is something.\n\n01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.720\nI think we can make some money.\n\n01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:08.720\nDicker is sticker.\n\n01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.760\nI think it's definitely like a, you know, your doctor swiped left or right.\n\n01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:18.000\nYour doctor is at the ER had seen you on TMZ and so they were so actually really\n\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.480\nreally super cool.\n\n01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.760\nThey brought me like two meals of hospital food on.\n\n01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.760\nI didn't ask.\n\n01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.360\nThey were just like, they were like super cool.\n\n01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.120\nLike they were like basically like they owned a sports bar and kid rock came in there.\n\n01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.120\nYeah.\n\n01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.000\nThey're like, you know, they're dope.\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.920\nThey were just like, you want some Delotin's and I was just like, no, you know, all right.\n\n01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:39.920\nSure.\n\n01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:41.920\nWhat's the street value?\n\n01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.880\nYes, I'll take it, but they were really, really cool and really sweet and really encouraging\n\n01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:54.600\nand they said, you know, um, honestly, something along the lines of, you know, that, that,\n\n01:46:54.600 --> 01:47:01.040\nyou know, you have a good soul and you're a good kid and not kid because I am definitely\n\n01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.040\nnow like, um, I'm in the halftime show, but yo, I'm 39 years old.\n\n01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.080\nSo 40 is the halftime and then, you know what I mean?\n\n01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.920\nIf life is a football game or a Super Bowl, but, um, back at the matter at hand and again,\n\n01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:22.280\nI'm totally be honest, that's a self defense mechanism to kind of like, you know, to try\n\n01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:27.240\nto put some humor on this cause, cause these, yeah, it's, it is rough talking about this\n\n01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:34.320\nis necessary, but these, these were beyond humbling times, growing times and times when\n\n01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.760\nyou know, um, yeah, you, you, you, you just, you are all of this in the end is, is, is\n\n01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.880\ngood because, you know, it, but in that moment where you, where you irritated, it's okay.\n\n01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:46.880\nBut the answer is yes.\n\n01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:51.680\nBecause at the time it was like, like, I was a little, well, you know, I'm here by choice\n\n01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.520\nand I don't want to be rescued and it's embarrassing that people like, I can imagine that would\n\n01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:01.200\nbe very humiliating and, and maybe angry when you, when you find out you're a missing person\n\n01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:08.200\nwhen you were just, you know, um, at the, you know, end of a year and a half drug odyssey\n\n01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:14.800\nand that ends in again, Fontana, it's right off the 10 by the way, Fontana is that beautiful\n\n01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:21.760\nhamlet between Ontario and San Bernardino. Okay. So again, if you want to go to Fontana,\n\n01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:29.200\ntake the ten freeway fun about it. It's a lot heavier on the fawn as in dude. Fondue\n\n01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:36.480\nis if chocolate and cheese and fondue is like, and it has some, I know that that okay. Final\n\n01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.120\nthought we have to wrap up here though. We do have to wrap up. I know and I will like\n\n01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:44.880\na fucking condom about to go into Heidi flight. I don't want to write your story for you,\n\n01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.880\nbut we're looking for that moment of like the crossing and return threshold where you\n\n01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.160\nwere like, okay, I'm coming back. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I got that moment for\n\n01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.840\nyou and more Jesse. I'm going to pull a Stefan Jesse redemption isn't lower East Side New\n\n01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:04.120\nYork bar where there are lots of midgets that wear Fanny packs. Jesse, I have to say the\n\n01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.200\nday that you called me up and you had been gone for a while and you called me up, I,\n\n01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:13.000\nyou couldn't, I got to say, yeah, the feeling that hit me. I think I know where you're getting\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.840\nat Jeff is that when the doctors, they really showed a lot of love and that's, I had no\n\n01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:26.280\nidea that I was missing when I had checked out of the planet or lost my phone. I definitely\n\n01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.920\nwasn't wasn't in the headspace of thinking that there's a big world out there that that\n\n01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.000\ncares about you or that you're significant. You know what I mean? I definitely felt like\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:43.320\nbroken. I felt, you know, almost to the point of here's the thing is that if you have nothing\n\n01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.200\nto lose, there's a real freedom with that. I mean, like, like Kris Kristofferson freedoms,\n\n01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:51.120\njust another word for nothing left to lose. You probably thought you were doing yourself\n\n01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.680\nand other people a favor. Yeah, I mean, I didn't care anymore. And I just more honest\n\n01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:02.000\nthan you had been, you felt, but you felt like that's the riveting part of this. Like,\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.320\nI feel this way so much. And like, I want to hear from people that have gone and come\n\n01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:12.160\nback. Yeah. So sorry, sorry to interrupt. But no, not at all. I mean, that's definitely\n\n01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:22.400\na sign of, you know, of not being. No, let's just call it what it is. I mean, you're depressed.\n\n01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:27.320\nIf you're not, if you lose your phone and you don't want to like immediately go to an\n\n01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:36.600\nApple store or ATT or Sprint or whomever you get your phone from. Again, if you want a\n\n01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:43.400\ngood phone at a relatively cheaper price than even offer up the 24 hour auto zone in Fontana\n\n01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:52.040\nhas all your needs mobile mechanics, Pays to grind with transgender. They got mechanics\n\n01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:57.040\nto go as you felt that feeling when you felt that very complicated layered feeling of a\n\n01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.120\nlost my phone. And for the first time in my life, I feel like actually maybe that's the\n\n01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:08.320\nway to go. I feel good. My life is there. Is there a return threshold equivalent? I'm\n\n01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:14.960\njust a screenwriter from the Sidfield school. Like, is there a picture to really be just\n\n01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:21.440\njust blunt about where I was prior to this? Did you save a cat at any point? No, that's\n\n01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.760\na screenwriting joke. Okay, continue. Sorry. No, I mean, no, no, no, sorry. I don't get\n\n01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.960\ndistracted by that. It didn't even get a laugh. So not worth it. Well, to add to that, you\n\n01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:37.240\nknow, I I'd like to think I didn't save a cat. No, you shouldn't have you shouldn't\n\n01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:41.240\nhave and that's not story structure. That's a different thing. It's a dialectic about\n\n01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:49.240\nokay. Not bad. But um, but here's the thing and believe me, man, like Bruce, do not even\n\n01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:57.600\nI don't even mean to even remotely think that I'm like, on the level of like a beautiful\n\n01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:03.040\nsoul like a Bruce Springsteen. But to be really honest, I was just so broken that I was kind\n\n01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.760\nof wandering the streets of Fontana, kind of like Bruce Springsteen in the streets of\n\n01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:14.120\nPhiladelphia video, you know, where I believe, you know, from the movie where where Tom Hanks\n\n01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:22.000\nhas AIDS and he knows he's not gonna survive that and then you you know, you're just pulling\n\n01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.600\nback from life in a way. I mean, I was just at a point where I was almost I don't I don't\n\n01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:33.800\nman, I was just at my threshold of what I could endure. But the thing is, is that having\n\n01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.040\nthe strength to enter, I want to let everyone in this room know that like, you know, I was\n\n01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:43.960\njust depressed, but never in a bazillion years would I ever no matter the level of\n\n01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:49.400\ndepression. And this is not also me passing judgment on people that that that check out\n\n01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:55.440\nand can't take it. But I still know, even in my darkest hours, what a blessing it is\n\n01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:03.680\nto be alive. And, you know, I'm very much, you know, of the opinion of if you've they\n\n01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:07.560\nsay this about successful people that when you realize something's not going right, you\n\n01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:11.520\nknow, you can abandon it quickly. And that, you know, the longer we that if you're in\n\n01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:15.680\na toxic relationship, you know, but you put a lot of time in it, you're apt to stay in\n\n01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.400\nit longer because you've already invested this time. So you don't want to lose the time\n\n01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:23.280\nyou already have. And that's why bad relationships kind of go on and on and on forever.\n\n01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:25.040\nAnd what if you feel that about your life?\n\n01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:31.160\nWell, I'll say I'll say this just for myself. And I think for everybody, I love you.\n\n01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:37.720\nYeah. And no, I know that. And I and it's, I didn't mean to shut you off on that, Jeff,\n\n01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.840\nI know that. And but I mean, to hear that from you that that that that's a heavy emotion.\n\n01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:49.920\nBut I mean, that was it was it was what this it was a really this is beyond the life changing\n\n01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:53.920\nexperience. Because I mean, I'm not saying that I was like a guy who jumped off the Golden\n\n01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:59.200\nBridge Golden Gate Bridge and like survived. And now that's the danger to me. That's the\n\n01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:04.200\nthing is that we a lot of us associate like the idea of these thoughts with I was never\n\n01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.480\never going to put a gun in your mouth, all that stuff. But like, the these decisions\n\n01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.280\ncan be made in the I know exactly the feeling that you're talking about when you're like,\n\n01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:18.280\nyou know what? What if I was a fucking ghost? What if I didn't exist? That's different from\n\n01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.680\nsaying, I'm going to take proactive action to do this dramatic thing because you're\n\n01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:29.160\nfeeling the opposite of dramatic. You're feeling worthless. You're feeling like like just like\n\n01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:39.160\nit feels in those moments like not just liberation, but like a weird medicinal kind of like, yeah,\n\n01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.720\nthis is it. This is what I need. This feels good. Totally. It's I'm not going to say no,\n\n01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:50.080\nit's not good, but I'm also going to say it's incredibly dangerous because you're alone.\n\n01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:57.920\nAnd so yeah, it was there. Was there a I mean, I mean, or have you been dragged back and\n\n01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:04.160\nwe're going to lose you again to that? Never. No, no, no, no, this. No, to be really blunt\n\n01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.440\nabout that. And that and the other thing too is that I'm not I'm not anything coming out\n\n01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.200\nmy mouth. I'm not trying to to pet myself on the back. But I mean, like, there's definitely,\n\n01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:23.800\nyou know, the fun love inside of me. But I mean, I'm, you know, I'm experienced as far\n\n01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.800\nas like that you could, you know what? No, I'm not even going to say what I was going\n\n01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.120\nto say, but I could definitely just say that, you know, like if I'm walking the streets\n\n01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:40.880\nin Fontana, you know, I mean, like, I love to to bring I live like to put positive energy\n\n01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:46.880\nout there into the world. That's that's my that that's really the only reason to live\n\n01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:53.880\nlife where I'm going with this all is that this this is really heavy. But I promise I\n\n01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.080\ndidn't take you guys this far to abandon it. But what I the point I was trying to get at\n\n01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.200\nwhen I brought up that whole thing about successful people and then knowing how to quit early,\n\n01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.400\nbut like that that really if you're following your heart and you've invested so much time\n\n01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:14.240\nin a bad relationship, you know, you want to hang in there. Well, I mean, I'm very much\n\n01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.080\nlike that in life, you know, I didn't put in these 39 years to not, you know, now I've\n\n01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:24.480\nbeen in it that I'm definitely wanting to see it all the way till 80, maybe 90, or you\n\n01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:31.800\nknow, with, yeah, head transplants, maybe 110, you know, who knows. But where I'm really\n\n01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:37.480\ngoing with all this is that it was two things. And then I promise I'll wrap this up. But\n\n01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:46.200\nit was really, I think that what our subconscious is, our subconscious do for us is sometimes\n\n01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:53.720\nincredibly protective. Because I thought that I think in a lot of ways that I don't know\n\n01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:59.360\nthis is going to sound crazy, but you know, like, I wanted to lose that phone. And I wanted\n\n01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:05.400\nto go off the grid, because I ultimately wanted to get to that place. I wanted to make a\n\n01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:11.120\nlow for myself and make that low as fast as I could, because I wanted to land. And I didn't\n\n01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:19.160\nwant to live the way that I had been living. And I just didn't, you know, and, and, and\n\n01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:25.480\nI didn't, I, I didn't want to numb the pain. That's basically all I did for like a year\n\n01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:31.680\nand a half was just numb this emotional pain, didn't grow from it. My body was just in subconscious\n\n01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:37.240\nand mind was just, you know, telling me to let go. Because one thing I completely do\n\n01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:44.240\nbelieve in is that I think and obviously if you were at 9 11 and you were with all that\n\n01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:48.840\nthe debris that was so cancerous, you're going to get cancer. But I do think sorry, sorry,\n\n01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:54.400\nthat's probably a weird time to break that to you. Oh, yeah. But that anger is a cancer.\n\n01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.000\nAnd so I really think that long story short that I needed to kind of like, you know, go\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.320\noff the grid, but my thinking was just that I was going to do this. I was going to then,\n\n01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.000\nyou know, get a couple of days sober and then just continue on my journey. It was almost\n\n01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.960\nlike wanting to get clean and like a cocoon. And so I just, and I came out and, and I had\n\n01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:21.120\nno idea what I told Jeff is true that, that, that, that basically you would go on like,\n\n01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:24.880\nyou know, Instagram and you'd see like, you know, like people would be like, Oh, Nikki\n\n01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:30.360\nsix was, you know, looking for you. And you know, when President Barack Obama was looking\n\n01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:34.960\nfor you, you know what I mean? And Rex Tillerson was looking for you. What's the connection\n\n01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:40.600\nthere? And I'm just like, I don't know. I mean, like, Rex, he was always a big fan.\n\n01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.520\nYou know, I mean, it was just like, he would be like, yo, Jess, get on the big Exxon Valdez\n\n01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:51.320\ncruise boat thing and let's party. I mean, but Rex Tillerson was looking for you. Oh\n\n01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:56.560\nman, man, it's a hacky part of me that's like pushing through this weird return threshold\n\n01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.360\nthing. I think the incredibly valuable thing is the resonance of like everybody, whether\n\n01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:04.840\nor not they drop off the grid and go to Fontana, lose their phone or not. We constantly are\n\n01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:10.360\ncombating this feeling of like, I'm a fucking ghost. I would be better focused and doing\n\n01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:17.000\na better job. It's like, it is possible to kill yourself with everyone's permission\n\n01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.840\nbecause you'd never checked with them because you didn't talk about it. You can you can\n\n01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:27.760\nslip away into shadow and you don't perceive it as shadow. I'm not. And I know that the\n\n01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:32.640\nwhole time you're like, look, I never intended to do any of this. And I am not telling you,\n\n01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:38.760\nno, you're perceived it wrong. I'm I'm saying the reason that story is so valuable is because\n\n01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:44.360\nI think everybody listening is constantly going like, well, what if I what if I what\n\n01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.120\nif I what if I and it's not always what if I did something dangerous? What if I did\n\n01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:53.480\nsomething? It's sort of just sort of like, like, like, would anyone miss me? Like, like,\n\n01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:57.840\nlike, shouldn't I just shouldn't I just be by myself? And there's a really fine line\n\n01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:08.400\nbetween that like self help and like the opposite. Yeah. And here's the thing is that I mean,\n\n02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:15.600\nI think what it really boils completely down to in the soul and the spirit of us of people\n\n02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:22.960\nis that is having hope. Hope is everything. If you have hope, hope will fuel positivity.\n\n02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:28.640\nI mean, one big lesson I learned from all of this is that mental health is the most important\n\n02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:34.800\nthing we have. And that, like your physical health, like you do have to exercise and and\n\n02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.800\nbe conscious of what you're eating, you know, mental health, I just always took it for granted\n\n02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:47.320\nbefore the last couple of years. And I realized that it's incredibly important to to be social,\n\n02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:52.840\nto not self isolate and to be with all your friends and and to live a full life and and\n\n02:00:52.840 --> 02:01:00.760\nto say yes. And just but but more than that, I mean, it's a battle out there. And there's\n\n02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:07.360\nnever been a harder time to be a human being. No scratch that statement. I can't believe\n\n02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.600\nI was about to say there was never a harder time to be a human than 2019. What am I thinking\n\n02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:18.640\ncaveman? You know, I'm going to get by a buffalo.\n\n02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.120\nLet's give it up everybody. Thank you for coming to heart.\n\n02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:28.440\nShe can't everybody. Thank you for being vulnerable sharing your before I go out on the music.\n\n02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:34.960\nI want to say, Jesse, I fucking love you. I'm a lucky man to have quality and anybody\n\n02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.280\nlistening. If you ever get the lucky break to hang out with Jesse camp, you are a fucking\n\n02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.920\nlucky human. Well, a couple of things to plug if I may. Yes.\n\n02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:53.440\nAll right. I got a to hear who here is a big salt and pepper fan. Well, yo, get this. It's\n\n02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.720\nnot a competing podcast, but I have a pepper cast. That's right. Me and pepper from salt\n\n02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:06.760\nand pepper. We are just everybody. Yeah, this has been a chance for David's dad. I mean,\n\n02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:15.000\nbut for real, maybe you're a joy to know you're a joy to be around. And I appreciate you so\n\n02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.400\nmuch to the bottom of my boots, man. Thank you all.\n\n02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.400\nTry it fast and take chance. Thank you.\n\n02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:43.400\nDid you get any of that?\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[179073]}
