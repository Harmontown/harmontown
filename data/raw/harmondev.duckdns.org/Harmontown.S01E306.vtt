WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.520
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session. How are ya? Let them hear ya at home.

00:12.520 --> 00:20.520
Make a little noise. How are ya? There we go. Uh, Jeff Davis is so, so far away. I'm

00:20.520 --> 00:49.520
here. My name is Brandon Johnson. I'll be comptrolling tonight. Let us welcome to the stage our king, our dungeon master, Spencer Crittenden. Yes. Yes, enjoy him. Enjoy him. You all know him as the mayor, the chief surveyor, Boomshaka Laka. Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:49.520 --> 01:15.520
Hello, hello, hello. It's my podcast show. Hello, hello, welcome to my podcast show. Can you hear me, though?

01:15.520 --> 01:44.520
I said no to your mama's big toe podcast show. Fuck your mama. Okay. Thought I'd try a different, I don't know about the applause, but if it was organic, you can applaud. That's fine. There was a very, I keep having an emotional flashback in my head to our last episode when I was commending David Cummings from the No Sleep podcast on his graceful, uh,

01:44.520 --> 02:13.520
delivery, uh, uh, curating of, uh, or advocating and, and, and weaving of the LGBT kind of pride week kind of thing. And actually, and there, you, I said, I said what I had to say as far as kudos. And then you were like, like, you did this. It was like, I was so embarrassed. It was like, because it, I haven't seen you in a week. And this is the first thing you say to me.

02:13.520 --> 02:25.520
I know. Well, I bet it's been a thing. I don't like walking around with secrets from you. Like I don't, I don't, you know, you would have a transparent relationship. Where's the money? Hey, let me ask you a question. Why did I embarrass you?

02:25.520 --> 02:53.520
Well, because I, you know, I, I, this is my problem. I realize it, but I always view the world. I always have a camera on me that is, uh, the property of the person that hates me the most in the world. And that, and that's how I choose to view myself. And so at this phase of my life, that's like, uh, you know, that's going to be your all righty kind of like, like I'm sick and tired of this progress culture stuff.

02:53.520 --> 03:19.520
And so for the forced like one, one, what is the sound of one man clapping kind of like, like, like, like thing. I was like, oh, they're going to love that. You know, because it's like, that's, that's their impression of it is like, that's why we're doing it. You know, that's why we're, that's why we talk about this stuff is because we want, we want our little Scooby snack. We want to make people applaud.

03:19.520 --> 03:34.520
Man, I make that camera like a old ass camera with a big tape when I see it. That's just so you know where I'm coming from. That's when I, when I hear this camera that every, that this awful voice owns, I don't make it like a nice camera.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.520
Yeah.

03:35.520 --> 03:43.520
I make it like a really shitty camera. Like before you bought it in Van Nuys, it was used for porn.

03:43.520 --> 03:55.520
This is a thing is the only it's like, this is a thing that's like endemic to the standup community. And I was a terrible standup, but I was compatible with that community in one sense, which is I think it's very like a standup mentality.

03:55.520 --> 04:23.520
It's like the guy in the back of the room that's not laughing, like he's the smart one. He knows, but, but for that reason, fuck him. And I'm going to fucking murder this room and his fucking face, you know, like it's all of this like syndrome of like you can never just like confront what's scaring you, you know, I'm like, I just like so much shame in my spinal column.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.520
It's like, it's crazy. I'm a shame driven man.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.520
No, no, no.

04:28.520 --> 04:35.520
What are you arguing with that for? I need, I need to have that be true so I can fix it. You can't. Don't tell me no.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.520
All right. I didn't know it was part of the episode.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.520
All right. Well, okay.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.520
So then we got, we got how long is this arc? And we're talking like two, three more shows.

04:43.520 --> 05:06.520
What till I'm not have no shame. It's a 49 year story. And I've been alive 45 years. So I yeah, four years is the answer to your question. It will be, I will, I will be done with this podcast and I will, I will Instagram under my new account.

05:06.520 --> 05:18.520
Hey, no shame. It'll be like hidden in the comment of a like a picture of a wine label. Cody and I own a restaurant and some island or something.

05:18.520 --> 05:24.520
I'll be like, by the way, I'm not ashamed of myself anymore. Cody's dad. Happy 70th birthday.

05:24.520 --> 05:42.520
And since the last show, Stephen Heller, if you, you can, you can trace my Instagram. You can see his, he's a photographer and spent his 70th with him and went to his sushi place and where the hell are we?

05:42.520 --> 05:49.520
Burbank? I don't know where we were. I don't know where he lives. I just follow, I just go where the Tesla tells me a guy plugged in a number.

05:49.520 --> 06:03.520
But he was telling the stories about, you know, visiting his, his other daughter. And I wrote this down because I thought it was such a great quote.

06:03.520 --> 06:10.520
It was offered so sincerely. He's telling a story about how he got, he had like, he just had kind of a wild night.

06:10.520 --> 06:23.520
And he goes like, so we go to the, we go to, we go to the, we go to the concert and then there's a bar and we're, you know, we're having a good time.

06:23.520 --> 06:30.520
I get over served.

06:30.520 --> 06:40.520
So, you know, a lot of this is, I can't over serve. Long story short, I got over served. I like that a lot.

06:40.520 --> 06:47.520
We are, we've got this CD case out, we're chopping it up and someone gives me a huge line of cocaine.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.520
I got, I got, I got, I got, I got coke getting injected.

06:51.520 --> 06:58.520
Someone blew a bunch of coke up my nose.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.520
I love it that you're kicking it with him at 70. He's in good shape for 70.

07:02.520 --> 07:07.520
He looks identical to me. People see me and him and Cody and they're like, what's going on?

07:07.520 --> 07:19.520
Like, young lady, do your uncle and your dad want to, I don't know, park the car. I don't know what the, I just, we look the same age.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.520
And that's, that's a warning shot across my bow.

07:24.520 --> 07:29.520
But it's good, good for him. There's, there's 25 years between us.

07:29.520 --> 07:36.520
I kind of want to like take the age between us and turn it into a dude and, and just talk to him.

07:36.520 --> 07:41.520
This looks kind of like lump of 25 year old Plato. Like, would he be cool? I don't know.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.520
Yeah.

07:45.520 --> 07:53.520
I can't remember because I've been pretty drunk a lot lately. I've been over served in these, in these shows a lot.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.520
So I know I've been talking about Fallout 4. I've been replaying Fallout 4.

07:57.520 --> 08:02.520
But have I talked about the Preston Garvey issue in Fallout 4?

08:02.520 --> 08:03.520
No, I don't think so.

08:03.520 --> 08:11.520
Preston Garvey is a man that you meet early in the game. He's, he belongs to, in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.

08:11.520 --> 08:21.520
He's, he's a, he's part of a, a now virtually extinct group of militia men called the Minutemen.

08:21.520 --> 08:27.520
And they're kind of like a, they, they borrow their culture from like the, the revolutionary Minutemen.

08:27.520 --> 08:33.520
And they represent like the hope for the future in this wasteland.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.520
He happens to be African-American. And yes, that is an important part of the story.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.520
Why are you looking at Spencer?

08:39.520 --> 08:43.520
Yeah, what the fuck, man?

08:43.520 --> 08:55.520
So pre, all of these characters like Fallout 4 is a very, very, I'm sure it's got lots of awards, but it really needs like special awards because it has these like the way that it handles this concept of romance.

08:55.520 --> 09:02.520
You can play as either gender, and that's not me signing off on there being two genders. Thank you very much.

09:02.520 --> 09:06.520
But according to this video game, apparently you got a salt or pepper.

09:06.520 --> 09:16.520
But, but you, you, you can, you can play as one of two genders and, and, but it doesn't, it doesn't like flip all the other genders.

09:16.520 --> 09:26.520
Like, which means that basically they're like, okay, so you might be gay in playing the game, you might be straight, you might be a man, you might be a woman, any combination of all of the above.

09:26.520 --> 09:36.520
So they had to like, they had to create these characters that you hook, you, you, you encounter, and then they're your companions and they follow you around.

09:36.520 --> 09:43.520
And then they, they will, if you, if they really get attached to you, they start, you know, they start gaining affinity for you.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.520
And then you're experiencing that through these conversations.

09:46.520 --> 09:56.520
But in these conversations, like, they had to keep in mind that this might be a man talking to a man who is not interested in male, male sex.

09:56.520 --> 10:04.520
Like, so, but on the other hand, but it might also simultaneously be a man talking to a woman, a straight woman that's playing.

10:04.520 --> 10:11.520
That's like really like, hello, sugar, sugar man, like, like when she, when she sees this guy the first time, you know, yes.

10:11.520 --> 10:25.520
Like, and it's just, it's kind of, it's really this masterpiece, because I'm looking at this 45 year old man I'm replaying Fallout 4 and I'm like, you know, these female characters that they go like, oh, it's me, my name's Piper, and I'm a journalist.

10:25.520 --> 10:40.520
And I'm like, I majored in journalism and like, hey, and it kind of like automatically like locked into this thing of like, like, like every time she goes like, hey, can I tell you something about my backstory and all this stuff?

10:40.520 --> 10:47.520
And then there will be a button that says flirt, and then it'll build to a button that says romance.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.520
Wow.

10:48.520 --> 10:57.520
So you can play it however you want, but I just think the most interesting thing is because I started playing the game long enough that now all the guys are doing this too.

10:57.520 --> 11:12.520
So here's the just the amazing thing about that I'm learning about sexual projection is that the women characters, when they say, hey, can I talk to you about something for a second?

11:12.520 --> 11:27.520
You know, we've been traveling for a long time, and I never knew how to trust anybody, but you're really like traveling with you has really made me realize I need to get over my defense mechanisms and trust people.

11:27.520 --> 11:32.520
And I just wanted to let you know, I really, I really trust you and you're really special to me.

11:32.520 --> 11:42.520
And like, when it's a woman, and then there's the button that comes up that says flirt, so you retroactively go, oh, she's hitting on me.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.520
That's what I do.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
I don't know why I'm saying you.

11:44.520 --> 12:02.520
Sometimes I like I like I got and then but then when when when it's a guy and he goes like, hey, could I talk to you for a second? You know, when I first met you, I wasn't sure I thought you were a tub of guts, but the universal brotherhood of steel needs everything they've gotten.

12:02.520 --> 12:07.520
I just got to say you've given this old tin can soldier a new Lisa in life.

12:07.520 --> 12:13.520
And then and then what and then the flirt button comes up and you're like, whoa.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
It's really fascinating.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.520
It's like an actual kind of an educational tool because it's like they had this.

12:18.520 --> 12:29.520
I mean, because the game isn't the game is simply saying, these are people who are growing fond of you and then it's up to you to project on to it any way you want.

12:29.520 --> 12:46.520
And the and and I am ashamed to say as a as a modern liberal this video game with that I still I haven't I haven't I haven't gone there with a dude yet and yet I have been so unfaithful in all of the female relationships.

12:46.520 --> 12:58.520
I just keep I just keep like I'll max them out until I get all their combat bonuses and then I'll assign them to a supply line with cattle or something are all like I'll put them in a field because I'm like, well, I got their combat bonuses.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.520
And now I'm now I'm with now I'm with what's your name.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.520
And and like, so there's no shame about that.

13:04.520 --> 13:11.520
There was a little bit of there was there was a little bit of difficulty with it, but clearly I got over it.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.520
But I will not.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.520
I still won't fucking do it.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
No one's watching me.

13:15.520 --> 13:21.520
I know I know the game isn't going to punish me or reward me in any particular way.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.520
It's not going to make my character gay and like change my weapons.

13:26.520 --> 13:33.520
It's it's it's I know that the only thing that's going to happen is the conclusion of a fucking like algorithm.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.520
And I still don't do it.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.520
Shame on me.

13:36.520 --> 13:41.520
I should be fucking everyone in the apocalyptic wasteland.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.520
So you might have more value value in that community.

13:45.520 --> 13:53.520
You might rise to a king because you met a dude and you guys fell in love because the way you set your shit up, you got to be the president.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.520
It would be a man. So here's this is why I brought this up.

13:56.520 --> 14:01.520
So this is why it's important that Preston Garvey is African American.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
Right.

14:02.520 --> 14:10.520
So Preston Garvey is one of these male characters who the so his is particularly it's it's legitimately like it's it's great.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.520
Like he he when he gets to the peak where it's time to either hit romance or not.

14:15.520 --> 14:19.520
He says, hey, can I talk to you about something?

14:19.520 --> 14:21.520
You know, something I know.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.520
How he sounds.

14:23.520 --> 14:30.520
You know, what do you want me to do?

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
He's not he doesn't have big headphones on and roller skates.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
He's not like, hey.

14:35.520 --> 14:41.520
I mean, you earlier did say something about confronting your fears on stage and we cool.

14:41.520 --> 14:52.520
This guy, this guy, he's he sounds like you. He's he's he's an unmistakably black man.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.520
But there's no impression to do of him.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.520
He's not like, oh, I'm an Italian chef.

14:57.520 --> 15:03.520
You know, like, and you're not like, yo, blood, like, you're Brandon.

15:03.520 --> 15:10.520
I don't think I don't think, you know, I'm not like, like, and so he's he's a gentleman.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.520
He likes to dress up.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.520
I don't mean to derail you.

15:15.520 --> 15:23.520
And he's deep. He's a deep thinker and he's an emotionally available friend.

15:23.520 --> 15:30.520
And so he comes up to you when you're playing this game, when you get up to the peak levels with him and he's been

15:30.520 --> 15:35.520
what he says is he goes, can I tell you something?

15:35.520 --> 15:41.520
Well, you know, I already told you about how, you know, it's really important that you.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
Fuck, I'm sorry.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.520
It's important that he has this like even keel because it's a voice actor reading a script into a microphone.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.520
So that's what's also creepy about it is that he's not.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.520
There is no like hemming and hawing about it.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
It's just like reading.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.520
It's like saying these things.

15:54.520 --> 16:01.520
I already told you about how when I first met you, I wasn't sure you were a natural leader and then I was inspired by you.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.520
But there's one more thing I haven't told you.

16:04.520 --> 16:11.520
Before I met you, I lost so much hope that I wasn't sure if I wanted to live anymore.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.520
I often thought about ending it all.

16:14.520 --> 16:19.520
I've never told anyone that before, but I thought about ending it all, all the time.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.520
And just before I met you, I was really thinking about ending it all and I really wanted to let you know that.

16:24.520 --> 16:30.520
And then you have four buttons and one says like flirt.

16:30.520 --> 16:36.520
Like, I don't know, like I won't even save my place and just see what that is.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.520
Like, is it, is it?

16:38.520 --> 16:44.520
Do you go like, well, if you ended it all, that would mean a couple less drinks on me.

16:44.520 --> 16:51.520
I don't know what that button is, but then one is like, hey, let's keep this professional or something like that.

16:51.520 --> 16:58.520
And then one is like the one I would hit in real life, which is like, thank you for being honest with me.

16:58.520 --> 17:05.520
I appreciate how hard that must be because what you're telling me is you can't tell anybody about this.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
So thank you.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.520
So that's like, that's penultimate.

17:08.520 --> 17:13.520
So then what happens is with these characters, if you, it turns out if you don't friend zone them,

17:13.520 --> 17:19.520
if you don't actively friend zone them with the B button, if you don't, there's a button that basically says like,

17:19.520 --> 17:28.520
keep fucking chill, like, keep it, keep it above the belt and like rock on. And I won't press that either.

17:28.520 --> 17:33.520
So not only am I homophobic, I'm also like a crazy like codependent hunter.

17:33.520 --> 17:43.520
Like I, like I just farm these guys that are like, when I walk through my settlement, these men who are all,

17:43.520 --> 17:48.520
these men are all saying like, hey, can we talk now?

17:48.520 --> 17:54.520
And, and, and I'll get, I'll get cornered by them and I'll go, uh-huh.

17:54.520 --> 18:00.520
And then, and then Preston's like his whole thing is he goes like, he keeps, he keeps doing it's on a loop now.

18:00.520 --> 18:07.520
And here's the thing, it's like, okay, he's first, now he's African American, he's dressed like a revolutionary soldier

18:07.520 --> 18:12.520
and through no selection of my own, he is working on crops.

18:12.520 --> 18:20.520
Like he, like that's the default that happens. So he's a black man dressed like 1700 soldier in a tricorner hat,

18:20.520 --> 18:27.520
digging in dirt, who when I walk by, he pops out of bushes that he's like cultivating and goes like,

18:27.520 --> 18:30.520
now is a good time for that talk.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.520
And I go, maybe he's asking you to help him out.

18:33.520 --> 18:39.520
And one of the, well, I always, I stop and I go, because, and one of the buttons is like, I thought we already talked about this.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.520
I swear that one of the buttons is like, we taught, we, I already, I already heard you.

18:43.520 --> 18:51.520
And when you press that, he says, okay, cool, because I just never told anybody that before.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.520
And then, and then one of the buttons says romance.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.520
So you, and then one of the buttons says, keep it professional.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.520
And I never press it.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.520
And then one of the buttons says, thank you for sharing.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
Then I keep pressing it.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.520
What am I doing?

19:08.520 --> 19:11.520
And why don't I assign him to a different job?

19:11.520 --> 19:13.520
It's uncomfortable.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.520
Or put him in a different outfit.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.520
Dress him as a space man at least.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.520
Like it's, it's a weird mind fuck.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.520
There's also, there's other guys.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.520
There's guys that are like George Clooney's and like, like armor.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.520
And like, like, I don't know if the, I don't know if the robots eventually come on to you.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.520
But, but, and then again, the point is they don't come on to you.

19:32.520 --> 19:37.520
They might, they're designed to just say, I have, I trust you.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.520
And okay, that's it.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.520
So anyways, there's just a lot of shit going on.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.520
I want you to rescue this dude because he had to work for the military.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.520
And he has some beans that he's growing with his hands.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.520
Maybe listen to him next time and see what he does.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.520
I listen to him every time.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
I'm trying to tell you, I listen to him every time.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.520
I'm caught in this crazy fucking hamster wheel.

19:57.520 --> 20:02.520
Like maybe what if that's, well, if we're just seeing a low five version of the simulation that is real life.

20:02.520 --> 20:06.520
What if my relationship with these people is like, is that like,

20:06.520 --> 20:10.520
I keep hitting the A button on like, well, do you need approval?

20:10.520 --> 20:12.520
Or do you want to be yourself?

20:12.520 --> 20:15.520
And then I keep hitting this like this middle line option where I'm like,

20:15.520 --> 20:17.520
I appreciate you coming to the show.

20:17.520 --> 20:21.520
And then they keep hitting this button that's like, man, I'm a big fan of yours.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.520
And we're just like, we're never going to like keep it professional.

20:26.520 --> 20:31.520
Nor are we going to flirt, you know, like we're not going to like max our combat bonuses.

20:31.520 --> 20:41.520
Anyways, I, yeah, I really enjoying my fall out for fucking, that's a rich game.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
It's a real good game.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.520
The settlement aspect, like, like, like you got to check it out.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
That's for a different episode.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.520
I'll be talking about fall out for the next six episodes.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.520
And what is this new show?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.520
The new show.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.520
Yeah.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
What are you watching?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
Maniac.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
Yeah.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
Maniac.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
I like it.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.520
Yeah, I got, I got, I like it too.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
She's great.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
Oh, she's so good.

21:04.520 --> 21:08.520
I know, is that, is there, we say she's an italics, like, like there's like a little

21:08.520 --> 21:14.520
subtext there that if Jonah Hill's listening, he's like, like, yeah, she's amazing.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.520
I just figured, you know, we'll start off with her first.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.520
We'll give her her props first.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
We'll work our way to Jonah Hill.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
Calm down, Jonah Hill.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.520
It is just, I love, I love, I like the construction of the show.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.520
Like I'm a very jaded TV viewer.

21:26.520 --> 21:33.520
I don't, you know, like, you know, like, but I really, I'm really glad I stuck with it.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.520
Yeah.

21:34.520 --> 21:41.520
And I'm not done with it yet, but I like, yeah, I like, I like the very, very unique combination

21:41.520 --> 21:47.520
of giving you what you maybe didn't know you wanted while at the same time continually

21:47.520 --> 21:48.520
going lateral.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.520
So there's like, like stuff that's just, oh, I'm always lateral.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.520
I'm going lateral.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.520
I'm also so lateral, it's predictable where it's like, like, like just sort of like,

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
yeah, I get it.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.520
You hate people, you know, and then there's stuff that's like, oh, I'm Charles Schultz.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.520
I'm going to make you love like yours to your heart.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.520
And, and like, you're like, okay, yeah, I can see your pattern there.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.520
But like, I like, I like this nice blend here.

22:08.520 --> 22:16.520
Like this isn't, I don't, I don't feel like I'm in the hands of amateurs or old stodgy

22:16.520 --> 22:19.520
foggy bottoms when I watch the show.

22:19.520 --> 22:22.520
And I feel like I feel like I feel like it's a, yeah.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.520
I like the stuff that they're doing.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.520
It stays outwitting.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.520
Yeah.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.520
There was a point where I said, okay, I really like the show now.

22:30.520 --> 22:34.520
And it wasn't like at a point where anything got revealed, it was just sort of like, it

22:34.520 --> 22:41.520
was like right at the top of the episode where now they're into the second like iteration

22:41.520 --> 22:43.520
of them having different lives.

22:43.520 --> 22:46.520
And he's like a magician that's like anything.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.520
And then it wasn't, it wasn't that yet, because previously in a jaded way, I said, so what

22:51.520 --> 22:53.520
is this show just going to do this now?

22:53.520 --> 22:55.520
Every week, different life.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.520
And not really asking myself what I like that or not.

22:58.520 --> 23:02.520
And then when I really started giving it to me and I was like, okay, I like it.

23:02.520 --> 23:07.520
But also more importantly that they came out and they were showing the computer people

23:07.520 --> 23:12.520
and then what the computer people were saying and how the attention that they're paying

23:12.520 --> 23:15.520
to the logic of the sci-fi is really important to me.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.520
Yeah.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
Yeah.

23:17.520 --> 23:20.520
And there's a lot of like thought about psychology.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.520
That's not just as simple as like, I'm Tyler Durden.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.520
I'm like, I represent your fucking booyah side.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
You know.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.520
Incredible.

23:28.520 --> 23:34.520
There's like clearly a lot of thought going into like, what is that?

23:34.520 --> 23:39.520
Like you really like, like, oh, the difference between her and him on a fundamental level

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
and stuff.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.520
Yeah.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.520
Okay.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.520
I've made our guests wait long enough.

23:44.520 --> 23:49.520
He, I met him at my neighbor Beth's house.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.520
Her son Timmer.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.520
Boy, there's a lot of backstory here that's just like, you wouldn't even know.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.520
So Dan had this tree, right?

23:55.520 --> 23:56.520
Yeah.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.520
I had this tree that had to get cut down.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
Great episode.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
Classic Harmontown.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.520
Right.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.520
I mean, amazing episode.

24:04.520 --> 24:12.520
My neighbor Beth and her, you might remember her kid as the nutty kid who always did the

24:12.520 --> 24:14.520
Haunted House every year, the Haunted Maze.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.520
So, you know, kids grow up fast.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.520
They've been doing this shit for a long time.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.520
So he's like 40 now.

24:22.520 --> 24:28.520
And he made, he made a short film and like all this stuff like, like, so I was, I was just

24:28.520 --> 24:32.520
at their house at a barbecue and I met this guy and he told me about his YouTube thing.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.520
And I was like, you should come on the show and plug that anyways.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.520
Let's talk to him about it instead of me explaining it to you.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.520
Please welcome my new friend Omar Camacho.

24:40.520 --> 24:58.520
I did a little fist bump.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.520
Okay.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.520
Yo.

25:03.520 --> 25:07.520
Omar, Omar is a star.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.520
Omar is a star.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.520
Omar is a star of a YouTube series.

25:12.520 --> 25:16.520
It's hard to do this terminology now because, okay, so you got your YouTube and then you

25:16.520 --> 25:20.520
got your YouTube channels, like there's these people that have a channel called Me Too.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.520
Right.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.520
Not to be confused with hashtag Me Too.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
No, no, no.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
This is Me Too.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Yeah.

25:26.520 --> 25:30.520
Am I with a slanty instead of a dot?

25:30.520 --> 25:32.520
It's the you, I think.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
Oh, is it?

25:33.520 --> 25:34.520
Yeah.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.520
Oh, you think?

25:35.520 --> 25:36.520
It makes me feel better that you don't know.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.520
No, yeah, yeah.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.520
It's in the green room chilling right now, you know what I mean?

25:40.520 --> 25:42.520
It could be the I, it could be the you.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
It could be I or you.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.520
I don't know.

25:44.520 --> 25:48.520
I just, I'm a white guy and I see the little accents that you have to hold an iPhone button

25:48.520 --> 25:49.520
down longer to get.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
Right.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
And I'm just like, that's Gandalf shit.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.520
I don't even know.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.520
I know the name of one, which is a tilde, right?

25:56.520 --> 25:57.520
And that's what makes you.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.520
Tilde, yeah, yeah.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.520
You're right about that.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.520
You know what's up, man?

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
I know that's a little more Mexican than I am, you see.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.520
The tilde you hit it in Fallout 4, if you want to do console commands, you want to like,

26:06.520 --> 26:12.520
you can use it to raise the graphic budget of your settlements.

26:12.520 --> 26:22.520
Oh, anyways, but so you do, so me too does this, they do all kinds of shit.

26:22.520 --> 26:26.520
And one of the things they do is a recurring like series.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.520
Cholo's try.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.520
Yeah, definitely, man.

26:28.520 --> 26:32.520
It's a, you know, it's just something that they put together real quick on the, on the

26:32.520 --> 26:33.520
fly.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.520
I think, you know, because it just happens so divinely that, you know, we've got, it got

26:35.520 --> 26:40.520
all this recognition, you know, because we want to see Cholo's try stuff.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.520
And sorry, I don't want to get too familiar with that word because that's the one thing

26:42.520 --> 26:43.520
I wanted to ask you.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.520
All right.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.520
First, let's define Cholo.

26:45.520 --> 26:50.520
I looked it up in the, on the phone on the way here and I knew that I would see one definition

26:50.520 --> 26:55.520
that I kind of would have guessed because just my white guilt kind of like that it's sort

26:55.520 --> 27:01.520
of like a, there's a definition that's sort of like a derogatory, whatever, like kind of

27:01.520 --> 27:04.520
the definition that I would have guessed maybe.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
Right, right, right.

27:05.520 --> 27:10.520
But then there was the one that, then there was all this shit about mestizo, like, like,

27:10.520 --> 27:13.520
like people with different blood and all this stuff.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.520
There's like a lot of,

27:14.520 --> 27:15.520
It goes deep, man.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.520
It goes very, very deep, man.

27:17.520 --> 27:22.520
But now, I mean, nowadays in modern era, you know, it gets a misrepresented, you know,

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
as a negative thing.

27:23.520 --> 27:28.520
So that's what, you know, the, the media, you know, profiles, what a gangster is a Cholo,

27:28.520 --> 27:29.520
you know what I'm saying?

27:29.520 --> 27:33.520
And as long as it's a title of your show, I can use it in that context.

27:33.520 --> 27:38.520
But if I were, I'd have to be a very trusted white guy in a bar to like, to like refer

27:38.520 --> 27:44.520
to somebody in the third person as Cholo, like, like, like in front of someone of Mexican

27:44.520 --> 27:47.520
descent, like they would be like, they would bristle.

27:47.520 --> 27:48.520
Why are you using that word?

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
I'm a fucking mechanic, bro.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.520
What the hell are you talking about, though?

27:51.520 --> 27:54.520
Like, like, because it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not an innocent phrase.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.520
It's like, it's, it's got like,

27:56.520 --> 27:59.520
Yeah, it's not, it gets thrown out a lot, you know what I mean?

27:59.520 --> 28:03.520
But, but then there's the traditional kind of like taking it, taking it back.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.520
I actually wanted to read the definitions of that.

28:05.520 --> 28:10.520
I mean, what it is, what, you know, what we all know it for nowadays is, you know,

28:10.520 --> 28:11.520
thug-ass homie in the hood.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.520
Thug-ass homie in the hood.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.520
Yeah.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
That's the one that I would have guessed.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.520
It's an informal offensive, a lower class Mexican, especially in an urban area.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
There.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.520
Wow.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.520
Yeah.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.520
Pretty easy.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.520
Fuck the Webster dictionary.

28:24.520 --> 28:29.520
Shit, I'm gonna have to holler at him.

28:29.520 --> 28:37.520
Before that, though, it says a Latin American with Indian blood semicolon a mestizo.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.520
And I was like, what?

28:38.520 --> 28:39.520
Right.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.520
Okay.

28:40.520 --> 28:46.520
And then US, a teenage boy, especially in a Mexican-American community who is a member of a street gang.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.520
Yeah, well, yeah, you know, that's what it is.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.520
You know, but what is a 16-year-old boy?

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
It's a teenage boy.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
Oh, shit.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.520
One full-star gang bangin' at eight years old, man.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.520
Well, yeah.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.520
I think, well, if you're, you know, if you're really thugged up, eight's the new 13.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.520
Yeah, it is, man.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
Yeah, it is, man.

29:03.520 --> 29:09.520
You get those, you get those, those quinceanera tattoos.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.520
I fake it till you make it, Harmon.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.520
Speaking of which...

29:14.520 --> 29:15.520
Pressant tattoos.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.520
So, how much of a cholo, like, like, how much do you, do you gleefully self-apply that?

29:19.520 --> 29:24.520
And how much are you, like, I'm an actor and I want to own my, I don't want to be, like,

29:24.520 --> 29:31.520
a sell-out and, like, say, please absorb me up, you know, like, like, what's your relationship

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
with that word?

29:32.520 --> 29:36.520
Well, it's a trip, man, because right now, how I feel about it, it's ironic that, you know,

29:36.520 --> 29:41.520
it's, it's kind of fucked up sometimes that you get typecasted in the industry, you know what I'm

29:41.520 --> 29:45.520
saying, to play this thug role, cholo or prisoner or whatever, you know what I mean?

29:45.520 --> 29:49.520
So, the media perceives us as that, you know, and that's, a lot of the times we get those

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
roles.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.520
Yeah.

29:51.520 --> 29:55.520
But before me jumping into the industry, before I got exposed to, like, you know, doing

29:55.520 --> 29:59.520
extra stuff and then, you know, lead roles and some small shit and feature shit or whatever,

29:59.520 --> 30:02.520
you know, I grew up in the ghetto, man.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.520
I grew up in the hood, man.

30:03.520 --> 30:04.520
I'm from East LA.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.520
I was raised in South Central and I grew up in Compton, man.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.520
So, it's like, I got, I got all of that shit at an early age.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.520
I used to tag and shit, you know what I mean?

30:12.520 --> 30:17.520
Your friends, you're, if you, if you, if you YouTube cholos try and watch this guy, this,

30:17.520 --> 30:22.520
this guy is the, he's the Paul Rudd of the cholos, like, like, in the, in that you are

30:22.520 --> 30:24.520
not covered with, like, very intimidating.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.520
I assume prison tattoos with scar, with scar in prison.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.520
Yeah.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.520
I mean, I don't know, to be honest with you.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.520
That's fucking loyalty right there.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.520
I'll let him tell you that shit.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.520
Was your friend ever in jail?

30:38.520 --> 30:39.520
I don't know, man.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.520
I don't even know if that dude is my friend, officer.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.520
I'll be honest with you.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.520
I thought that was a lady.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.520
Was it a dude right there?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.520
I don't speak English.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.520
I don't know nothing.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.520
Cus.

30:53.520 --> 30:59.520
One of the, one of the cholos, again, using that phrase in the context it's provided,

30:59.520 --> 31:02.520
not, not like I'm all excited to call people, to dehumanize people.

31:02.520 --> 31:09.020
One of the cholos from cholos try is this guy, Scar, who has a fucking Omar from the

31:09.020 --> 31:13.520
wire scar going down, but not, well, Omar's thing is, like, more fucked.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.520
Like, this is, is that real?

31:15.520 --> 31:16.520
Cus it looks cinematic.

31:16.520 --> 31:20.520
It looks like a lion tried to kill him with its middle finger.

31:20.520 --> 31:21.520
Yeah, well, basically that's what-

31:21.520 --> 31:23.520
And he closed his eyes at just the right time.

31:23.520 --> 31:27.720
So he has, like, a fucking thing going down his forehead that continues in a slightly

31:27.720 --> 31:29.020
offset way down his cheek.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.520
Does he have a story for that scar?

31:31.520 --> 31:36.520
Other than being a big fan of the Lion King as a, that I know, you know, that's the homie.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.520
You know, that's my boy.

31:37.520 --> 31:41.020
And it's a tat, you know, a lot of people do think it's something that's for reals,

31:41.020 --> 31:42.520
for reals, but it's a, it's a tat.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.520
Oh, it's a tat too.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.520
Yeah, the homie will tell you.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.520
Ah, fucking Scar, come on.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.520
Yeah, but you know, from what the homie has ever told me, like, cause I've asked him,

31:49.520 --> 31:54.520
you know, and I'm like, yeah, fool, you know, something about the Lion King, you know, Scar,

31:54.520 --> 31:57.520
the uncle and shit, y'all know what's up with that movie back in the day?

31:57.520 --> 31:58.520
It's like the uncle.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.520
Yeah, yeah.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.520
You know what I mean?

32:00.520 --> 32:03.520
I don't know, I guess he liked the name and I guess he liked the Scar right there and

32:03.520 --> 32:05.520
then, you know, he went all out with it.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.520
Damn.

32:06.520 --> 32:12.520
And then he got me impugning a cholo's, a cholo ship.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.520
I'm like, wait, that's a tattoo.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
Oh, what a poser.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.520
Hey, but you.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.520
Hey.

32:17.520 --> 32:24.520
No, I mean, the other guy, what is it with the, the, cause, can you, so you really can't

32:24.520 --> 32:25.520
answer that?

32:25.520 --> 32:29.520
Cause I, I thought, I thought there was, I thought something that you guys, one of you

32:29.520 --> 32:34.520
guys said in one of the things that I saw, someone referred, otherwise I wouldn't cause

32:34.520 --> 32:40.520
I'd be afraid to be offensive to do it, that someone referred to his tats and the other,

32:40.520 --> 32:45.520
and one of the other guys as prison tattoos, that they were, that they were prison tattoos.

32:45.520 --> 32:49.520
Nah, another thing the homie told me, he said he was eating pineapple.

32:49.520 --> 32:52.520
That's all I got that time.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.520
You know, pineapple.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.520
He was trying to throw a little zinger out there.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
You know what I'm saying?

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
So I get it, fool.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.520
You're eating some raunchy shit.

33:00.520 --> 33:05.520
So you guys are like actors who are like bunched together by a YouTube producer who's like,

33:05.520 --> 33:08.520
here, like now watch Mean Girls and tell us what you think.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.520
Like they're not, you're not like, Hey, it's good to see you again.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:12.520 --> 33:17.520
It was basically something that was just, you know, I guess plight it on for like a week

33:17.520 --> 33:18.520
or something.

33:18.520 --> 33:19.520
I don't know.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.520
Cause I got hit up with that shit last minute.

33:20.520 --> 33:25.520
Some of the things that the Cholos try on Cholos try hipster fashion, which I thought

33:25.520 --> 33:29.520
was really interesting because, because it was like, well, I thought it was interesting.

33:29.520 --> 33:35.520
It was when you guys making that gas face, like based on like certain shit that I couldn't

33:35.520 --> 33:38.520
like, cause fashion in general, I can't, I'm like, what?

33:38.520 --> 33:44.520
Like, like, and so like, like seeing a guy who's like, who's like comfort zone is like

33:44.520 --> 33:48.520
with the button, the top button thing with the, you know, the flannel.

33:48.520 --> 33:53.520
And then, and then you put that guy in a pretty much the same shirt, but all the buttons and

33:53.520 --> 33:56.520
the sleeves are short and he's like, well, I feel like a point dexter.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.520
And I'm like, yeah, man.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.520
Like you look, you already look like a point dexter to me that I thought that I always thought

34:02.520 --> 34:04.520
that was part of like the whole threat.

34:04.520 --> 34:08.520
Like you see like a, like when you see a dude and he's got the sandals and socks and the

34:08.520 --> 34:13.520
socks are all the way up and you look normal with that on it.

34:13.520 --> 34:19.520
Is there anything to like, like the Cholo culture is fucking dumb.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.520
I feel so dumb saying that phrase.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.020
Could you confirm a suspicion that I've had since moving to LA where it's like some of

34:26.020 --> 34:31.520
that stuff is like, I dare you to fucking like think less of me like, like, like do it.

34:31.520 --> 34:36.520
Like, I guess I could say like any urban like fashion choices, like where it's like, whether

34:36.520 --> 34:41.020
it's like a price tag hanging off of things or like something like, like, like doing things

34:41.020 --> 34:47.520
wrong on purpose as like a red flag to a, to, to, to a, to a white bull.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.020
Like, like, like, why don't you come, come, come at me kind of thing.

34:51.020 --> 34:56.020
Like, please make the mistake of like, of, of, of saying that I shouldn't be wearing this

34:56.020 --> 34:57.520
after Labor Day.

34:57.520 --> 35:01.520
Well, no, I mean, for me personally, as long as you ain't fucking with me, you don't pose

35:01.520 --> 35:03.020
no threat to me wearing that kind of shit.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.520
You could have wear whatever the fuck you want.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.520
You know what I mean?

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
Just don't catch me wearing that shit.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.520
I don't wear that tight stuff, man.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
I don't know.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.520
I got a breeze, man.

35:09.520 --> 35:15.020
And literally when I fucking tried that stuff on bro, literally I felt like kicking my own

35:15.020 --> 35:16.520
ass down.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.520
I swear to God dude.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.520
There was some stuff where I was like, okay, I can see how you're uncomfortable with that

35:21.520 --> 35:22.520
other stuff.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.520
I was like, to me, that looks pretty much the same.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.520
Like it is just a different kind of t-shirt.

35:26.520 --> 35:30.520
And then like, like, but you can't really fucking nobody for what they wearing, you know

35:30.520 --> 35:31.520
what I'm saying?

35:31.520 --> 35:33.520
Catch a felony for that shit.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.520
But you know, shit.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.520
I mean, I just fuck kind of trend you gone.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
Like, you know what I'm saying?

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
Like I'm from, I'm an 80s baby.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.520
You know what I mean?

35:41.520 --> 35:43.520
So I grew up in the late 80s and the 90s.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.520
You know what I'm saying?

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
2000.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.520
So I always wear that 501 shit, you know what I'm saying?

35:47.520 --> 35:49.520
Black, white, solid tee, white tee, whatever.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
You know what I'm saying?

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
Dickies and all that shit.

35:51.520 --> 35:55.520
But I feel like these dudes adopted some of that from us.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
You know what I mean?

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
Because you know, with the flannels.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.520
You know what I mean?

35:58.520 --> 35:59.520
These dudes wear flannels.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
It's just for these cats.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
I don't know.

36:01.520 --> 36:05.520
Maybe they ain't fluffy like me, man, but they, they got some, they always wear that shit

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
tight dude.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.520
It's like, can you even bend?

36:07.520 --> 36:10.520
Can you climb up a stair or something when you, you know what I'm saying?

36:10.520 --> 36:12.520
With that tight ass shit on, you know?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.520
They tough them on the bottom.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.520
I don't know.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.520
I think that I'm saying like underneath this, I am all sinew and muscle.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.520
Like I'm, I, I, I need to keep warm.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.520
Yeah.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.520
Well, you try to be a machista with that shit on homie.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.520
You in the wrong city though.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.520
Yeah.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
Childless.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.520
You guys, the Cholos try hipster fashion.

36:32.520 --> 36:37.520
We watched Mean Girls, which was really just a couple of dudes watching Mean Girls and

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
getting it.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.520
Like it was just like, oh, okay.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
Yeah.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.520
She's now, now she's realizing that it's not about that.

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
It's about this.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.520
Okay.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
Got you.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.520
My honey man made me watch that shit after she saw the episode.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.520
And I was like, nah, I'm good.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.520
I just saw little pieces of it, but I'm gonna be real, man.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.520
I like that shit.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.520
She was tired.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.520
What, what is your favorite part of that?

36:56.520 --> 37:02.520
Well, basically the fact that the chick is from Africa, right?

37:02.520 --> 37:08.520
And she comes over just that my favorite part was the, the, the, the food fight.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.520
Okay.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.520
You know what I'm saying?

37:10.520 --> 37:12.520
It reminded me a lot of, a lot of back in high school, man.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.520
I started a couple of food fights and shit.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.520
Like a plan through a couple of chicken patties and shit at somebody.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.520
So that was cool.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.520
We brought back flashbacks and I liked that it was cool.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.520
You know, it had a cool little twist to it.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.520
So, you know, I'm a big movie buff too.

37:24.520 --> 37:29.520
So I'm not going to shy from, you know, watching some shit just because it's a chick flick.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.520
My chick watch wants to watch it.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.520
Hey, blaze out.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.520
Let's Netflix and chill and shit.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.520
Yeah, man.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
Movies are moving.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
Yeah.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.520
Like, yeah.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.520
Like, yeah.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.520
All right.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.520
Well, I'll put a pin in that.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.520
I want to get back to that.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.520
Like Dan's playing that business.

37:44.520 --> 37:49.520
But, but I was like, you guys surf, you golf, you ballroom dance.

37:49.520 --> 37:53.520
But the stuff that's got more interesting is like the stuff that's not so it's like,

37:53.520 --> 37:56.520
like you, you watch Speedy Gonzalez.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.520
Oh, that's like the most racist shit ever.

37:59.520 --> 38:05.520
At the top of it, like what is just so funny when somebody says the most obvious thing,

38:05.520 --> 38:09.520
but it's like takes on such charisma as I can't remember which guy it is, but it's like in

38:09.520 --> 38:13.520
the intro to the video, it's like, we're going to watch Speedy Gonzalez.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.520
I used to watch it when I was a kid.

38:16.520 --> 38:21.520
Speedy was, Speedy was, he was my homie.

38:21.520 --> 38:28.520
But now I'm an adult and I know what racism is.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.520
So it might be different.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
I don't know.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.520
I haven't, I haven't watched it in a while.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.520
Let's check it out.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.520
And then it's just as you would predict.

38:35.520 --> 38:40.520
But then it's, are they still making that movie or is that, is that just kibosh?

38:40.520 --> 38:43.520
Do we know if they're still making a Speedy Gonzalez movie?

38:43.520 --> 38:47.520
I'm going to have to update on that one, man, because I'm really curious to see what they come out with.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.520
And you know, you know how it is in the game, man.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.520
You know, you hear about it, you know, way in advance.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.520
So I don't know if it might be a next year thing or, or even how true to the fact that it is.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.520
It's just we came across it and, you know, that's what it was.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.520
We were like, let's review this shit.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.520
Well, in that simple thing, it's just like, oh, we watched Speedy Gonzalez.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.520
Let me comment on it. It's the YouTube video.

39:05.520 --> 39:13.520
But it's like the place where it's left is the same place that after maybe two years of me trying to be woke and like figure shit out,

39:13.520 --> 39:19.520
like as a writer, as a TV writer who has influence over people, my many hit shows.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.520
Of course, yeah.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.520
Like, like, there's a constant pressure on me.

39:23.520 --> 39:27.520
Like, Harmon, get your brain right. You're affecting like so many people.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.520
Waking up looking like doc and shit on Back to the Future, huh?

39:30.520 --> 39:32.520
Like, what the fuck is going on?

39:32.520 --> 39:36.520
And I want to decode the same stuff that you end up talking about in the end, right?

39:36.520 --> 39:38.520
In the end is like, you watch a bunch of clubs of Speedy Gonzalez.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.520
He's going to Arriva, Arriva.

39:40.520 --> 39:44.520
What one person notes that we've, we've, we never sing the Cucaracha for anything.

39:44.520 --> 39:49.520
There's no, there's no occasion. There's no, it's his boy.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.520
This boy is like lazy. It's not, it's not just Speedy.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.520
It's that they made slow, slow, slow.

39:55.520 --> 40:01.520
No, the thing is with all of these like things, but so like, and then in the end of it, it's like,

40:01.520 --> 40:04.520
you're like, if they make the movie, I think it's you saying this.

40:04.520 --> 40:09.520
You're like, if they make the movie, look, you know, like, I'm not saying don't make the movie,

40:09.520 --> 40:12.520
but like, you should probably involve some Mexican people.

40:12.520 --> 40:17.520
Oh, the stuff which is like, we all have this like, kind of, we're coming around to this wisdom,

40:17.520 --> 40:20.520
but it's like, this is this thing, like, you don't have to have any answer to this either,

40:20.520 --> 40:25.520
because I think this is what we keep struggling with is, we have this like, like, we're like,

40:25.520 --> 40:32.520
we use this word culture, and then so then half the time we're like, we treat culture like it's like

40:32.520 --> 40:38.520
a butterfly in a museum or something or like, like, like, oh my God, this thing's going to die out

40:38.520 --> 40:40.520
or you got to stay true to this thing and all this stuff.

40:40.520 --> 40:45.520
But then like, you could be a villain and stay true to your culture, like, like, like,

40:45.520 --> 40:51.520
which is exhibited by you, you know, this show saying like, you know, like, well, let's go skydiving.

40:51.520 --> 40:56.520
Like, it doesn't mean that only white people skydive, and it doesn't mean that Mexican people never skydive,

40:56.520 --> 41:00.520
but it's like, you're, we're cholos, we're striking a silhouette here.

41:00.520 --> 41:01.520
Yeah, yeah.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.520
Let's go skydiving, let's go golfing, let's go, let's go surfing.

41:04.520 --> 41:10.520
But it's like, it does, it's like, the thing that like, my Asperger brain like, can't fucking,

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
it's like, what is my-

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
Get it, Dan, get it, get it.

41:12.520 --> 41:16.520
It's, it's, it's like, it's like, like, like, and I know the answer is neither,

41:16.520 --> 41:20.520
it's just like some combination of the two, but it's just like this constant fucking thing where it's like,

41:20.520 --> 41:27.520
are we, are we all supposed to be alike, or are we all supposed to like, like, represent, you know?

41:27.520 --> 41:28.520
Man, I see it like this, man.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.520
I see it as like, fuck the stereotypes, man, because that's what everybody got us twisted with.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.520
Everybody, all cultures, you know what I'm saying?

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
The stereotypes and shit.

41:35.520 --> 41:40.520
You know, and, and doing this shit right and getting it right and saying the truth, you know what I mean?

41:40.520 --> 41:47.520
Because, I mean, the reason why we saw that now as a, as Dan, this shit is racist as fuck.

41:47.520 --> 41:52.520
It's because, you know, we saw it as an, we see it as an adult, but as kids, we don't see that.

41:52.520 --> 41:53.520
You know what I'm saying?

41:53.520 --> 42:01.520
And the people who are writing these cartoons and coming up with these cartoons are pretty much generating those stereotypes.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.520
Like all these fools, all they do is fucking work in the warehouse and all this and that.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.520
You know what I mean?

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
You know what I mean?

42:06.520 --> 42:13.520
So it's like, if that is, if that is what it is, you know, there's people out there trying to break from that.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.520
You know what I'm saying?

42:14.520 --> 42:17.520
We don't just all work in this fucking warehouse.

42:17.520 --> 42:18.520
I work in the office, dude.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.520
I'm cool.

42:19.520 --> 42:20.520
I'm chilling.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.520
Clerical work.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.520
Call me, I'm born here, so I got rights.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.520
You know what I mean?

42:23.520 --> 42:26.520
So I'm doing my thing, but I'm not going to let my people shit go in vain.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.520
You know what I mean?

42:27.520 --> 42:28.520
Right.

42:28.520 --> 42:33.520
But what they came here to do, but see, that's, that's was projected at that time.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.520
You know what I'm saying?

42:34.520 --> 42:39.520
As, as a stereotype that maybe is why you're having that, that little clash.

42:39.520 --> 42:49.520
So if we, if we celebrate stuff, because it's like, it's like, it's like, like we celebrate like cultures and it's like, like one of the big things that I'm learning about as a white person is that there is shit to learn about.

42:49.520 --> 42:59.520
Like the idea that, that, that without perceiving it, that I, that I never, I never knew that I was making this active choice, which is what somebody else might have to do when they wake up in the morning.

42:59.520 --> 43:09.520
And I was actually, without making the choice that I was actually thinking of myself as default, vanilla, mainstream, normal.

43:09.520 --> 43:14.520
That's the thing that we're coping with right now is like, is like white people going like, what did I do?

43:14.520 --> 43:15.520
I didn't do anything wrong.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.520
What's going on around here?

43:16.520 --> 43:18.520
What's with all the alarm bells?

43:18.520 --> 43:20.520
And it's like, I didn't do anything.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.520
And it's like, yeah, you didn't do anything.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.520
And while you weren't doing anything, you can't, you're like, well, who am I?

43:25.520 --> 43:26.520
What the fuck am I?

43:26.520 --> 43:39.520
And so then we get into these, like, I think the, the, the evil versions of me are people that are equally confused, but their confusion generates like this, this anger and frustration where they're just like, what the fuck are we supposed to do?

43:39.520 --> 43:51.520
Like, I think I could, I've told this story on this, on this podcast before, like, I was working with this writer who, who's researching like Henry Ford, or in that era.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.640
And he told me this anecdote about Henry Ford

43:54.640 --> 43:58.960
at his factories, like he had this thing called American

43:58.960 --> 44:00.320
Day or something.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.520
And he would encourage all of his workers

44:02.520 --> 44:04.040
that were from all over the world.

44:04.040 --> 44:08.720
He would say, if you're going to dress like you're Polish,

44:08.720 --> 44:11.880
like for real, it's sort of like you

44:11.880 --> 44:16.200
imagine it being some kind of themed Friday,

44:16.200 --> 44:18.840
Taco Tuesday or something.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.360
But it was basically ethnic day.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.920
But because they would do this ceremony,

44:23.920 --> 44:25.600
like whatever you are, if you're Polish,

44:25.600 --> 44:27.280
like where your most Polish outfit,

44:27.280 --> 44:29.680
if you're Mexican, where your most Mexican outfit is good,

44:29.680 --> 44:30.360
yeah?

44:30.360 --> 44:34.240
And so, and then they would do this big ceremony

44:34.240 --> 44:37.840
on the factory floor where they had a literal giant melting

44:37.840 --> 44:39.480
pot.

44:39.480 --> 44:42.080
All of these prideful, grateful workers

44:42.080 --> 44:44.280
who were part of this new experiment called America

44:44.280 --> 44:46.760
with like wearing their Polish outfits

44:46.760 --> 44:49.840
would climb into this, they would walk into this like melting

44:49.840 --> 44:54.560
pot, and then they would take off their Polish clothes

44:54.560 --> 44:58.240
and put on a suit and tie, or like, and then they

44:58.240 --> 45:00.520
would come out the other side, and it would be like,

45:00.520 --> 45:01.800
here you are.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.600
And it was like this, and it's like, to me,

45:04.600 --> 45:10.680
that absolutely encapsulates the big fucking question.

45:10.680 --> 45:13.720
Because when you hear that, you immediately go,

45:13.720 --> 45:19.160
that sounds problematic as far as management.

45:19.160 --> 45:22.080
But then you go, also, there's an asterisk in there

45:22.080 --> 45:25.000
in my brain where I go, yeah, but the bad guys are constantly

45:25.000 --> 45:29.360
encouraging us to hold on to the differences, too.

45:29.360 --> 45:33.320
This thing of like, well, women do this, men do that,

45:33.320 --> 45:34.760
and it's like, we're starting to recognize

45:34.760 --> 45:38.120
that that's like a theme, like separating us

45:38.120 --> 45:39.600
is how you keep us powerless.

45:39.600 --> 45:40.160
Right, right.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.880
Well, see, I want to know, who are the bad guys?

45:41.880 --> 45:42.760
Who are you speaking of?

45:42.760 --> 45:44.840
Well, I'm talking about Nazis, have you heard of them?

45:44.840 --> 45:46.200
Oh, OK, OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:46.200 --> 45:47.120
The government over here.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.200
I'm talking about them less and less as they get richer

45:49.200 --> 45:51.600
and richer, and just want to sneak out quietly.

45:51.600 --> 45:52.920
I feel that shit.

45:52.920 --> 45:53.600
I feel that shit.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.360
I just want to die in a fucking lighthouse,

45:55.360 --> 45:57.640
so like, well, the fucking atom bombs go off,

45:57.640 --> 45:59.880
like fucking fallout style, baby.

45:59.880 --> 46:01.440
Oh, yeah.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.440
There's no fighting these old bones.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.000
No, I don't know.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.200
You watch Game of Thrones, I'm the Onion Knight.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.560
I've got cable, bro.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.840
I've got cable.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.680
How do you feel like your people feel about the stuff

46:11.680 --> 46:13.440
that you do?

46:13.440 --> 46:14.480
They're proud, man.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.520
Let me ask you this question, if like, do you care?

46:16.520 --> 46:18.760
Are you out just making content for content's sake,

46:18.760 --> 46:19.840
which is also dope?

46:19.840 --> 46:20.360
No.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.760
Do you care what your people think?

46:21.760 --> 46:22.760
Definitely, man.

46:22.760 --> 46:23.320
Definitely.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.080
I think that's very important, you know what I'm saying?

46:25.080 --> 46:26.240
To an artist, you know?

46:26.240 --> 46:27.440
Yeah.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.400
You got to care about what your people think, you know?

46:29.400 --> 46:31.520
Because otherwise, what are you doing it for?

46:31.520 --> 46:31.840
Yeah.

46:31.840 --> 46:32.920
You know what I'm saying?

46:32.920 --> 46:35.680
As opposed to, you know, doing it for yourself,

46:35.680 --> 46:37.360
which is another thing, but like,

46:37.360 --> 46:39.680
once you've done that past that level,

46:39.680 --> 46:41.600
it's like, is what you're doing really worth it?

46:41.600 --> 46:41.760
Right.

46:41.760 --> 46:42.800
Is it making an impact?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.960
Is it, you know, spreading a message,

46:44.960 --> 46:46.920
sending a message or something, you know what I mean?

46:46.920 --> 46:48.320
Yeah, what do people say to you?

46:48.320 --> 46:50.040
Like, when they bump into people,

46:50.040 --> 46:51.280
you can recognize, I'm sure.

46:51.280 --> 46:52.320
Yeah, man.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.280
Even at the taco stands, bro.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.600
Can't even order tacos sometimes and shit.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.200
Hey, aren't you that guy?

46:58.200 --> 46:58.680
That's dope.

46:58.680 --> 47:02.360
And I'd be like, uh, where, bro?

47:02.360 --> 47:03.080
I just want to test it.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.080
Yeah, aren't you that dude from, you know, the videos,

47:06.080 --> 47:07.240
Cholos Try videos?

47:07.240 --> 47:07.640
Yeah.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.240
Can I take a picture with you, Doc?

47:09.240 --> 47:14.000
Holding a big-ass burrito and shit, like, you know?

47:14.000 --> 47:14.960
In the natural.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.440
You'd be like, yeah, man, my natural element is shit.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.360
Yeah, you already know.

47:18.360 --> 47:19.160
It's like a baby, you know?

47:19.160 --> 47:26.720
Like, there was a wonderful backstage event,

47:26.720 --> 47:29.840
because it was like, what is the one thing that you

47:29.840 --> 47:33.320
were made to try through the show that you actually

47:33.320 --> 47:34.160
stuck with you?

47:34.160 --> 47:36.080
And the answer was sushi, right?

47:36.080 --> 47:38.200
Sushi, yes, yes.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.720
Did I ever try sushi?

47:39.720 --> 47:40.640
Yeah.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.440
OK, damn.

47:41.440 --> 47:42.440
All right, yeah.

47:42.440 --> 47:45.160
Y'all probably live on the hipster side of town.

47:45.160 --> 47:48.200
You won't catch no fucking sushi restaurant in Compton,

47:48.200 --> 47:49.720
bro, I'll tell you that.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.760
But yeah, that was one of the main things

47:51.760 --> 47:53.040
that really stuck with me, man.

47:53.040 --> 47:56.320
I was really, really, really skeptical for a long time,

47:56.320 --> 47:58.680
dude, because that shit, I don't know.

47:58.680 --> 48:04.120
It does sound like the pinnacle of rich people

48:04.120 --> 48:05.720
using themselves for no reason.

48:05.720 --> 48:08.440
Like, eat this seaweed with raw fish, yeah?

48:08.440 --> 48:09.240
Yeah, you know?

48:09.240 --> 48:12.960
And not to sound culturally racist or nothing like that.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.040
I'm going to be Spanish, if I sound offended, but nah.

48:15.040 --> 48:15.880
That's all I.

48:15.880 --> 48:19.120
If it's reverse racism, I think we'd all very much enjoy it.

48:19.120 --> 48:19.760
Oh shit.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.040
Well, please, please whip us.

48:22.040 --> 48:22.880
I don't know.

48:22.880 --> 48:26.960
I guess people would think I love to eat tacos, which I do.

48:26.960 --> 48:30.200
But I assume that it was just an Asian cuisine.

48:30.200 --> 48:30.680
You know what I mean?

48:30.680 --> 48:32.600
For just Asian people, you know what I mean?

48:32.600 --> 48:34.960
When I saw that, that was, you know, they fucked with it.

48:34.960 --> 48:37.400
Because I worked for a Korean dude one time,

48:37.400 --> 48:39.840
and he brought us some, and I think

48:39.840 --> 48:40.840
they were California rolls.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.360
They had no, you know, raw, nothing.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.480
But that seaweed, I thought it was fish scales.

48:45.480 --> 48:46.680
So I didn't even fuck with it, man.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.400
Yeah.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.080
You know what I mean?

48:48.080 --> 48:49.480
If you had got barbecue, though,

48:49.480 --> 48:51.160
I can't believe he brought you sushi.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.160
Yeah, right?

48:52.160 --> 48:53.200
That's what the fuck I'm saying.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.200
What the fuck?

48:54.200 --> 48:54.680
If you.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.600
They fucked me up with that one, dude.

48:56.600 --> 48:57.960
That's why you didn't trust it, because you were like,

48:57.960 --> 49:00.280
why is a Korean dude bringing me Japanese food?

49:00.280 --> 49:02.760
Yeah, if it was warm and it looked like it was cooked

49:02.760 --> 49:04.400
and looked like, you know, something to what I eat,

49:04.400 --> 49:06.880
like carne asada or whatever, then I'm with it.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.200
I'm sorry, I'm spilling my shit over you.

49:08.200 --> 49:08.920
No, that's OK.

49:08.920 --> 49:09.520
It's OK.

49:09.520 --> 49:12.320
I can fill you up, too, or help yourself.

49:12.320 --> 49:12.680
All right.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.560
Is that vodka?

49:13.560 --> 49:14.040
Yes, sir.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.040
OK.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.400
The homie brought me water, but I thought I'd

49:16.400 --> 49:17.920
help myself to some little drink.

49:17.920 --> 49:18.520
Please do.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.760
It's for after.

49:19.760 --> 49:20.560
Cheers, everybody.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.200
Cheers, man, too.

49:21.200 --> 49:21.840
Cheers.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.160
Everybody, man.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.320
Can't answer that.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.920
What sushi did you like?

49:27.920 --> 49:32.320
Once we tried it, man, and I was really open-minded to it,

49:32.320 --> 49:34.560
and I tried it, and I was like, OK, this is pretty good.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.600
I guess I'll give it a try next time.

49:36.600 --> 49:37.840
I went out, you know what I'm saying?

49:37.840 --> 49:40.800
And I had me a little sushi date or whatnot,

49:40.800 --> 49:43.440
and I like that shrimp tempura stuff.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:44.400 --> 49:45.680
But you know what I do, though?

49:45.680 --> 49:47.480
The reason why I like it, though,

49:47.480 --> 49:51.200
is because I make a little paste called, what I call,

49:51.200 --> 49:52.760
crack sauce.

49:52.760 --> 49:54.160
It's very addicting, man.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.040
I swear, dude.

49:55.040 --> 49:59.120
It's basically low-sodium soy sauce with sriracha sauce,

49:59.120 --> 50:02.360
and I dip my sushi roll in it, and I just chomp it up, dude.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.480
Yeah.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.640
Bomb, homie.

50:05.640 --> 50:07.560
It explodes in my mouth, dude.

50:07.560 --> 50:08.560
No homo.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.680
I'm a bad shit and sound right.

50:09.680 --> 50:10.800
That shit and sound right.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.600
But it's like a party in my mouth, man.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.480
And I'm like, oh, damn, girl, where you been at all my life?

50:17.480 --> 50:18.480
You know, it's like that.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.120
Sushi's bomb.

50:19.120 --> 50:19.920
I love it, man.

50:19.920 --> 50:20.640
I love sushi, man.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.840
I love Patrick Shrimp.

50:21.840 --> 50:26.800
What's your dream gig as an actor?

50:26.800 --> 50:29.240
Can you point at anything that anybody else is doing

50:29.240 --> 50:31.800
or a kind of movie that you'd like to be in?

50:31.800 --> 50:34.280
And it doesn't have to be realistic in whatever.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.720
Don't, you know, like, this is your fantasy.

50:36.720 --> 50:40.960
Like, what would you like to be doing as an actor?

50:40.960 --> 50:41.800
Shit.

50:41.800 --> 50:45.040
My timeframe, my life, man, I would

50:45.040 --> 50:47.480
like to be, if anything, somehow reincarnated

50:47.480 --> 50:52.200
to Antonio Banderas' fucking career, man.

50:52.200 --> 50:53.840
Antonio Banderas is a shit, man.

50:53.840 --> 50:54.360
You know what I'm saying?

50:54.360 --> 50:57.320
As far as him being a Latino, I respect his work and all that.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.280
He did a lot of good stuff, man.

50:59.280 --> 51:02.000
And I always thought he was a good actor, you know?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.480
And, you know, somewhere along those lines, you know?

51:04.480 --> 51:06.840
He never really played the cholo homie role,

51:06.840 --> 51:09.560
like some dudes in Standing Deliver,

51:09.560 --> 51:12.000
and, you know, Lou Diamond Phillips, you know,

51:12.000 --> 51:15.120
which is a very well-known respected actor in the game.

51:15.120 --> 51:15.840
We do have this.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.960
I know if my ex-girlfriend, who's like a media studies,

51:18.960 --> 51:21.080
probably got her PhD by now, she would always

51:21.080 --> 51:22.520
blow my mind with all this shit.

51:22.520 --> 51:26.560
But she would, I imagine if she was sitting here, she'd go,

51:26.560 --> 51:29.520
yeah, but there's also this, the Latin lover thing

51:29.520 --> 51:31.920
is like this other way of like, it's like,

51:31.920 --> 51:35.680
there's two ways of, like, oppressing African-American,

51:35.680 --> 51:37.840
like people, Brandon, I'll explain it to you.

51:41.120 --> 51:45.360
It's like, there's like the infantilizing where it's like,

51:45.360 --> 51:47.080
oh, look at this little knucklehead.

51:47.080 --> 51:48.240
He doesn't mean no harm.

51:48.240 --> 51:52.600
And then there's the thugged out kind of like, uh-oh, careful.

51:52.600 --> 51:53.960
Someone's rolling up.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.120
It's like Eddie Murphy.

51:56.120 --> 52:00.960
You always try to take the big dick thing away, oh.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.520
I've never tried to take that away.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.320
There's three things.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.360
There's three things.

52:04.360 --> 52:07.440
Infantilizing, whatever that word was.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.800
Big dick and then thug.

52:09.800 --> 52:13.760
And the one that upsets me the most is the big dick one.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.240
Yeah.

52:16.240 --> 52:19.160
It's just so, so stereotypical.

52:19.160 --> 52:22.080
Not only have I never questioned that stereotype,

52:22.080 --> 52:25.680
either of you, like, a few people do.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.280
We just tolerate it, don't we?

52:27.280 --> 52:33.640
But it's like, but that God, that, you know, they're like,

52:33.640 --> 52:38.080
oh, I'm a Latin, they're also like a Mandingo thing.

52:38.080 --> 52:44.480
Like, that idea of sexualizing a less than privileged class,

52:44.480 --> 52:48.040
like, it can feel like it's like awesome.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.320
But at the same time, it's like, if you're

52:50.320 --> 52:53.080
into the hobby of problematization,

52:53.080 --> 52:54.800
because you had a degree, it's like,

52:54.800 --> 52:59.280
you can trace how it actually, but why am I shitting

52:59.280 --> 53:00.000
on your dream?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.680
You want to be fucking, but Darius isn't just in movies

53:02.680 --> 53:08.600
where he's seducing white honeys with a rose in his teeth.

53:08.600 --> 53:13.920
He also was like, he was like, he was the Mexican Bruce

53:13.920 --> 53:15.200
Willis, was what he was.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.000
Yeah, basically.

53:16.000 --> 53:16.640
Yeah, basically.

53:16.640 --> 53:17.640
Yeah, basically.

53:17.640 --> 53:19.160
He's Spanish, though?

53:19.160 --> 53:20.440
OK, sorry.

53:20.440 --> 53:21.280
Racist.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.680
No, you're good.

53:22.680 --> 53:23.480
Nationalists.

53:23.480 --> 53:24.960
Just shouting it out.

53:24.960 --> 53:25.920
Just shouting it out.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.560
Can I?

53:26.560 --> 53:29.080
OK, so yeah, let me ask dumb white people questions

53:29.080 --> 53:31.360
about Latinx culture.

53:31.360 --> 53:37.040
If you see a Spanish guy, do you guys get in a fight?

53:37.040 --> 53:37.720
It's a joke.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.440
It's a joke question.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.560
No, no, I'm going to answer that shit for you, man,

53:40.560 --> 53:44.840
because it's a yes and a no answer, you know what I'm saying?

53:44.840 --> 53:47.920
Because it all depends on the person who it is.

53:47.920 --> 53:51.400
I've rolled around with homies that they're active and whatever.

53:51.400 --> 53:53.880
And we're going to Hollywood Boulevard just chilling

53:53.880 --> 53:54.560
and we're walking.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.680
I'm peeping out the honeys, but this was peeping out the dudes

53:56.680 --> 53:57.800
as who's mad, dog, in this food.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.320
Like, what the fuck are you looking at for?

53:59.320 --> 54:01.440
And they want to start some shit, and I'm like, dog.

54:01.440 --> 54:02.760
Chill, homie.

54:02.760 --> 54:03.560
Kick it with the honeys.

54:03.560 --> 54:04.800
You see what's up with the honeys?

54:04.800 --> 54:06.280
I ain't trying to go to jail tonight, dog.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.120
You know what I'm saying?

54:07.120 --> 54:08.800
We are here in Hollywood Boulevard and shit, you know?

54:08.800 --> 54:11.760
So sometimes it could happen if you're not

54:11.760 --> 54:14.480
with the right people.

54:14.480 --> 54:17.360
I think that, OK.

54:17.360 --> 54:18.440
Let's dig into the, all right.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.440
So I want to dig into this fantasy.

54:20.440 --> 54:27.160
Like, maybe let's do the movie where you're this kind of,

54:27.160 --> 54:34.320
like, if you were a bandera's type, like, what's your favorite,

54:34.320 --> 54:36.480
not your favorite movie, I hate when people ask me that.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.280
What's a movie that you really like?

54:38.280 --> 54:40.920
Like, you would be like, man, if I was in that movie,

54:40.920 --> 54:42.000
I'd be so excited.

54:44.920 --> 54:48.320
Maybe something like Carlitos, Waste, Scarface.

54:48.320 --> 54:51.240
If it was a bandera's movie, it'd be Desperado.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.120
You know, Trejo was in that a while back.

54:53.120 --> 54:56.080
You know, I mean, he's doing, you know.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.480
I like how you say Trejo.

54:57.480 --> 54:58.440
Yeah, yeah.

54:58.440 --> 54:59.360
Danny's cool, man.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.480
It's very Latinx.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.360
Oh, yeah.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.240
What's the, is that new Latinx?

55:04.240 --> 55:04.960
I just learned that.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.600
I was so excited about it.

55:06.600 --> 55:07.840
School me on that shit, then.

55:07.840 --> 55:08.960
I don't have to help.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.240
You know, have you ever heard of different Latinx?

55:11.240 --> 55:13.080
It stood up because I think it's just.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.440
I can help, maybe.

55:14.440 --> 55:17.800
So you know how there's, like, Latino or Latina?

55:17.800 --> 55:21.880
I think Latinx is just trying to do both of those.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.320
Oh, it's like a sci-fi.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.080
I think that's the way people do it.

55:25.080 --> 55:27.400
Like, gender identification type of shit?

55:27.400 --> 55:29.640
Well, kind of, it's just like, it's like to say,

55:29.640 --> 55:32.240
kind of like Latin people, like, like, like saying,

55:32.240 --> 55:35.280
oh, so you're like, you're like a Latinx comedian

55:35.280 --> 55:37.240
or something, like, like you're just in that community.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.720
Like, that's how people use it, I think.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.800
Well, Brenda, do you want to weigh it?

55:40.800 --> 55:42.240
Shit.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.760
OK.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.120
Oh, oh, I want to know.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.200
I'm not going to, I'm not.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.520
All I know is Malcolm X.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.280
I'm just guessing.

55:52.280 --> 55:54.680
Is it true that Malcolm X was developed because there

55:54.680 --> 55:56.400
was Malcolm M and Malcolm O?

55:56.400 --> 55:56.900
Yeah.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.240
There.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.240
Malcolm X representation.

56:04.240 --> 56:07.000
There had been Malcolm 9.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.240
And Malcolm in the middle, too.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.040
Don't forget that guy.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.240
Thank you.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.160
Thank you.

56:12.160 --> 56:16.640
But like, OK, yeah, OK, I want to write this movie for you.

56:16.640 --> 56:17.040
OK.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.920
OK, so let's see.

56:18.920 --> 56:20.400
I'm trying to figure out how to do it.

56:20.400 --> 56:24.400
Like, I don't want to put you in the spot, but OK.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.280
Let's do, let's do like a radio play.

56:26.280 --> 56:28.920
Let's come up with a name for your character.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.040
It doesn't have to be crazy.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.400
Do you want to name them or?

56:32.400 --> 56:35.200
Yeah, we can, I can name them, man.

56:35.200 --> 56:38.360
How about a?

56:38.360 --> 56:39.000
Toco.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.400
Toco.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.120
I like that.

56:41.120 --> 56:41.600
Break it back.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.840

56:43.840 --> 56:46.280
All right.

56:46.280 --> 56:50.080
Could it be Toco 3000 AD?

56:50.080 --> 56:50.600
Yeah.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.520
Just so that I can, otherwise, because if I'm writing it like.

56:53.520 --> 56:55.240

56:55.240 --> 56:56.600
No, no, no, no.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.800
But, but yeah, exactly.

56:57.800 --> 57:00.520
Yeah, it could, but it could be so far in the future

57:00.520 --> 57:02.120
that the shit got thrown back.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.280
So it's more savage.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.480
Like, I doesn't like as long as, because otherwise,

57:06.480 --> 57:09.000

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
It's called Toco.

57:12.800 --> 57:16.640
It's set in 2018, Los Angeles.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.320
All right.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.800
OK, there's a guy, Toco.

57:26.800 --> 57:32.520
He's just getting out of the joint.

57:32.520 --> 57:34.960
You mentioned Carlitos way.

57:34.960 --> 57:37.960
He did not belong in the joint.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.720
He went to the joint for the best reason

57:39.720 --> 57:42.520
you could go to the joint, being a gentleman.

57:42.520 --> 57:43.440
Yeah, definitely.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.560
To his homies.

57:44.560 --> 57:45.480
Definitely.

57:45.480 --> 57:46.480

57:46.480 --> 57:48.720
Stuck by his homies.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.600

57:55.600 --> 57:57.800
So like, we've got to change something up here.

57:57.800 --> 57:58.320
All right.

as fuck watching movies man cuz you're gonna cry yeah we're gonna cry dog have

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.740
you noticed a theme that will make you cry is it like father son stuff or is

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:51.700
it like underdog stuff for all that stuff man all that stuff gets to me bro on

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:59.620
the real shit because it's you know it oh shit what movies you're about to cry

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:05.020
he paused for a second what it is man you know movies reflect on how you live

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.420
sometimes yeah life yeah you know I'm saying if you portray your life in a

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.860
movie fashion you're doing the shit all wrong but if you watch a film and you

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:19.700
can relate to it and it hits home you know I'm saying deep in your heart like

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.980
with something you might have been through or something or you know what

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.380
whatever it is you've gone through fucked up relationships or whatever you

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.220
lost a loved one whatever man whatever the dramatization is within that film

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.900
that got to you you know it's shit like that that really hits home man that

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.860
gets to me man and like I'm a big movie buff you know and sometimes like I'll

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.500
I'll just be in my zone people in these movies out man and I'm trying to think

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.820
of the last one like it was like balling I think it might have been cocoa like

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:52.060
like I'm not trying to I'm not sure I'm not bringing that up to score culture

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:57.820
but I feel you I think it was a little bit of cocoa I started fucking losing it

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:02.060
I did a little cocoa man but and it was unexpected because at the beginning of

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:05.260
the first 20 minutes of cocoa I was like this shit's more complicated than

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.220
Phantom Menace what the fuck the fuck are you talking about you got to be a

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:13.020
skeleton by morning but on Tuesday if no one has your picture on a bench yeah

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:19.700
like but but it did turn out to be quite simple and then actually like was

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.340
like very profound and like I was like I was just like fucking like sobbing I

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:30.340
can't actually remember why I was crying my girlfriend will just fucking like

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:36.660
she'll she'll just sob like a cartoon at anything like like anything that's like

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:42.540
like where if the well I don't want to cheapen or it has to be sincerely done

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:47.140
but I'm just saying she cried to sausage party like well not quite that no

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.300
guys up but like anything where the director was like was like you know you

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:55.940
know if I had it my way you'd be crying right now like in a real sincere way

01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.940
like Cody will like like like she'll actually like unpredictably like she'll

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:06.340
actually be like sobbing did you see you didn't see there's no way you saw did

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:10.860
you see a ghost story with Casey Affleck he's wearing a sheet the whole movie and

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:15.460
then you know watch a girl eat a pie it's a weird I've seen the sixth sense it's

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:19.700
pretty similar kind of like that but yeah that that's a move I got a lot of

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.220
catching up to do on movies that was the most well this movie like nobody's seen

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:27.460
it but yeah but like it's the most like I was most unexpected like it's like

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:34.100
Casey Affleck is just a dude who he's like he dies and then the gimmick of the

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.540
movie is that he's just under a sheet like Charlie Brown like like like like the

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.980
whole movie and it's like it like wait the movie waits for you to like get over

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.940
that and be like this is corny but then it's just like he's just hanging out in

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:48.380
the background he's in a sheet and then like you there's a scene where his

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:54.780
girlfriend like you're just he's just watching her and she eats this pie that

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:59.540
somebody gave her she's alone and it's like the camera doesn't cut and then you

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:04.260
just watch her eat a fucking pie because she's like binging but then and then I

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.540
think she goes and pukes it up or whatever but it's just like sort of like

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:10.620
it just it's like two minutes like and people who don't like the movie they're

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.660
like like they immediately leap to the scene like I don't watch somebody eat a

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.660
pie yeah like in a sheet what are you doing to me and I don't fault those

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.700
people I'm not saying those people you don't get it man three seconds to the

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.300
movie then change the shit but the crazy thing is if you're on the other side of

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.220
it and the only way reason I was because Cody started crying and then I was like

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.820
why is Cody crying and then we paused the movie and that's my girlfriend she's

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:40.820
got a guy's name she's my middle name is a female's name oh yeah all right so we're like we were

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.420
basically like family yeah we're the same we're the same a little different but

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.620
same same you know but I started thinking about what for the first time in my

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.500
life I started thinking about instead of thinking about how sad it would be to die

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:58.580
as in like how bummed I would be to not be able to live life I don't get no more

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:06.380
life like and I was like I started getting scared that I would die and like

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.540
because of the like I was like oh my god what if you had to watch your the person

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:15.940
that you loved cope with your and I know there's been other movies about that like

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.340
what dreams may come yeah like Robert Williams yeah like I know those never

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:24.500
affected me like I never I watched us and I go like grown-up shit like I don't

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.100
I don't know this like hipster thing got to me it's like Casey Applex in a sheet

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.780
maybe it disarmed me they just call hearted Dan I don't know fucking cold

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:36.820
hearted you don't got no love I think I just needed to have like a

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.620
relationship with somebody that was like so cool yeah sobbing and then she's

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.980
like I'm gonna pause it making some drinks and then I was like that's going

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.180
to be a goal and then I was like what's she crying about and then I was like

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:58.540
amazing I'll figure it out while she's making drinks ever since that it's been

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:03.340
several years now I still think about that scene from that movie when I think

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:09.980
about death yeah that's my new that if the director of that movie knew that they

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:15.220
had accomplished that would they be proud ashamed I don't know I don't know

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:18.980
what I'm sure they would have been proud man it's only the chosen few that can

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:23.660
catch it so what would you as an actor would you really like to like do you'd

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:27.700
like to play it like is would that be your ultimate fantasy is that is knowing

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:31.540
that you did something that somebody somebody out there even if it's one

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:37.100
person because of your performance they it like it fucked up their whole brain

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.380
it changed their whole life like that would be the brass ring right well that

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:45.260
would fuck me up if I fucked up somebody else's shit like that but if I help change

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.900
their life in some kind of way then you know I've served my purpose in life you

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:54.500
know but yeah like that'll be that'll be dope man like that's what that's

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.620
actually what I really strive for and live for you know a lot of the times

01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:03.860
what I do with my music you know music yeah I produce man drop a beat no I'm

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:11.700
kidding why are you kidding because he may be into bluegrass we don't know I

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:19.460
love blue I love all kind of music I didn't but he's had says dope and he's

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:31.060
got a chain on some stereotypes are real freestyle probably what's with the

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:38.700
what's with the Morrissey thing how is that real like I don't understand the

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:44.180
Morrissey thing like the that's a that's a genuine cholo thing if I can use that

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.740
word outside the context of the title of your show like fuck it like what it you

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:55.220
like like Latinx Los Angeles dudes like being in so fucking big into Morrissey

01:22:55.220 --> 01:23:00.220
you're not familiar with that stereotype not to be honest with you I'm not

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:03.140
familiar with the stereotype I think there's a band called Morrissey ain't

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:10.060
there yeah it's yeah so a lot of guys like him because the hipsters bro they

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.460
look like us that's what I'm saying they adopted our culture you know there's

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:17.540
sort of a there's like a rockabilly crossover so it's lowriders rockabilly

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:22.780
50s type I heard of some shit called cholo got to I don't know that falls in

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:28.300
the category could be yeah yeah these are crazy daughter fucking but a lot of

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:34.140
the luchiva people are our Morrissey fan because I couldn't pick I mean I was

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.460
like I know I know Morrissey from impressions like I know Dina Gould's

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:45.860
impression of Morris he's like he couldn't sound more white I think he's

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.580
any literally British yeah yeah he's not it's like that's what it's kind of

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:53.620

fingernail length oh like if you're a real man's man you're not necessarily

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:04.500

shank me bro I don't understand why these things keep fucking growing don't you

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.140
think they should have come out with a pill by now just make these things stop

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:29.540
growing yeah yeah but I think if you can't do it without the pill man just

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:35.500
lazy as fuck what about your toenails though like it's I like toenails like

it's like to be old and to like hunch over and you got the thing I just like

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:46.100
tend to do with the long-ass toenails yeah me me because I put it off as long

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.780
as possible are you kidding with this again it just keeps coming out it's

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:54.220
like this cori it's like fucking insane like I was like like what am I doing this

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:58.460
for there's got to be a pill do you scissors or heads clippers for your

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:07.700

massage or whatever and the one guy was like I was touching my feet that's how

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.740

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:25.860
like a professional back rub or anything like I I the same way I would never I

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.820
would never avail myself of a sex worker it's because where other other men

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:37.660
would it would would think oh I I just I just you're my bitch now I just make it

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:41.660

01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:45.540
much acne I have on my back like they've seen every back so now they're gonna be

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:51.020
like comparing so I don't want anybody this guy's who got a fucking land over

01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:56.160
here you got a mountain yeah well city is this shit yeah I got a lot of shit to

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.860
work I feel the insecurity the thing is once you get the feet done a bunch of

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:05.580
times I wish I could crash that threshold where I would just go into a

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:10.540
place three times I'd just be like do my feet that would be the craze that would

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:15.540
be crazier you don't have to talk to them right they know they know what you're

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:22.020
going in there for bro do my feet let me explain why let me explain why I'm

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:27.860
here you know what I would really do is I would be like and they would be like

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:31.660
you want me to do your feet like they would yell at me and the next time I

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:37.540
go like do my feet like you don't have to yell I'm like see I don't like this

01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:40.660
they're not gonna they're not gonna harass you they're gonna guide you over to a chair

01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:45.020
you go you can go with Cody you guys to get your feet yeah you do this all the

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:50.580
time I don't know Jeff does now I heard I heard in downtown LA man I do my

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:54.740
if you go do that you got to be careful of which one you go to because I heard

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:59.260
in downtown LA do my feet could mean something else I don't know yeah I don't

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:04.700
know that might be better I will tell you you don't get in grumps that way so

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.340
you can you can have somebody do your nails or you can go to a doctor and

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:10.900
he's gonna cut your nails out and shit I'll tell you I don't have claws my boy

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:15.860
yeah for fucking see this for a brag but I don't think I don't get any of those

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:20.780
problems because I have the one problem which is that they grow at one inch a

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:25.500
day yeah so there's no in growing there's no things out I have one problem

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.940
alone which is just Freddie Krueger feet like do they ever cut through your

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:36.260
shoes yeah they are constantly running up against the the fucking like physics

01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:45.620
of our world and I the only I go down to get the food at the door and if I'm not

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:51.860
wearing socks and I'm like I'm just like don't look down like you know like my

01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:58.420
toenails clicks like it clicks like a dog's feet oh yeah it they grow very

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:03.460
quickly by my definition so you got to keep away a certain length of everything

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:07.540
because otherwise you know you're gonna fucking step on it I mean or poke

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:17.340
through it or shrink that shit if I'm naked in the bed sheets the only the

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:20.620
only thing that doesn't have to do with vanity like oh it looks gross it's

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:26.100
unbecoming you look like a monster who wants to look like a monster you know

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:31.660
my audience does okay but like we come here to celebrate but but but but but

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:36.980
the the one thing is like you the the bed sheets and then you're like you like

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:40.980
move your weight around and you're naked you should be the best moment of your

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:48.100
life naked like fucking like I love my life I'm gonna play some Fallout 4 like

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:51.740
and you just like and then like you're you get this weird reminder that you have

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:56.700
a monster toenail drags along your thousand thread count sheet makes a

01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.620
sound or something like I'm a monster I'm a monster do you find yourself having

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:07.100
to buy sheets constantly I take out that way I just I feel like I just feel like

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:13.220

from Los Angeles or people from all over yeah mainly from LA the greater LA

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:47.340
area you know I'm from Compton you know was it a crew that you always rolled

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:51.540
with or did you find people you know via this person there's stuff you'd worked

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:55.980
up before yeah every time I go on set I'm always trying to network with

01:44:55.980 --> 01:45:01.140
somebody you know because what I kind of find out I'm a hustler man you know

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:05.420
I network with a lot of people I talk to a lot of people I'm a humble dude you

01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:08.980
know it doesn't really matter what it is that you do or what you can do for me I

01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:12.500
just chop it up with people right and then once you get to know them you know

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:16.980
once they open those up those doors and you tie with them with that person then

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:21.340
you start to really network and collab you know so I try not to put all my eggs

01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:25.260
