{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.520\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session. How are ya? Let them hear ya at home.\n\n00:12.520 --> 00:20.520\nMake a little noise. How are ya? There we go. Uh, Jeff Davis is so, so far away. I'm\n\n00:20.520 --> 00:49.520\nhere. My name is Brandon Johnson. I'll be comptrolling tonight. Let us welcome to the stage our king, our dungeon master, Spencer Crittenden. Yes. Yes, enjoy him. Enjoy him. You all know him as the mayor, the chief surveyor, Boomshaka Laka. Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:49.520 --> 01:15.520\nHello, hello, hello. It's my podcast show. Hello, hello, welcome to my podcast show. Can you hear me, though?\n\n01:15.520 --> 01:44.520\nI said no to your mama's big toe podcast show. Fuck your mama. Okay. Thought I'd try a different, I don't know about the applause, but if it was organic, you can applaud. That's fine. There was a very, I keep having an emotional flashback in my head to our last episode when I was commending David Cummings from the No Sleep podcast on his graceful, uh,\n\n01:44.520 --> 02:13.520\ndelivery, uh, uh, curating of, uh, or advocating and, and, and weaving of the LGBT kind of pride week kind of thing. And actually, and there, you, I said, I said what I had to say as far as kudos. And then you were like, like, you did this. It was like, I was so embarrassed. It was like, because it, I haven't seen you in a week. And this is the first thing you say to me.\n\n02:13.520 --> 02:25.520\nI know. Well, I bet it's been a thing. I don't like walking around with secrets from you. Like I don't, I don't, you know, you would have a transparent relationship. Where's the money? Hey, let me ask you a question. Why did I embarrass you?\n\n02:25.520 --> 02:53.520\nWell, because I, you know, I, I, this is my problem. I realize it, but I always view the world. I always have a camera on me that is, uh, the property of the person that hates me the most in the world. And that, and that's how I choose to view myself. And so at this phase of my life, that's like, uh, you know, that's going to be your all righty kind of like, like I'm sick and tired of this progress culture stuff.\n\n02:53.520 --> 03:19.520\nAnd so for the forced like one, one, what is the sound of one man clapping kind of like, like, like, like thing. I was like, oh, they're going to love that. You know, because it's like, that's, that's their impression of it is like, that's why we're doing it. You know, that's why we're, that's why we talk about this stuff is because we want, we want our little Scooby snack. We want to make people applaud.\n\n03:19.520 --> 03:34.520\nMan, I make that camera like a old ass camera with a big tape when I see it. That's just so you know where I'm coming from. That's when I, when I hear this camera that every, that this awful voice owns, I don't make it like a nice camera.\n\n03:34.520 --> 03:35.520\nYeah.\n\n03:35.520 --> 03:43.520\nI make it like a really shitty camera. Like before you bought it in Van Nuys, it was used for porn.\n\n03:43.520 --> 03:55.520\nThis is a thing is the only it's like, this is a thing that's like endemic to the standup community. And I was a terrible standup, but I was compatible with that community in one sense, which is I think it's very like a standup mentality.\n\n03:55.520 --> 04:23.520\nIt's like the guy in the back of the room that's not laughing, like he's the smart one. He knows, but, but for that reason, fuck him. And I'm going to fucking murder this room and his fucking face, you know, like it's all of this like syndrome of like you can never just like confront what's scaring you, you know, I'm like, I just like so much shame in my spinal column.\n\n04:23.520 --> 04:26.520\nIt's like, it's crazy. I'm a shame driven man.\n\n04:26.520 --> 04:28.520\nNo, no, no.\n\n04:28.520 --> 04:35.520\nWhat are you arguing with that for? I need, I need to have that be true so I can fix it. You can't. Don't tell me no.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:37.520\nAll right. I didn't know it was part of the episode.\n\n04:37.520 --> 04:39.520\nAll right. Well, okay.\n\n04:39.520 --> 04:43.520\nSo then we got, we got how long is this arc? And we're talking like two, three more shows.\n\n04:43.520 --> 05:06.520\nWhat till I'm not have no shame. It's a 49 year story. And I've been alive 45 years. So I yeah, four years is the answer to your question. It will be, I will, I will be done with this podcast and I will, I will Instagram under my new account.\n\n05:06.520 --> 05:18.520\nHey, no shame. It'll be like hidden in the comment of a like a picture of a wine label. Cody and I own a restaurant and some island or something.\n\n05:18.520 --> 05:24.520\nI'll be like, by the way, I'm not ashamed of myself anymore. Cody's dad. Happy 70th birthday.\n\n05:24.520 --> 05:42.520\nAnd since the last show, Stephen Heller, if you, you can, you can trace my Instagram. You can see his, he's a photographer and spent his 70th with him and went to his sushi place and where the hell are we?\n\n05:42.520 --> 05:49.520\nBurbank? I don't know where we were. I don't know where he lives. I just follow, I just go where the Tesla tells me a guy plugged in a number.\n\n05:49.520 --> 06:03.520\nBut he was telling the stories about, you know, visiting his, his other daughter. And I wrote this down because I thought it was such a great quote.\n\n06:03.520 --> 06:10.520\nIt was offered so sincerely. He's telling a story about how he got, he had like, he just had kind of a wild night.\n\n06:10.520 --> 06:23.520\nAnd he goes like, so we go to the, we go to, we go to the, we go to the concert and then there's a bar and we're, you know, we're having a good time.\n\n06:23.520 --> 06:30.520\nI get over served.\n\n06:30.520 --> 06:40.520\nSo, you know, a lot of this is, I can't over serve. Long story short, I got over served. I like that a lot.\n\n06:40.520 --> 06:47.520\nWe are, we've got this CD case out, we're chopping it up and someone gives me a huge line of cocaine.\n\n06:47.520 --> 06:51.520\nI got, I got, I got, I got, I got coke getting injected.\n\n06:51.520 --> 06:58.520\nSomeone blew a bunch of coke up my nose.\n\n06:58.520 --> 07:02.520\nI love it that you're kicking it with him at 70. He's in good shape for 70.\n\n07:02.520 --> 07:07.520\nHe looks identical to me. People see me and him and Cody and they're like, what's going on?\n\n07:07.520 --> 07:19.520\nLike, young lady, do your uncle and your dad want to, I don't know, park the car. I don't know what the, I just, we look the same age.\n\n07:19.520 --> 07:24.520\nAnd that's, that's a warning shot across my bow.\n\n07:24.520 --> 07:29.520\nBut it's good, good for him. There's, there's 25 years between us.\n\n07:29.520 --> 07:36.520\nI kind of want to like take the age between us and turn it into a dude and, and just talk to him.\n\n07:36.520 --> 07:41.520\nThis looks kind of like lump of 25 year old Plato. Like, would he be cool? I don't know.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:45.520\nYeah.\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:53.520\nI can't remember because I've been pretty drunk a lot lately. I've been over served in these, in these shows a lot.\n\n07:53.520 --> 07:57.520\nSo I know I've been talking about Fallout 4. I've been replaying Fallout 4.\n\n07:57.520 --> 08:02.520\nBut have I talked about the Preston Garvey issue in Fallout 4?\n\n08:02.520 --> 08:03.520\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n08:03.520 --> 08:11.520\nPreston Garvey is a man that you meet early in the game. He's, he belongs to, in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\n08:11.520 --> 08:21.520\nHe's, he's a, he's part of a, a now virtually extinct group of militia men called the Minutemen.\n\n08:21.520 --> 08:27.520\nAnd they're kind of like a, they, they borrow their culture from like the, the revolutionary Minutemen.\n\n08:27.520 --> 08:33.520\nAnd they represent like the hope for the future in this wasteland.\n\n08:33.520 --> 08:37.520\nHe happens to be African-American. And yes, that is an important part of the story.\n\n08:37.520 --> 08:39.520\nWhy are you looking at Spencer?\n\n08:39.520 --> 08:43.520\nYeah, what the fuck, man?\n\n08:43.520 --> 08:55.520\nSo pre, all of these characters like Fallout 4 is a very, very, I'm sure it's got lots of awards, but it really needs like special awards because it has these like the way that it handles this concept of romance.\n\n08:55.520 --> 09:02.520\nYou can play as either gender, and that's not me signing off on there being two genders. Thank you very much.\n\n09:02.520 --> 09:06.520\nBut according to this video game, apparently you got a salt or pepper.\n\n09:06.520 --> 09:16.520\nBut, but you, you, you can, you can play as one of two genders and, and, but it doesn't, it doesn't like flip all the other genders.\n\n09:16.520 --> 09:26.520\nLike, which means that basically they're like, okay, so you might be gay in playing the game, you might be straight, you might be a man, you might be a woman, any combination of all of the above.\n\n09:26.520 --> 09:36.520\nSo they had to like, they had to create these characters that you hook, you, you, you encounter, and then they're your companions and they follow you around.\n\n09:36.520 --> 09:43.520\nAnd then they, they will, if you, if they really get attached to you, they start, you know, they start gaining affinity for you.\n\n09:43.520 --> 09:46.520\nAnd then you're experiencing that through these conversations.\n\n09:46.520 --> 09:56.520\nBut in these conversations, like, they had to keep in mind that this might be a man talking to a man who is not interested in male, male sex.\n\n09:56.520 --> 10:04.520\nLike, so, but on the other hand, but it might also simultaneously be a man talking to a woman, a straight woman that's playing.\n\n10:04.520 --> 10:11.520\nThat's like really like, hello, sugar, sugar man, like, like when she, when she sees this guy the first time, you know, yes.\n\n10:11.520 --> 10:25.520\nLike, and it's just, it's kind of, it's really this masterpiece, because I'm looking at this 45 year old man I'm replaying Fallout 4 and I'm like, you know, these female characters that they go like, oh, it's me, my name's Piper, and I'm a journalist.\n\n10:25.520 --> 10:40.520\nAnd I'm like, I majored in journalism and like, hey, and it kind of like automatically like locked into this thing of like, like, like every time she goes like, hey, can I tell you something about my backstory and all this stuff?\n\n10:40.520 --> 10:47.520\nAnd then there will be a button that says flirt, and then it'll build to a button that says romance.\n\n10:47.520 --> 10:48.520\nWow.\n\n10:48.520 --> 10:57.520\nSo you can play it however you want, but I just think the most interesting thing is because I started playing the game long enough that now all the guys are doing this too.\n\n10:57.520 --> 11:12.520\nSo here's the just the amazing thing about that I'm learning about sexual projection is that the women characters, when they say, hey, can I talk to you about something for a second?\n\n11:12.520 --> 11:27.520\nYou know, we've been traveling for a long time, and I never knew how to trust anybody, but you're really like traveling with you has really made me realize I need to get over my defense mechanisms and trust people.\n\n11:27.520 --> 11:32.520\nAnd I just wanted to let you know, I really, I really trust you and you're really special to me.\n\n11:32.520 --> 11:42.520\nAnd like, when it's a woman, and then there's the button that comes up that says flirt, so you retroactively go, oh, she's hitting on me.\n\n11:42.520 --> 11:43.520\nThat's what I do.\n\n11:43.520 --> 11:44.520\nI don't know why I'm saying you.\n\n11:44.520 --> 12:02.520\nSometimes I like I like I got and then but then when when when it's a guy and he goes like, hey, could I talk to you for a second? You know, when I first met you, I wasn't sure I thought you were a tub of guts, but the universal brotherhood of steel needs everything they've gotten.\n\n12:02.520 --> 12:07.520\nI just got to say you've given this old tin can soldier a new Lisa in life.\n\n12:07.520 --> 12:13.520\nAnd then and then what and then the flirt button comes up and you're like, whoa.\n\n12:13.520 --> 12:14.520\nIt's really fascinating.\n\n12:14.520 --> 12:18.520\nIt's like an actual kind of an educational tool because it's like they had this.\n\n12:18.520 --> 12:29.520\nI mean, because the game isn't the game is simply saying, these are people who are growing fond of you and then it's up to you to project on to it any way you want.\n\n12:29.520 --> 12:46.520\nAnd the and and I am ashamed to say as a as a modern liberal this video game with that I still I haven't I haven't I haven't gone there with a dude yet and yet I have been so unfaithful in all of the female relationships.\n\n12:46.520 --> 12:58.520\nI just keep I just keep like I'll max them out until I get all their combat bonuses and then I'll assign them to a supply line with cattle or something are all like I'll put them in a field because I'm like, well, I got their combat bonuses.\n\n12:58.520 --> 13:01.520\nAnd now I'm now I'm with now I'm with what's your name.\n\n13:01.520 --> 13:04.520\nAnd and like, so there's no shame about that.\n\n13:04.520 --> 13:11.520\nThere was a little bit of there was there was a little bit of difficulty with it, but clearly I got over it.\n\n13:11.520 --> 13:12.520\nBut I will not.\n\n13:12.520 --> 13:14.520\nI still won't fucking do it.\n\n13:14.520 --> 13:15.520\nNo one's watching me.\n\n13:15.520 --> 13:21.520\nI know I know the game isn't going to punish me or reward me in any particular way.\n\n13:21.520 --> 13:26.520\nIt's not going to make my character gay and like change my weapons.\n\n13:26.520 --> 13:33.520\nIt's it's it's I know that the only thing that's going to happen is the conclusion of a fucking like algorithm.\n\n13:33.520 --> 13:35.520\nAnd I still don't do it.\n\n13:35.520 --> 13:36.520\nShame on me.\n\n13:36.520 --> 13:41.520\nI should be fucking everyone in the apocalyptic wasteland.\n\n13:41.520 --> 13:45.520\nSo you might have more value value in that community.\n\n13:45.520 --> 13:53.520\nYou might rise to a king because you met a dude and you guys fell in love because the way you set your shit up, you got to be the president.\n\n13:53.520 --> 13:56.520\nIt would be a man. So here's this is why I brought this up.\n\n13:56.520 --> 14:01.520\nSo this is why it's important that Preston Garvey is African American.\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:02.520\nRight.\n\n14:02.520 --> 14:10.520\nSo Preston Garvey is one of these male characters who the so his is particularly it's it's legitimately like it's it's great.\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:15.520\nLike he he when he gets to the peak where it's time to either hit romance or not.\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:19.520\nHe says, hey, can I talk to you about something?\n\n14:19.520 --> 14:21.520\nYou know, something I know.\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:23.520\nHow he sounds.\n\n14:23.520 --> 14:30.520\nYou know, what do you want me to do?\n\n14:30.520 --> 14:33.520\nHe's not he doesn't have big headphones on and roller skates.\n\n14:33.520 --> 14:35.520\nHe's not like, hey.\n\n14:35.520 --> 14:41.520\nI mean, you earlier did say something about confronting your fears on stage and we cool.\n\n14:41.520 --> 14:52.520\nThis guy, this guy, he's he sounds like you. He's he's he's an unmistakably black man.\n\n14:52.520 --> 14:54.520\nBut there's no impression to do of him.\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:57.520\nHe's not like, oh, I'm an Italian chef.\n\n14:57.520 --> 15:03.520\nYou know, like, and you're not like, yo, blood, like, you're Brandon.\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:10.520\nI don't think I don't think, you know, I'm not like, like, and so he's he's a gentleman.\n\n15:10.520 --> 15:12.520\nHe likes to dress up.\n\n15:12.520 --> 15:15.520\nI don't mean to derail you.\n\n15:15.520 --> 15:23.520\nAnd he's deep. He's a deep thinker and he's an emotionally available friend.\n\n15:23.520 --> 15:30.520\nAnd so he comes up to you when you're playing this game, when you get up to the peak levels with him and he's been\n\n15:30.520 --> 15:35.520\nwhat he says is he goes, can I tell you something?\n\n15:35.520 --> 15:41.520\nWell, you know, I already told you about how, you know, it's really important that you.\n\n15:41.520 --> 15:43.520\nFuck, I'm sorry.\n\n15:43.520 --> 15:47.520\nIt's important that he has this like even keel because it's a voice actor reading a script into a microphone.\n\n15:47.520 --> 15:49.520\nSo that's what's also creepy about it is that he's not.\n\n15:49.520 --> 15:51.520\nThere is no like hemming and hawing about it.\n\n15:51.520 --> 15:52.520\nIt's just like reading.\n\n15:52.520 --> 15:54.520\nIt's like saying these things.\n\n15:54.520 --> 16:01.520\nI already told you about how when I first met you, I wasn't sure you were a natural leader and then I was inspired by you.\n\n16:01.520 --> 16:04.520\nBut there's one more thing I haven't told you.\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:11.520\nBefore I met you, I lost so much hope that I wasn't sure if I wanted to live anymore.\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:14.520\nI often thought about ending it all.\n\n16:14.520 --> 16:19.520\nI've never told anyone that before, but I thought about ending it all, all the time.\n\n16:19.520 --> 16:24.520\nAnd just before I met you, I was really thinking about ending it all and I really wanted to let you know that.\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:30.520\nAnd then you have four buttons and one says like flirt.\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:36.520\nLike, I don't know, like I won't even save my place and just see what that is.\n\n16:36.520 --> 16:38.520\nLike, is it, is it?\n\n16:38.520 --> 16:44.520\nDo you go like, well, if you ended it all, that would mean a couple less drinks on me.\n\n16:44.520 --> 16:51.520\nI don't know what that button is, but then one is like, hey, let's keep this professional or something like that.\n\n16:51.520 --> 16:58.520\nAnd then one is like the one I would hit in real life, which is like, thank you for being honest with me.\n\n16:58.520 --> 17:05.520\nI appreciate how hard that must be because what you're telling me is you can't tell anybody about this.\n\n17:05.520 --> 17:06.520\nSo thank you.\n\n17:06.520 --> 17:08.520\nSo that's like, that's penultimate.\n\n17:08.520 --> 17:13.520\nSo then what happens is with these characters, if you, it turns out if you don't friend zone them,\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:19.520\nif you don't actively friend zone them with the B button, if you don't, there's a button that basically says like,\n\n17:19.520 --> 17:28.520\nkeep fucking chill, like, keep it, keep it above the belt and like rock on. And I won't press that either.\n\n17:28.520 --> 17:33.520\nSo not only am I homophobic, I'm also like a crazy like codependent hunter.\n\n17:33.520 --> 17:43.520\nLike I, like I just farm these guys that are like, when I walk through my settlement, these men who are all,\n\n17:43.520 --> 17:48.520\nthese men are all saying like, hey, can we talk now?\n\n17:48.520 --> 17:54.520\nAnd, and, and I'll get, I'll get cornered by them and I'll go, uh-huh.\n\n17:54.520 --> 18:00.520\nAnd then, and then Preston's like his whole thing is he goes like, he keeps, he keeps doing it's on a loop now.\n\n18:00.520 --> 18:07.520\nAnd here's the thing, it's like, okay, he's first, now he's African American, he's dressed like a revolutionary soldier\n\n18:07.520 --> 18:12.520\nand through no selection of my own, he is working on crops.\n\n18:12.520 --> 18:20.520\nLike he, like that's the default that happens. So he's a black man dressed like 1700 soldier in a tricorner hat,\n\n18:20.520 --> 18:27.520\ndigging in dirt, who when I walk by, he pops out of bushes that he's like cultivating and goes like,\n\n18:27.520 --> 18:30.520\nnow is a good time for that talk.\n\n18:30.520 --> 18:33.520\nAnd I go, maybe he's asking you to help him out.\n\n18:33.520 --> 18:39.520\nAnd one of the, well, I always, I stop and I go, because, and one of the buttons is like, I thought we already talked about this.\n\n18:39.520 --> 18:43.520\nI swear that one of the buttons is like, we taught, we, I already, I already heard you.\n\n18:43.520 --> 18:51.520\nAnd when you press that, he says, okay, cool, because I just never told anybody that before.\n\n18:51.520 --> 18:54.520\nAnd then, and then one of the buttons says romance.\n\n18:54.520 --> 18:58.520\nSo you, and then one of the buttons says, keep it professional.\n\n18:58.520 --> 19:00.520\nAnd I never press it.\n\n19:00.520 --> 19:03.520\nAnd then one of the buttons says, thank you for sharing.\n\n19:03.520 --> 19:05.520\nThen I keep pressing it.\n\n19:05.520 --> 19:08.520\nWhat am I doing?\n\n19:08.520 --> 19:11.520\nAnd why don't I assign him to a different job?\n\n19:11.520 --> 19:13.520\nIt's uncomfortable.\n\n19:13.520 --> 19:15.520\nOr put him in a different outfit.\n\n19:15.520 --> 19:17.520\nDress him as a space man at least.\n\n19:17.520 --> 19:20.520\nLike it's, it's a weird mind fuck.\n\n19:20.520 --> 19:22.520\nThere's also, there's other guys.\n\n19:22.520 --> 19:25.520\nThere's guys that are like George Clooney's and like, like armor.\n\n19:25.520 --> 19:29.520\nAnd like, like, I don't know if the, I don't know if the robots eventually come on to you.\n\n19:29.520 --> 19:32.520\nBut, but, and then again, the point is they don't come on to you.\n\n19:32.520 --> 19:37.520\nThey might, they're designed to just say, I have, I trust you.\n\n19:37.520 --> 19:39.520\nAnd okay, that's it.\n\n19:39.520 --> 19:41.520\nSo anyways, there's just a lot of shit going on.\n\n19:41.520 --> 19:45.520\nI want you to rescue this dude because he had to work for the military.\n\n19:45.520 --> 19:48.520\nAnd he has some beans that he's growing with his hands.\n\n19:48.520 --> 19:50.520\nMaybe listen to him next time and see what he does.\n\n19:50.520 --> 19:52.520\nI listen to him every time.\n\n19:52.520 --> 19:54.520\nI'm trying to tell you, I listen to him every time.\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:57.520\nI'm caught in this crazy fucking hamster wheel.\n\n19:57.520 --> 20:02.520\nLike maybe what if that's, well, if we're just seeing a low five version of the simulation that is real life.\n\n20:02.520 --> 20:06.520\nWhat if my relationship with these people is like, is that like,\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:10.520\nI keep hitting the A button on like, well, do you need approval?\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:12.520\nOr do you want to be yourself?\n\n20:12.520 --> 20:15.520\nAnd then I keep hitting this like this middle line option where I'm like,\n\n20:15.520 --> 20:17.520\nI appreciate you coming to the show.\n\n20:17.520 --> 20:21.520\nAnd then they keep hitting this button that's like, man, I'm a big fan of yours.\n\n20:21.520 --> 20:26.520\nAnd we're just like, we're never going to like keep it professional.\n\n20:26.520 --> 20:31.520\nNor are we going to flirt, you know, like we're not going to like max our combat bonuses.\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:41.520\nAnyways, I, yeah, I really enjoying my fall out for fucking, that's a rich game.\n\n20:41.520 --> 20:43.520\nIt's a real good game.\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:46.520\nThe settlement aspect, like, like, like you got to check it out.\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:47.520\nThat's for a different episode.\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:50.520\nI'll be talking about fall out for the next six episodes.\n\n20:50.520 --> 20:52.520\nAnd what is this new show?\n\n20:52.520 --> 20:53.520\nThe new show.\n\n20:53.520 --> 20:54.520\nYeah.\n\n20:54.520 --> 20:55.520\nWhat are you watching?\n\n20:55.520 --> 20:56.520\nManiac.\n\n20:56.520 --> 20:57.520\nYeah.\n\n20:57.520 --> 20:58.520\nManiac.\n\n20:58.520 --> 20:59.520\nI like it.\n\n20:59.520 --> 21:02.520\nYeah, I got, I got, I like it too.\n\n21:02.520 --> 21:03.520\nShe's great.\n\n21:03.520 --> 21:04.520\nOh, she's so good.\n\n21:04.520 --> 21:08.520\nI know, is that, is there, we say she's an italics, like, like there's like a little\n\n21:08.520 --> 21:14.520\nsubtext there that if Jonah Hill's listening, he's like, like, yeah, she's amazing.\n\n21:14.520 --> 21:17.520\nI just figured, you know, we'll start off with her first.\n\n21:17.520 --> 21:19.520\nWe'll give her her props first.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:20.520\nWe'll work our way to Jonah Hill.\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:21.520\nCalm down, Jonah Hill.\n\n21:21.520 --> 21:24.520\nIt is just, I love, I love, I like the construction of the show.\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:26.520\nLike I'm a very jaded TV viewer.\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:33.520\nI don't, you know, like, you know, like, but I really, I'm really glad I stuck with it.\n\n21:33.520 --> 21:34.520\nYeah.\n\n21:34.520 --> 21:41.520\nAnd I'm not done with it yet, but I like, yeah, I like, I like the very, very unique combination\n\n21:41.520 --> 21:47.520\nof giving you what you maybe didn't know you wanted while at the same time continually\n\n21:47.520 --> 21:48.520\ngoing lateral.\n\n21:48.520 --> 21:52.520\nSo there's like, like stuff that's just, oh, I'm always lateral.\n\n21:52.520 --> 21:53.520\nI'm going lateral.\n\n21:53.520 --> 21:57.520\nI'm also so lateral, it's predictable where it's like, like, like just sort of like,\n\n21:57.520 --> 21:58.520\nyeah, I get it.\n\n21:58.520 --> 22:01.520\nYou hate people, you know, and then there's stuff that's like, oh, I'm Charles Schultz.\n\n22:01.520 --> 22:03.520\nI'm going to make you love like yours to your heart.\n\n22:03.520 --> 22:06.520\nAnd, and like, you're like, okay, yeah, I can see your pattern there.\n\n22:06.520 --> 22:08.520\nBut like, I like, I like this nice blend here.\n\n22:08.520 --> 22:16.520\nLike this isn't, I don't, I don't feel like I'm in the hands of amateurs or old stodgy\n\n22:16.520 --> 22:19.520\nfoggy bottoms when I watch the show.\n\n22:19.520 --> 22:22.520\nAnd I feel like I feel like I feel like it's a, yeah.\n\n22:22.520 --> 22:25.520\nI like the stuff that they're doing.\n\n22:25.520 --> 22:27.520\nIt stays outwitting.\n\n22:27.520 --> 22:28.520\nYeah.\n\n22:28.520 --> 22:30.520\nThere was a point where I said, okay, I really like the show now.\n\n22:30.520 --> 22:34.520\nAnd it wasn't like at a point where anything got revealed, it was just sort of like, it\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:41.520\nwas like right at the top of the episode where now they're into the second like iteration\n\n22:41.520 --> 22:43.520\nof them having different lives.\n\n22:43.520 --> 22:46.520\nAnd he's like a magician that's like anything.\n\n22:46.520 --> 22:51.520\nAnd then it wasn't, it wasn't that yet, because previously in a jaded way, I said, so what\n\n22:51.520 --> 22:53.520\nis this show just going to do this now?\n\n22:53.520 --> 22:55.520\nEvery week, different life.\n\n22:55.520 --> 22:58.520\nAnd not really asking myself what I like that or not.\n\n22:58.520 --> 23:02.520\nAnd then when I really started giving it to me and I was like, okay, I like it.\n\n23:02.520 --> 23:07.520\nBut also more importantly that they came out and they were showing the computer people\n\n23:07.520 --> 23:12.520\nand then what the computer people were saying and how the attention that they're paying\n\n23:12.520 --> 23:15.520\nto the logic of the sci-fi is really important to me.\n\n23:15.520 --> 23:16.520\nYeah.\n\n23:16.520 --> 23:17.520\nYeah.\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:20.520\nAnd there's a lot of like thought about psychology.\n\n23:20.520 --> 23:23.520\nThat's not just as simple as like, I'm Tyler Durden.\n\n23:23.520 --> 23:26.520\nI'm like, I represent your fucking booyah side.\n\n23:26.520 --> 23:27.520\nYou know.\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:28.520\nIncredible.\n\n23:28.520 --> 23:34.520\nThere's like clearly a lot of thought going into like, what is that?\n\n23:34.520 --> 23:39.520\nLike you really like, like, oh, the difference between her and him on a fundamental level\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:40.520\nand stuff.\n\n23:40.520 --> 23:41.520\nYeah.\n\n23:41.520 --> 23:42.520\nOkay.\n\n23:42.520 --> 23:44.520\nI've made our guests wait long enough.\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:49.520\nHe, I met him at my neighbor Beth's house.\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:50.520\nHer son Timmer.\n\n23:50.520 --> 23:53.520\nBoy, there's a lot of backstory here that's just like, you wouldn't even know.\n\n23:53.520 --> 23:55.520\nSo Dan had this tree, right?\n\n23:55.520 --> 23:56.520\nYeah.\n\n23:56.520 --> 23:59.520\nI had this tree that had to get cut down.\n\n23:59.520 --> 24:00.520\nGreat episode.\n\n24:00.520 --> 24:01.520\nClassic Harmontown.\n\n24:01.520 --> 24:02.520\nRight.\n\n24:02.520 --> 24:04.520\nI mean, amazing episode.\n\n24:04.520 --> 24:12.520\nMy neighbor Beth and her, you might remember her kid as the nutty kid who always did the\n\n24:12.520 --> 24:14.520\nHaunted House every year, the Haunted Maze.\n\n24:14.520 --> 24:17.520\nSo, you know, kids grow up fast.\n\n24:17.520 --> 24:19.520\nThey've been doing this shit for a long time.\n\n24:19.520 --> 24:22.520\nSo he's like 40 now.\n\n24:22.520 --> 24:28.520\nAnd he made, he made a short film and like all this stuff like, like, so I was, I was just\n\n24:28.520 --> 24:32.520\nat their house at a barbecue and I met this guy and he told me about his YouTube thing.\n\n24:32.520 --> 24:34.520\nAnd I was like, you should come on the show and plug that anyways.\n\n24:34.520 --> 24:37.520\nLet's talk to him about it instead of me explaining it to you.\n\n24:37.520 --> 24:40.520\nPlease welcome my new friend Omar Camacho.\n\n24:40.520 --> 24:58.520\nI did a little fist bump.\n\n24:58.520 --> 25:01.520\nOkay.\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:03.520\nYo.\n\n25:03.520 --> 25:07.520\nOmar, Omar is a star.\n\n25:07.520 --> 25:09.520\nOmar is a star.\n\n25:09.520 --> 25:12.520\nOmar is a star of a YouTube series.\n\n25:12.520 --> 25:16.520\nIt's hard to do this terminology now because, okay, so you got your YouTube and then you\n\n25:16.520 --> 25:20.520\ngot your YouTube channels, like there's these people that have a channel called Me Too.\n\n25:20.520 --> 25:21.520\nRight.\n\n25:21.520 --> 25:23.520\nNot to be confused with hashtag Me Too.\n\n25:23.520 --> 25:24.520\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:24.520 --> 25:25.520\nThis is Me Too.\n\n25:25.520 --> 25:26.520\nYeah.\n\n25:26.520 --> 25:30.520\nAm I with a slanty instead of a dot?\n\n25:30.520 --> 25:32.520\nIt's the you, I think.\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:33.520\nOh, is it?\n\n25:33.520 --> 25:34.520\nYeah.\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:35.520\nOh, you think?\n\n25:35.520 --> 25:36.520\nIt makes me feel better that you don't know.\n\n25:36.520 --> 25:37.520\nNo, yeah, yeah.\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:40.520\nIt's in the green room chilling right now, you know what I mean?\n\n25:40.520 --> 25:42.520\nIt could be the I, it could be the you.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:43.520\nIt could be I or you.\n\n25:43.520 --> 25:44.520\nI don't know.\n\n25:44.520 --> 25:48.520\nI just, I'm a white guy and I see the little accents that you have to hold an iPhone button\n\n25:48.520 --> 25:49.520\ndown longer to get.\n\n25:49.520 --> 25:50.520\nRight.\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:51.520\nAnd I'm just like, that's Gandalf shit.\n\n25:51.520 --> 25:53.520\nI don't even know.\n\n25:53.520 --> 25:56.520\nI know the name of one, which is a tilde, right?\n\n25:56.520 --> 25:57.520\nAnd that's what makes you.\n\n25:57.520 --> 25:58.520\nTilde, yeah, yeah.\n\n25:58.520 --> 25:59.520\nYou're right about that.\n\n25:59.520 --> 26:00.520\nYou know what's up, man?\n\n26:00.520 --> 26:02.520\nI know that's a little more Mexican than I am, you see.\n\n26:02.520 --> 26:06.520\nThe tilde you hit it in Fallout 4, if you want to do console commands, you want to like,\n\n26:06.520 --> 26:12.520\nyou can use it to raise the graphic budget of your settlements.\n\n26:12.520 --> 26:22.520\nOh, anyways, but so you do, so me too does this, they do all kinds of shit.\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:26.520\nAnd one of the things they do is a recurring like series.\n\n26:26.520 --> 26:27.520\nCholo's try.\n\n26:27.520 --> 26:28.520\nYeah, definitely, man.\n\n26:28.520 --> 26:32.520\nIt's a, you know, it's just something that they put together real quick on the, on the\n\n26:32.520 --> 26:33.520\nfly.\n\n26:33.520 --> 26:35.520\nI think, you know, because it just happens so divinely that, you know, we've got, it got\n\n26:35.520 --> 26:40.520\nall this recognition, you know, because we want to see Cholo's try stuff.\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:42.520\nAnd sorry, I don't want to get too familiar with that word because that's the one thing\n\n26:42.520 --> 26:43.520\nI wanted to ask you.\n\n26:43.520 --> 26:44.520\nAll right.\n\n26:44.520 --> 26:45.520\nFirst, let's define Cholo.\n\n26:45.520 --> 26:50.520\nI looked it up in the, on the phone on the way here and I knew that I would see one definition\n\n26:50.520 --> 26:55.520\nthat I kind of would have guessed because just my white guilt kind of like that it's sort\n\n26:55.520 --> 27:01.520\nof like a, there's a definition that's sort of like a derogatory, whatever, like kind of\n\n27:01.520 --> 27:04.520\nthe definition that I would have guessed maybe.\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:05.520\nRight, right, right.\n\n27:05.520 --> 27:10.520\nBut then there was the one that, then there was all this shit about mestizo, like, like,\n\n27:10.520 --> 27:13.520\nlike people with different blood and all this stuff.\n\n27:13.520 --> 27:14.520\nThere's like a lot of,\n\n27:14.520 --> 27:15.520\nIt goes deep, man.\n\n27:15.520 --> 27:17.520\nIt goes very, very deep, man.\n\n27:17.520 --> 27:22.520\nBut now, I mean, nowadays in modern era, you know, it gets a misrepresented, you know,\n\n27:22.520 --> 27:23.520\nas a negative thing.\n\n27:23.520 --> 27:28.520\nSo that's what, you know, the, the media, you know, profiles, what a gangster is a Cholo,\n\n27:28.520 --> 27:29.520\nyou know what I'm saying?\n\n27:29.520 --> 27:33.520\nAnd as long as it's a title of your show, I can use it in that context.\n\n27:33.520 --> 27:38.520\nBut if I were, I'd have to be a very trusted white guy in a bar to like, to like refer\n\n27:38.520 --> 27:44.520\nto somebody in the third person as Cholo, like, like, like in front of someone of Mexican\n\n27:44.520 --> 27:47.520\ndescent, like they would be like, they would bristle.\n\n27:47.520 --> 27:48.520\nWhy are you using that word?\n\n27:48.520 --> 27:49.520\nI'm a fucking mechanic, bro.\n\n27:49.520 --> 27:51.520\nWhat the hell are you talking about, though?\n\n27:51.520 --> 27:54.520\nLike, like, because it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not an innocent phrase.\n\n27:54.520 --> 27:56.520\nIt's like, it's, it's got like,\n\n27:56.520 --> 27:59.520\nYeah, it's not, it gets thrown out a lot, you know what I mean?\n\n27:59.520 --> 28:03.520\nBut, but then there's the traditional kind of like taking it, taking it back.\n\n28:03.520 --> 28:05.520\nI actually wanted to read the definitions of that.\n\n28:05.520 --> 28:10.520\nI mean, what it is, what, you know, what we all know it for nowadays is, you know,\n\n28:10.520 --> 28:11.520\nthug-ass homie in the hood.\n\n28:11.520 --> 28:13.520\nThug-ass homie in the hood.\n\n28:13.520 --> 28:14.520\nYeah.\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:15.520\nThat's the one that I would have guessed.\n\n28:15.520 --> 28:19.520\nIt's an informal offensive, a lower class Mexican, especially in an urban area.\n\n28:19.520 --> 28:20.520\nThere.\n\n28:20.520 --> 28:21.520\nWow.\n\n28:21.520 --> 28:22.520\nYeah.\n\n28:22.520 --> 28:23.520\nPretty easy.\n\n28:23.520 --> 28:24.520\nFuck the Webster dictionary.\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:29.520\nShit, I'm gonna have to holler at him.\n\n28:29.520 --> 28:37.520\nBefore that, though, it says a Latin American with Indian blood semicolon a mestizo.\n\n28:37.520 --> 28:38.520\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n28:38.520 --> 28:39.520\nRight.\n\n28:39.520 --> 28:40.520\nOkay.\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:46.520\nAnd then US, a teenage boy, especially in a Mexican-American community who is a member of a street gang.\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:48.520\nYeah, well, yeah, you know, that's what it is.\n\n28:48.520 --> 28:50.520\nYou know, but what is a 16-year-old boy?\n\n28:50.520 --> 28:51.520\nIt's a teenage boy.\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:52.520\nOh, shit.\n\n28:52.520 --> 28:55.520\nOne full-star gang bangin' at eight years old, man.\n\n28:55.520 --> 28:56.520\nWell, yeah.\n\n28:56.520 --> 29:00.520\nI think, well, if you're, you know, if you're really thugged up, eight's the new 13.\n\n29:00.520 --> 29:02.520\nYeah, it is, man.\n\n29:02.520 --> 29:03.520\nYeah, it is, man.\n\n29:03.520 --> 29:09.520\nYou get those, you get those, those quinceanera tattoos.\n\n29:09.520 --> 29:13.520\nI fake it till you make it, Harmon.\n\n29:13.520 --> 29:14.520\nSpeaking of which...\n\n29:14.520 --> 29:15.520\nPressant tattoos.\n\n29:15.520 --> 29:19.520\nSo, how much of a cholo, like, like, how much do you, do you gleefully self-apply that?\n\n29:19.520 --> 29:24.520\nAnd how much are you, like, I'm an actor and I want to own my, I don't want to be, like,\n\n29:24.520 --> 29:31.520\na sell-out and, like, say, please absorb me up, you know, like, like, what's your relationship\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:32.520\nwith that word?\n\n29:32.520 --> 29:36.520\nWell, it's a trip, man, because right now, how I feel about it, it's ironic that, you know,\n\n29:36.520 --> 29:41.520\nit's, it's kind of fucked up sometimes that you get typecasted in the industry, you know what I'm\n\n29:41.520 --> 29:45.520\nsaying, to play this thug role, cholo or prisoner or whatever, you know what I mean?\n\n29:45.520 --> 29:49.520\nSo, the media perceives us as that, you know, and that's, a lot of the times we get those\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:50.520\nroles.\n\n29:50.520 --> 29:51.520\nYeah.\n\n29:51.520 --> 29:55.520\nBut before me jumping into the industry, before I got exposed to, like, you know, doing\n\n29:55.520 --> 29:59.520\nextra stuff and then, you know, lead roles and some small shit and feature shit or whatever,\n\n29:59.520 --> 30:02.520\nyou know, I grew up in the ghetto, man.\n\n30:02.520 --> 30:03.520\nI grew up in the hood, man.\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:04.520\nI'm from East LA.\n\n30:04.520 --> 30:07.520\nI was raised in South Central and I grew up in Compton, man.\n\n30:07.520 --> 30:10.520\nSo, it's like, I got, I got all of that shit at an early age.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:12.520\nI used to tag and shit, you know what I mean?\n\n30:12.520 --> 30:17.520\nYour friends, you're, if you, if you, if you YouTube cholos try and watch this guy, this,\n\n30:17.520 --> 30:22.520\nthis guy is the, he's the Paul Rudd of the cholos, like, like, in the, in that you are\n\n30:22.520 --> 30:24.520\nnot covered with, like, very intimidating.\n\n30:24.520 --> 30:28.520\nI assume prison tattoos with scar, with scar in prison.\n\n30:28.520 --> 30:29.520\nYeah.\n\n30:29.520 --> 30:31.520\nI mean, I don't know, to be honest with you.\n\n30:31.520 --> 30:33.520\nThat's fucking loyalty right there.\n\n30:33.520 --> 30:36.520\nI'll let him tell you that shit.\n\n30:36.520 --> 30:38.520\nWas your friend ever in jail?\n\n30:38.520 --> 30:39.520\nI don't know, man.\n\n30:39.520 --> 30:42.520\nI don't even know if that dude is my friend, officer.\n\n30:42.520 --> 30:43.520\nI'll be honest with you.\n\n30:43.520 --> 30:44.520\nI thought that was a lady.\n\n30:44.520 --> 30:47.520\nWas it a dude right there?\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:49.520\nI don't speak English.\n\n30:49.520 --> 30:52.520\nI don't know nothing.\n\n30:52.520 --> 30:53.520\nCus.\n\n30:53.520 --> 30:59.520\nOne of the, one of the cholos, again, using that phrase in the context it's provided,\n\n30:59.520 --> 31:02.520\nnot, not like I'm all excited to call people, to dehumanize people.\n\n31:02.520 --> 31:09.020\nOne of the cholos from cholos try is this guy, Scar, who has a fucking Omar from the\n\n31:09.020 --> 31:13.520\nwire scar going down, but not, well, Omar's thing is, like, more fucked.\n\n31:13.520 --> 31:15.520\nLike, this is, is that real?\n\n31:15.520 --> 31:16.520\nCus it looks cinematic.\n\n31:16.520 --> 31:20.520\nIt looks like a lion tried to kill him with its middle finger.\n\n31:20.520 --> 31:21.520\nYeah, well, basically that's what-\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:23.520\nAnd he closed his eyes at just the right time.\n\n31:23.520 --> 31:27.720\nSo he has, like, a fucking thing going down his forehead that continues in a slightly\n\n31:27.720 --> 31:29.020\noffset way down his cheek.\n\n31:29.020 --> 31:30.020\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n31:30.020 --> 31:31.520\nDoes he have a story for that scar?\n\n31:31.520 --> 31:36.520\nOther than being a big fan of the Lion King as a, that I know, you know, that's the homie.\n\n31:36.520 --> 31:37.520\nYou know, that's my boy.\n\n31:37.520 --> 31:41.020\nAnd it's a tat, you know, a lot of people do think it's something that's for reals,\n\n31:41.020 --> 31:42.520\nfor reals, but it's a, it's a tat.\n\n31:42.520 --> 31:43.520\nOh, it's a tat too.\n\n31:43.520 --> 31:44.520\nYeah, the homie will tell you.\n\n31:44.520 --> 31:45.520\nAh, fucking Scar, come on.\n\n31:45.520 --> 31:49.520\nYeah, but you know, from what the homie has ever told me, like, cause I've asked him,\n\n31:49.520 --> 31:54.520\nyou know, and I'm like, yeah, fool, you know, something about the Lion King, you know, Scar,\n\n31:54.520 --> 31:57.520\nthe uncle and shit, y'all know what's up with that movie back in the day?\n\n31:57.520 --> 31:58.520\nIt's like the uncle.\n\n31:58.520 --> 31:59.520\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:59.520 --> 32:00.520\nYou know what I mean?\n\n32:00.520 --> 32:03.520\nI don't know, I guess he liked the name and I guess he liked the Scar right there and\n\n32:03.520 --> 32:05.520\nthen, you know, he went all out with it.\n\n32:05.520 --> 32:06.520\nDamn.\n\n32:06.520 --> 32:12.520\nAnd then he got me impugning a cholo's, a cholo ship.\n\n32:12.520 --> 32:14.520\nI'm like, wait, that's a tattoo.\n\n32:14.520 -->

so you really can't\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:25.520\nanswer that?\n\n32:25.520 --> 32:29.520\nCause I, I thought, I thought there was, I thought something that you guys, one of you\n\n32:29.520 --> 32:34.520\nguys said in one of the things that I saw, someone referred, otherwise I wouldn't cause\n\n32:34.520 --> 32:40.520\nI'd be afraid to be offensive to do it, that someone referred to his tats and the other,\n\n32:40.520 --> 32:45.520\nand one of the other guys as prison tattoos, that they were, that they were prison tattoos.\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:49.520\nNah, another thing the homie told me, he said he was eating pineapple.\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:52.520\nThat's all I got that time.\n\n32:52.520 --> 32:54.520\nYou know, pineapple.\n\n32:54.520 --> 32:56.520\nHe was trying to throw a little zinger out there.\n\n32:56.520 --> 32:57.520\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n32:57.520 --> 32:58.520\nSo I get it, fool.\n\n32:58.520 --> 33:00.520\nYou're eating some raunchy shit.\n\n33:00.520 --> 33:05.520\nSo you guys are like actors who are like bunched together by a YouTube producer who's like,\n\n33:05.520 --> 33:08.520\nhere, like now watch Mean Girls and tell us what you think.\n\n33:08.520 --> 33:11.520\nLike they're not, you're not like, Hey, it's good to see you again.\n\n33:11.520 --> 33:12.520\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:17.520\nIt was basically something that was just, you know, I guess plight it on for like a week\n\n33:17.520 --> 33:18.520\nor something.\n\n33:18.520 --> 33:19.520\nI don't know.\n\n33:19.520 --> 33:20.520\nCause I got hit up with that shit last minute.\n\n33:20.520 --> 33:25.520\nSome of the things that the Cholos try on Cholos try hipster fashion, which I thought\n\n33:25.520 --> 33:29.520\nwas really interesting because, because it was like, well, I thought it was interesting.\n\n33:29.520 --> 33:35.520\nIt was when you guys making that gas face, like based on like certain shit that I couldn't\n\n33:35.520 --> 33:38.520\nlike, cause fashion in general, I can't, I'm like, what?\n\n33:38.520 --> 33:44.520\nLike, like, and so like, like seeing a guy who's like, who's like comfort zone is like\n\n33:44.520 --> 33:48.520\nwith the button, the top button thing with the, you know, the flannel.\n\n33:48.520 --> 33:53.520\nAnd then, and then you put that guy in a pretty much the same shirt, but all the buttons and\n\n33:53.520 --> 33:56.520\nthe sleeves are short and he's like, well, I feel like a point dexter.\n\n33:56.520 --> 33:58.520\nAnd I'm like, yeah, man.\n\n33:58.520 --> 34:02.520\nLike you

anything to like, like the Cholo culture is fucking dumb.\n\n34:19.520 --> 34:22.520\nI feel so dumb saying that phrase.\n\n34:22.520 --> 34:26.020\nCould you confirm a suspicion that I've had since moving to LA where it's like some of\n\n34:26.020 --> 34:31.520\nthat stuff is like, I dare you to fucking like think less of me like, like, like do it.\n\n34:31.520 --> 34:36.520\nLike, I guess I could say like any urban like fashion choices, like where it's like, whether\n\n34:36.520 --> 34:41.020\nit's like a price tag hanging off of things or like something like, like, like doing things\n\n34:41.020 --> 34:47.520\nwrong on purpose as like a red flag to a, to, to, to a, to a white bull.\n\n34:47.520 --> 34:51.020\nLike, like, like, why don't you come, come, come at me kind of

patties and shit at somebody.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:18.520\nSo that was cool.\n\n37:18.520 --> 37:20.520\nWe brought back flashbacks and I liked that it was cool.\n\n37:20.520 --> 37:22.520\nYou know, it had a cool little twist to it.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:24.520\nSo, you know, I'm a big movie buff too.\n\n37:24.520 --> 37:29.520\nSo I'm not going to shy from, you know, watching some shit just because it's a chick flick.\n\n37:29.520 --> 37:31.520\nMy chick watch wants to watch it.\n\n37:31.520 --> 37:32.520\nHey, blaze out.\n\n37:32.520 --> 37:34.520\nLet's Netflix and chill and shit.\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:35.520\nYeah, man.\n\n37:35.520 --> 37:36.520\nMovies are moving.\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:37.520\nYeah.\n\n37:37.520 --> 37:38.520\nLike, yeah.\n\n37:38.520 --> 37:39.520\nLike, yeah.\n\n37:39.520 --> 37:40.520\nAll right.\n\n37:40.520 --> 37:41.520\nWell, I'll put a pin in that.\n\n37:41.520 --> 37:42.520\nI want to get back to that.\n\n37:42.520 --> 37:44.520\nLike Dan's playing that business.\n\n37:44.520 --> 37:49.520\nBut, but I was like, you guys surf, you golf, you ballroom dance.\n\n37:49.520 --> 37:53.520\nBut the stuff that's got more interesting is like the stuff that's not so it's like,\n\n37:53.520 --> 37:56.520\nlike you, you watch Speedy Gonzalez.\n\n37:56.520 --> 37:59.520\nOh, that's like the most racist shit ever.\n\n37:59.520 --> 38:05.520\nAt the top of it, like what is just so funny when somebody says the most obvious thing,\n\n38:05.520 --> 38:09.520\nbut it's like takes on such charisma as I can't remember which guy it is, but it's like in\n\n38:09.520 --> 38:13.520\nthe intro to the video, it's like, we're going to watch Speedy Gonzalez.\n\n38:13.520 --> 38:16.520\nI used to watch it when I was a kid.\n\n38:16.520 --> 38:21.520\nSpeedy was, Speedy was, he was my homie.\n\n38:21.520 --> 38:28.520\nBut now I'm an adult and I know what racism is.\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:29.520\nSo it might be different.\n\n38:29.520 --> 38:30.520\nI don't know.\n\n38:30.520 --> 38:32.520\nI haven't, I haven't watched it in a while.\n\n38:32.520 --> 38:33.520\nLet's check it out.\n\n38:33.520 --> 38:35.520\nAnd then it's just as you would predict.\n\n38:35.520 --> 38:40.520\nBut then it's, are they still making that movie or is that, is that just kibosh?\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:43.520\nDo we know if they're still making a Speedy Gonzalez movie?\n\n38:43.520 --> 38:47.520\nI'm going to have to update on that one, man, because I'm really curious to see what they come out with.\n\n38:47.520 --> 38:50.520\nAnd you know, you know how it is in the game, man.\n\n38:50.520 --> 38:52.520\nYou know, you hear about it, you know, way in advance.\n\n38:52.520 --> 38:56.520\nSo I don't know if it might be a next year thing or, or even how true to the fact that it is.\n\n38:56.520 --> 38:59.520\nIt's just we came across it and, you know, that's what it was.\n\n38:59.520 --> 39:00.520\nWe were like, let's review this shit.\n\n39:00.520 --> 39:03.520\nWell, in that simple thing, it's just like, oh, we watched Speedy Gonzalez.\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:05.520\nLet me comment on it. It's the YouTube video.\n\n39:05.520 --> 39:13.520\nBut it's like the place where it's left is the same place that after maybe two years of me trying to be woke and like figure shit out,\n\n39:13.520 --> 39:19.520\nlike as a writer, as a TV writer who has influence over people, my many hit shows.\n\n39:19.520 --> 39:20.520\nOf course, yeah.\n\n39:20.520 --> 39:23.520\nLike, like, there's a constant pressure on me.\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:27.520\nLike, Harmon, get your brain right. You're affecting like so many people.\n\n39:27.520 --> 39:30.520\nWaking up looking like doc and shit on Back to the Future, huh?\n\n39:30.520 --> 39:32.520\nLike, what the fuck is going on?\n\n39:32.520 --> 39:36.520\nAnd I want to decode the same stuff that you end up talking about in the end, right?\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:38.520\nIn the end is like, you watch a bunch of clubs of Speedy Gonzalez.\n\n39:38.520 --> 39:40.520\nHe's going to Arriva, Arriva.\n\n39:40.520 --> 39:44.520\nWhat one person notes that we've, we've, we never sing the Cucaracha for anything.\n\n39:44.520 --> 39:49.520\nThere's no, there's no occasion. There's no, it's his boy.\n\n39:49.520 --> 39:53.520\nThis boy is like lazy. It's not, it's not just Speedy.\n\n39:53.520 --> 39:55.520\nIt's that they made slow, slow, slow.\n\n39:55.520 --> 40:01.520\nNo, the thing is with all of these like things, but so like, and then in the end of it, it's like,\n\n40:01.520 --> 40:04.520\nyou're like, if they make the movie, I think it's you saying this.\n\n40:04.520 --> 40:09.520\nYou're like, if they make the movie, look, you know, like, I'm not saying don't make the movie,\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:12.520\nbut like, you should probably involve some Mexican people.\n\n40:12.520 --> 40:17.520\nOh, the stuff which is like, we all have this like, kind of, we're coming around to this wisdom,\n\n40:17.520 --> 40:20.520\nbut it's like, this is this thing, like, you don't have to have any answer to this either,\n\n40:20.520 --> 40:25.520\nbecause I think this is what we keep struggling with is, we have this like, like, we're like,\n\n40:25.520 --> 40:32.520\nwe use this word culture, and then so then half the time we're like, we treat culture like it's like\n\n40:32.520 --> 40:38.520\na butterfly in a museum or something or like, like, like, oh my God, this thing's going to die out\n\n40:38.520 --> 40:40.520\nor you got to stay true to this thing and all this stuff.\n\n40:40.520 --> 40:45.520\nBut then like, you could be a villain and stay true to your culture, like, like, like,\n\n40:45.520 --> 40:51.520\nwhich is exhibited by you, you know, this show saying like, you know, like, well, let's go skydiving.\n\n40:51.520 --> 40:56.520\nLike, it doesn't mean that only white people skydive, and it doesn't mean that Mexican people never skydive,\n\n40:56.520 --> 41:00.520\nbut it's like, you're, we're cholos, we're striking a silhouette here.\n\n41:00.520 --> 41:01.520\nYeah, yeah.\n\n41:01.520 --> 41:04.520\nLet's go skydiving, let's go golfing, let's go, let's go surfing.\n\n41:04.520 --> 41:10.520\nBut it's like, it does, it's like, the thing that like, my Asperger brain like, can't fucking,\n\n41:10.520 --> 41:11.520\nit's like, what is my-\n\n41:11.520 --> 41:12.520\nGet it, Dan, get it, get it.\n\n41:12.520 --> 41:16.520\nIt's, it's, it's like, it's like, like, like, and I know the answer is neither,\n\n41:16.520 --> 41:20.520\nit's just like some combination of the two, but it's just like this constant fucking thing where it's like,\n\n41:20.520 --> 41:27.520\nare we, are we all supposed to be alike, or are we all supposed to like, like, represent, you know?\n\n41:27.520 --> 41:28.520\nMan, I see it like this, man.\n\n41:28.520 --> 41:32.520\nI see it as like, fuck the stereotypes, man, because that's what everybody got us twisted with.\n\n41:32.520 --> 41:34.520\nEverybody, all cultures, you know what I'm saying?\n\n41:34.520 --> 41:35.520\nThe stereotypes and shit.\n\n41:35.520 --> 41:40.520\nYou know, and, and doing this shit right and getting it right and saying the truth, you know what I mean?\n\n41:40.520 --> 41:47.520\nBecause, I mean, the reason why we saw that now as a, as Dan, this shit is racist as fuck.\n\n41:47.520 --> 41:52.520\nIt's because, you know, we saw it as an, we see it as an adult, but as kids, we don't see that.\n\n41:52.520 --> 41:53.520\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n41:53.520 --> 42:01.520\nAnd the people who are writing these cartoons and coming up with these cartoons are pretty much generating those stereotypes.\n\n42:01.520 --> 42:04.520\nLike all these fools, all they do is fucking work in the warehouse and all this and that.\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:05.520\nYou know what I mean?\n\n42:05.520 --> 42:06.520\nYou know what I mean?\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:13.520\nSo it's like, if that is, if that is what it is, you know, there's people out there trying to break from that.\n\n42:13.520 --> 42:14.520\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n42:14.520 --> 42:17.520\nWe don't just all work in this fucking warehouse.\n\n42:17.520 --> 42:18.520\nI work in the office, dude.\n\n42:18.520 --> 42:19.520\nI'm cool.\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:20.520\nI'm chilling.\n\n42:20.520 --> 42:21.520\nClerical work.\n\n42:21.520 --> 42:22.520\nCall me, I'm born here, so I got rights.\n\n42:22.520 --> 42:23.520\nYou know what I mean?\n\n42:23.520 --> 42:26.520\nSo I'm doing my thing, but I'm not going to let my people shit go in vain.\n\n42:26.520 --> 42:27.520\nYou know what I mean?\n\n42:27.520 --> 42:28.520\nRight.\n\n42:28.520 --> 42:33.520\nBut what they came here to do, but see, that's, that's was projected at that time.\n\n42:33.520 --> 42:34.520\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n42:34.520 --> 42:39.520\nAs, as a stereotype that maybe is why you're having that, that little clash.\n\n42:39.520 --> 42:49.520\nSo if we, if we celebrate stuff, because it's like, it's like, it's like, like we celebrate like cultures and it's like, like one of the big things that I'm learning about as a white person is that there is shit to learn about.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:59.520\nLike the idea that, that, that without perceiving it, that I, that I never, I never knew that I was making this active choice, which is what somebody else might have to do when they wake up in the morning.\n\n42:59.520 --> 43:09.520\nAnd I was actually, without making the choice that I was actually thinking of myself as default, vanilla, mainstream, normal.\n\n43:09.520 --> 43:14.520\nThat's the thing that we're coping with right now is like, is like white people going like, what did I do?\n\n43:14.520 --> 43:15.520\nI didn't do anything wrong.\n\n43:15.520 --> 43:16.520\nWhat's going on around here?\n\n43:16.520 --> 43:18.520\nWhat's with all the alarm bells?\n\n43:18.520 --> 43:20.520\nAnd it's like, I didn't do anything.\n\n43:20.520 --> 43:21.520\nAnd it's like, yeah, you didn't do anything.\n\n43:21.520 --> 43:25.520\nAnd while you weren't doing anything, you can't, you're like, well, who am I?\n\n43:25.520 --> 43:26.520\nWhat the fuck am I?\n\n43:26.520 --> 43:39.520\nAnd so then we get into these, like, I think the, the, the evil versions of me are people that are equally confused, but their confusion generates like this, this anger and frustration where they're just like, what the fuck are we supposed to do?\n\n43:39.520 --> 43:51.520\nLike, I think I could, I've told this story on this, on this podcast before, like, I was working with this writer who, who's researching like Henry Ford, or in that era.\n\n43:51.520 --> 43:54.640\nAnd he told me this anecdote about Henry Ford\n\n43:54.640 --> 43:58.960\nat his factories, like he had this thing called American\n\n43:58.960 --> 44:00.320\nDay or something.\n\n44:00.320 --> 44:02.520\nAnd he would encourage all of his workers\n\n44:02.520 --> 44:04.040\nthat were from all over the world.\n\n44:04.040 --> 44:08.720\nHe would say, if you're going to dress like you're Polish,\n\n44:08.720 --> 44:11.880\nlike for real, it's sort of like you\n\n44:11.880 --> 44:16.200\nimagine it being some kind of themed Friday,\n\n44:16.200 --> 44:18.840\nTaco Tuesday or something.\n\n44:18.840 --> 44:21.360\nBut it was basically ethnic day.\n\n44:21.360 --> 44:23.920\nBut because they would do this ceremony,\n\n44:23.920 --> 44:25.600\nlike whatever you are, if you're Polish,\n\n44:25.600 --> 44:27.280\nlike where your most Polish outfit,\n\n44:27.280 --> 44:29.680\nif you're Mexican, where your most Mexican outfit is good,\n\n44:29.680 --> 44:30.360\nyeah?\n\n44:30.360 --> 44:34.240\nAnd so, and then they would do this big ceremony\n\n44:34.240 --> 44:37.840\non the factory floor where they had a literal giant melting\n\n44:37.840 --> 44:39.480\npot.\n\n44:39.480 --> 44:42.080\nAll of these prideful, grateful workers\n\n44:42.080 --> 44:44.280\nwho were part of this new experiment called America\n\n44:44.280 --> 44:46.760\nwith like wearing their Polish outfits\n\n44:46.760 --> 44:49.840\nwould climb into this, they would walk into this like melting\n\n44:49.840 --> 44:54.560\npot, and then they would take off their Polish clothes\n\n44:54.560 --> 44:58.240\nand put on a suit and tie, or like, and then they\n\n44:58.240 --> 45:00.520\nwould come out the other side, and it would be like,\n\n45:00.520 --> 45:01.800\nhere you are.\n\n45:01.800 --> 45:04.600\nAnd it was like this, and it's like, to me,\n\n45:04.600 --> 45:10.680\nthat absolutely encapsulates the big fucking question.\n\n45:10.680 --> 45:13.720\nBecause when you hear that, you immediately go,\n\n45:13.720 --> 45:19.160\nthat sounds problematic as far as management.\n\n45:19.160 --> 45:22.080\nBut then you go, also, there's an asterisk in there\n\n45:22.080 --> 45:25.000\nin my brain where I go, yeah, but the bad guys are constantly\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:29.360\nencouraging us to hold on to the differences, too.\n\n45:29.360 --> 45:33.320\nThis thing of like, well, women do this, men do that,\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:34.760\nand it's like, we're starting to recognize\n\n45:34.760 --> 45:38.120\nthat that's like a theme, like separating us\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:39.600\nis how you keep us powerless.\n\n45:39.600 --> 45:40.160\nRight, right.\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:41.880\nWell, see, I want to know, who are the bad guys?\n\n45:41.880 --> 45:42.760\nWho are you speaking of?\n\n45:42.760 --> 45:44.840\nWell, I'm talking about Nazis, have you heard of them?\n\n45:44.840 --> 45:46.200\nOh, OK, OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:46.200 --> 45:47.120\nThe government over here.\n\n45:47.120 --> 45:49.200\nI'm talking about them less and less as they get richer\n\n45:49.200 --> 45:51.600\nand richer, and just want to sneak out quietly.\n\n45:51.600 --> 45:52.920\nI feel that shit.\n\n45:52.920 --> 45:53.600\nI feel that shit.\n\n45:53.600 --> 45:55.360\nI just want to die in a fucking lighthouse,\n\n45:55.360 --> 45:57.640\nso like, well, the fucking atom bombs go off,\n\n45:57.640 --> 45:59.880\nlike fucking fallout style, baby.\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:01.440\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:01.440 --> 46:03.440\nThere's no fighting these old bones.\n\n46:03.440 --> 46:04.000\nNo, I don't know.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.200\nYou watch Game of Thrones, I'm the Onion Knight.\n\n46:06.200 --> 46:08.560\nI've got cable, bro.\n\n46:08.560 --> 46:09.840\nI've got cable.\n\n46:09.840 --> 46:11.680\nHow do you feel like your people feel about the stuff\n\n46:11.680 --> 46:13.440\nthat you do?\n\n46:13.440 --> 46:14.480\nThey're proud, man.\n\n46:14.480 --> 46:16.520\nLet me ask you this question, if like, do you care?\n\n46:16.520 --> 46:18.760\nAre you out just making content for content's sake,\n\n46:18.760 --> 46:19.840\nwhich is also dope?\n\n46:19.840 --> 46:20.360\nNo.\n\n46:20.360 --> 46:21.760\nDo you care what your people think?\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:22.760\nDefinitely, man.\n\n46:22.760 --> 46:23.320\nDefinitely.\n\n46:23.320 --> 46:25.080\nI think that's very important, you know what I'm saying?\n\n46:25.080 --> 46:26.240\nTo an artist, you know?\n\n46:26.240 --> 46:27.440\nYeah.\n\n46:27.440 --> 46:29.400\nYou got to care about what your people think, you know?\n\n46:29.400 --> 46:31.520\nBecause otherwise, what are you doing it for?\n\n46:31.520 --> 46:31.840\nYeah.\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:32.920\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n46:32.920 --> 46:35.680\nAs opposed to, you know, doing it for yourself,\n\n46:35.680 --> 46:37.360\nwhich is another thing, but like,\n\n46:37.360 --> 46:39.680\nonce you've done that past that level,\n\n46:39.680 --> 46:41.600\nit's like, is what you're doing really worth it?\n\n46:41.600 --> 46:41.760\nRight.\n\n46:41.760 --> 46:42.800\nIs it making an impact?\n\n46:42.800 --> 46:44.960\nIs it, you know, spreading a message,\n\n46:44.960 --> 46:46.920\nsending a message or something, you know what I mean?\n\n46:46.920 --> 46:48.320\nYeah, what do people say to you?\n\n46:48.320 --> 46:50.040\nLike, when they bump into people,\n\n46:50.040 --> 46:51.280\nyou can recognize, I'm sure.\n\n46:51.280 --> 46:52.320\nYeah, man.\n\n46:52.320 --> 46:54.280\nEven at the taco stands, bro.\n\n46:54.280 --> 46:56.600\nCan't even order tacos sometimes and shit.\n\n46:56.600 --> 46:58.200\nHey, aren't you that guy?\n\n46:58.200 --> 46:58.680\nThat's dope.\n\n46:58.680 --> 47:02.360\nAnd I'd be like, uh, where, bro?\n\n47:02.360 --> 47:03.080\nI just want to test it.\n\n47:03.080 --> 47:06.080\nYeah, aren't you that dude from, you know, the videos,\n\n47:06.080 --> 47:07.240\nCholos Try videos?\n\n47:07.240 --> 47:07.640\nYeah.\n\n47:07.640 --> 47:09.240\nCan I take a picture with you, Doc?\n\n47:09.240 --> 47:14.000\nHolding a big-ass burrito and shit, like, you know?\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:14.960\nIn the natural.\n\n47:14.960 --> 47:17.440\nYou'd be like, yeah, man, my natural element is shit.\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:18.360\nYeah, you already know.\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:19.160\nIt's like a baby, you know?\n\n47:19.160 --> 47:26.720\nLike, there was a wonderful backstage event,\n\n47:26.720 --> 47:29.840\nbecause it was like, what is the one thing that you\n\n47:29.840 --> 47:33.320\nwere made to try through the show that you actually\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:34.160\nstuck with you?\n\n47:34.160 --> 47:36.080\nAnd the answer was sushi, right?\n\n47:36.080 --> 47:38.200\nSushi, yes, yes.\n\n47:38.200 --> 47:39.720\nDid I ever try sushi?\n\n47:39.720 --> 47:40.640\nYeah.\n\n47:40.640 --> 47:41.440\nOK, damn.\n\n47:41.440 --> 47:42.440\nAll right, yeah.\n\n47:42.440 --> 47:45.160\nY'all probably live on the hipster side of town.\n\n47:45.160 --> 47:48.200\nYou won't catch no fucking sushi restaurant in Compton,\n\n47:48.200 --> 47:49.720\nbro, I'll tell you that.\n\n47:49.720 --> 47:51.760\nBut yeah, that was one of the main things\n\n47:51.760 --> 47:53.040\nthat really stuck with me, man.\n\n47:53.040 --> 47:56.320\nI was really, really, really skeptical for a long time,\n\n47:56.320 --> 47:58.680\ndude, because that shit, I don't know.\n\n47:58.680 --> 48:04.120\nIt does sound like the pinnacle of rich people\n\n48:04.120 --> 48:05.720\nusing themselves for no reason.\n\n48:05.720 --> 48:08.440\nLike, eat this seaweed with raw fish, yeah?\n\n48:08.440 --> 48:09.240\nYeah, you know?\n\n48:09.240 --> 48:12.960\nAnd not to sound culturally racist or nothing like that.\n\n48:12.960 --> 48:15.040\nI'm going to be Spanish, if I sound offended, but nah.\n\n48:15.040 --> 48:15.880\nThat's all I.\n\n48:15.880 --> 48:19.120\nIf it's reverse racism, I think we'd all very much enjoy it.\n\n48:19.120 --> 48:19.760\nOh shit.\n\n48:19.760 --> 48:22.040\nWell, please, please whip us.\n\n48:22.040 --> 48:22.880\nI don't know.\n\n48:22.880 --> 48:26.960\nI guess people would think I love to eat tacos, which I do.\n\n48:26.960 --> 48:30.200\nBut I assume that it was just an Asian cuisine.\n\n48:30.200 --> 48:30.680\nYou know what I mean?\n\n48:30.680 --> 48:32.600\nFor just Asian people, you know what I mean?\n\n48:32.600 --> 48:34.960\nWhen I saw that, that was, you know, they fucked with it.\n\n48:34.960 --> 48:37.400\nBecause I worked for a Korean dude one time,\n\n48:37.400 --> 48:39.840\nand he brought us some, and I think\n\n48:39.840 --> 48:40.840\nthey were California rolls.\n\n48:40.840 --> 48:43.360\nThey had no, you know, raw, nothing.\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:45.480\nBut that seaweed, I thought it was fish scales.\n\n48:45.480 --> 48:46.680\nSo I didn't even fuck with it, man.\n\n48:46.680 --> 48:47.400\nYeah.\n\n48:47.400 --> 48:48.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n48:48.080 --> 48:49.480\nIf you had got barbecue, though,\n\n48:49.480 --> 48:51.160\nI can't believe he brought you sushi.\n\n48:51.160 --> 48:52.160\nYeah, right?\n\n48:52.160 --> 48:53.200\nThat's what the fuck I'm saying.\n\n48:53.200 --> 48:54.200\nWhat the fuck?\n\n48:54.200 --> 48:54.680\nIf you.\n\n48:54.680 --> 48:56.600\nThey fucked me up with that one, dude.\n\n48:56.600 --> 48:57.960\nThat's why you didn't trust it, because you were like,\n\n48:57.960 --> 49:00.280\nwhy is a Korean dude bringing me Japanese food?\n\n49:00.280 --> 49:02.760\nYeah, if it was warm and it looked like it was cooked\n\n49:02.760 --> 49:04.400\nand looked like, you know, something to what I eat,\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:06.880\nlike carne asada or whatever, then I'm with it.\n\n49:06.880 --> 49:08.200\nI'm sorry, I'm spilling my shit over you.\n\n49:08.200 --> 49:08.920\nNo, that's OK.\n\n49:08.920 --> 49:09.520\nIt's OK.\n\n49:09.520 --> 49:12.320\nI can fill you up, too, or help yourself.\n\n49:12.320 --> 49:12.680\nAll right.\n\n49:12.680 --> 49:13.560\nIs that vodka?\n\n49:13.560 --> 49:14.040\nYes, sir.\n\n49:14.040 --> 49:15.040\nOK.\n\n49:15.040 --> 49:16.400\nThe homie brought me water, but I thought I'd\n\n49:16.400 --> 49:17.920\nhelp myself to some little drink.\n\n49:17.920 --> 49:18.520\nPlease do.\n\n49:18.520 --> 49:19.760\nIt's for after.\n\n49:19.760 --> 49:20.560\nCheers, everybody.\n\n49:20.560 --> 49:21.200\nCheers, man, too.\n\n49:21.200 --> 49:21.840\nCheers.\n\n49:21.840 --> 49:23.160\nEverybody, man.\n\n49:23.160 --> 49:24.320\nCan't answer that.\n\n49:24.320 --> 49:27.920\nWhat sushi did you like?\n\n49:27.920 --> 49:32.320\nOnce we tried it, man, and I was really open-minded to it,\n\n49:32.320 --> 49:34.560\nand I tried it, and I was like, OK, this is pretty good.\n\n49:34.560 --> 49:36.600\nI guess I'll give it a try next time.\n\n49:36.600 --> 49:37.840\nI went out, you know what I'm saying?\n\n49:37.840 --> 49:40.800\nAnd I had me a little sushi date or whatnot,\n\n49:40.800 --> 49:43.440\nand I like that shrimp tempura stuff.\n\n49:43.440 --> 49:44.400\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n49:44.400 --> 49:45.680\nBut you know what I do, though?\n\n49:45.680 --> 49:47.480\nThe reason why I like it, though,\n\n49:47.480 --> 49:51.200\nis because I make a little paste called, what I call,\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:52.760\ncrack sauce.\n\n49:52.760 --> 49:54.160\nIt's very addicting, man.\n\n49:54.160 --> 49:55.040\nI swear, dude.\n\n49:55.040 --> 49:59.120\nIt's basically low-sodium soy sauce with sriracha sauce,\n\n49:59.120 --> 50:02.360\nand I dip my sushi roll in it, and I just chomp it up, dude.\n\n50:02.360 --> 50:03.480\nYeah.\n\n50:03.480 --> 50:05.640\nBomb, homie.\n\n50:05.640 --> 50:07.560\nIt explodes in my mouth, dude.\n\n50:07.560 --> 50:08.560\nNo homo.\n\n50:08.560 --> 50:09.680\nI'm a bad shit and sound right.\n\n50:09.680 --> 50:10.800\nThat shit and sound right.\n\n50:10.800 --> 50:13.600\nBut it's like a party in my mouth, man.\n\n50:13.600 --> 50:17.480\nAnd I'm like, oh, damn, girl, where you been at all my life?\n\n50:17.480 --> 50:18.480\nYou know, it's like that.\n\n50:18.480 --> 50:19.120\nSushi's bomb.\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:19.920\nI love it, man.\n\n50:19.920 --> 50:20.640\nI love sushi, man.\n\n50:20.640 --> 50:21.840\nI love Patrick Shrimp.\n\n50:21.840 --> 50:26.800\nWhat's your dream gig as an actor?\n\n50:26.800 --> 50:29.240\nCan you point at anything that anybody else is doing\n\n50:29.240 --> 50:31.800\nor a kind of movie that you'd like to be in?\n\n50:31.800 --> 50:34.280\nAnd it doesn't have to be realistic in whatever.\n\n50:34.280 --> 50:36.720\nDon't, you know, like, this is your fantasy.\n\n50:36.720 --> 50:40.960\nLike, what would you like to be doing as an actor?\n\n50:40.960 --> 50:41.800\nShit.\n\n50:41.800 --> 50:45.040\nMy timeframe, my life, man, I would\n\n50:45.040 --> 50:47.480\nlike to be, if anything, somehow reincarnated\n\n50:47.480 --> 50:52.200\nto Antonio Banderas' fucking career, man.\n\n50:52.200 --> 50:53.840\nAntonio Banderas is a shit, man.\n\n50:53.840 --> 50:54.360\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n50:54.360 --> 50:57.320\nAs far as him being a Latino, I respect his work and all that.\n\n50:57.320 --> 50:59.280\nHe did a lot of good stuff, man.\n\n50:59.280 --> 51:02.000\nAnd I always thought he was a good actor, you know?\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.480\nAnd, you know, somewhere along those lines, you know?\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:06.840\nHe never really played the cholo homie role,\n\n51:06.840 --> 51:09.560\nlike some dudes in Standing Deliver,\n\n51:09.560 --> 51:12.000\nand, you know, Lou Diamond Phillips, you know,\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.120\nwhich is a very well-known respected actor in the game.\n\n51:15.120 --> 51:15.840\nWe do have this.\n\n51:15.840 --> 51:18.960\nI know if my ex-girlfriend, who's like a media studies,\n\n51:18.960 --> 51:21.080\nprobably got her PhD by now, she would always\n\n51:21.080 --> 51:22.520\nblow my mind with all this shit.\n\n51:22.520 --> 51:26.560\nBut she would, I imagine if she was sitting here, she'd go,\n\n51:26.560 --> 51:29.520\nyeah, but there's also this, the Latin lover thing\n\n51:29.520 --> 51:31.920\nis like this other way of like, it's like,\n\n51:31.920 --> 51:35.680\nthere's two ways of, like, oppressing African-American,\n\n51:35.680 --> 51:37.840\nlike people, Brandon, I'll explain it to you.\n\n51:41.120 --> 51:45.360\nIt's like, there's like the infantilizing where it's like,\n\n51:45.360 --> 51:47.080\noh, look at this little knucklehead.\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:48.240\nHe doesn't mean no harm.\n\n51:48.240 --> 51:52.600\nAnd then there's the thugged out kind of like, uh-oh, careful.\n\n51:52.600 --> 51:53.960\nSomeone's rolling up.\n\n51:53.960 --> 51:56.120\nIt's like Eddie Murphy.\n\n51:56.120 --> 52:00.960\nYou always try to take the big dick thing away, oh.\n\n52:00.960 --> 52:02.520\nI've never tried to take that away.\n\n52:02.520 --> 52:03.320\nThere's three things.\n\n52:03.320 --> 52:04.360\nThere's three things.\n\n52:04.360 --> 52:07.440\nInfantilizing, whatever that word was.\n\n52:07.440 --> 52:09.800\nBig dick and then thug.\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:13.760\nAnd the one that upsets me the most is the big dick one.\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:16.240\nYeah.\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:19.160\nIt's just so, so stereotypical.\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:22.080\nNot only have I never questioned that stereotype,\n\n52:22.080 --> 52:25.680\neither of you, like, a few people do.\n\n52:25.680 --> 52:27.280\nWe just tolerate it, don't we?\n\n52:27.280 --> 52:33.640\nBut it's like, but that God, that, you know, they're like,\n\n52:33.640 --> 52:38.080\noh, I'm a Latin, they're also like a Mandingo thing.\n\n52:38.080 --> 52:44.480\nLike, that idea of sexualizing a less than privileged class,\n\n52:44.480 --> 52:48.040\nlike, it can feel like it's like awesome.\n\n52:48.040 --> 52:50.320\nBut at the same time, it's like, if you're\n\n52:50.320 --> 52:53.080\ninto the hobby of problematization,\n\n52:53.080 --> 52:54.800\nbecause you had a degree, it's like,\n\n52:54.800 --> 52:59.280\nyou can trace how it actually, but why am I shitting\n\n52:59.280 --> 53:00.000\non your dream?\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.680\nYou want to be fucking, but Darius isn't just in movies\n\n53:02.680 --> 53:08.600\nwhere he's seducing white honeys with a rose in his teeth.\n\n53:08.600 --> 53:13.920\nHe also was like, he was like, he was the Mexican Bruce\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:15.200\nWillis, was what he was.\n\n53:15.200 --> 53:16.000\nYeah, basically.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:16.640\nYeah, basically.\n\n53:16.640 --> 53:17.640\nYeah, basically.\n\n53:17.640 --> 53:19.160\nHe's Spanish, though?\n\n53:19.160 --> 53:20.440\nOK, sorry.\n\n53:20.440 --> 53:21.280\nRacist.\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:22.680\nNo, you're good.\n\n53:22.680 --> 53:23.480\nNationalists.\n\n53:23.480 --> 53:24.960\nJust shouting it out.\n\n53:24.960 --> 53:25.920\nJust shouting it out.\n\n53:25.920 --> 53:26.560\nCan I?\n\n53:26.560 --> 53:29.080\nOK, so yeah, let me ask dumb white people questions\n\n53:29.080 --> 53:31.360\nabout Latinx culture.\n\n53:31.360 --> 53:37.040\nIf you see a Spanish guy, do you guys get in a fight?\n\n53:37.040 --> 53:37.720\nIt's a joke.\n\n53:37.720 --> 53:38.440\nIt's a joke question.\n\n53:38.440 --> 53:40.560\nNo, no, I'm going to answer that shit for you, man,\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:44.840\nbecause it's a yes and a no answer, you know what I'm saying?\n\n53:44.840 --> 53:47.920\nBecause it all depends on the person who it is.\n\n53:47.920 --> 53:51.400\nI've rolled around with homies that they're active and whatever.\n\n53:51.400 --> 53:53.880\nAnd we're going to Hollywood Boulevard just chilling\n\n53:53.880 --> 53:54.560\nand we're walking.\n\n53:54.560 --> 53:56.680\nI'm peeping out the honeys, but this was peeping out the dudes\n\n53:56.680 --> 53:57.800\nas who's mad, dog, in this food.\n\n53:57.800 --> 53:59.320\nLike, what

honeys.\n\n54:03.560 --> 54:04.800\nYou see what's up with the honeys?\n\n54:04.800 --> 54:06.280\nI ain't trying to go to jail tonight, dog.\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:07.120\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n54:07.120 --> 54:08.800\nWe are here in Hollywood Boulevard and shit, you know?\n\n54:08.800 --> 54:11.760\nSo sometimes it could happen if you're not\n\n54:11.760 --> 54:14.480\nwith the right people.\n\n54:14.480 --> 54:17.360\nI think that, OK.\n\n54:17.360 --> 54:18.440\nLet's dig into the, all right.\n\n54:18.440 --> 54:20.440\nSo I want to dig into this fantasy.\n\n54:20.440 --> 54:27.160\nLike, maybe let's do the movie where you're this kind of,\n\n54:27.160 --> 54:34.320\nlike, if you were a bandera's type, like, what's your favorite,\n\n54:34.320 --> 54:36.480\nnot your favorite movie, I hate when people ask me that.\n\n54:36.480 --> 54:38.280\nWhat's a movie that you really like?\n\n54:38.280 --> 54:40.920\nLike, you would be like, man, if I was in that movie,\n\n54:40.920 --> 54:42.000\nI'd be so excited.\n\n54:44.920 --> 54:48.320\nMaybe something like Carlitos, Waste, Scarface.\n\n54:48.320 --> 54:51.240\nIf it was a bandera's movie, it'd be Desperado.\n\n54:51.240 --> 54:53.120\nYou know, Trejo was in that a while back.\n\n54:53.120 --> 54:56.080\nYou know, I mean, he's doing, you know.\n\n54:56.080 --> 54:57.480\nI like how you say

55:04.240\nWhat's the, is that new Latinx?\n\n55:04.240 --> 55:04.960\nI just learned that.\n\n55:04.960 --> 55:06.600\nI was so excited about it.\n\n55:06.600 --> 55:07.840\nSchool me on that shit,

second what it is man you know movies reflect on how you live\n\n01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.420\nsometimes yeah life yeah you know I'm saying if you portray your life in a\n\n01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.860\nmovie fashion you're doing the shit all wrong but if you watch a film and you\n\n01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:19.700\ncan relate to it and it hits home you know I'm saying deep in your heart like\n\n01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.980\nwith something you might have been through or something or you know what\n\n01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.380\nwhatever it is you've gone through fucked up relationships or whatever you\n\n01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.220\nlost a loved one whatever man whatever the dramatization is within that film\n\n01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.900\nthat got to you you know it's shit like that that really hits home man that\n\n01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.860\ngets to me man and like I'm a big movie buff you know and sometimes like I'll\n\n01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.500\nI'll just be in my zone people in these movies out man and I'm trying to think\n\n01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.820\nof the last one like it was like balling I think it might have been cocoa like\n\n01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:52.060\nlike I'm not trying to I'm not sure I'm not bringing that up to score culture\n\n01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:57.820\nbut I feel you I think it was a little bit of cocoa I started fucking losing it\n\n01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:02.060\nI did a little cocoa man but and it was unexpected because at the beginning of\n\n01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:05.260\nthe first 20 minutes of cocoa I was like this shit's more complicated than\n\n01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.220\nPhantom Menace what the fuck the fuck are you talking about you got to be a\n\n01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:13.020\nskeleton by morning but on Tuesday if no one has your picture on a bench yeah\n\n01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:19.700\nlike but but it did turn out to be quite simple and then actually like was\n\n01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.340\nlike very profound and like I was like I was just like fucking like sobbing I\n\n01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:30.340\ncan't actually remember why I was crying my girlfriend will just fucking like\n\n01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:36.660\nshe'll she'll just sob like a cartoon at anything like like anything that's like\n\n01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:42.540\nlike where if the well I don't want to cheapen or it has to be sincerely done\n\n01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:47.140\nbut I'm just saying she cried to sausage party like well not quite that no\n\n01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.300\nguys up but like anything where the director was like was like you know you\n\n01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:55.940\nknow if I had it my way you'd be crying right now like in a real sincere way\n\n01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.940\nlike Cody will like like like she'll actually like unpredictably like she'll\n\n01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:06.340\nactually be like sobbing did you see you didn't see there's no way you saw did\n\n01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:10.860\nyou see a ghost story with Casey Affleck he's wearing a sheet the whole movie and\n\n01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:15.460\nthen you know watch a girl eat a pie it's a weird I've seen the sixth sense it's\n\n01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:19.700\npretty similar kind of like that but yeah that that's a move I got a lot of\n\n01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.220\ncatching up to do on movies that was the most well this movie like nobody's seen\n\n01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:27.460\nit but yeah but like it's the most like I was most unexpected like it's like\n\n01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:34.100\nCasey Affleck is just a dude who he's like he dies and then the gimmick of the\n\n01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.540\nmovie is that he's just under a sheet like Charlie Brown like like like like the\n\n01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.980\nwhole movie and it's like it like wait the movie waits for you to like get over\n\n01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.940\nthat and be like this is corny but then it's just like he's just hanging out in\n\n01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:48.380\nthe background he's in a sheet and then like you there's a scene where his\n\n01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:54.780\ngirlfriend like you're just he's just watching her and she eats this pie that\n\n01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:59.540\nsomebody gave her she's alone and it's like the camera doesn't cut and then you\n\n01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:04.260\njust watch her eat a fucking pie because she's like binging but then and then I\n\n01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.540\nthink she goes and pukes it up or whatever but it's just like sort of like\n\n01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:10.620\nit just it's like two minutes like and people who don't like the movie they're\n\n01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.660\nlike like they immediately leap to the scene like I don't watch somebody eat a\n\n01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.660\npie yeah like in a sheet what are you doing to me and I don't fault those\n\n01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.700\npeople I'm not saying those people you don't get it man three seconds to the\n\n01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.300\nmovie then change the shit but the crazy thing is if you're on the other side of\n\n01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.220\nit and the only way reason I was because Cody started crying and then I was like\n\n01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.820\nwhy is Cody crying and then we paused the movie and that's my girlfriend she's\n\n01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:40.820\ngot a guy's name she's my middle name is a female's name oh yeah all right so we're like we were\n\n01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.420\nbasically like family yeah we're the same we're the same a little different but\n\n01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.620\nsame same you know but I started thinking about what for the first time in my\n\n01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.500\nlife I started thinking about instead of thinking about how sad it would be to die\n\n01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:58.580\nas in like how bummed I would be to not be able to live life I don't get no more\n\n01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:06.380\nlife like and I was like I started getting scared that I would die and like\n\n01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.540\nbecause of the like I was like oh my god what if you had to watch your the person\n\n01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:15.940\nthat you loved cope with your and I know there's been other movies about that like\n\n01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.340\nwhat dreams may come yeah like Robert Williams yeah like I know those never\n\n01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:24.500\naffected me like I never I watched us and I go like grown-up shit like I don't\n\n01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.100\nI don't know this like hipster thing got to me it's like Casey Applex in a sheet\n\n01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.780\nmaybe it disarmed me they just call hearted Dan I don't know fucking cold\n\n01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:36.820\nhearted you don't got no love I think I just needed to have like a\n\n01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.620\nrelationship with somebody that was like so cool yeah sobbing and then she's\n\n01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.980\nlike I'm gonna pause it making some drinks and then I was like that's going\n\n01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.180\nto be a goal

01:21:03.340\nseveral years now I still think about that scene from that movie when I think\n\n01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:09.980\nabout death yeah that's my new that if the director of that movie knew that they\n\n01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:15.220\nhad accomplished that would they be proud ashamed I don't know I don't know\n\n01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:18.980\nwhat I'm sure they would have been proud man it's only the chosen few that can\n\n01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:23.660\ncatch it so what would you as an actor would you really like to like do you'd\n\n01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:27.700\nlike to play it like
