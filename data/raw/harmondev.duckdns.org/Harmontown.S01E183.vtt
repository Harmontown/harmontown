{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.000\nYeah, this is entertainment everybody from Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:31.000\nLet's welcome Spencer Crittenden into the stage, shall we?\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:49.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:49.000 --> 01:02.000\nThere's kind of a shower effect when you're in your car and you're like, I'm a BG!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:21.000\nLet's go back about elite class. Harmonize! Harmonize!\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:39.000\nThe show already dedicated to Glenn Fry.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:45.000\nWe prededicate that one to Eagles singer and guitar player Glenn Fry.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:53.000\nWhy do I always, I guess it's stage fright, I always need the, is the microphone too far forward?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nI thought you guys liked it back a little bit.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nIs director Chris Peruff back there?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:01.000\nGood for camera!\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nIt's good for camera if it's back a little bit.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nYeah, we don't care about you guys.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nWe just want to milk your laughs, your presence.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:11.000\nThis feels better because this feels like the way it's always been.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:18.000\nYeah, colloquially backstage with the crew, we call you the aphids.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:23.000\nIt's a reference to those ants that milk, they milk aphids.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nI thought we called them the day sleepers.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:29.000\nThe day sleepers? Wait, they're the vampires?\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nNo, no, they're just, they're just lazy.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nSo there was a, remember we talked in Miami, I think, before the guy got punched in the face.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:47.000\nWe were talking a little bit about, it's not because of the, the transgender, I still don't know if you call it a movement.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:53.000\nI think that sounds a little weird, it sounds like, because it's whatever, the transgender thing that's happening,\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:02.000\nour new found awareness of it, it has raised this very interesting question that's just sort of on a fundamental level about bathroom dichotomy.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nLike what are we doing? What have we been doing?\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:13.000\nI think a very well-intended thing in the past, in the days of a long ago when bathrooms were just maybe like bushes or caves,\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:20.000\nlike maybe there probably was a great progressive thought behind like, oh, ladies go over there and the fellas go over there.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:25.000\nBut it's not as complicated as just tearing down that wall because men are pigs and sometimes women too.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:30.000\nLike there's different, there are just differences, there's different things that happen in men's rooms and women's rooms.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nThe big thing that you brought up.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nI gotta say, I was wrong about that. I looked it up way off.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nWhat?\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:49.000\nI said, I told you, I said on this very stage to millions of unsuspecting people that single-user stalls end up screwing women over,\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:55.000\nbut it turns out single-user stalls are the best way to push out and equalize wait times,\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nand wait times are truly the commodity of the bathroom.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nOkay, well I can't.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:05.000\nI'm sorry, hang on, Dan. I remember, I just listened to that Miami episode today.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:12.000\nYou're saying, what you said the last, that time was that women take longer biologically and that's why, that's.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nYes, which is true.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nIt is true.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:19.000\nBut to that end, that has only affected non-single-user genderless bathrooms.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nThat's only affected the current bathroom paradigm.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nWell, let me cut, let me, let me.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nYou guys, you gotta look up potty parity.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:32.000\nLet me, let me, let me cut to my chase because I thought I was a genius getting out of the shower today.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:33.000\nYou still are.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nI took a shower today.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:35.000\nYou still are.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:42.000\nWell, actually, I wasn't a genius. I ripped this off. Somebody on Twitter said this, and they mentioned your name because they said,\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:51.000\nthe discussion you guys were having, and they said, do, do have multiple bathrooms, but, but make them like long and short.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nIn terms of like the time you're going to take.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nRight.\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:01.000\nYou're going to make a number one or a number two kind of, or, or are you, are you making a number two and or female?\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:06.000\nYou know, women don't want to be lumped in with shitting men.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:12.000\nBut I was, I was like, like, if you, if you, if you look at it more like, like, like lanes on a freeway.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nOkay.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:20.000\nThere's, there's separation on the freeway that when people don't observe it, shit gets fucked up and you get mad at them because they\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:26.000\ndon't know how to drive right. You know, what if we had like two or even three bathrooms at the places, the bigger the place,\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nadd more lanes.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nIt's like fast lane, passing lane, you know, like, I just have to fucking, I'm not even going to wash my hands.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nWait, Dan, are you, I'm going to piss my pants.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nI just need a place to do it while I check my texts.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nWell, we'll get back to you not washing your hands.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nNo, no, no, I always wash my hands.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nI was making a joke.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nOkay.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nAre you saying the lane choice is on the door out front of the bathroom?\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nYeah, it's like, it's like, it's like slow and fast.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nLike, are you going to take a long time?\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nGo in here.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nYou see if you poop.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:02.000\nAnd so I know, and then I was tumbling off and I was like, oh, that won't work because in a crowded situation, then people that are\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nbacked up in the slow lane, they're going to start going into the fast lane.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nBut no, there will be shame involved in that.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:17.000\nAnd the only, just as on the freeway, because you like, you'll go in and you'll, you'll, you'll, there will be a line\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nforming outside the fast toilet, which shouldn't be happening.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nAnd you'll be a piece of shit when you come out.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:28.000\nAnd the song, the song that will play when you leave there, I mean, don't poop in the fast lane.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nI'd say,\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nSure, brought you by Glenn Fry, everybody.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nAnd then there will be arguments.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:37.000\nPeople like a guy will come out and everyone will start booing him and he'll go, I'm a fast shooter.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd I said, no, you're not.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nWhat, what, what, what is the cutoff point for what is fast and what is slow?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nWell, that's, I mean,\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:51.000\nThere should be a big red digital clock right in the door with like a spring loaded toilet.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nFreeways.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nThere's a speed limit.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nYou get ejected out of the door.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nYou get a fine as a speed limit.\n\n06:58.000 --> 06:59.000\nRight.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nWhich, what's the cutoff for freeways?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nWhy, why, when do you get to go in the fast lane?\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nA cop won't answer that question because he can't technically tell you to speed.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:11.000\nBut the truth is, if you're trying to get to work really fast, you're supposed to go around people.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nIt's called the fast lane. If we all went 55, there wouldn't be a fucking fast lane.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nIt's called the fast lane.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nBut there's a limit to the speed in that lane.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:27.000\nAnd so everyone's, when everyone's driving 35 on the freeway, that's when the city, that's why they built that lane.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:31.000\nIt's for the days when everyone's just feeling leisurely.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nAnd driving under the speed limit.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nAnd you want to go 55 and a half miles an hour.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nSo that's what this lane is for.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nNo, it's for going 70.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nAnd there could be a 55 of shitting.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nI gotcha.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nAnd then there couldn't be a Sammy Hagar of shitting.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nWho would be like, fuck you!\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nDon't tell me what to do!\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nI like to read a book when I do it!\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nI check my tweets, I get on Facebook too!\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nI can't shit!\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nIn less than an hour!\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd there's like a judge, like with her horned rain glasses, she takes them off and starts dancing.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nFuck that!\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nShe's like, I like this guy.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nHe fucking shits like a fucking molasses.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:21.000\nCan you draw me up like on a grid D&D pathfinder map of what you would like?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nYou go to an airport and you go to an airport.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nYou have to relieve yourself.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nYou come across how many doors, and what do those doors say?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nOr have you got that far?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:38.000\nThey say, when I was getting out of the shower, it was long and short.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nNot number two and number one.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nBut there are other factors, but let's get to those factors.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nAs Spencer says, the big key issue first of all is wait time.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nThat's the tyranny of bathrooms.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:54.000\nSo solve that and then we can get into, maybe we start to devolve a whole fucking culture.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nAbout peeing and washing your hands and pooping and lighting matches.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nOh my god, can you imagine? Of all of this emphasis we put on consideration.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nWe didn't then undercut by going in the bathroom and wailing all over the walls\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nbecause we think everyone else is secretly a racist animal.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nAnd we hate them and we don't want to touch the same toilet seat as them.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nAnd we're electing a fascist and we're like, oh, don't forget to keep your elbows off the table.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nWe're a fucking liar.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nLet's look where we shit.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nWe should make it fucking scientific.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nYou should feel like a clone when you poop.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nDon't you feel like a naughty clone?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nLike who's scientists are mad at them and testing them.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nYou should fucking like, it's a sanitary business.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nHow do you think babies feel when they shit?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nThey can't do anything about it.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nThey're like, oh shit, I fucked up.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nBut you know, there should be luxury, there should be talcum,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:47.000\nthere should be love and squeezing and motorboats.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nWhat? I don't know.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nRazzleberries?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nOkay, you can't motorboat a baby.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:59.000\nBabies ain't got no titties.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nDear penthouse.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:10.000\nI never thought I'd be reading one of these letters.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nI work at a large home depot.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nI said it, home depot.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nI work at home depot.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:25.000\nAnd in walked this woman with a baby that wouldn't quit.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:31.000\nI knew I had to motorboat it.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nAll right, so it's time for a new segment.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nThis is called paragraphs that I,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:41.000\nsentences I pull from newspaper articles\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:46.000\nand read out of context because it's funny.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nI think Jay Leno does this.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:56.000\nSometimes when you read news,\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:01.000\nyou get to a sentence that makes you realize\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:06.000\nyou're 43 in a world being taken over by children\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:13.000\nthat don't know how to put a thought together.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:18.000\nOkay, just a little article about Ben Carson losing his,\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nhe's always been a conservative fellow,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:26.000\nbut he was also like a hometown hero to a lot of his own,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nI don't know, personal kind of like,\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nI can't remember where he's from and what he,\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nbut he was like, you know, he did good stuff.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nHe's from Nappy Town.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nHe's from Nappy Town?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nSleepy Town.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nHe always looks like he's going to take a little nap.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nHe always looks like he just had a turkey sandwich\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:48.000\nand a glass of warm milk.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nWell, here's it.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nThis is me after, if I did nine yoga classes,\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.000\nthat's how alert he looks.\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:02.000\nThis is out of a Washington Post article about Ben Carson.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:07.000\nAnd it did, the headline did involve his blackness,\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:11.000\nbut I still think this is a weird sentence.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nCarson has been a black icon since 1987\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:17.000\nwhen he became the first person to successfully separate twins\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:22.000\nconjoined at the backs of their heads.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nWhile being black.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:32.000\nBlack people loved that shit.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou know that stereotype of the black lady in the operating room?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nLook at those babies disconnected.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nMa'am.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:52.000\nWe're going to have to ask you to stop yelling out during your surgery.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nI meant to say Sleepy Town at first.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nI said Nappy Town and people thought I meant Nappy like Nappy Hair.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nOh God.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nI'm proud to say you just put that in my head.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nI'm very proud of myself.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nThis millennial crowd knew exactly what I'm saying right now.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nThey heard that.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nWho knows with them?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nIf it didn't trip my wires, I mean that's the thing.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nThis is going to be a theme tonight because we're going to have a fellow up here\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nthat we've never met before on the show.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nYou and I have met him, but we're going to be talking about\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nthe realm of the uncomfortably surface sea and how deep it goes.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:28.000\nWe have Dr. Ben Carson here tonight.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:37.000\nOne of the themes that I'd like to talk about is the sometimes damaging thing.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nI don't know if I'm stealing this from somebody clever that actually coined it.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nI think it's a really apt.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nI read it somewhere, heard it somewhere.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nA penny saved is a penny earned.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:59.000\nThe modern code of, I don't know what to call it, political correctness\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nthat has all these negative connotations.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nIf you could come up with a golden rule of social etiquette,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:12.000\npolitical cultural etiquette, the rule has become whoever smelt it dealt it.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:17.000\nIn other words, if you keep your mouth shut,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:23.000\nyou stand tactically the highest percentage chance of not being offensive,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:28.000\nwhich is I think a very dangerous thing because as we can see in our culture,\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nyou kind of want the idiots talking as loudly as possible.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:36.000\nIt's better than them slinking around in the shadows and then popping up all of a sudden.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:40.000\nAnd becoming the front-runner for one of our two political parties.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:47.000\nYeah, I would like if that guy, well, he is a fucking like, yeah, what should we have done,\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\ngiven him a reality show?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nWe already did!\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nWe gave him 30 reality shows.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nHe was good at all of them.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nHe's definitely a fucking anomaly.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nHe himself is a, like, he should be...\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nThere's a lot of reasons to not like Donald Trump.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\nHere's one of my top 30.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nHe says very too much.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:14.000\nYou know, I think the Mexicans are very, very, you know, I think they're very good people,\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:18.000\nbut they're very corrupt and our economy is very, very good.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nBut people very like me.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nThey very, very, very like me.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:27.000\nI say, are you like a kid trying to air out your 10,000-word book report\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:32.000\nby adding more varies and really is into it?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:36.000\nThey had an article that was like the 76 campaign promises\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:40.000\nthat we've been able to, you know, glean from what he's said so far.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nIt's really, it's very, very terrifying.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nIt's really, really, really terrifying.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nWe need a very, very big wall and then I'm going to bomb ISIS\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nand I'm going to do it by having very, very good generals.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nYes, yes.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nAnd they're going to make really good bombs, the best ever.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nLike he sounds like a six-year-old.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nThese bombs, these bombs are going to be so good,\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nyour head's going to spin.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nI mean, they'll be blown off.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nYour head's going to be blown off but as they're flying off of your body\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nyour head's going to spin and how good these bombs are.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nYeah.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nAnd I want to clarify something.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:14.000\nI just heard myself say something that might have been offensive to six-year-olds\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nbecause I...\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nIt's too late.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nIt's too late.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nYou've been coming down on six-year-olds for fucking too long.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nI don't want six-year-olds to listen to this podcast.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nThey shouldn't yet.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nBut I really mean this.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:32.000\nI like most of them and he's like a shitty six-year-old.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nI just wanted to clarify that.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:38.000\nHe's like a six-year-old that you go to a family on Christmas\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nand he's the one little cousin that's like,\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nyou're playing some game and everybody's like,\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nthis is so cool, we made up this game.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd then he's always the one that's like,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nif you're playing, let's shoot missiles with these G.I. Joe things.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nHe's like, now I'm shooting a missile that blows up every plane in the whole room\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nno matter where you try to hide.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nInfinity.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nInfinity.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nYou can't just say that.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nYou just said something, loser.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nI think there's a conflict of interest.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nWhy are you even moderating this G.I. Joe?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nThere's a word for that and it's a word that applies I think for almost all of them\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nwith maybe one or two exceptions.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:19.000\nIt's petulance and the political discourse is\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\npetulant children level of fucking discourse.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:26.000\nThey're all 70 and they're all like calling each other old\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nand they're all talking about 9-11 like it's their friend\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nand they're all pieces of shit and they're all born rich\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nand they can all take a fuck fly.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nI don't know what I was trying to do in the middle of that.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nI know the phrase flying fuck.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nI was like, you know what, Harmon, you can beat that.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:51.000\nThey could take a first class flight fuck\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:56.000\nand fucking mint jet blue mint.\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nJet blue mint.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nWe flew fucking first class jet blue which is nice.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nYou sit in these little egg pods and it seems really groovy\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nand then I went down into the like the recline mode\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nbut you can't just rock your seat back.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nYou can't just go like lean back.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nThe whole thing has to go brrrrr\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nand your legs come out into this like this whole long bed frame kind of thing\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nbut at one point it was very clear to me\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nthat my legs were not going to get any farther than the wall in front\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:31.000\nand now I'm being like Star Wars trash compactor seats.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nFree B.O.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nFree B.O.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nWreck and E.B.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nWreck and E.B.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nI'm so distracted.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nJeff Fort.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nI can't.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nThis is the perfect time to bring out our guests.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nRight at the height of you complaining about your leg room.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nEverybody.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nIt was the worst time.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nIt was the worst time then.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nThis is the worst time to do that.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\nOur first, the current phrase is a little person.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nHe's an actor.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nWe met him in New York.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nColin Buckingham is here.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nLet's bring him out.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nAwkward.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nYeah.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nThere you go.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nSweet.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nThat worked perfectly.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nWhat's up Colin?\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nHow you doing?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.000\nWe met at the CISO launching, right?\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nHow you been?\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nDoing well.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nHow you doing?\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nGreat.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nDo you live out here?\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nNo, I live in New York City.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:29.000\nWhat do you think about Jeff's leg room complaints?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:33.000\nI mean, he gets crunched in the first class again.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nThe fuck you put in this?\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nFucking.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\nDo you try to ambush me with Colin?\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nYour piece of shit.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nThis is Dan.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nI'm ashamed of him noticing things\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nthat are different about other people.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nIt's just funny.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nIn his defense, though,\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nwhen I was doing the reclining thing,\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:01.000\nit didn't, like, I almost slid down into the...\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nI'm trying to think, like,\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nthey had to be designed for this really median,\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nlike, height person.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nLike, 5'8\", maybe, was the perfect sweet spot.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nCan I put in a thing about that?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nI did have a lot of leg room, though.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nThis is it.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nThe...\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\nI'm fat, and that's not easy either.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nThe JetBlue first class, I'll go too.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\nAs far as how you're treated as a human being,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nlike, so far, they're new to first class\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nfor terrible reasons because the airlines are cartels.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nDon't get me started.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nI'm sorry, the airlines are a cartel.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nThat's the important thing about a cartel.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nIt's not plural.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nOtherwise, it would be fucking amazing.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nIt would be capitalism.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:50.000\nThe only thing...\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:53.000\nIt's the reclining thing for me, too, for a different reason.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nThe tray table.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt doesn't move forward.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:02.000\nFor me, the tray table never comes close enough to me.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nThey ask you to make a choice.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nI mean, where's my...\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nI have to reach all the way over there for my food?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nWell, no wonder you're so thin.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nNo, no, you're making...\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nFood's always all over me.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nI have to eat it.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nJust to stay clean.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nI'm like, I can't.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nI'm like...\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nI can't.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd then I get fat.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nIt's...\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nI don't know if you know how hard it can be to be fat.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nI don't, I'm sorry.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:41.000\nColin, Dan was born six foot two and fat.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:50.000\nThey ask you to make a choice on that airline between sleep mode and just sitting up and hanging out.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nYeah, and electric chair.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nLike upright.\n\n21:53.000 --> 22:01.000\nBut what you can't do is a setting that is, you know, it's just like, I'm sleepy, but I'm playing Minecraft.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:08.000\nAnd I'm going to nod off while I'm digging for some minerals.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nAnd I'm going to wake up and go, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:16.000\nAnd then I'm like, oh, well placed torches, I'm fine.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:21.000\nAnd then the guy next to me is going to be like, what's he doing?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nHe's like a child.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:28.000\nLike, yeah, why don't you watch Avatar a third time?\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nJust because I win an Oscar doesn't make it for throwing us.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nHow long was that flight? Were you flying from Dubai?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nNo, I don't mean, he watched it third time on the flight.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nYeah, I'm flying.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nI'm Amelia Earhart.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nI only fly.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nAll right.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nAnyways, welcome, Colin.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nI'm sorry about the way you were brought out.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:50.000\nI'm sorry about the way you've been treated since.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nDo you like the stool?\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:55.000\nIs it like, are you doing a bit by using it?\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nNo, it made it a lot less awkward.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nI think Spencer deserves a little Boy Scout badge for that.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nOh, you guys haven't met?\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nHow's it going?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nSpencer wasn't the only one that thought about that.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nBecause that's something that's like, oh, it's progress.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nJust put it out of your mind.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nDon't think about anything.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nDon't think about it of a person that's a guest of yours\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nthat might have a need or something.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nSpencer thinks about it.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nI mean, I didn't think about it.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nWe had Steve Silberman on.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:23.000\nAnd he's, I mean, he might not be offended by me saying he's a bit rotund.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:26.000\nAnd he had a lot of trouble getting on.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nAnd so I was like, I don't know, man.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nThese are crazy stools.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nAnd also, these stools are built for one butt cheek.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:36.000\nIf you're a larger person, we needed a little more\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\ncomodious accommodation.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nAll right.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:43.000\nLet's start our little person questions with the big one.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nThe big one.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:48.000\nWho are you voting for?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:52.000\nI want to talk about the phrase little people.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nYou already gave me a hint.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nYeah.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:59.000\nWell, as we talked about a little bit,\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:04.000\nthat it changed in the past 30 years from Mijit to Dwarf to little person.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:09.000\nAnd it's like going in a direction of trying to say,\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nlike, hey, people that are shorter are still people.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:16.000\nBut I think when you say someone is a little person,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:20.000\nit's different than saying someone has dwarfism or something, you know?\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nRight.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nThat a person with it, yeah.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nYeah, because it's like you're making that their identity.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nYeah.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nYou know, you're saying like that person is a dwarf.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:32.000\nLike that is all encompassing of his personality or her personality\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:35.000\nor that kind of thing and like how they define themselves as.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:38.000\nI always play ball with this stuff because, well, I mean, it's honestly,\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nI'm just a chicken shit socially.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:44.000\nSo I would never like, I would never deliberately,\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nI say shit all the time, it makes people upset.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nYeah.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:50.000\nAnd it's never like because I'm like, oh, I hope people get really upset.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nNo.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nIt's just because I'm like, oh, the only chance I have of making people\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nlike me is to like talk.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nThat's it.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nAnd I know it's like, it's like, it's like if you were Indiana Jones\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nand you just like, you see the poison dart shooters and you're just,\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nand it's like a mile and you're just like, fuck it.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nLike I'm not going to, like I'll get hit with a couple\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nand then like I'll try to find an antidote.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:15.000\nMaybe or I just like, maybe, maybe there's a, maybe just keep running\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nand it's just like the darts are hitting everybody.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nYeah.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nAnd then I get to the front and there's the idol and I have a bag of sand.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nI'm like, I'm not going to weigh it now.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nI got fucking darts all over me.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:31.000\nThe darts aren't supposed to come out until, shut up.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nWhat did you, what did you design this place?\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:37.000\nWhy didn't you turn it off so I could get the idol?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:41.000\nThe, please rent Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nI could say, that's a great film.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:48.000\nGod damn it, the, so when I, I don't remember where I was\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:52.000\nor what year it was when the little person thing got floated.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nIt was like, and I was like, okay, but it was the same,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.000\nit was like the phrase African American I've always said is like,\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nit really rubs me, like it's not my job to be rubbed the right way\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nor the wrong way, that's the thing.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nAnd then I just go like, okay, if that's what we're saying,\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nbut I think that's fucking weird because you're saying that you're,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:10.000\nin that case, it's like the thing that I think is weird about it is that,\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nand I know that what they're doing is they're adding syllables\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nand I do understand the, because it's like,\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nit's about dehumanization, like any phrase that you can use\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nto like make someone sound like not a someone.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nYeah, if you say someone has, who has autism, you say,\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nyeah, he's an autistic, like that sounds right.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nAll of a sudden it's offensive.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nYeah, then I sound like an asshole.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nYeah, but if you say he is autistic, it's like, it's a little,\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:37.000\nespecially, do you think that, is there something new on the horizon\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:40.000\nthat might like, that, that term will evolve?\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:44.000\nI've been workshopping a couple that I'd like to run by you,\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nand can I tell them that I got the all clear?\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.000\nNo, that's a terrible desk piece that would be.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:58.000\nUm, but I don't, I don't, I mean, for me, like,\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:02.000\nI think in my ideal world, it would be if someone was describing\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:07.000\nhow I looked and like, to someone, it would be he has dwarfism,\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:11.000\nor he has achondroplasia, but achondroplasia is a five-syllable word,\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:15.000\nand we don't like saying more than three usually,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:18.000\nso, you know, that's, that's not very likely.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nUm, yeah, I mean, you definitely need,\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nbut what someone says, like, little prison,\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nis that, is that something that kind of like, like, automatically?\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nNo, it doesn't offend me at all, it's just, I don't,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\nit's just not how I, it's like, it doesn't enter my conscience.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nIt's like that painting of a ship in your bathroom,\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.000\nthat every time you pee, you're like,\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nwow, one of these days.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.000\nYeah. It's not ruining the house, but why,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nI'm not even into ships.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nWho bought this?\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nYeah, I mean, it's just like, like I was saying before,\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:48.000\nit's not like a, it's not that much of a prevalent part of my identity,\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:51.000\nwhere, you know, it's, it's like, not something I go out into the world thinking\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:54.000\nuntil it's the terms used, and I'm like, oh, right, yeah.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:58.000\nAnd, um, but, I mean, that being said, I don't mean to,\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nI mean, because other people love the term little person,\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nthat have dwarfism, other people are like, yes,\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nbecause it means it's the whole organization,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nlittle people of American, they do, you know, amazing things,\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:09.000\nthey have scholarships, they, because it's like,\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nwhen a baby has a disability, sometimes their parents will give it up for adoption,\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:15.000\nand they like, do an adoption coordination for people with dwarfism,\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nthat kind of thing. So, by saying, I'm not a fan of that,\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:22.000\nit's just me saying that like, as someone who was in middle school,\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nwhen the term was changed from dwarf to little person,\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nand I was just kind of supposed to be like, okay.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nRight.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nThat's what I am now.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\nRight out to the playground with all these Winston Churchill's,\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.000\nthese fucking, these professional diplomats in the making,\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nthey're real good at handling this kind of thing.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:43.000\nWell, I mean, it's just I didn't get a choice in like how,\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:46.000\nit's just like that's what I am now.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nDid you go to like a public school or private school?\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nYeah, I was in a public middle school.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:53.000\nI was actually also the only white kid in my middle school, so that was,\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nthat was kind of like a huge thing.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nYou fucking, you doubled down.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:00.000\nAnd I was the only guy with long curly hair,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:03.000\nplayed the violin and loved Pokemon and had Pokemon t-shirts.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nSo I was just like, yeah.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nMaking front of you was like a fucking.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nYeah.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:13.000\nThey could have just picked violin.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nThat would have been enough.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nThere was like a plethora of things.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nYou should have also just put a fake unicorn horn.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:25.000\nI just fucked up like 6,000 black kids.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nLike who just would go out into the world and go,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:31.000\nI swear though, I swear.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nI'm not racist.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:43.000\nAnd I'm also, I'm not, I don't believe in magic, but God damn it.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nI guess that's not a joke.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:48.000\nYou can even propose in the post internet era.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:54.000\nI was like, I was probably one of,\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\npeople think I'm exaggerating when I say this,\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nbut I have photos of my eighth grade graduation,\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:03.000\nlike where it's like comically and delightfully evident.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:08.000\nI was like one of like, I would say in a 2,000 kid junior high,\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:12.000\nI was probably, I think like one of 20 white kids.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nThere was a thing in Milwaukee,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:18.000\nwhich is like NPR just talked about being one of the most segregated cities in the country.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nThere's just this effort to like,\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:24.000\ntry to desegregate in both directions.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nSo they had a computer specialty program.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:31.000\nThey had two Apple IIEs in the basement of an inner city middle school,\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:36.000\nso that I would come in and learn to program in basic,\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nin the basement of this place.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:42.000\nAnd this very naive, but well-intended attempt to like,\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nsomething's wrong and we got to take a proactive step.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:50.000\nBut what I noticed from that experience is that, as I've said before,\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:53.000\nblack people are not racist, white people are,\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:56.000\nbecause I then went to a high school where it was flipped and it was like,\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nwe were fucking horrible.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nAnd I was like, I never got beat up for being white.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:03.000\nI never got, I never got, like, there was never any jokes.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nThere was never any dehumanization at all.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:09.000\nIt was never, nobody like made me, nobody like wanted to party with me.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:13.000\nLike, I was a nerd, but I was, I did not, I was not like,\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:17.000\nI did not feel fucking inhibited or anything like that.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nThis was a fucking...\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nWhere was your school gone?\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nWhat part of the country?\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nIt was in Southern Maryland, like near D.C. area.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nWas it, was it like, was it rough?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nWas it fun for you or bad?\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nIt wasn't fun.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:33.000\nI mean, the, you know, the aforementioned Pokemon and violin kind of,\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:39.000\nI saw to that, but it was, I mean, like,\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nwhen you're saying you didn't get bullied for being white,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nbullied for being white, like, I never got really bullied,\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nbut I did get, like, kids would accuse me of, like,\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\ngetting favoritism or something.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nRight.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:50.000\nBecause, you know, like, the teacher was white and I was white,\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:53.000\nand then there was, you know, like, I would do my work sometimes,\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nand then, like, other kids would do their work too,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nbut then, like, they, I don't know, it was,\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:02.000\nbut, I mean, that's not, I realize that sounds like the most elitist thing to say,\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nlike, I was accused of favoritism for being white.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nNo, I mean, that's...\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:10.000\nDo you think it actually could have been maybe some even tiny way white privilege\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nor no?\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nLike, that was just...\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nI mean, if the teacher was white for sure...\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:18.000\nI didn't know enough about it and my memories of that time are...\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:22.000\nBecause that would be amazing if that's how strong white privilege runs.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nI mean, it may well be, I don't know.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:25.000\nIt does, it does.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\nWhite people are fucking racist.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nThat's what we're good at.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nLike, we're really good at it.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:31.000\nWe're naturally, we have a gift for racism.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:35.000\nI know, it's like, like, I don't, I make that joke all the time,\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nbut it's like, I don't think it's genetic,\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:39.000\nbut I think it's fucking really, really strong, the momentum,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nbecause I have been in...\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:44.000\nI've observed these situations in a pre-internet world,\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nso now there's a whole new generation,\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nbut at this moment, there's...\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:52.000\nYou know that this shit, that toxic, like, still has tendrils,\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\neven though we're now all talking to each other and sharing stories\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nand everything's very verbose,\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.000\nbut like, in my growing up,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:02.000\nI saw every kind of configuration you could see,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nand I remember noticing, I was like,\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nthat guy is being really mean to that guy.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nLike, this person has all the power and their...\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nAnd the reverse of it, like, I had in that school,\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nI mentioned, like, all of my teachers were black,\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:20.000\nand I felt the reverse, like, thing,\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:24.000\nand I was like, good, like, I deserve it.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nI was like that self-loathing already as a kid,\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nI was just like, I get it, man.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nI'm surrounded by kids who are...\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nThere's fucking like, this shitty, like, they're 12 years old\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:36.000\nand they're writing, like, with Magic Marker,\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:39.000\nlike, they're being indoctrinated.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nWe all were into, like, gang culture,\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:44.000\nlike, I knew how to beat box by 11 years old\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:47.000\nand I knew how to, like, write the right gang signs and stuff,\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nand it was like, if you're a teacher\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nand you've bothered to, like, dedicate your life\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nto, like, molding minds and you see that happening\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\non the way out the door of your school,\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nyou're gonna get mad and you're only human, too.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:01.000\nSo when the white kid raises his hand for every question,\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nyou're gonna start treating him like a piece of shit.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd I was like, and being like, why don't you fucking cool it, nerd?\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:10.000\nLike, hit the showers,\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:13.000\nlike, see if I can work some magic here.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, I get it, I get it,\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nI've seen enough movies about this shit.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nNo, I just wouldn't raise my hand.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:22.000\nI just, like, I just...\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:25.000\nAlso, I didn't like putting attention on myself to begin with\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nbecause, I mean, when I'd like,\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:30.000\nsome from about six through, I'd say, probably 14\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nwhen I started going to high school,\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:35.000\nyou know, it was, like, and I didn't realize this\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nbecause as a kid, you're just kind of focused on yourself,\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:40.000\nbut, I mean, everyone gets bullied and that kind of thing,\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nbut for me, it seemed like disproportionate.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nRight.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:45.000\nYou know, because, like...\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nThat's no pun intended.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:47.000\nYeah.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.000\nOh!\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:49.000\nWhat?\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:53.000\nIf you guys can't handle that, I...\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nYou're gonna hate what he's about to say.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nYeah.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nThe bullying was disproportionate.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nNo, but you said yourself, you said, like,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.000\nyou always felt like there was favoritism,\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\nbut accusations or suspicions of favoritism,\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nand you said you didn't actually get bullied,\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nso, like...\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nWell, I mean, like, I was bullying, like,\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nnot for being white, just, like, for being short.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\nRight.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nI was, you know, because, I mean, I look different,\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\npeople don't like difference when...\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nThere had to be jokes behind your back\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nand behind your back never works.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\nYeah.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:27.000\nYeah, no.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:28.000\nBut, I mean, they weren't clever.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nNo.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nThey were just, like, pointing out,\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nlike, like, literally just, like,\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nyou're short and it's like, yeah.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:39.000\nOr, you know, like, it's like, your head's large, yeah.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:44.000\nMy brain is bigger than yours.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nIf your brain was my size,\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nyou wouldn't be saying that bullshit.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nNow, so then that takes us to your choice\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nto become an actor.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nYeah.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nIt's stellar.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nHitch your wagon to the star that...\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nNo, but it's like...\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nThe one career that's based on my looks, yeah.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:01.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nDo you think, like, how much of it is, like,\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:06.000\njust a passion for acting and how much of it is, like,\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nman, first of all, I got calluses\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nall over that part of my brain, you know,\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nlike, I can take a punch, like...\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:13.000\nYeah.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.000\nOr, like...\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nI mean, part of it's me...\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nI mean, I'm sure, ever since I was a kid,\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nI've always, like, whenever people said,\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nyou can't do something, I've always wanted to say,\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nyou know, well, fuck you, I'm going to.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nLike, because, I mean, doctors still don't know a lot\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nabout dwarfism, because it's a relatively recent thing,\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nand it's...\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nI just looked up the figure while I was backstage,\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nand there's, like, maybe even less than what I'd estimate.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nThere's, like, 35,000 people in the U.S.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nOh, okay.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:39.000\nI love that you're the one Googling,\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.000\nand then I just bring you out and go,\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:43.000\nhey, how does it feel to be small?\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nGoogle it, motherfucker!\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nWait, Khan...\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nThere's less than 35,000 people with dwarfism\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nin the U.S.?\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nYeah, I think that was...\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:53.000\nYeah, you said 100,000...\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nYeah, that was a very much...\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:58.000\nI mean, even that, 100,000 seems very low.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:01.000\nYeah, I mean, it's just not that problem of a thing.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nIt's just not that...\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:06.000\nBecause it's one in every around 40,000 births.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nReally?\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nYeah.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:11.000\nIs there any, like, looking back through history of,\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nlike, has it been the same throughout history?\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nHas it gone up and down, or do we even know that?\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nWell, I mean, historically,\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nI mean, people were...\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:23.000\nBabies were kind of killed a lot\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:26.000\nwhen they had differences that were kind of like that.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nAnd also, record keeping wasn't...\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:29.000\nYeah, that would be...\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nBut actually, like, in some cultures,\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nlike, I'm gonna be wrong,\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nso I'm not even gonna attempt to say which one it was.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nBut there's, like, paintings and stuff\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:38.000\nwhere you see people with dwarfism\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:41.000\nin very highly respected positions, like, you know,\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nbecause, like you're saying, with the whole brain thing,\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nlike, they were thought to be more intelligent\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nand that kind of thing in some cultures.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nLike, Spartan stuff, they would kill them.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nYeah, people that were left-handed were killed, too.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:52.000\nYeah.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.000\nIt didn't take a whole lot.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:54.000\nYeah, why?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:57.000\nThey're just like, look, like, are we a society\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nor are we an emotion workshop?\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nOr do we love freckles?\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nThis guy uses...\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nThis guy needs special scissors, I say.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:08.000\nCheaper to feed the dogs.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:13.000\nI mean, well, that's a really fascinating thing\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nabout humanity, too, is that we live in this, like,\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nfirst-world empire where we, I think,\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:20.000\namong the many assumptions that we don't know we're making\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:26.000\nis that morality, like, particularly interhuman morality,\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nit's not, like, genetic.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nIt's not born into you.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nThat doesn't make it not valuable.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nLike, we have this, like, misconception.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nIt's like, the really uncomfortable truth\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:41.000\nis that human beings are designed to survive\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:44.000\nwherever you might happen to drop them.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nAnd that is...\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nSo if you are living in a society that is hateful,\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:53.000\nyou will not use the word hateful\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:56.000\nto describe the thing that's hateful.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:59.000\nYou'll use the word normal to describe the word hateful.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nIf you're a Spartan, for example,\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nthe example I always use, because they had this, like,\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.000\nreally historically documented, incredibly specific society\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nwhere you got killed, apparently, for being left-handed,\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:11.000\nit's like, the kids growing up in that world,\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:14.000\nthey weren't, like, man, this is fucked up.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nI'm sure some of them were, and then they got killed\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nbecause that's worse than being left-handed.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:22.000\nBut they weren't, like, people didn't go to bed\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:25.000\nand, like, sweat and, like, have acid reflux\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:28.000\nand go to a therapist and go, I can't figure it out.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nAnd they're like, well, you're a Spartan\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:33.000\nand you're supposed to be living in Wisconsin in 2016\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nwhere everything's very enlightened.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:38.000\nOh, thanks, Doc. I'll move there right away.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nThe therapist was a Spartan and said,\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nyou should have your head cut off.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:46.000\nAnd my job shouldn't exist, because this is Sparta.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:51.000\nAnd we need to acknowledge that,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nnot because we need to hate ourselves more,\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nwe need to be proud of the fact that we're able to adapt to anything,\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nbut we need to, I think we need to, like,\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:02.000\nthe illusion that we have some inborn sense of right and wrong\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:07.000\nis dangerous as the other thing that is,\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:10.000\nit's this illusion that if you say the right combination of words,\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nyou can make everything better.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.000\nAnd that whoever smelt a Delta rule,\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nbecause now, and then we're talking,\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:20.000\nI'm a writer and a producer talking to an actor.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:24.000\nAnd so, like, you were just telling me in the green room,\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:28.000\nlike, you were, like, obviously any,\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nyou said you just went out for your first part\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nthat was, like, that had nothing to do with your stature.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:35.000\nWell, not my first, but, like, it's been,\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:39.000\nand part of that's due to my agent being one of,\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:42.000\nyou know, she's cool with sending me out for anything\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nthat, you know, young 20s-ish.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:45.000\nThe casting director.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nYeah.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nOr your agent.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nMy agent is.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nBut I've been getting called in a few more times recently\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:54.000\nfor stuff that's not exclusively for a little person\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nor that kind of thing.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.000\nAnd...\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nWhen you see a breakdown, like as an actor,\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:03.000\nit'll say all ethnicities, all shapes and sizes,\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nand they don't really mean that.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:06.000\nNo, they don't mean that.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nThey don't fucking mean that.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nBecause the writer wrote it and said,\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:11.000\nshe's tall, she's nerdy, hot.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:12.000\nRight.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nYou know, and hot doesn't know it.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:15.000\nSubmit all ethnicities.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:18.000\nLike, you said Blonde five times in that description.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:19.000\nRight.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nLike, I mean, they're saying that the corporation\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:22.000\nhas to say that.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.000\nAnd I think they're, I was about to ask the same question\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:26.000\nthat Daniel's asked you.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:29.000\nAre you seeing any opening up of that gate\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:32.000\nto them actually meaning such things when they say that?\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:36.000\nWell, I think they're, the fact that I'm even getting\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nin the room now is, speaks to something,\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nbecause, you know, with the age of technology and stuff,\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nyou can look at someone's entire thing\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nwithout ever meeting them.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:45.000\nRight.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nAnd, you know, I don't pretend to know what goes on\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:48.000\nin casting offices.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nI've never been in, like, on that side.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:53.000\nBut I feel like, you know, once you look at someone's\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nreal and you're like, all right, they're very clearly\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:56.000\nnot what we're looking for.\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nIt helps you narrow down.\n\n41:58.000 --> 41:59.000\nBut hopefully, yeah.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nNow they can come down to essentially what the character\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:04.000\nneeds to be as opposed to what they thought the silhouette\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:05.000\nof that person needed to be.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:09.000\nAnd I feel like as more young, well, not young writers,\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nbut like writers that are more open-minded\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:15.000\nand that kind of thing become in positions of power\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:19.000\nwhere they can, you know, like create shows\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:20.000\nand that kind of thing.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nBy the way, it'll have to be young writers,\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nbecause ironically, if you're over 50,\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nyou're not allowed to be a writer.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nNot on a staff.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nLike, I've run up against that where it's like,\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nwell, there was a lawsuit, a class action lawsuit,\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nabout ageism and writing rooms.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nI just thought it was, I just wanted to dip that in,\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nbecause the layers of irony are that like...\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.000\nIt will be a young writer.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.000\nIt won't be an old writer.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nBecause when old writers are sitting at home going,\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.000\nfuck the society, they fucking tell me,\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:49.000\nlike, yeah, I know why you didn't hire me.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:53.000\nIt will start with writers, and I know this firsthand.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:56.000\nAnd it's also, like, important for me to say,\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nthis is a 180-degree point of view.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:01.000\n180-degree from when I was your age.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:04.000\nWhen I was your age, I was unemployed.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nI wanted to be the best writer in the world.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nI wanted to save the universe with my words.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nAnd I was also, without realizing it,\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:14.000\nI was just, like, the voice of, like, you know,\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:15.000\nholding things back.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nBecause I would get my Writers Guild magazine,\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:21.000\nwhich was being printed with the money that I didn't have.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nAnd it was like, I broke my tooth last month,\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nbut because I didn't do a rewrite on a Beetlejuice cartoon\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nthis month, I can't get it fixed.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:30.000\nAnd the money's going to, like, this glossy magazine,\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nand every month, you know, I open my mailbox\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nand there's always some smiling, ugly face looking at me\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:36.000\nthat's a successful writer.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nThere's this peanut-headed fucking, oh, that's just sweet.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:39.000\nOkay.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nIf I could, well, what'd he do that's so great?\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:43.000\nOh, I traded, Buffy.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:44.000\nOkay.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:45.000\nWhat else, though?\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:46.000\nAll right, everything.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.000\nAll right, fine, fine.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:50.000\nThen I won't read your magazine.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:51.000\nWhat?\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:52.000\nWe're called writers.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nWhy are you making us read shit?\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:57.000\nBut when I would look through that, man.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:58.000\nWriters hate reading.\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:01.000\nOne of the bookmarks I have in my head\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:05.000\nof the 180-degree Harmon politically as a writer\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:10.000\nis literally throwing one of those WGA magazines\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nacross the room because I had just looked at this\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:15.000\nsidebar item that was called a report card\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nabout diversity in writer's rooms or something like that.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:21.000\nAnd I saw the words and I didn't even see the content.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:22.000\nI just threw it.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nAnd I was doing it.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.000\nPeople think that the white people that are doing that\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:31.000\nare doing it because they're racist.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:35.000\nThey're doing it because they're,\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:38.000\nto derive from privilege, it's a combination of that\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nand fucking like underdog syndrome.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nEverybody's an underdog.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:46.000\nSo I was like, I'm the best writer in this fucking city.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:50.000\nAnd the union that represents me is spending money\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:54.000\nand attention on competition between who can hire\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:57.000\nmore people that have different shaped hats\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nthan who is the best writer.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:02.000\nAnd when I would say that, I would imagine a chorus\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nof super-talented black writers behind me going,\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:09.000\nfucking go, man, because I don't want any fucking handouts\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:12.000\nand I want to be known for my writing, too.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:16.000\nI was deluded, the difference is I had to become a showrunner.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nI had to be in charge of hiring.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nI had to have a stack of scripts on my desk\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:24.000\nand be like, oh, oh, Harvard, Yale, Harvard, Yale, Harvard,\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:27.000\nYale, and be like, oh, there's a systemic thing\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:30.000\nand this cycle needs to be broken at any point along the chain,\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:36.000\nSo the new thing now, the bleeding edge of this is like,\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:40.000\nugh, it's like, I just finished a script with Chris McKenna\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:44.000\nwho effectively ran community five and six with me\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:47.000\nand was like, the reason why community is good.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:51.000\nWe, because we're old white men who are in the twilight\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:55.000\nof our efficacy and we want to write another good one\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.000\nand do everything right from square one,\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nwe're writing this script together\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:03.000\nand we're having all these conversations going,\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:09.000\nhow do you, okay, is it possible to write a gender neutral character?\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:12.000\nSo far, it turns out the answer is no.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:16.000\nIt's possible to write a transgender character.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:19.000\nIt's possible to like leave it up to the casting director\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:22.000\nwithout the script reading like toothpick instructions.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:28.000\nLike pronouns are fucking endemic to move in the action.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:32.000\nLike there's a way I all try to get more talented\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nbut like ultimately what I ended up doing is going,\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:37.000\nthis character, when introducing the character,\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nthis character can be any gender,\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:44.000\nwe're gonna call him a he to fucking get the script finished.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:47.000\nBut it's a gender neutral character.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nWhat's important is their age.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nSometimes what's important is their age.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nIt's important that they're in their 20s\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nbecause of the dynamic that they'll have with the person in their 40s,\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:59.000\ndepending on the situation.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:02.000\nWe talked the entire time,\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.000\nI have a point to all of this,\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nwe talked the entire time,\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:11.000\nthese like noble minded fucking like middle aged white writers,\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:15.000\nwe're going like, how do you accomplish this, what do you do?\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nThe thing that we kept saying,\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nhaving this like weird debate about was like,\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nokay there's this buffoon in the script.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nIt's the Michael Scott figure.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:28.000\nHe's the guy that you love to feel bad for or slash hate,\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:31.000\nhe's got the foot in his mouth.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:34.000\nWe would have endless conversations.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:37.000\nIt's like, we know that can be a woman\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:40.000\nif the actor is the right actor.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:43.000\nUltimately though, as a comedian,\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:47.000\nas a comedic writer who worships at this altar that is so much higher,\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.000\nis there a craft that you're betraying,\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:55.000\neven by 5% in the interest of like progress or anything,\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nshould that buffoon,\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:01.000\nis it an extra 5% funnier if he's a straight white male,\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:04.000\ndoes it go down 5% for the sake of progress\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:09.000\nif your buffoon for instance is a woman\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:14.000\nand the answer, we very happily never came up with an answer,\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nso we just were like,\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nokay let's just keep thinking of this guy we work with\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nand using him as like in our heads\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:23.000\nand like let's just make sure when we get,\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nif we start to get a pickup,\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:28.000\nwe got to fight this battle in casting.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nWe got to say, get Kristen Wiig in here\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:33.000\nand see if she can like do this like Michael Scott character.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:36.000\nYeah, you wish, asshole.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:41.000\nNo, I make no eye contact and said you wish asshole to myself,\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nyou thought there was an asshole.\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:49.000\nSo here's the last part of my story\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nthat's a cautionary tale for the future,\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:54.000\nbecause it's up to writers and it's fucking like,\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nI was on the phone because we turned in the script\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nand they're like, this is awesome,\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nlet's get on the phone and talk about what actors to give this to\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nand I'm like holy shit, this has never happened.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:05.000\nLike oh my god, I can't believe we're talking about this guy\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nand this guy, and this guy, and this guy,\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nand this white guy, and this white guy,\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nand this white guy, and this white guy,\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:14.000\nand I didn't even, it was like 40 minutes into the conference call\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nand I was like looking at headshots and I was like,\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:21.000\nthis is a blizzard of talent, a very talented blizzard.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:28.000\nI am my cup runneth over with Rudds and...\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:33.000\nAnd then I had to like,\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:37.000\nI'm not telling this story because I'm any kind of hero in it,\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nI'm telling this story as a,\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:42.000\nbecause I was so, I forgot,\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:45.000\nI fucking forgot until halfway through the conversation\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.000\nand then I was like, oh yeah, yeah, wait, wait.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:51.000\nAnd then I was like, you guys know, right,\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nhave we ever had this conversation?\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nLike is this something that's unspoken?\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nCasting directors have to run their thing like a target,\n\n49:57.000 --> 50:00.000\nthey have to know where the big shirts are\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nand the small shirts and the dark shirts\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nand the checkered shirts.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nThey have to, if they don't know that they're,\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\npart of their job as a casting director,\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nnot the whole job, they're doing it wrong.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:14.000\nThey have to be like a wholesaler of corporeal humanity.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nOh, you want a little person?\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:20.000\nI got, I know a fucking great actor who's a little person.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nYou want the word little person to change?\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nIt's out of my jurisdiction.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:27.000\nBut the other, and the other part of their job\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nis curating talent and going like,\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nno, I'm not going to send you a little person\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nwho's also a hack and all this shit,\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nand also hopefully going like, look,\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:38.000\nyou said this character can be anything.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:41.000\nI'm sending you the most,\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:44.000\nthe best actors I have, my favorites,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:47.000\nthat's what good casting directors do.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nThey already do that.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nIt starts, the important thing,\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nit starts with the writer as much as,\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nthe writer has to be like, if you're in TV,\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nthey have to be like,\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:01.000\nyou're going to think of like fucking white people\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nfrom your neighborhood if you don't,\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nif you don't like switch.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nIf I'm interrupting you, do you want to keep going?\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nYou're interrupting me and you're a hero for it.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nThe blue wire, the blue wire.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nBut like, for instance, the Obed character,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nyou knew a guy named Obed.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:20.000\nOur friend, the real Obed, who is,\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:24.000\nis he Iraqi, Iranian?\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nWhat is Obed?\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nHe's Arabic.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:31.000\nHalf Arabic, half Swedish or something.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:34.000\nAnd he is, you know, on some part of the spectrum\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nand whatever, and you wrote this interesting character\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nand you said, I'm basing it on this person.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nI felt like it was important, the regionality.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:43.000\nBut Danny Pooty came in, who's Indian,\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nhalf Indian, half Polish.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nBut then, that's possibly a step in a direction.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:50.000\nI said like, because your circle of friends\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:53.000\nstopped being white dudes from Milwaukee\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nand then white dudes from Los Angeles, whatever,\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nyou started to have a bigger group of friends,\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nyou meet Colin, you meet more women,\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nyou meet people that like, you can start writing as a writer\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:05.000\nand say, I'm writing this around an actual person\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nthat you should meet.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nAnd then, not that it needs to even be that person\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nat the end of the day when they cast it\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nand when they make the show,\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:17.000\nyou start like focusing in like on, say like,\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nthe reason why we're doing this is not randomly\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\ntrying to be diverse.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:24.000\nWe're writing this because I hung out at a bar with Colin\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:27.000\nand the character doesn't have to be,\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nI have dwarfism.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nI just think it's way funnier, like,\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nbecause I've met him when I talked to him\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nand there's an essential quality here.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nWell, this is a lazy answer, but it's like,\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:40.000\nif what you're doing is really specific,\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:43.000\nas in that example, then go with God\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nand use that technique.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:48.000\nI wrote this for my small friend Colin,\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nI had a conversation with him and I have this vision\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nof this character, even though there's no mention\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nof it in the script, like, it's important and blah, blah, blah.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nDefinitely, go ahead, do that.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nI'm talking about the other side of it,\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nis when you don't have those specific thoughts\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nand you are picturing either yourself\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:05.000\nor Steve Carell,\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:09.000\nyou aren't doing anything wrong,\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.000\nyou're just not doing a thing\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nthat if writers don't do it,\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nlike, especially writer-producers,\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nyou're doing what's very comfortable for you,\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:19.000\nyou're trying to get the script sold,\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:20.000\nyou're trying to get it made.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:21.000\nYou should think of Steve Carell while you write it,\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:22.000\nbut you should ask yourself,\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:23.000\nyou should go through your script and go,\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:27.000\nhow many of these jokes are based on him,\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nlike, oh, here it is,\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nlike, they need an extra bounce card,\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nbut then the complexion of his face,\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nlike, reflects the sun.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nLike, there is nothing, there's no bits like that,\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nit doesn't matter what, it doesn't,\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nbut you should picture Steve Carell\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nbecause you're picturing this funny person\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nor the person with all these quirks,\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nbut then you have to say,\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nlike, to the casting director\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nand the network and the studio,\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nyou have to go, like, we gotta put,\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nwe gotta exercise a muscle that's, like,\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nnot atrophied, whatever the word is,\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nwhen it's not even used.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:02.000\nWe have to start doing crunches with this muscle\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:06.000\nwhere we make sure that it's like\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\na cattle call and all the cows,\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nlike, are coming in.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nHow often, like, how many times,\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nor percentage-wise, when you go in for casting,\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nis it specific to who you are\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nand what you look like,\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nor how often is it not?\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nLike, do you feel like it's honestly,\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nlike, they're open for seeing you,\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nlike, because they're really, you know...\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:29.000\nIt's, like, probably 70%,\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nit's usually because of my size,\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\n30-ish recently.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nI'm surprised it's actually 70-30,\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nlike, I would have thought worse than that, but that's...\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nYeah, I mean, like,\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nI mean, my type's not called for that much,\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nso, I mean, it's not, like...\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nIt would be skewed if, like,\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nthat type was called for a lot more.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nDo you feel some sort of, like, movement in that direction?\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nLike, do you feel like it's, like,\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nsort of shifting into a more even?\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nYeah, I think it's for everyone.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nI mean, honestly, like, you know,\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nfor people with different ethnicities,\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nfor different genders, for, you know,\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\ndifferent, like, gender identities,\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nan actor up here that was black and had dwarfism,\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nwhat would he be like?\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nYou fucking think you have it bad?\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nI mean, yeah, probably, honestly.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nI've never, that whole mediocre superpowers,\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nthe question we're always asking ourselves,\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nman, if I could conjure a...\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nAnd we were talking about this a little bit before,\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nI don't know if you remember, but, like,\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nhow a friend of mine once told me\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nthat I am both privileged and not privileged\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nat the same time,\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nwhich, to be fair, like,\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nwhen I'm walking around the streets in New York,\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\ncops, like, smile.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nThey nod and, like,\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nthey sometimes say hi,\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nand...\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nWhat about Chicago?\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nI've never been to Chicago.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nI've never not wanted\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\na little person\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nblack person\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nto be around me, but I've never wanted it\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nmore than right now, because I'm so fat,\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nI want to know, like, if he would say,\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nlike, oh, yeah, cops, like,\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nI have no idea, like...\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nI wouldn't know, and I'm not about to speculate.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nYeah.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nI mean, it's just because I'm not in a position\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nto say, because, I mean, I would never, you know,\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nlike... Because it could go either way.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nThe cops are smiling at you, because they're just, like,\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nGod, finally a stress-free encounter\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\njust for...\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nIt's like, they don't think I'm capable\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nor would do anything.\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nUntil the first day, you know, ISIS will,\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nyou know, a little terrorist will...\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nI think...\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nI think I remember seeing a storyline...\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nIs it ISIS that you're offended for?\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nI always...\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nSometimes I just want to check in with you guys.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nI mean,\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nI would be offended if ISIS was trying to\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\ncapitalize on, like,\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nbeing an undiversity.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nLike, they thought that was going to make them\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nmore likable.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nAnd that ISIS, eventually, would have more\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\ndiversity than paramount.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nOh, that would be...\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nOh, my God, look at this!

done\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nI think it was 11 episodes,\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nalthough the last one is 25 minutes\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nlonger or something.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nBut that was Kyle Ryder\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nand also Matt Freund.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nAnd the three of us together\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\njust sort of saying, what could we do\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nthat's absolutely insane and\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\ninvolves all of these things.\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nIt starts off as like Bronson meets\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nArsenal meets\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nHarold Maud.\n\n01:04:23.000 -->

01:04:31.000\nto Kyle for everyone that we would shoot\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nevery month.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nMaybe he's got this jacket on.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nSometimes he'd say yes, sometimes he'd say no.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nLike folding back on a question\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nto Colin, because it also\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nfelt like in that Gumball series\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nthat you guys collectively, I always imagined\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nwe're talking about that you liked\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nmovies like Sexy Beast\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nor like British indie movies\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nand that it was

--> 01:35:56.000\nkeep it together\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nit's just\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nrole playing based on the universe of HP Lovecraft\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nthat's all I can say\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nit's a game that involves serious commitment\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nto the flavor of the universe\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nthis sounds like\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nright up our alley\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nthat's why I just believe all of it\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nit's a very tonal\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000\na game it's all about the horror\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nand\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nthe paranoia of dealing with the\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nancient ones\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nlet's the three of us talk about this\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000\noffstage\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nwe'll come at this in a way that we can come at this\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nI know that if we end up playing Call of Cthulhu\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nit'll be because that conversation got very\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nuncomfortable for Spencer\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nto the point where he\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nhe said look\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000\nyou can do this if you want\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000\nI'm going to protest I'll still do it\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nbecause I get paid so much\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nSpencer doesn't get paid\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nwould we theoretically\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000\nDan be allowed to play that\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nlegally because Harmon Quest\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nI'm actually trying to think of because\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nas far as the letter of the contract goes\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nit's medieval fantasy that we shouldn't\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000\nlike\n\n01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nthat's what we're told\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nbut I think we could honestly a phone call\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nor not one and just breaking the rule\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nno one's going to sue us for anything\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nwhat if we got really into fantasy\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nBritish Premier League soccer\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nI will tell you this for sure the most important\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nthing to solve\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nis personnel\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nwe could engineer\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nthe game if we wanted where there was a guest player\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nbut they would be designed to be always\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000\npocketed but it's like we got to make sure\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nlike people are reasonably always coming\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nyeah because when we first started\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nthe very beginnings of\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000\nD&D\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nit was you and I doing these little\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nbite-sized things where you and I could remember\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nwhat you and I did it was kind of like a two-man\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nlittle thing that's what those were the golden\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nyeah maybe expand on that\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000\nslowly, modulally\n\n01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nyou can't role play for 15 minutes\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000\nwith six people and four of them are like\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nI have a purple mohawk and\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000\nI've never seen this show\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nwhat do these words mean\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nand I'm like well I know\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000\neverything that's going on and it was in a blackout\n\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nlast time we played I think\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nit's something I really like I never\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000\ngot to really learn much about my character\n\n01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nI really like designing EVE Liberteam but I never\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000\ngot to do anything like it's like\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nnot because it was anybody else's fault\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nI never knew what the fuck\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000\nwe were doing I learned a lot about\n\n01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nNorway\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nI did research\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nHordegaard was a rich tapestry\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nalso I think\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nthe few times Curtis played\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nDoctor Friend\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nhe had no idea what was going on\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000\nso he made hard\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nfast decisions that were\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nbeautifully etched in marble\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000\nthat was really good but he was also like\n\n01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000\ntonally he was like look I don't\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nwant to talk about that\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nI feel\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nAgony\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000\nAgony\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nhe approached it like an actor\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nanyways speaking of actors let's\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nmake sure that Colin\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000\nColin have you ever done role playing games before\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nhave you ever done
