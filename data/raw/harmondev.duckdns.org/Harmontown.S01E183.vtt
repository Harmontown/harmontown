WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, this is entertainment everybody from Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.

00:14.000 --> 00:31.000
Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden into the stage, shall we?

00:31.000 --> 00:49.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:49.000 --> 01:02.000
There's kind of a shower effect when you're in your car and you're like, I'm a BG!

01:02.000 --> 01:21.000
Let's go back about elite class. Harmonize! Harmonize!

01:21.000 --> 01:39.000
The show already dedicated to Glenn Fry.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
We prededicate that one to Eagles singer and guitar player Glenn Fry.

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
Why do I always, I guess it's stage fright, I always need the, is the microphone too far forward?

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I thought you guys liked it back a little bit.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Is director Chris Peruff back there?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Good for camera!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
It's good for camera if it's back a little bit.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, we don't care about you guys.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
We just want to milk your laughs, your presence.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
This feels better because this feels like the way it's always been.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, colloquially backstage with the crew, we call you the aphids.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
It's a reference to those ants that milk, they milk aphids.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I thought we called them the day sleepers.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
The day sleepers? Wait, they're the vampires?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
No, no, they're just, they're just lazy.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
So there was a, remember we talked in Miami, I think, before the guy got punched in the face.

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
We were talking a little bit about, it's not because of the, the transgender, I still don't know if you call it a movement.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
I think that sounds a little weird, it sounds like, because it's whatever, the transgender thing that's happening,

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
our new found awareness of it, it has raised this very interesting question that's just sort of on a fundamental level about bathroom dichotomy.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Like what are we doing? What have we been doing?

03:04.000 --> 03:13.000
I think a very well-intended thing in the past, in the days of a long ago when bathrooms were just maybe like bushes or caves,

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
like maybe there probably was a great progressive thought behind like, oh, ladies go over there and the fellas go over there.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
But it's not as complicated as just tearing down that wall because men are pigs and sometimes women too.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Like there's different, there are just differences, there's different things that happen in men's rooms and women's rooms.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
The big thing that you brought up.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I gotta say, I was wrong about that. I looked it up way off.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
What?

03:37.000 --> 03:49.000
I said, I told you, I said on this very stage to millions of unsuspecting people that single-user stalls end up screwing women over,

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
but it turns out single-user stalls are the best way to push out and equalize wait times,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
and wait times are truly the commodity of the bathroom.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Okay, well I can't.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
I'm sorry, hang on, Dan. I remember, I just listened to that Miami episode today.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
You're saying, what you said the last, that time was that women take longer biologically and that's why, that's.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yes, which is true.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
It is true.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
But to that end, that has only affected non-single-user genderless bathrooms.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That's only affected the current bathroom paradigm.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, let me cut, let me, let me.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You guys, you gotta look up potty parity.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
Let me, let me, let me cut to my chase because I thought I was a genius getting out of the shower today.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You still are.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I took a shower today.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You still are.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, actually, I wasn't a genius. I ripped this off. Somebody on Twitter said this, and they mentioned your name because they said,

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
the discussion you guys were having, and they said, do, do have multiple bathrooms, but, but make them like long and short.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
In terms of like the time you're going to take.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Right.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
You're going to make a number one or a number two kind of, or, or are you, are you making a number two and or female?

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
You know, women don't want to be lumped in with shitting men.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
But I was, I was like, like, if you, if you, if you look at it more like, like, like lanes on a freeway.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
There's, there's separation on the freeway that when people don't observe it, shit gets fucked up and you get mad at them because they

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
don't know how to drive right. You know, what if we had like two or even three bathrooms at the places, the bigger the place,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
add more lanes.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
It's like fast lane, passing lane, you know, like, I just have to fucking, I'm not even going to wash my hands.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Wait, Dan, are you, I'm going to piss my pants.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I just need a place to do it while I check my texts.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, we'll get back to you not washing your hands.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
No, no, no, I always wash my hands.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I was making a joke.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Okay.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Are you saying the lane choice is on the door out front of the bathroom?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, it's like, it's like, it's like slow and fast.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Like, are you going to take a long time?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Go in here.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
You see if you poop.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
And so I know, and then I was tumbling off and I was like, oh, that won't work because in a crowded situation, then people that are

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
backed up in the slow lane, they're going to start going into the fast lane.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But no, there will be shame involved in that.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
And the only, just as on the freeway, because you like, you'll go in and you'll, you'll, you'll, there will be a line

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
forming outside the fast toilet, which shouldn't be happening.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
And you'll be a piece of shit when you come out.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
And the song, the song that will play when you leave there, I mean, don't poop in the fast lane.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I'd say,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Sure, brought you by Glenn Fry, everybody.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
And then there will be arguments.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
People like a guy will come out and everyone will start booing him and he'll go, I'm a fast shooter.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And I said, no, you're not.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
What, what, what, what is the cutoff point for what is fast and what is slow?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, that's, I mean,

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
There should be a big red digital clock right in the door with like a spring loaded toilet.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Freeways.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
There's a speed limit.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You get ejected out of the door.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
You get a fine as a speed limit.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Right.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Which, what's the cutoff for freeways?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Why, why, when do you get to go in the fast lane?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
A cop won't answer that question because he can't technically tell you to speed.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
But the truth is, if you're trying to get to work really fast, you're supposed to go around people.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
It's called the fast lane. If we all went 55, there wouldn't be a fucking fast lane.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It's called the fast lane.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
But there's a limit to the speed in that lane.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
And so everyone's, when everyone's driving 35 on the freeway, that's when the city, that's why they built that lane.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
It's for the days when everyone's just feeling leisurely.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And driving under the speed limit.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And you want to go 55 and a half miles an hour.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
So that's what this lane is for.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
No, it's for going 70.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And there could be a 55 of shitting.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I gotcha.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And then there couldn't be a Sammy Hagar of shitting.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Who would be like, fuck you!

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Don't tell me what to do!

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I like to read a book when I do it!

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I check my tweets, I get on Facebook too!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I can't shit!

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
In less than an hour!

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
And there's like a judge, like with her horned rain glasses, she takes them off and starts dancing.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Fuck that!

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
She's like, I like this guy.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
He fucking shits like a fucking molasses.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
Can you draw me up like on a grid D&D pathfinder map of what you would like?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
You go to an airport and you go to an airport.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
You have to relieve yourself.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
You come across how many doors, and what do those doors say?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Or have you got that far?

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
They say, when I was getting out of the shower, it was long and short.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Not number two and number one.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
But there are other factors, but let's get to those factors.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
As Spencer says, the big key issue first of all is wait time.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That's the tyranny of bathrooms.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
So solve that and then we can get into, maybe we start to devolve a whole fucking culture.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
About peeing and washing your hands and pooping and lighting matches.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh my god, can you imagine? Of all of this emphasis we put on consideration.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
We didn't then undercut by going in the bathroom and wailing all over the walls

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
because we think everyone else is secretly a racist animal.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
And we hate them and we don't want to touch the same toilet seat as them.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
And we're electing a fascist and we're like, oh, don't forget to keep your elbows off the table.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
We're a fucking liar.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Let's look where we shit.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
We should make it fucking scientific.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
You should feel like a clone when you poop.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Don't you feel like a naughty clone?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Like who's scientists are mad at them and testing them.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
You should fucking like, it's a sanitary business.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
How do you think babies feel when they shit?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
They can't do anything about it.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
They're like, oh shit, I fucked up.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
But you know, there should be luxury, there should be talcum,

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
there should be love and squeezing and motorboats.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
What? I don't know.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Razzleberries?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Okay, you can't motorboat a baby.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Babies ain't got no titties.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Dear penthouse.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
I never thought I'd be reading one of these letters.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
I work at a large home depot.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I said it, home depot.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I work at home depot.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
And in walked this woman with a baby that wouldn't quit.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
I knew I had to motorboat it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
All right, so it's time for a new segment.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
This is called paragraphs that I,

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
sentences I pull from newspaper articles

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
and read out of context because it's funny.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I think Jay Leno does this.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Sometimes when you read news,

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
you get to a sentence that makes you realize

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
you're 43 in a world being taken over by children

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
that don't know how to put a thought together.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Okay, just a little article about Ben Carson losing his,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
he's always been a conservative fellow,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
but he was also like a hometown hero to a lot of his own,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I don't know, personal kind of like,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I can't remember where he's from and what he,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
but he was like, you know, he did good stuff.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
He's from Nappy Town.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
He's from Nappy Town?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Sleepy Town.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
He always looks like he's going to take a little nap.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
He always looks like he just had a turkey sandwich

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
and a glass of warm milk.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Well, here's it.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
This is me after, if I did nine yoga classes,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
that's how alert he looks.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
This is out of a Washington Post article about Ben Carson.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
And it did, the headline did involve his blackness,

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
but I still think this is a weird sentence.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Carson has been a black icon since 1987

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
when he became the first person to successfully separate twins

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
conjoined at the backs of their heads.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
While being black.

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
Black people loved that shit.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
You know that stereotype of the black lady in the operating room?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Look at those babies disconnected.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Ma'am.

12:41.000 --> 12:52.000
We're going to have to ask you to stop yelling out during your surgery.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I meant to say Sleepy Town at first.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
I said Nappy Town and people thought I meant Nappy like Nappy Hair.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Oh God.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I'm proud to say you just put that in my head.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm very proud of myself.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
This millennial crowd knew exactly what I'm saying right now.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
They heard that.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Who knows with them?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
If it didn't trip my wires, I mean that's the thing.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
This is going to be a theme tonight because we're going to have a fellow up here

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
that we've never met before on the show.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
You and I have met him, but we're going to be talking about

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
the realm of the uncomfortably surface sea and how deep it goes.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
We have Dr. Ben Carson here tonight.

13:28.000 --> 13:37.000
One of the themes that I'd like to talk about is the sometimes damaging thing.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
I don't know if I'm stealing this from somebody clever that actually coined it.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I think it's a really apt.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I read it somewhere, heard it somewhere.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
A penny saved is a penny earned.

13:49.000 --> 13:59.000
The modern code of, I don't know what to call it, political correctness

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
that has all these negative connotations.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
If you could come up with a golden rule of social etiquette,

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
political cultural etiquette, the rule has become whoever smelt it dealt it.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
In other words, if you keep your mouth shut,

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
you stand tactically the highest percentage chance of not being offensive,

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
which is I think a very dangerous thing because as we can see in our culture,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
you kind of want the idiots talking as loudly as possible.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
It's better than them slinking around in the shadows and then popping up all of a sudden.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
And becoming the front-runner for one of our two political parties.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah, I would like if that guy, well, he is a fucking like, yeah, what should we have done,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
given him a reality show?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
We already did!

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
We gave him 30 reality shows.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
He was good at all of them.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
He's definitely a fucking anomaly.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
He himself is a, like, he should be...

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
There's a lot of reasons to not like Donald Trump.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Here's one of my top 30.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
He says very too much.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
You know, I think the Mexicans are very, very, you know, I think they're very good people,

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
but they're very corrupt and our economy is very, very good.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But people very like me.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
They very, very, very like me.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
I say, are you like a kid trying to air out your 10,000-word book report

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
by adding more varies and really is into it?

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
They had an article that was like the 76 campaign promises

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
that we've been able to, you know, glean from what he's said so far.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
It's really, it's very, very terrifying.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's really, really, really terrifying.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
We need a very, very big wall and then I'm going to bomb ISIS

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and I'm going to do it by having very, very good generals.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yes, yes.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
And they're going to make really good bombs, the best ever.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Like he sounds like a six-year-old.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
These bombs, these bombs are going to be so good,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
your head's going to spin.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I mean, they'll be blown off.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Your head's going to be blown off but as they're flying off of your body

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
your head's going to spin and how good these bombs are.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yeah.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
And I want to clarify something.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
I just heard myself say something that might have been offensive to six-year-olds

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
because I...

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
It's too late.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
It's too late.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
You've been coming down on six-year-olds for fucking too long.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I don't want six-year-olds to listen to this podcast.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
They shouldn't yet.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
But I really mean this.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
I like most of them and he's like a shitty six-year-old.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I just wanted to clarify that.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
He's like a six-year-old that you go to a family on Christmas

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
and he's the one little cousin that's like,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
you're playing some game and everybody's like,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
this is so cool, we made up this game.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And then he's always the one that's like,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
if you're playing, let's shoot missiles with these G.I. Joe things.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
He's like, now I'm shooting a missile that blows up every plane in the whole room

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
no matter where you try to hide.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Infinity.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Infinity.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
You can't just say that.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
You just said something, loser.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I think there's a conflict of interest.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Why are you even moderating this G.I. Joe?

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
There's a word for that and it's a word that applies I think for almost all of them

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
with maybe one or two exceptions.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
It's petulance and the political discourse is

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
petulant children level of fucking discourse.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
They're all 70 and they're all like calling each other old

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
and they're all talking about 9-11 like it's their friend

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
and they're all pieces of shit and they're all born rich

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
and they can all take a fuck fly.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I don't know what I was trying to do in the middle of that.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I know the phrase flying fuck.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I was like, you know what, Harmon, you can beat that.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
They could take a first class flight fuck

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
and fucking mint jet blue mint.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Jet blue mint.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
We flew fucking first class jet blue which is nice.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You sit in these little egg pods and it seems really groovy

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
and then I went down into the like the recline mode

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
but you can't just rock your seat back.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You can't just go like lean back.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
The whole thing has to go brrrrr

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
and your legs come out into this like this whole long bed frame kind of thing

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
but at one point it was very clear to me

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
that my legs were not going to get any farther than the wall in front

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
and now I'm being like Star Wars trash compactor seats.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Free B.O.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Free B.O.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Wreck and E.B.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Wreck and E.B.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I'm so distracted.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Jeff Fort.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I can't.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
This is the perfect time to bring out our guests.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Right at the height of you complaining about your leg room.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Everybody.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
It was the worst time.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It was the worst time then.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
This is the worst time to do that.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Our first, the current phrase is a little person.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
He's an actor.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
We met him in New York.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Colin Buckingham is here.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Let's bring him out.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Awkward.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
There you go.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Sweet.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
That worked perfectly.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
What's up Colin?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
How you doing?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
We met at the CISO launching, right?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
How you been?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Doing well.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
How you doing?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Great.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Do you live out here?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
No, I live in New York City.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
What do you think about Jeff's leg room complaints?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I mean, he gets crunched in the first class again.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
The fuck you put in this?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Fucking.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
Do you try to ambush me with Colin?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Your piece of shit.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
This is Dan.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm ashamed of him noticing things

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
that are different about other people.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It's just funny.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
In his defense, though,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
when I was doing the reclining thing,

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
it didn't, like, I almost slid down into the...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm trying to think, like,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
they had to be designed for this really median,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
like, height person.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Like, 5'8", maybe, was the perfect sweet spot.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Can I put in a thing about that?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I did have a lot of leg room, though.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This is it.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The...

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I'm fat, and that's not easy either.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
The JetBlue first class, I'll go too.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
As far as how you're treated as a human being,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
like, so far, they're new to first class

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
for terrible reasons because the airlines are cartels.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Don't get me started.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm sorry, the airlines are a cartel.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
That's the important thing about a cartel.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
It's not plural.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Otherwise, it would be fucking amazing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It would be capitalism.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
The only thing...

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
It's the reclining thing for me, too, for a different reason.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
The tray table.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
It doesn't move forward.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
For me, the tray table never comes close enough to me.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
They ask you to make a choice.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I mean, where's my...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I have to reach all the way over there for my food?

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, no wonder you're so thin.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
No, no, you're making...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, exactly.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Food's always all over me.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I have to eat it.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Just to stay clean.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I'm like, I can't.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I'm like...

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
I can't.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And then I get fat.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
It's...

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I don't know if you know how hard it can be to be fat.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I don't, I'm sorry.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
Colin, Dan was born six foot two and fat.

21:41.000 --> 21:50.000
They ask you to make a choice on that airline between sleep mode and just sitting up and hanging out.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, and electric chair.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Like upright.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
But what you can't do is a setting that is, you know, it's just like, I'm sleepy, but I'm playing Minecraft.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.000
And I'm going to nod off while I'm digging for some minerals.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
And I'm going to wake up and go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
And then I'm like, oh, well placed torches, I'm fine.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
And then the guy next to me is going to be like, what's he doing?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
He's like a child.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Like, yeah, why don't you watch Avatar a third time?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Just because I win an Oscar doesn't make it for throwing us.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
How long was that flight? Were you flying from Dubai?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
No, I don't mean, he watched it third time on the flight.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, I'm flying.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm Amelia Earhart.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I only fly.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
All right.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Anyways, welcome, Colin.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I'm sorry about the way you were brought out.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
I'm sorry about the way you've been treated since.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Do you like the stool?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Is it like, are you doing a bit by using it?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
No, it made it a lot less awkward.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
I think Spencer deserves a little Boy Scout badge for that.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Oh, you guys haven't met?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
How's it going?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Spencer wasn't the only one that thought about that.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Because that's something that's like, oh, it's progress.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Just put it out of your mind.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Don't think about anything.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Don't think about it of a person that's a guest of yours

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
that might have a need or something.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Spencer thinks about it.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I mean, I didn't think about it.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
We had Steve Silberman on.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
And he's, I mean, he might not be offended by me saying he's a bit rotund.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
And he had a lot of trouble getting on.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And so I was like, I don't know, man.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
These are crazy stools.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
And also, these stools are built for one butt cheek.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
If you're a larger person, we needed a little more

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
comodious accommodation.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
All right.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Let's start our little person questions with the big one.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
The big one.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
Who are you voting for?

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
I want to talk about the phrase little people.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You already gave me a hint.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Well, as we talked about a little bit,

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
that it changed in the past 30 years from Mijit to Dwarf to little person.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
And it's like going in a direction of trying to say,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
like, hey, people that are shorter are still people.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
But I think when you say someone is a little person,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
it's different than saying someone has dwarfism or something, you know?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Right.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
That a person with it, yeah.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, because it's like you're making that their identity.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
You know, you're saying like that person is a dwarf.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
Like that is all encompassing of his personality or her personality

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
or that kind of thing and like how they define themselves as.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
I always play ball with this stuff because, well, I mean, it's honestly,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I'm just a chicken shit socially.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
So I would never like, I would never deliberately,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I say shit all the time, it makes people upset.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And it's never like because I'm like, oh, I hope people get really upset.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
No.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It's just because I'm like, oh, the only chance I have of making people

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
like me is to like talk.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
That's it.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
And I know it's like, it's like, it's like if you were Indiana Jones

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
and you just like, you see the poison dart shooters and you're just,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and it's like a mile and you're just like, fuck it.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Like I'm not going to, like I'll get hit with a couple

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
and then like I'll try to find an antidote.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Maybe or I just like, maybe, maybe there's a, maybe just keep running

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
and it's just like the darts are hitting everybody.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
And then I get to the front and there's the idol and I have a bag of sand.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I'm like, I'm not going to weigh it now.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I got fucking darts all over me.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
The darts aren't supposed to come out until, shut up.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
What did you, what did you design this place?

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
Why didn't you turn it off so I could get the idol?

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The, please rent Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I could say, that's a great film.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
God damn it, the, so when I, I don't remember where I was

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
or what year it was when the little person thing got floated.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
It was like, and I was like, okay, but it was the same,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
it was like the phrase African American I've always said is like,

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
it really rubs me, like it's not my job to be rubbed the right way

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
or the wrong way, that's the thing.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And then I just go like, okay, if that's what we're saying,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
but I think that's fucking weird because you're saying that you're,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
in that case, it's like the thing that I think is weird about it is that,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
and I know that what they're doing is they're adding syllables

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
and I do understand the, because it's like,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
it's about dehumanization, like any phrase that you can use

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
to like make someone sound like not a someone.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah, if you say someone has, who has autism, you say,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
yeah, he's an autistic, like that sounds right.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
All of a sudden it's offensive.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah, then I sound like an asshole.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, but if you say he is autistic, it's like, it's a little,

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
especially, do you think that, is there something new on the horizon

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
that might like, that, that term will evolve?

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
I've been workshopping a couple that I'd like to run by you,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
and can I tell them that I got the all clear?

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
No, that's a terrible desk piece that would be.

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
Um, but I don't, I don't, I mean, for me, like,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
I think in my ideal world, it would be if someone was describing

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
how I looked and like, to someone, it would be he has dwarfism,

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
or he has achondroplasia, but achondroplasia is a five-syllable word,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
and we don't like saying more than three usually,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
so, you know, that's, that's not very likely.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Um, yeah, I mean, you definitely need,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
but what someone says, like, little prison,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
is that, is that something that kind of like, like, automatically?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
No, it doesn't offend me at all, it's just, I don't,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
it's just not how I, it's like, it doesn't enter my conscience.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
It's like that painting of a ship in your bathroom,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
that every time you pee, you're like,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
wow, one of these days.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah. It's not ruining the house, but why,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I'm not even into ships.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Who bought this?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just like, like I was saying before,

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
it's not like a, it's not that much of a prevalent part of my identity,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
where, you know, it's, it's like, not something I go out into the world thinking

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
until it's the terms used, and I'm like, oh, right, yeah.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
And, um, but, I mean, that being said, I don't mean to,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I mean, because other people love the term little person,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
that have dwarfism, other people are like, yes,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
because it means it's the whole organization,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
little people of American, they do, you know, amazing things,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
they have scholarships, they, because it's like,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
when a baby has a disability, sometimes their parents will give it up for adoption,

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
and they like, do an adoption coordination for people with dwarfism,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
that kind of thing. So, by saying, I'm not a fan of that,

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
it's just me saying that like, as someone who was in middle school,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
when the term was changed from dwarf to little person,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
and I was just kind of supposed to be like, okay.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Right.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
That's what I am now.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Right out to the playground with all these Winston Churchill's,

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
these fucking, these professional diplomats in the making,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
they're real good at handling this kind of thing.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, I mean, it's just I didn't get a choice in like how,

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
it's just like that's what I am now.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Did you go to like a public school or private school?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah, I was in a public middle school.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
I was actually also the only white kid in my middle school, so that was,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
that was kind of like a huge thing.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
You fucking, you doubled down.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
And I was the only guy with long curly hair,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
played the violin and loved Pokemon and had Pokemon t-shirts.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
So I was just like, yeah.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Making front of you was like a fucking.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
They could have just picked violin.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
That would have been enough.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
There was like a plethora of things.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
You should have also just put a fake unicorn horn.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
I just fucked up like 6,000 black kids.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Like who just would go out into the world and go,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
I swear though, I swear.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I'm not racist.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
And I'm also, I'm not, I don't believe in magic, but God damn it.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I guess that's not a joke.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
You can even propose in the post internet era.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
I was like, I was probably one of,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
people think I'm exaggerating when I say this,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
but I have photos of my eighth grade graduation,

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
like where it's like comically and delightfully evident.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
I was like one of like, I would say in a 2,000 kid junior high,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
I was probably, I think like one of 20 white kids.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
There was a thing in Milwaukee,

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
which is like NPR just talked about being one of the most segregated cities in the country.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
There's just this effort to like,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
try to desegregate in both directions.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So they had a computer specialty program.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
They had two Apple IIEs in the basement of an inner city middle school,

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
so that I would come in and learn to program in basic,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
in the basement of this place.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
And this very naive, but well-intended attempt to like,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
something's wrong and we got to take a proactive step.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
But what I noticed from that experience is that, as I've said before,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
black people are not racist, white people are,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
because I then went to a high school where it was flipped and it was like,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
we were fucking horrible.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And I was like, I never got beat up for being white.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
I never got, I never got, like, there was never any jokes.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
There was never any dehumanization at all.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
It was never, nobody like made me, nobody like wanted to party with me.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
Like, I was a nerd, but I was, I did not, I was not like,

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
I did not feel fucking inhibited or anything like that.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
This was a fucking...

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Where was your school gone?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
What part of the country?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
It was in Southern Maryland, like near D.C. area.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Was it, was it like, was it rough?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Was it fun for you or bad?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
It wasn't fun.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
I mean, the, you know, the aforementioned Pokemon and violin kind of,

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
I saw to that, but it was, I mean, like,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
when you're saying you didn't get bullied for being white,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
bullied for being white, like, I never got really bullied,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
but I did get, like, kids would accuse me of, like,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
getting favoritism or something.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Right.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
Because, you know, like, the teacher was white and I was white,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
and then there was, you know, like, I would do my work sometimes,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
and then, like, other kids would do their work too,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
but then, like, they, I don't know, it was,

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
but, I mean, that's not, I realize that sounds like the most elitist thing to say,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
like, I was accused of favoritism for being white.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
No, I mean, that's...

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
Do you think it actually could have been maybe some even tiny way white privilege

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
or no?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Like, that was just...

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I mean, if the teacher was white for sure...

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
I didn't know enough about it and my memories of that time are...

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Because that would be amazing if that's how strong white privilege runs.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I mean, it may well be, I don't know.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
It does, it does.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
White people are fucking racist.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
That's what we're good at.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Like, we're really good at it.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
We're naturally, we have a gift for racism.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
I know, it's like, like, I don't, I make that joke all the time,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
but it's like, I don't think it's genetic,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
but I think it's fucking really, really strong, the momentum,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
because I have been in...

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
I've observed these situations in a pre-internet world,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
so now there's a whole new generation,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
but at this moment, there's...

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
You know that this shit, that toxic, like, still has tendrils,

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
even though we're now all talking to each other and sharing stories

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
and everything's very verbose,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
but like, in my growing up,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
I saw every kind of configuration you could see,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
and I remember noticing, I was like,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
that guy is being really mean to that guy.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Like, this person has all the power and their...

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
And the reverse of it, like, I had in that school,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I mentioned, like, all of my teachers were black,

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
and I felt the reverse, like, thing,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
and I was like, good, like, I deserve it.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I was like that self-loathing already as a kid,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I was just like, I get it, man.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I'm surrounded by kids who are...

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
There's fucking like, this shitty, like, they're 12 years old

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
and they're writing, like, with Magic Marker,

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
like, they're being indoctrinated.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
We all were into, like, gang culture,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
like, I knew how to beat box by 11 years old

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
and I knew how to, like, write the right gang signs and stuff,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and it was like, if you're a teacher

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
and you've bothered to, like, dedicate your life

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
to, like, molding minds and you see that happening

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
on the way out the door of your school,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
you're gonna get mad and you're only human, too.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
So when the white kid raises his hand for every question,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
you're gonna start treating him like a piece of shit.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
And I was like, and being like, why don't you fucking cool it, nerd?

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Like, hit the showers,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
like, see if I can work some magic here.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And I was like, yeah, I get it, I get it,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I've seen enough movies about this shit.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
No, I just wouldn't raise my hand.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
I just, like, I just...

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Also, I didn't like putting attention on myself to begin with

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
because, I mean, when I'd like,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
some from about six through, I'd say, probably 14

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
when I started going to high school,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
you know, it was, like, and I didn't realize this

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
because as a kid, you're just kind of focused on yourself,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
but, I mean, everyone gets bullied and that kind of thing,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
but for me, it seemed like disproportionate.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Right.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
You know, because, like...

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
That's no pun intended.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Oh!

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
What?

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
If you guys can't handle that, I...

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
You're gonna hate what he's about to say.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
The bullying was disproportionate.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
No, but you said yourself, you said, like,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
you always felt like there was favoritism,

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
but accusations or suspicions of favoritism,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
and you said you didn't actually get bullied,

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
so, like...

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Well, I mean, like, I was bullying, like,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
not for being white, just, like, for being short.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Right.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I was, you know, because, I mean, I look different,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
people don't like difference when...

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
There had to be jokes behind your back

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
and behind your back never works.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, no.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
But, I mean, they weren't clever.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
No.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
They were just, like, pointing out,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
like, like, literally just, like,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
you're short and it's like, yeah.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Or, you know, like, it's like, your head's large, yeah.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
My brain is bigger than yours.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
If your brain was my size,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
you wouldn't be saying that bullshit.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Now, so then that takes us to your choice

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
to become an actor.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
It's stellar.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Hitch your wagon to the star that...

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
No, but it's like...

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
The one career that's based on my looks, yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Do you think, like, how much of it is, like,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
just a passion for acting and how much of it is, like,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
man, first of all, I got calluses

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
all over that part of my brain, you know,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
like, I can take a punch, like...

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Yeah.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Or, like...

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I mean, part of it's me...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I mean, I'm sure, ever since I was a kid,

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
I've always, like, whenever people said,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
you can't do something, I've always wanted to say,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
you know, well, fuck you, I'm going to.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Like, because, I mean, doctors still don't know a lot

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
about dwarfism, because it's a relatively recent thing,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
and it's...

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I just looked up the figure while I was backstage,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
and there's, like, maybe even less than what I'd estimate.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
There's, like, 35,000 people in the U.S.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Oh, okay.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
I love that you're the one Googling,

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
and then I just bring you out and go,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
hey, how does it feel to be small?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Google it, motherfucker!

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Wait, Khan...

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
There's less than 35,000 people with dwarfism

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
in the U.S.?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Yeah, I think that was...

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Yeah, you said 100,000...

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Yeah, that was a very much...

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
I mean, even that, 100,000 seems very low.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just not that problem of a thing.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
It's just not that...

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Because it's one in every around 40,000 births.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Really?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Is there any, like, looking back through history of,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
like, has it been the same throughout history?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Has it gone up and down, or do we even know that?

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Well, I mean, historically,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I mean, people were...

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Babies were kind of killed a lot

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
when they had differences that were kind of like that.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And also, record keeping wasn't...

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, that would be...

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
But actually, like, in some cultures,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
like, I'm gonna be wrong,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
so I'm not even gonna attempt to say which one it was.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
But there's, like, paintings and stuff

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
where you see people with dwarfism

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
in very highly respected positions, like, you know,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
because, like you're saying, with the whole brain thing,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
like, they were thought to be more intelligent

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and that kind of thing in some cultures.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Like, Spartan stuff, they would kill them.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah, people that were left-handed were killed, too.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Yeah.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
It didn't take a whole lot.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah, why?

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
They're just like, look, like, are we a society

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
or are we an emotion workshop?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Or do we love freckles?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
This guy uses...

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
This guy needs special scissors, I say.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Cheaper to feed the dogs.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
I mean, well, that's a really fascinating thing

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
about humanity, too, is that we live in this, like,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
first-world empire where we, I think,

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
among the many assumptions that we don't know we're making

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
is that morality, like, particularly interhuman morality,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
it's not, like, genetic.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's not born into you.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
That doesn't make it not valuable.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Like, we have this, like, misconception.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
It's like, the really uncomfortable truth

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
is that human beings are designed to survive

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
wherever you might happen to drop them.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
And that is...

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
So if you are living in a society that is hateful,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
you will not use the word hateful

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
to describe the thing that's hateful.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
You'll use the word normal to describe the word hateful.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
If you're a Spartan, for example,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
the example I always use, because they had this, like,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
really historically documented, incredibly specific society

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
where you got killed, apparently, for being left-handed,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
it's like, the kids growing up in that world,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
they weren't, like, man, this is fucked up.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I'm sure some of them were, and then they got killed

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
because that's worse than being left-handed.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
But they weren't, like, people didn't go to bed

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
and, like, sweat and, like, have acid reflux

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
and go to a therapist and go, I can't figure it out.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And they're like, well, you're a Spartan

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
and you're supposed to be living in Wisconsin in 2016

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
where everything's very enlightened.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Oh, thanks, Doc. I'll move there right away.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
The therapist was a Spartan and said,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
you should have your head cut off.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
And my job shouldn't exist, because this is Sparta.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
And we need to acknowledge that,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
not because we need to hate ourselves more,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
we need to be proud of the fact that we're able to adapt to anything,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
but we need to, I think we need to, like,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
the illusion that we have some inborn sense of right and wrong

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
is dangerous as the other thing that is,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
it's this illusion that if you say the right combination of words,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
you can make everything better.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
And that whoever smelt a Delta rule,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
because now, and then we're talking,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
I'm a writer and a producer talking to an actor.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
And so, like, you were just telling me in the green room,

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
like, you were, like, obviously any,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
you said you just went out for your first part

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
that was, like, that had nothing to do with your stature.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Well, not my first, but, like, it's been,

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
and part of that's due to my agent being one of,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
you know, she's cool with sending me out for anything

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
that, you know, young 20s-ish.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
The casting director.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Or your agent.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
My agent is.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
But I've been getting called in a few more times recently

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
for stuff that's not exclusively for a little person

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
or that kind of thing.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
And...

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
When you see a breakdown, like as an actor,

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
it'll say all ethnicities, all shapes and sizes,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and they don't really mean that.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
No, they don't mean that.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
They don't fucking mean that.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Because the writer wrote it and said,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
she's tall, she's nerdy, hot.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Right.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You know, and hot doesn't know it.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Submit all ethnicities.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Like, you said Blonde five times in that description.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Right.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Like, I mean, they're saying that the corporation

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
has to say that.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
And I think they're, I was about to ask the same question

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
that Daniel's asked you.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Are you seeing any opening up of that gate

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
to them actually meaning such things when they say that?

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
Well, I think they're, the fact that I'm even getting

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
in the room now is, speaks to something,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
because, you know, with the age of technology and stuff,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
you can look at someone's entire thing

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
without ever meeting them.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Right.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
And, you know, I don't pretend to know what goes on

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
in casting offices.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I've never been in, like, on that side.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
But I feel like, you know, once you look at someone's

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
real and you're like, all right, they're very clearly

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
not what we're looking for.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
It helps you narrow down.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
But hopefully, yeah.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Now they can come down to essentially what the character

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
needs to be as opposed to what they thought the silhouette

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
of that person needed to be.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
And I feel like as more young, well, not young writers,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
but like writers that are more open-minded

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
and that kind of thing become in positions of power

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
where they can, you know, like create shows

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
and that kind of thing.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
By the way, it'll have to be young writers,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
because ironically, if you're over 50,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
you're not allowed to be a writer.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Not on a staff.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Like, I've run up against that where it's like,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
well, there was a lawsuit, a class action lawsuit,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
about ageism and writing rooms.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I just thought it was, I just wanted to dip that in,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
because the layers of irony are that like...

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
I didn't know that.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It will be a young writer.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
It won't be an old writer.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Because when old writers are sitting at home going,

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
fuck the society, they fucking tell me,

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
like, yeah, I know why you didn't hire me.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
It will start with writers, and I know this firsthand.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
And it's also, like, important for me to say,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
this is a 180-degree point of view.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
180-degree from when I was your age.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
When I was your age, I was unemployed.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I wanted to be the best writer in the world.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I wanted to save the universe with my words.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And I was also, without realizing it,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
I was just, like, the voice of, like, you know,

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
holding things back.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Because I would get my Writers Guild magazine,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
which was being printed with the money that I didn't have.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
And it was like, I broke my tooth last month,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
but because I didn't do a rewrite on a Beetlejuice cartoon

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
this month, I can't get it fixed.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
And the money's going to, like, this glossy magazine,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
and every month, you know, I open my mailbox

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
and there's always some smiling, ugly face looking at me

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
that's a successful writer.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
There's this peanut-headed fucking, oh, that's just sweet.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Okay.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
If I could, well, what'd he do that's so great?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Oh, I traded, Buffy.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Okay.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
What else, though?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
All right, everything.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
All right, fine, fine.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Then I won't read your magazine.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
What?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
We're called writers.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Why are you making us read shit?

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
But when I would look through that, man.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Writers hate reading.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
One of the bookmarks I have in my head

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
of the 180-degree Harmon politically as a writer

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
is literally throwing one of those WGA magazines

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
across the room because I had just looked at this

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
sidebar item that was called a report card

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
about diversity in writer's rooms or something like that.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
And I saw the words and I didn't even see the content.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
I just threw it.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
And I was doing it.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
People think that the white people that are doing that

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
are doing it because they're racist.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
They're doing it because they're,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
to derive from privilege, it's a combination of that

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and fucking like underdog syndrome.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Everybody's an underdog.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
So I was like, I'm the best writer in this fucking city.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
And the union that represents me is spending money

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
and attention on competition between who can hire

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
more people that have different shaped hats

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
than who is the best writer.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
And when I would say that, I would imagine a chorus

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
of super-talented black writers behind me going,

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
fucking go, man, because I don't want any fucking handouts

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
and I want to be known for my writing, too.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
I was deluded, the difference is I had to become a showrunner.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I had to be in charge of hiring.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I had to have a stack of scripts on my desk

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
and be like, oh, oh, Harvard, Yale, Harvard, Yale, Harvard,

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
Yale, and be like, oh, there's a systemic thing

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
and this cycle needs to be broken at any point along the chain,

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
blah, blah, blah.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
So the new thing now, the bleeding edge of this is like,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
ugh, it's like, I just finished a script with Chris McKenna

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
who effectively ran community five and six with me

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
and was like, the reason why community is good.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
We, because we're old white men who are in the twilight

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
of our efficacy and we want to write another good one

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
and do everything right from square one,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
we're writing this script together

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
and we're having all these conversations going,

46:03.000 --> 46:09.000
how do you, okay, is it possible to write a gender neutral character?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
So far, it turns out the answer is no.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
It's possible to write a transgender character.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
It's possible to like leave it up to the casting director

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
without the script reading like toothpick instructions.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
Like pronouns are fucking endemic to move in the action.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
Like there's a way I all try to get more talented

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
but like ultimately what I ended up doing is going,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
this character, when introducing the character,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
this character can be any gender,

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
we're gonna call him a he to fucking get the script finished.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
But it's a gender neutral character.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
What's important is their age.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Sometimes what's important is their age.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
It's important that they're in their 20s

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
because of the dynamic that they'll have with the person in their 40s,

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
depending on the situation.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
We talked the entire time,

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
I have a point to all of this,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
we talked the entire time,

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
these like noble minded fucking like middle aged white writers,

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
we're going like, how do you accomplish this, what do you do?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
The thing that we kept saying,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
having this like weird debate about was like,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
okay there's this buffoon in the script.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
It's the Michael Scott figure.

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
He's the guy that you love to feel bad for or slash hate,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
he's got the foot in his mouth.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
We would have endless conversations.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
It's like, we know that can be a woman

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
if the actor is the right actor.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Ultimately though, as a comedian,

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
as a comedic writer who worships at this altar that is so much higher,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
is there a craft that you're betraying,

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
even by 5% in the interest of like progress or anything,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
should that buffoon,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
is it an extra 5% funnier if he's a straight white male,

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
does it go down 5% for the sake of progress

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
if your buffoon for instance is a woman

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
and the answer, we very happily never came up with an answer,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
so we just were like,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
okay let's just keep thinking of this guy we work with

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and using him as like in our heads

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
and like let's just make sure when we get,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
if we start to get a pickup,

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
we got to fight this battle in casting.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
We got to say, get Kristen Wiig in here

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
and see if she can like do this like Michael Scott character.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Yeah, you wish, asshole.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
No, I make no eye contact and said you wish asshole to myself,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
you thought there was an asshole.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
So here's the last part of my story

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
that's a cautionary tale for the future,

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
because it's up to writers and it's fucking like,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I was on the phone because we turned in the script

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and they're like, this is awesome,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
let's get on the phone and talk about what actors to give this to

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
and I'm like holy shit, this has never happened.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
Like oh my god, I can't believe we're talking about this guy

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
and this guy, and this guy, and this guy,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and this white guy, and this white guy,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and this white guy, and this white guy,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
and I didn't even, it was like 40 minutes into the conference call

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
and I was like looking at headshots and I was like,

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
this is a blizzard of talent, a very talented blizzard.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
I am my cup runneth over with Rudds and...

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
And then I had to like,

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
I'm not telling this story because I'm any kind of hero in it,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I'm telling this story as a,

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
because I was so, I forgot,

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
I fucking forgot until halfway through the conversation

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
and then I was like, oh yeah, yeah, wait, wait.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
And then I was like, you guys know, right,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
have we ever had this conversation?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Like is this something that's unspoken?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Casting directors have to run their thing like a target,

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
they have to know where the big shirts are

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
and the small shirts and the dark shirts

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
and the checkered shirts.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
They have to, if they don't know that they're,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
part of their job as a casting director,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
not the whole job, they're doing it wrong.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
They have to be like a wholesaler of corporeal humanity.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Oh, you want a little person?

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
I got, I know a fucking great actor who's a little person.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
You want the word little person to change?

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It's out of my jurisdiction.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
But the other, and the other part of their job

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
is curating talent and going like,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
no, I'm not going to send you a little person

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
who's also a hack and all this shit,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
and also hopefully going like, look,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
you said this character can be anything.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
I'm sending you the most,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
the best actors I have, my favorites,

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
that's what good casting directors do.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
They already do that.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
It starts, the important thing,

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
it starts with the writer as much as,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
the writer has to be like, if you're in TV,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
they have to be like,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
you're going to think of like fucking white people

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
from your neighborhood if you don't,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
if you don't like switch.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
If I'm interrupting you, do you want to keep going?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
You're interrupting me and you're a hero for it.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
The blue wire, the blue wire.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
But like, for instance, the Obed character,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
you knew a guy named Obed.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Our friend, the real Obed, who is,

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
is he Iraqi, Iranian?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
What is Obed?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
He's Arabic.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Half Arabic, half Swedish or something.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
And he is, you know, on some part of the spectrum

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
and whatever, and you wrote this interesting character

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
and you said, I'm basing it on this person.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I felt like it was important, the regionality.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
But Danny Pooty came in, who's Indian,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
half Indian, half Polish.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
But then, that's possibly a step in a direction.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
I said like, because your circle of friends

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
stopped being white dudes from Milwaukee

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
and then white dudes from Los Angeles, whatever,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
you started to have a bigger group of friends,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
you meet Colin, you meet more women,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
you meet people that like, you can start writing as a writer

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
and say, I'm writing this around an actual person

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
that you should meet.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
And then, not that it needs to even be that person

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
at the end of the day when they cast it

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
and when they make the show,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
you start like focusing in like on, say like,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
the reason why we're doing this is not randomly

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
trying to be diverse.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
We're writing this because I hung out at a bar with Colin

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
and the character doesn't have to be,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I have dwarfism.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I just think it's way funnier, like,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
because I've met him when I talked to him

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
and there's an essential quality here.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Well, this is a lazy answer, but it's like,

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
if what you're doing is really specific,

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
as in that example, then go with God

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
and use that technique.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
I wrote this for my small friend Colin,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I had a conversation with him and I have this vision

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
of this character, even though there's no mention

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
of it in the script, like, it's important and blah, blah, blah.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Definitely, go ahead, do that.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I'm talking about the other side of it,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
is when you don't have those specific thoughts

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
and you are picturing either yourself

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
or Steve Carell,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
you aren't doing anything wrong,

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
you're just not doing a thing

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
that if writers don't do it,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
like, especially writer-producers,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
you're doing what's very comfortable for you,

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
you're trying to get the script sold,

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
you're trying to get it made.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
You should think of Steve Carell while you write it,

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
but you should ask yourself,

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
you should go through your script and go,

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
how many of these jokes are based on him,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
like, oh, here it is,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
like, they need an extra bounce card,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
but then the complexion of his face,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
like, reflects the sun.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Like, there is nothing, there's no bits like that,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
it doesn't matter what, it doesn't,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
but you should picture Steve Carell

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
because you're picturing this funny person

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
or the person with all these quirks,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
but then you have to say,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
like, to the casting director

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
and the network and the studio,

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
you have to go, like, we gotta put,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
we gotta exercise a muscle that's, like,

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
not atrophied, whatever the word is,

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
when it's not even used.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
We have to start doing crunches with this muscle

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
where we make sure that it's like

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
a cattle call and all the cows,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
like, are coming in.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
How often, like, how many times,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
or percentage-wise, when you go in for casting,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
is it specific to who you are

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
and what you look like,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
or how often is it not?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Like, do you feel like it's honestly,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
like, they're open for seeing you,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
like, because they're really, you know...

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
It's, like, probably 70%,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
it's usually because of my size,

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
30-ish recently.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm surprised it's actually 70-30,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
like, I would have thought worse than that, but that's...

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Yeah, I mean, like,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I mean, my type's not called for that much,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
so, I mean, it's not, like...

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
It would be skewed if, like,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
that type was called for a lot more.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Do you feel some sort of, like, movement in that direction?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Like, do you feel like it's, like,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
sort of shifting into a more even?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Yeah, I think it's for everyone.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I mean, honestly, like, you know,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
for people with different ethnicities,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
for different genders, for, you know,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
different, like, gender identities,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
an actor up here that was black and had dwarfism,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
what would he be like?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
You fucking think you have it bad?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I mean, yeah, probably, honestly.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I've never, that whole mediocre superpowers,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
the question we're always asking ourselves,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
man, if I could conjure a...

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And we were talking about this a little bit before,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I don't know if you remember, but, like,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
how a friend of mine once told me

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
that I am both privileged and not privileged

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
at the same time,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
which, to be fair, like,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
when I'm walking around the streets in New York,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
cops, like, smile.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
They nod and, like,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
they sometimes say hi,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
and...

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
What about Chicago?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I've never been to Chicago.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I've never not wanted

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
a little person

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
black person

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
to be around me, but I've never wanted it

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
more than right now, because I'm so fat,

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I want to know, like, if he would say,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
like, oh, yeah, cops, like,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I have no idea, like...

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I wouldn't know, and I'm not about to speculate.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Yeah.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I mean, it's just because I'm not in a position

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
to say, because, I mean, I would never, you know,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
like... Because it could go either way.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
The cops are smiling at you, because they're just, like,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
God, finally a stress-free encounter

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
just for...

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
It's like, they don't think I'm capable

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
or would do anything.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Until the first day, you know, ISIS will,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
you know, a little terrorist will...

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I think...

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I think I remember seeing a storyline...

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Is it ISIS that you're offended for?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I always...

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Sometimes I just want to check in with you guys.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I mean,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I would be offended if ISIS was trying to

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
capitalize on, like,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
being an undiversity.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Like, they thought that was going to make them

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
more likable.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
And that ISIS, eventually, would have more

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
diversity than paramount.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Oh, that would be...

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Oh, my God, look at this! Did you guys see

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
who crashed that bus into that fucking school?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I mean, there was, like, little people...

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
There was a transgender...

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Like, what...

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
And it covered...

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I mean, if ISIS's only goal was

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
to win...

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
To blow our minds...

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Fucking hit us where not our wallets, because,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
you know, we'll bail out corporations

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
if they go bankrupt.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
You can destroy as much shit as you want,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
but hit us where we're fucking thinking

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
we're actually proud of ourselves.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Like, have a bunch of beautiful

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
post-feminist naked women, like,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
just blow some shit up, and be like,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
yeah, I accept my sexuality,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I have agency, and I

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
love ISIS.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
This is my friend, the

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
African-American... Sorry, what?

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
African-Syrian

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
little

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
person. He fucking

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
loves ISIS, too.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Colin, for me, I'm going to answer the question

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
I'm going to ask you first, because if

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I've never... I've always wanted to be,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
as an actor, I want to be in a western,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I want to be on a horse, I want to be running

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
like, riding fast on a horse, and shooting a

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Remington, and I want to be, like, in a western.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I love westerns. If you could be any role,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
like, do you have, like,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
any character or style or genre

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
that you'd like to be in?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Honestly, I think that

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
what would make

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
the strongest...

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I mean, like, what I would want to do is probably,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
like, not something that just

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
unroll it, honestly, just

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
demonstrates an aspect of my humanity.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
No, I mean, like...

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
It could be anything in the world, yeah.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It's probably something comedic, but, like,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
you know, in the way

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
that kind of broad cities

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
doing it, where it's turning

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
the, you know, how men treat women

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
on its head, and that kind of thing.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
And it's pointing out how stupid

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
the comments that men make towards women

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
are, and by, like,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
and there's this,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
you know, the

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Cyrano de Bergeric,

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
how he's... how someone calls him

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
big nose, and then he comes up with all these

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
more clever things that they should say.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And it would ideally be something like that,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
where it's, like, turning

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
and one of my friends, actually,

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
like, because he's going through something similar,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
because he was, like,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
he's trying to succeed as an actor, and he's black,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
and he makes

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
height jokes towards me, and I make black jokes towards him.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
And...

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
We have to get DeMorge out here.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Dan just had a partial orgasm

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
here.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
It's dehumanization palooza.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Yeah.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
This DeMorge's favorite thing

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
will be brought out as a representative

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
of his race.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
He loves that.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I mean, like, I mean, he'll make...

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I mean, like, we can with, you know,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
some jokes that, like, other people can make,

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
and if it's okay, I'd like to, you know, share

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
with, you know, like, if someone,

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
like he was saying, if someone could say,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
grow up.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
that one went over your head, and that kind of thing.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
But

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
it's just, like, more

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
clever trends of phrases like that, that

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
are just not used,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
because it's just easy to make the obvious jokes

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
and that kind of thing. But you can talk shit with your friends,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
and, like, so, like, if you and I

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
were closer friends, like, we could,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
you could, like, diss me on

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
what, like, anything, any flaw

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
in my personality or anything I did

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
that night. It's like, it's fun to fire

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
off at each other, because there's

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
equality in

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
fun, joking, you know,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
trash talk. It's great.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah, well, once you're familiar,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
once you get bored with shit, that's

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
what progress is, basically.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It's like, speaking of getting bored with shit,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
let's bring out DeMorge Brown!

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Oh!

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Hey!

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Congratulations.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Hello.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Please cap those green

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
hands.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Shake all the hands.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, I know. That was a classy move.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Like, DeMorge is the...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
No one shakes Spencer's hand.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I shake everybody's hand as they enter.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Except for yours. You just walk right on.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I want to be one of those guys that when he comes up,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I, like, shake the hands of the front row.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Like a...

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I think maybe Bon Jovi did that? I don't know.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I'm a cowboy.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Hi, how are you?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I'm a steel horse. I ride... Hey, Toby

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
from Michigan.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I'm wanted!

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Wanted!

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Stephanie.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Dead or alive.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
That's a great showbiz trick, though.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And politicians use it all the time, and it's taken

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
by the way, is the fake pointing

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
to people that you see in the crowd.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You're at Madison Square Garden, and there's

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
9,000 spotlights on you. You can't see

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
shit.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Because Springsteen is always like,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
oh, show you!

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
She's giving you that.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And there's eight guys named Tony up on the fucking

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
mezzanine, and they're like, oh, you fucking look

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
like that.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I never really thought that that was fake.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Because...

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Because when I...

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I can't see anything.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
When I see people do that, I always think,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
that's unprofessional.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's just too personal.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But I just realized, yeah, because

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I'm thinking that out of some like,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
you know, I'm not going to diagnose myself,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
but there may be something wrong.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Dan, just do a half walk up on stage.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
At this point, you can only see

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
what the first five wrote.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I see Dave Kline.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Dave Kline's within that lighting.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Dave Kline has his own light.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Artisanal lights.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Dave Kline is lit by his mother's

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
caesarean.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
There's light pouring out of the

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
sacrifice she didn't make.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
No!

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Ha, ha, ha!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I think Dave Kline just

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
beams that his beard emanates its own

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
sort of...

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
He's like one of those plates at your

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
grandma's house that has Jesus on it.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It's just like, he's lit by

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
the anxiety you have

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
for being an atheist

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and 11 years old.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
How are you doing DeMarche?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
What's new in the

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
DeMarche Brown world?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's February.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I've spent a year working on other people's

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
projects, so I'm sort of gearing up to start

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
making more of those weird shorts.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I make a lot of weird, absurdist shorts

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
under the name Black Empowerment Network.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
So it's time to make more of those.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And I think probably in February I'll shoot

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
like three of them, I think.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
There's probably cinematic photos of you

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
looking like you're on some sort of 35mm

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
set somewhere, but it's just...

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's just me working on other people's stuff.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Psychotic park ranger.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Oh shit, is he in the Revenant?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's a beautiful shot!

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Have we ever mentioned Gumball on this show?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Like on the podcast?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Not to me at least.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
If you don't know it, is it all Channel 101?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Yeah, it's all Channel 101.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
For those of you who do not know, hear

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
or are listening, go watch all of

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Gumball and watch how good Dimar just...

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Well, that's it.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It's a short series that was done

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I think it was 11 episodes,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
although the last one is 25 minutes

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
longer or something.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But that was Kyle Ryder

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
and also Matt Freund.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And the three of us together

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
just sort of saying, what could we do

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
that's absolutely insane and

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
involves all of these things.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It starts off as like Bronson meets

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Arsenal meets

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Harold Maud.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It was an excuse for you to wear your Arsenal gear

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
on camera, right?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I would pitch that

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
to Kyle for everyone that we would shoot

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
every month.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Maybe he's got this jacket on.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Sometimes he'd say yes, sometimes he'd say no.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Like folding back on a question

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
to Colin, because it also

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
felt like in that Gumball series

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
that you guys collectively, I always imagined

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
we're talking about that you liked

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
movies like Sexy Beast

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
or like British indie movies

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and that it was beyond

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
that we had grown beyond, let's make a space movie

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
because space movies are silly

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
and we'll make our own space movie

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and it'll be silly. Channel 101

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
had evolved into like, let's actually do

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
what we really, really, really want.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
We like the flavor of this actual

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
quality cinema that's being imported.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Kyle called me one day.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
When Drive came out

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
everybody was going crazy about

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Refn and

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I was like, people haven't seen Valhalla Rising

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
they haven't seen Bronson

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
they haven't seen Pusher

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
but everybody was saying

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
that Drive was like the first movie

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
that he'd made and there were all these

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Drive parodies coming out and Kyle called me

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and he was like, I want to make something

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I want to make it with you

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
but I don't want it to be

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
sort of referencing other things that other people have seen

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I really don't want it to reference anything. We could start at a certain point and go from there.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Have you seen Bronson?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And at that time, I was watching Bronson

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
on YouTube with Swedish subtitles

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
it was in English

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
but I had Swedish subtitles and I was like

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
yeah, idiot, I've seen it.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And he goes, what if we start there

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and then we just started with this thing where I was like

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
what about the idea of a guy

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
who sees Bronson and says that's my fucking life

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
but that guy's life, whereas

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
the actual Charlie Bronson

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
where his actual life is worth a two hour movie

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
what if this guy's life is worth a five minute

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
short

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and he goes, what would you name that guy?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I would have to be something really mundane

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
but also

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
have some pop to it

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
and the next day I just woke up out of the sleep

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
and I said, what was his name? Brian Gumbel

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
he's just a guy who's named Brian Gumbel

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and we started from there

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
so I shaved my head for it and grew a circus

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
strongman mustache

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and then I said, he has to love Arsenal

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and Kyle was like, yeah, whatever man

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Arsenal is an English soccer team everybody

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It is the English soccer team

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
It is the English soccer team

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Is it number one right now or number two?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
No Leicester's on top

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Leicester's on top, mate

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Leicester's on fucking number one

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Toss the table you can't

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
So Colin

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I'm just pretending I don't want to attack you

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Colin, just as an actor then

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
because your first answer was just like

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
oh you let him do that scene from Roxanne

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
where Steve Martin gets all the fucking big nose jokes

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
before the bullies do

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
but is there

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
just as an actor

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
not the action figure

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
but what's the scene

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I'll start

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
because he said

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
you wouldn't want to be a cowboy shooting a thing

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I want to be the Zuckerberg, Howard Hughes

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
the Steve Jobs

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
the guy in the

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
scene that's like

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
look, it's what I'm good at

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I want to be the guy

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that people

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
would love to fucking murder

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and they can't

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
and

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
that lives by his merits

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and that is misunderstood

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I want to do those monologues

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
that are written by Aaron Sorkin types

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
where you're just

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
phrasing exactly

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
like something

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
that is not likable necessarily

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
but is just like the verbal equivalent

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
of the Hulk bending a car

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
in half and shoving it up

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
his own ass and then pulling it out

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
of his mouth the size of a ping pong ball

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and throwing it away

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
which is like in the social

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
network is that moment when Zuckerberg

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
whatever that monologue is when he goes like

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
everyone in this room has one thing

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
everyone in this room that wants to say they invented Facebook

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
has one thing in common

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
they didn't invent Facebook

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
they didn't invent Sarkinny shit

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
so

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
in terms of the tone of the

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
fantasy of

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
just as an actor

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
the kind of monologue

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
what point of view the monologue might come from

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
that you feel like you could nail

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I think something that

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
yeah, I think it would be the

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
lines of Kevin Spacey

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
slash Brian Cranston from

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
House of Cards and Breaking Bad

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
when they just say something

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
where it's just so clear that they're such

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
a dangerous person

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
but they're about to go

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and make the people around them

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
trust them

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
because I mean there's still I think

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
something about... I can see it as being a very good

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
bad guy

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
like a strangely

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
horrifying bad guy in a...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
yeah, but not like in like a willow way

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
bad guys come in all sizes

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
no, no

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I'm just talking about

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
eye contact

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
the best bad guys aren't the ones that look

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
like the most

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
like physically violent

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
they're the ones that have

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
a sublimated

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
like an internal thing

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
well who's the guy in the wire

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
there's so many

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
thugs in the wire

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
that you're terrified of in different ways

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
no, it's the

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
you fall in love with him

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
like he fits in a fucking

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
like ultimately in like a spot

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
in your tackle watch

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I can't remember his name, the guy who wins

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I don't want to spoil the wire, but the guy who's

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
the last man standing

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Marlowe

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
when you meet him

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
he never raises his voice

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I don't think in the entire run of the show

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
he's like... it's

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
fucking terrifying because he's sending people out

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
to kill people

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
but you said

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
you used two examples

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
used Kevin

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Spacey in House of Cards

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and what's his fucking

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Breaking Bad

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Brian Cranston

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
these are both people

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
who need a chance

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
and then they're going to go out and prove

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
well they're going to go

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
you don't just want to kick ass and

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
intimidate

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
bully

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
well I feel like that would be too obviously trying to say

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
hey I can be a badass

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
oh hey look it's 180 degrees

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
look how tough he is

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
you want that monologue moment

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Kevin Spacey

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
in

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
fully James Foley made

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
a mammoth play into a movie

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Glen Gary Glen Ross

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
where he starts off as this guy who really hates

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
that's your path to remembering

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Glen Gary Glen Ross

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
it's like if you said like

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Gary Kurtz produced this little ditty

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Star Wars

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
it was

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
something that was based

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
on a novella

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
something Death Star

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Wicked comes

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
that's my level man

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
you're too fucking educated

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
so for me like

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
when I watched

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Alec Baldwin in Malice

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
when he gives the... do I have a God

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
complex? I am God

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I'm a doctor like that

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
stillness right?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
that's a great bad guy because he's the hero

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
of his own movie and also he's pretending to be a bad guy

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I like that one however

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
so here's Harmon Harris to split

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
in that movie Malice is fucking great

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
really rent Malice and check it out

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and Alec Baldwin and Bill Pullman

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
did I just mix up there last time

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
no it's really great

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
as far as just like popcorn

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
like thriller like twisty thriller

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
the

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
it's the Bill Pullman

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
it's not so much a monologue but it's later

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
the opposite side of the story circle from that

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
where Bill Pullman is talking to Nicole Kidman

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
and she says

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I'm not gonna give any spoilers but she says

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
what do you want that's the cue for his monologue

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
and the end of his monologue is like

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I want half what the fuck

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
do you think I want

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
and but it's like

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
it's because it's the underdog thing

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and I do think like Alec Baldwin

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
was a doctor to begin with

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
so he's like I'm special and he's privileged

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
as I mentioned earlier

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I think like

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
the biggest problem

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
the thing that keeps hatred

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
moving culturally in this country is the fact that

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Donald Trump right now somewhere

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
is tucking his little shitty head

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
into a pillow going like

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
today's chalk one up for the little guy

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and he's like

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
writing a telegram home to his mom going

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
mom I finally got what's

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
what I deserve

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I would fundamentally disagree with that

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I don't think he has that gene in his fucking DNA

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I think you're wrong

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I truly think you're wrong I don't think people behave that way

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I think some people behave that way

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
like there's a

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
but I don't see it in him I think that

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
it's actually more dangerous when

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
like people that have all the power

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
they

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
like I can attest to it it's like

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
everybody that's 50 feels

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
25 and everybody with all the fucking

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
power feels like an underdog

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
they this that is like

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
at the root of every argument you see

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
flare up in every comment section under every

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
unrelated YouTube video

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
it's just like some guy holding a sparkler

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
and the n-word is not far

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
the guy is not black the sparklers

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
not spelling I think it's like

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
the politics like fucking explode

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
underneath this thing and they're like oh these

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
libtards are gonna do this

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
what the fuck is going on guys waving a sparkler

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
in a circle for 15 seconds

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
yeah but Dan that guy was totes gay

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
the reason that the reason that

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
pot keeps stirring is because of this

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
like concept that everybody

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
it's capitalism's greatest success

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
is that you're never

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Spielberg is going to bed somewhere tonight

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
going like man

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
if I could just have creative

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
control

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
for real or he wouldn't do

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
the shit he's been doing

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
you think even after all this time

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
if he was capable of going to bed

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
one night and going like I did it

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
the next thing that would happen

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
would be 60 of the greatest

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
movies shot on a shittiest

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
camcorder in the world they'd be fucking great

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
he's going to bed every night going fucking

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
sony god damn it next time

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
next time I'm gonna get a fiber optic cable

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
to my place in the Hamptons and I'm gonna make the dinosaurs

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
myself

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and I want

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
merchandising, merchandising

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
because then I can funnel that into a special effects budget

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
the line producer's not gonna fuck me this time

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
and his wife is going like sweetie you're a genius

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
that's what everyone says

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
tell that to 20th

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
tell that to fucking 20th

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I want this movie to be made

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
with Colin playing you during this thing

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Colin playing me

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Colin's playing me writing it

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
or Colin's playing Spielberg

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
or he's portraying

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
this monologue

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and Colin can play Spielberg

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'll play your wife I'll just be going like

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
sweetie stop

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
come to bed

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Spencer what monologue

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
what scene, what genre

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
what's your fantasy

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
if you could portray

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
anything

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
yeah I'm a real actor

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
at heart

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
when you watch a film what kind of scenes do you

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I like the guy who like reveals

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
that he's the one like touching

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
all the pieces on the chess board

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
you know he's like you know there's all these

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
people and I was pulling the strings forever

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
you know like one of those

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
monologues where you instantly reveal

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
give us a what's a for instance

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
in film I mean I can't I don't watch

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I've got a good one you've probably never seen

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
the Peter Johnson

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
adapted

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Glen Gary Glen Ross

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
have you seen Glen Gary Glen Ross

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
no

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
there's a there's a everybody gets a monologue

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
in that movie but I feel like he

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
would want the Kevin Spacey one

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
the when he takes Jack

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
will you go to lunch

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
will you go to lunch will you go to

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
lunch

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and then they cut the lemon and lemons just got this like

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
cookie in his hand he's like

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
oh wait no are you talking

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
are we talking about two different moments

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
when Kevin Spacey turns out to be the

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
serious badass because that one just happens

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
to lemon in private and you realize oh this guy's a mother

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
that's what I'm then it gets that because he's

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
saying like he likes to be the guy that you

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
underestimated that turns out to have all the

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
yeah yeah yeah

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
which is a cousin of mine but

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
like second cousin

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
but but the deception removes

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
me and then the Alec Baldwin

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I'm removed from because he already

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
he was a doctor like the

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
the medical association already accepted

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
him

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I want to be a fucking raving

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I want to be John the Baptist

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
fuck it

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
fuck it Jesus Christ

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
no wait he didn't get angry enough John the Baptist

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Jesus got angry

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
in a special

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
what if version of the story where

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
he cuts everyone else's head off

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
you know you'd be a good

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
like if you had to remake the film

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
the Ten Commandments is hilarious because

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
you have every great over actor in one movie

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
but like

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Harmon you'd be good as Pharaoh

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
like a Joe Brenner

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
because you wouldn't be like so let it be

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
so shall it be done you were like

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
fucking do what I told you to do

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
you'd be more

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
you feel like God's giving you notes

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
how many eagle face people do I have to worship

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
to

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
for Locust not to eat my

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
crops

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I think you'd be a good Pharaoh

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
yeah but he was wrong

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
was he? not as far as he was concerned

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
yeah but

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you know

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
how about Mark Anthony

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
like Mark Anthony

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I don't know enough about him

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
he was a big sexy macho guy

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
who fucked Cleopatra I haven't seen Wizard of Oz

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
you haven't seen

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
or Cleopatra

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
or read anything about Cleopatra

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
yeah I haven't seen the classics

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I've seen 13 things on the

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
AFI 100

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
and it's because the AFI needed to

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
round it up to 100

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
so they put like Die Hard

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
in there

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
they're like this is only 73 things

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I've never seen American Graffiti and people get on my

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
ass about that but I just I never get up in the morning

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
you know what today I'm gonna do I'm gonna

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
watch that movie about cars

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
just watch Dazed and Confused and

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
add bleach

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
like to the film

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
process? yeah no to the

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
no to the flavor

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
it's not like every

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
generation makes a movie about everybody's hanging out

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
all night this is what it was like

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
it was called the 10 Commandments

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
the original one

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
was like yeah listen you guys

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I gotta go up to Mount Sinai I just got the

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
draft card

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
come on Moses have it

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Aaron we're gonna worship a calf

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
come on you losers

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I'm gonna smoke reefer with

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Yahweh

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
oh everybody this is Wolfman Jack coming at you

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
ancient Judea

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
those Jews are wandering the desert trying to make their own nation

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
good luck to you out there

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
here's Buddy Holly

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
come on let's go space

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
trucking

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
it's just an all yeah

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
hanging out all night

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
American Graffiti days are confused

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I'm acting like this is a genre

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
there was a thing with Robert

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Wool in it called Hollywood Nights

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
that was in the 80s

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
you also have

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
what's friend dresser in it

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I think it's like her first movie

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I wanna watch that again

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
like Robert Wool

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
who these kids don't even know

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
is Arliss

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
let alone

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Knox from Batman

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
but like Robert Wool

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
as the

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
sexy senior in high school

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
well the 80s you had Footloose

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
that's a hanging out all night movie

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
no no no no

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
you don't get it

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Footloose takes place over weeks

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
and there's caucuses

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
are you saying it has to be one night

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
a 24 hour affair

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
it's like oh we're gonna go

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
super bad is the

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
newest one it's different

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
when it's a comedy and not like

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
indie movie kind of like

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
feel this time and place thing

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I think that directors

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
writers turn 40

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
and then they go man when I was 11

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
and then they write those movies

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and then you're like this is cool

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
because you're 30 and you're like

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
yay and then you

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
go into a back room and there's just

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
heads on the wall

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
living heads

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and the neighbors keep complaining about the smell

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
how are the heads being sustained

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
they're just heads they're not being sustained

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
what they said that they're living

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
heads no I said I meant

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I meant I'm a serial killer

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
to me they're living

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
because you they talk to me

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
they tell me who to kill next

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
everybody the exits are

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
two to the rear it's one

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
no listen the more heads I add

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
to the wall the more of an opinion

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I get the less likely it is

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I'll kill again

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
the less likely Sony gives you

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
notes on your dinosaurs

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
that would be an amazing serial killer

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
gimmick as a guy who's obsessed

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
with like populism

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
egalitarianism or something so he's like

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
the cops can't catch him because

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
he doesn't have a profile like he's only killing

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
white women with red hair he's like trying

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
to gather this like he's trying

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
to gather a sea of opinion

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
because in his mind

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
instead of the dog telling him to kill people

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
which is just has the shelf life because

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
dogs whatever and also you're crazy

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
and you're gonna get caught dogs just keep saying

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
kill the milkman the guy thinks that if

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
he if he puts enough heads on his wall

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
the voice will tell him like

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
like okay now you can stop killing

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and so he keeps killing forever

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
and the cops can't catch

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
him because all serial killer

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
tracking is based on like these profiles

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
and it's like the guy is just like I don't

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I'll use a gun a hacksaw I don't care

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
right so he's just been doing it for 40

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
years and maybe he has

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
a really highly listened to podcast

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
maybe

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
it's a true story

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and maybe there's scenes where he confesses

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
it in full view

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
maybe he's always

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
hinting at it his love of mannequin

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
legs

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
maybe one day his wife

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
disappears

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
remember that joke about white redheaded people

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
yeah it seemed like a throwaway

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
when he first said it

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
all of a sudden she's gone where'd she go

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
yeah by the way

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
we haven't seen cameo in a long time

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Curtis Armstrong he's been

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
fucking glaringly missing in action

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
the worst if you want to

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
if you want to

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
you just remind me

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
if you want to stop doing this podcast

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
and like

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
or feel that you should like

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
like like like like just go

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
to the Harmontown subreddit which by the way

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
subreddit that fucking subreddit

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I went there for a really specific

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
reason and then I was like

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I'll click around and I saw one thread

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I was like I'm not click I would look at all the headlights

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I really miss cameo

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I'm like okay so you really think the

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
podcast sucks

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
like I just like like

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
let me give that a clickity click new

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
and then I

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
saw one I was like okay before I go

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
there was one that just said like is this

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
subreddit for complaining or

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
liking

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
you said that no no it was the

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
the headline of the post

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
so I was like what is this

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
are you playing a beat

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I was just writing something down

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
there was like a baseline did anyone else hear that

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
yeah you're having a stroke

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
the heads in my house

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
are talking to me

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I clicked

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
on it

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
there is nothing

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
when I was

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
there's nothing

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
is someone

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
hates a podcast

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and they want to like

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
like

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
do

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
green pants black man

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
it doesn't exist on my wall

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
yeah yeah yeah

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
yeah

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
hey

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
we don't hang out enough

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
you should come back to the crib tonight

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
he's having a real bomb I have like a million

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
board games

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I love board games do you like

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Espacho

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
it's a kind of soup

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
that no matter how it tastes you can't

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
get alarmed

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
it's designed

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
for poisoning

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
that's why Russian people

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
are poisoning each other so much

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
because their food is just like well I don't know

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
it's just Russian food

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
no if it was radiation poisoning I wouldn't be able

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
to taste it these fuckers do nothing

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
with poisoning each other and then you're like oh yeah

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I get why they can't but that's why

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
but then there's a scene where there's a cop

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
and her like

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
younger like partner and she's like

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
you know it's so hard to profile all these people

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
keep disappearing but they're all over the country

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
all over the map I'm not getting any like profile

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
but all of the beets and potatoes

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
are disappearing from all the markets

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
right now

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
where does he make Espacho that's borscht I got borscht

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
alright never mind fucking

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
different movie anyways

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
wish you swan the worst

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
thing in the world

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
you on the Harmontown subreddit

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
right now is not

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
you saying I don't

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
like this I don't like that

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
that's not what it is

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
as far as my personal nightmare is concerned

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
and it's also

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
it's not anybody going

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
because there's always a war going on between

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
those people and the people going like

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I think it's great it's a free podcast why don't you shut up

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
and then like why don't you just kiss some ass some more

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
the worst the problem is

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
the fucking war

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
the battlefield

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
because both sides

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
then it's just these kind of

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
both sides then it's just these conversations

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
going on the people

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
who are who love the podcast going

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
look I understand Dan's a bad person

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
he has a lot of flaws about himself

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
but he never said he was

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
a good person I mean health sometimes

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I find myself cringing or puking after a

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
show there's episodes

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
that I've deleted from my hard drive because I never

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
want to accidentally hear them again

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
all I'm saying is I want to win an argument

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
with you

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
don't do me any favors

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
anymore

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
stop sticking up for me

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
in arguments between you

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
and someone who hates me

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
the fucking change hitting the floor is burning

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
my skin

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
when I was

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
too young to speak

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
my first experience with this

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
was my fucking brother

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and my mother would do nothing but

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
incessantly argue about whether or not

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I was special

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
like a fucking like just third

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
person you're a ghost in the room

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I'm just like I'll just can I keep sucking

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
this

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
but Daniel doesn't have to do that

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Daniel's special

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
how come he shoots his pants all the time

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
well look I wish he'd stop that

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
but

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
he's fucking smarter than you

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I've been saying that for years

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
yes he is he's way smarter than you

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
no he's not

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
come on his writing he's just fucking

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
still sucking his thumb you think he's a good writer

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I can fucking do that do it do it

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
right now write better than Daniel

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
oh oh

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
this is a far far better thing that's tails of two

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
cities you cock sucker go in the basement

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
and I have to

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
be up here with a kid that can't stop

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
shitting his pants that's how shitty you are

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
oh

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
fucking shit go demon

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
listen

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
just stop shitting your pants so much

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
third act problems with this

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
last draft

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
go to your room and write a

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
story about a guy that showers

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I was when am I going to get a break

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
as a person that got pregnant out of high school

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
so anyways

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
should we do a bit of role playing

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
or no because

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
the last one was pretty great because

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
nothing happened except we

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
ruined another

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
well we actually did isn't the last one we all admitted were terrible

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
shadow runners and we failed the mission right

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I mean something like that you were in a library

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I mean yeah well you guys

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
went to the library to find out about invisibility

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
and whether or not invisibility works

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
which I like that

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
you guys will have com links on your

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
heads could you just access that like on your phone

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
you had to physically go to a library

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
having been to the subreddit

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
we could also

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
move forward into a world

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
and this has been my goal for a while

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
we could stop playing shadowrun

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I think we've proven that we're shitting at shadowrun

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and I think we need to move

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
into a world I'll be transparent about this

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I haven't brought this up yet but I think

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
as far as the role play

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
somebody tweeted and said oh Spencer should be

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
promoted to vice

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
com trailer I was like good because we got to stop calling him

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
master because sometimes we don't play

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
but I think we should

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
try to figure out how to actually

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
move a segment

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
maybe into the middle and

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
or like we got to

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
get things down to like

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
we got to have people that are always here

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
because it's been too diffuse because the cast

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
become six people that some of them aren't like

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Kumail, Curtis, Erin

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
they're not here like the golden age was

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
you know because Kumail was coming

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
here every week it wasn't that he was

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
a better person than me

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
he was just here all the time

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
but it wasn't that great

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
think about the days when Kumail was here

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
he was so funny, I know

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
he's hilarious, he's trucky

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
there was a thread in the

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Harmontown subreddit about how much more

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
likeable Justin Roiland is than me

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
do I have to bring him back on the show?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
yeah

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
for you to see

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
what I have to deal with

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
what I have to deal with?

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
so what

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
if we

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
are we going to stop playing Shatter One and move on to something else

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and Justin Roiland is a psychopath

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
the fact that you don't know that

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
is because he's a good one

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I'm a heart of my

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
sleeve baby

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
do you know

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
like Albert Schweitzer compared to him

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
anyways

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
thank you

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I think grandma's virginity might be coming back

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
oh it's back baby

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
new episode

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Dan what do you think

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
how do we go forward

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
let's pick

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
so

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
hey guys

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Spencer you are

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
aside being newly promoted Vice Comptroller

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
okay

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
as far as I'm concerned

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
yeah

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
co-comptroller status

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Vice makes it sound like

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
you're subordinate to my

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
controlling this

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I'll make that call he's subordinate

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I'm lower, I'm down here

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I'm off the stage

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I think Spencer needs to be more in this conversation

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
than I do

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
but how do you two think that this should go forward

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Mayor and Vice Comptroller

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I think we should just start playing like a different game

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
like boxing

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
like straight up

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
is that good podcast material

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I mean we have a video now

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
boost our video

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
it seems like people getting punched

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
like drives up the

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I was thinking about it's a good old fashioned

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
bear baiting

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
we'll just have an animal up on stage

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
you get a bear and a pen

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
and a bunch of rats and you bet on the rats

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
or the bear

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I don't know we'll have to figure it out offstage

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
yeah

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
one thing I thought of is there's this game called fate

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I think Adam has probably been

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
on our asses to play that game forever

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Adam Goldberg everybody

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
but fate is kind of cool

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
and it's more narrative

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and more fuck aroundy I don't know

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
is it fantasy based or more reality based

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
the one I'm thinking of is called spirit of the century

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
which is like pulp action

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
kind of you know like 20s

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
and fast talking detectives

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
and mad scientisties

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
and stuff like that I don't know

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
we only played

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
shadowrun for like 32 seconds

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
per week

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and we don't really like to do

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
is suck a big old

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
dick

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
the people that don't pay

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
$5 a month to subscribe to the video

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
don't know that Dan didn't say that

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
just like

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
it's a personal issue but

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
eating those balls

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
yeah

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I'm Dan Harmon for balls

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
hell yeah

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
just do Sam Elliott

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
doing a commercial for eating balls

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you know all the glitters ain't gold

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
well there's one flavor

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I've come to know and love

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
balls

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
it's what's for dinner

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
how is this not a regular segment of the

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Sam Elliott

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I won't do local spots

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
by Sam Elliott

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
there's a place in northern

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Colorado where the river runs

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
so deep

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
you can stick your dick in it

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I'm saying

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
it's the petty part of me

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
but

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I want to get a call of Cthulhu game going

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
because

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
just to stick it up Thomas Middleditch's

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
ass

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
because he belongs to

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Sam Elliott for sticking up Thomas Middleditch's

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
ass on it

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
because he's got that

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
so deep you can put your dick in it

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
what is it called of Cthulhu

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
it's just based on the universe of

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
keep it in your pants Dave Kline

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
keep it together

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
it's just

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
role playing based on the universe of HP Lovecraft

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
that's all I can say

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
it's a game that involves serious commitment

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
to the flavor of the universe

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
this sounds like

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
right up our alley

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
that's why I just believe all of it

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
it's a very tonal

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
a game it's all about the horror

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
the paranoia of dealing with the

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
ancient ones

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
let's the three of us talk about this

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
offstage

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
we'll come at this in a way that we can come at this

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I know that if we end up playing Call of Cthulhu

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
it'll be because that conversation got very

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
uncomfortable for Spencer

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
to the point where he

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
he said look

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
you can do this if you want

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I'm going to protest I'll still do it

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
because I get paid so much

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Spencer doesn't get paid

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
would we theoretically

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Dan be allowed to play that

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
legally because Harmon Quest

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I'm actually trying to think of because

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
as far as the letter of the contract goes

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
it's medieval fantasy that we shouldn't

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
like

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
that's what we're told

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
but I think we could honestly a phone call

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
or not one and just breaking the rule

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
no one's going to sue us for anything

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
what if we got really into fantasy

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
British Premier League soccer

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I will tell you this for sure the most important

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
thing to solve

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
is personnel

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
we could engineer

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
the game if we wanted where there was a guest player

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
but they would be designed to be always

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
pocketed but it's like we got to make sure

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
like people are reasonably always coming

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
yeah because when we first started

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
the very beginnings of

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
D&D

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
it was you and I doing these little

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
bite-sized things where you and I could remember

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
what you and I did it was kind of like a two-man

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
little thing that's what those were the golden

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
yeah maybe expand on that

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
slowly, modulally

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
you can't role play for 15 minutes

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
with six people and four of them are like

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I have a purple mohawk and

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I've never seen this show

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
what do these words mean

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
and I'm like well I know

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
everything that's going on and it was in a blackout

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
last time we played I think

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
it's something I really like I never

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
got to really learn much about my character

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I really like designing EVE Liberteam but I never

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
got to do anything like it's like

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
not because it was anybody else's fault

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I never knew what the fuck

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
we were doing I learned a lot about

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Norway

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I did research

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Hordegaard was a rich tapestry

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
also I think

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
the few times Curtis played

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Doctor Friend

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
he had no idea what was going on

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
so he made hard

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
fast decisions that were

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
beautifully etched in marble

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
that was really good but he was also like

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
tonally he was like look I don't

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
want to talk about that

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I feel

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Agony

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Agony

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
he approached it like an actor

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
anyways speaking of actors let's

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
make sure that Colin

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Colin have you ever done role playing games before

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
have you ever done like a D&D

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
yeah I played D&D before

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
like heavily or just a bit

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
just a little bit

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
wasn't really taken seriously

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
that's how it goes

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Spencer how much have we broken your heart

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
over the years about

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
not doing you any service at all

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
it's not my heart so much as my spirit

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
you know

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
it's like my heart

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
it's great it's always

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
always doing fine

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
that thread in the subreddit that I did click on

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
because someone was like do we just come here to complain

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I was like reading through it and going god damn

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
fuck these people fuck everything

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
and then there was a guy that said something like

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
well you know part of it is

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
because they're just arguing with each other

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and I'm okay to hate on the podcast

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
because Dan doesn't come anywhere

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Spencer's the new Dan he comes in every time

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
someone says something bad

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
and there was two people arguing

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
and then it was like Spencer doesn't come in

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
just to police people saying bad things

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Spencer comes into the blah blah blah

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
and there was a guy that I think Spencer did this

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
and then there was like a Spencer comment

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I was like why don't you just say you don't like me

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
yeah

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
nothing wrong with that

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
and it was like exactly what I was thinking

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
that is what I'm talking about Vice Comptroller

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
yeah

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
but it was exactly what I was

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I would have typed like I was

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I was just like yeah what are you taught

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
it's like the thing is is there some disconnect

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
like it's not generational

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Spencer's one of these fucking clones

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
um like

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
oh Danny's right now

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
oh did I find out what makes you feel something

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
um

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
it's

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
it's like what is there something

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
we're not getting about the internet

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
that only the people that were here before

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
the internet understand

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
which is that when in doubt fall back

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
on what would make you a dick

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
if you were talking

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
to the person

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
face to face how is that

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
not just the

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
unspoken rule if somebody

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
on Twitter is just like

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I went to Amy Schumer's

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Twitter feed

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
because I was like she's gotta have this

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
so worse than anybody

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
like and I was like

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I like her I gotta

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
morbidly curious like I gotta just like

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
look take a fucking crack

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
open the covenant arc and like just

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
uh like like and I went

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
to her feed and she the

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
latest thing she had posted was like a photo

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
of her on stage

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
it was taken from a low angle because

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
it was taken from somebody in the front row I think

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and uh so she captioned it

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
uh keeping my chins up

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
for charity like

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
self deprecating first

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
response uh just someone

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
saying fat

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
so

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
she can't respond to that

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
she can't go hey

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
fuck nut

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
that I shot

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
through that's why

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I'm famous like

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000

why are you trying so hard to hurt me

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I've already fucking been vetted

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I already know how to hurt myself

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
how can you do this like why are you

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
trying to hurt people

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
and and if she said that then

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
not only would there be a bunch of people

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
like lining up to go let me take a swipe

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
at this

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Harmon you're fat I mean

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I'm telling a story about Amy Schumer

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Amy Schumer

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
not only

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
those people aren't going to say that

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
the worst part of the fucking Parfait

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
is like people going like

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
like uh

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
if she were as dumb as me

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
and bothered to respond to that shit

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
there would be people not equating myself

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
with Amy Schumer by the way

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'm personalizing the story

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
only subconsciously

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
it's the people that would go

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
like uh Amy

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
