beautiful uptown Burbank in the heat of the night with the whole world on fire

00:06.600 --> 00:12.080
around us as ash rains slowly down on all of our cars and into our hair

00:12.080 --> 00:16.760

00:16.760 --> 00:32.200

Aside from being hot in the world becoming a horrible hellfire of crap, what's your

01:00.020 --> 01:04.440
problem? I don't know. I was I was in a good mood like like all week because I

01:04.440 --> 01:07.640
it was kind of a I guess it was a thing because it was like you know this is

01:07.640 --> 01:11.400
the hurricane in Texas and there's I don't know if you guys heard about that.

01:11.400 --> 01:17.280

and you put you in a kind of a good mood like I was in a good mood but I think

01:29.840 --> 01:33.680
that it's like an artificial good mood because it's derived from other people's

01:33.680 --> 01:36.680

01:36.680 --> 01:39.680

01:39.680 --> 01:44.640
like taking ecstasy I like crashes because now I'm just miserable and I'm

01:44.640 --> 01:50.960

10:00.240 --> 10:07.640
country that speaks a language that we do American well yes in a matter of

10:07.640 --> 10:12.040
speaking is it a Burbank establishment yeah it's that British place I'm

to desalinate water right like I need to actually and then also I need to bring

11:11.120 --> 11:17.000
an ocean to the desert I just don't you think there's a way to like I guess the

11:17.000 --> 11:21.440
reason oh yeah just go out like you don't want to build a fence because then

11:21.440 --> 11:24.920
if he's everyone's every scavenger see a fence then they'll go like oh there

11:24.920 --> 11:28.720
must be something on the other side of the fence right like buy a random spot

11:28.720 --> 11:32.680
in the desert they got a phone booth looking like regular random desert and

11:32.680 --> 11:37.680
then like there's a spot where you like you point a clicker and it goes there's

11:37.680 --> 11:41.960
like solar panels that no one can see from a distance they're just like sea

11:41.960 --> 11:47.400
level solar panels and you only expose them to charge your big battery under

11:47.400 --> 11:51.640
the ground and then and then you you go down there and there's like hydroponic

11:51.640 --> 11:57.240

dead person that you've never been sir yeah you've never met Spencer yeah so

12:44.960 --> 12:48.200
somebody you've never met that's alive okay and then somebody you've never met

12:48.200 --> 12:53.840
this dead to be part of your your desert hangout don the dragon Wilson he's a

12:53.840 --> 13:04.920
kickboxing champion just for security yeah although he's probably old now so

13:04.920 --> 13:12.440

other people can be kids all right so yeah well there was a guy FaceTiming

14:06.240 --> 14:09.320
what is with the I don't think anyone in this audience has ever done this what

14:09.320 --> 14:14.720
is through the people who FaceTime in public they're just like and crank it up

14:14.720 --> 14:19.360
and it was just a guy sitting at the bar and there was just this this woman it

14:19.360 --> 14:23.440
seemed like I made some assumptions it seemed like she was like a male order

14:23.440 --> 14:26.440
bride or something like she was like had a really thick accent and he was just

14:26.440 --> 14:31.720
like staring at her like he and she was just going like okay I love you I love

14:31.720 --> 14:35.600
you like like but he wasn't saying anything it was just like staring at

14:35.600 --> 14:41.000
her it was weird it was like I don't know if she was checking in on him or him

14:41.000 --> 14:44.280
on her but it was like one of them thought the other one was like an animal

14:44.280 --> 14:50.760
that you just monitor you know it was just like okay love you don't drink too

14:50.760 --> 14:56.400
much like like what do you do why do why you share how boring does your life

14:56.400 --> 15:00.800
have to be if you're willing to like have a phone call in public and let

15:00.800 --> 15:05.560
everyone see you're the person you're talking to I was it like sitting at the

15:05.560 --> 15:08.960
bar like at the Delta terminal like flying out of LAX and I was you know like

15:08.960 --> 15:12.400
like an idiot I bring a book to a bar and I get mad when people are loud and

15:12.400 --> 15:19.120
and aren't respecting my my library time and it's not it's not rational but

15:19.120 --> 15:23.080
there was a girl next to me who was FaceTiming with his sister at the top

15:23.080 --> 15:26.240
volume and the sister was coming in through top volume they were just the

15:26.240 --> 15:35.360
happiest sisters in the world like we're both bad people like I'm the guy that

15:35.360 --> 15:38.120
wants everyone to shut the fuck up you're the person that wants everyone to

15:38.120 --> 15:43.240
never have a book ever like everyone else in the world is always just like uh-huh

15:43.240 --> 15:47.960
yeah all over their phone and then every once in a while I'll like pick up as

15:47.960 --> 15:53.040
and as I'm leaving the restaurant like it's a crying baby you know cuz I'm so

15:53.040 --> 15:57.200
concerned with what other people think like I'll still like get some dirty look

15:57.200 --> 16:00.480
and someone I go like did you take that outside what do you think I'm going why

16:00.480 --> 16:04.120
does this only happen to me okay to take those people and put them in the same

16:04.120 --> 16:08.320
room as these people that I have to put up with why is it why does God hate me

16:08.320 --> 16:15.640

16:15.640 --> 16:19.880
where we're almost a year into like living in this shadow of this of this

16:19.880 --> 16:24.160
insane person you know it's almost been a fucking year that means that you could

like I'm gonna learn French or I'm gonna I'm gonna make a birdhouse like

16:31.840 --> 16:36.760
there's no bad way to spend a year we just spent it fucking like raising an

16:36.760 --> 16:47.360
autistic president I'm so sorry to my autistic fan base that I just mean I

16:47.360 --> 16:51.160
don't mean like he doesn't have the honor of being called autistic I don't

16:51.160 --> 16:54.280
mean he has autistic traits I just mean like he's like having like an autistic

16:54.280 --> 17:01.080
kid like like a three-year-old why is that you eat my fucking shit out of my

17:01.080 --> 17:08.160
ass like you because you like because you said not up to controversy I

17:08.160 --> 17:13.880
already said autistic and apologize for it and move on not the not the accurate

17:13.880 --> 17:18.640
physiological part of the autism just the annoying offensive part of the

17:18.640 --> 17:22.920
autistic that's the kind of autistic he is I think that's what I'm talking about

17:22.920 --> 17:26.840
I'm saying like if you talk to parents that have autistic children they may

17:26.840 --> 17:31.280
love them or hate them but it's it's hard to raise them they acknowledge that

17:31.280 --> 17:36.880
it's a challenge they're not like this is a snap none of them I think your

17:36.880 --> 17:39.640
mustache and whiskers are doing most of the driving right now I think it's

17:39.640 --> 17:45.440
changed I think it's liberated a part of you that maybe shouldn't have been

17:45.440 --> 17:49.280
liberated or maybe should have been I don't I mean do we are we really

17:49.280 --> 17:52.920
policing each other for defensiveness anymore there's a rapist in the White

17:52.920 --> 18:03.000
House he's a Nazi what go talk to him I'm a saint stop yelling at each other

18:03.000 --> 18:06.840
about hurting your feelings just because there's a fucking dude that doesn't

18:06.840 --> 18:12.900
give a fuck sitting on the throne of King's Landing eating babies that you

18:12.900 --> 18:18.120
can't talk to that you can't wag your finger at that has no shame stop taking

18:18.120 --> 18:22.560
it out on each other that you fucking insane how fucking heightenedly I thought

18:22.560 --> 18:26.600
we would relax I thought the one good thing would be oh we elected a rapist

18:26.600 --> 18:32.360
Nazi looks like political correctness is gonna shift into neutral no no not at

18:32.360 --> 18:38.000
all no quite the opposite let's all start in fighting about pronouns and

18:38.000 --> 18:42.720
fucking gender fluidity more than ever microaggressions just became nano

18:42.720 --> 18:54.720
aggressions hi Jane how are you thank you for coming my friend Jane is always a

18:54.720 --> 19:02.760
micro pleasure let's let's make sure that we recognize that you just compared

19:02.760 --> 19:08.320
children with autism to Nazi rapists you equated them a little bit yeah well I

19:08.320 --> 19:14.600
mean maybe by some like transitive property of math that I that I don't

19:14.600 --> 19:22.040
even understand like I got a 30% of my ACTs this is a midwestern equivalent of

19:22.040 --> 19:28.680
the SATs math I'm like I'm like I'm like dumber than normal people in math

19:28.680 --> 19:36.240
isn't that crazy given how smart I am about you know in other areas I just

19:36.240 --> 19:42.360
get such a big kick out of that I'm so stupid sometimes in some ways isn't that

19:42.360 --> 19:51.840
crazy anyways so can we talk about wait let me I want to make sure okay yeah

19:51.840 --> 19:56.560
well what's with the new okay so like you guys ever like you take a ride share

19:56.560 --> 20:00.760
service like I guess I'm gonna expose myself as like yeah I have lapsed back

20:00.760 --> 20:07.760
into ubers why did that happen did you try lift and not like it yeah I like to

20:07.760 --> 20:16.240
charge my phone mm-hmm lifts you can charge your phone yeah how many lifts

20:16.240 --> 20:19.840
did you take to prove that I don't like four or five there had to be some reason

20:19.840 --> 20:24.080
I don't know I think a lot of lift drivers have little phone chargers there

20:24.080 --> 20:27.880
was a guy who made me take my foot off his seat like which I thought it was so

20:27.880 --> 20:31.240
weird because it was a lift and not an Uber it was like a fucking Acura or

20:31.240 --> 20:34.480
something and he was like could you put lower your foot from my seat and I was

20:34.480 --> 20:38.640
like what was your foot was like you're crossing your leg and it was like sit on

20:38.640 --> 20:42.680
my foot you know like you're kind of sometimes isn't that really uncomfortable

20:42.680 --> 20:47.960
no I mean what I think it's just I think I'm compensating maybe for like 40

20:47.960 --> 20:52.000
years of a wallet I don't know I don't know why it is so I like to tuck my

20:52.000 --> 20:55.320
little footsie under when he's one of my butt cheeks sometimes and he said get

20:55.320 --> 21:00.520
your get your street pavement foot off of my anyways I'm sorry sorry I take sorry

21:00.520 --> 21:04.960
I take Uber sometimes but but the the the this is thing where they'll go they'll

21:04.960 --> 21:07.760
drop you off and then they'll give you a business card they'll try to like

21:07.760 --> 21:12.240
indoctrinate you into their own like private business like they're like oh

21:12.240 --> 21:18.160
take my card so like if you want to if you want to get a ride for me again

21:18.160 --> 21:24.440
don't use the service that arranges everything like take my business card

21:24.440 --> 21:28.520
of like call me on a regular phone and like what what are they how is that

21:28.520 --> 21:32.760
gonna take off I've never experienced you don't it seems like everyone's doing

21:32.760 --> 21:36.480
that now they drop you off and they go by the way here take my card when you if

21:36.480 --> 21:40.680
you want to get picked up like take my card like why would I there's an app that

21:40.680 --> 21:45.400
and so and I was like well I'm gonna make this guy's day I he dropped me off at

21:45.400 --> 21:51.480
the at the shitty British restaurant here in Burbank and and he was like hey

21:51.480 --> 21:54.280
remember me I was that guy that gave you that card I'm like oh yeah yeah do you

21:54.280 --> 21:57.760
have another card because this time actually this might work because I'm

21:57.760 --> 22:01.080
gonna eat here and then I'm gonna just be driving a couple of blocks over to

22:01.080 --> 22:04.680
the starburns castle and he's like oh that was done no that makes no sense for

22:04.680 --> 22:06.880
me

22:06.880 --> 22:11.760
well okay so it's based on logic then don't give me a business card when I've

22:11.760 --> 22:16.480
met you through a hologram don't ever give anybody a business card I've never

22:16.480 --> 22:22.480
ever used one that it's basically just things to go in my trash can yeah I

22:22.480 --> 22:25.920
don't call them I've never needed one I've never wanted one they have a whole

22:25.920 --> 22:33.000
culture based on them in Japan you know there maybe not still the whole culture

22:33.000 --> 22:35.880
is based on business cards well no I'm just saying like they have a whole like

22:35.880 --> 22:41.040
like you know that was like 90s Japan at least when I was learning Japanese and

22:41.040 --> 22:45.160
Marquette University they were explaining the whole business card you

22:45.160 --> 22:53.760
study Japanese and Marquette for like a semester

22:55.080 --> 23:03.880
can anybody verify or do oh yeah well there's a lot of white Japanese people

23:03.880 --> 23:13.080
here we get a lot of anime fans and what did you say just just for my own

23:13.080 --> 23:20.160
curiosity a little Japanese which is not true but I could only say that that's

23:20.160 --> 23:30.880
technically true beer oh no me my show car should we drink beer how do you say

23:30.880 --> 23:42.080
yes hi I never I thought I knew everything about you I didn't know

23:42.080 --> 23:48.240
you studied Japanese but what was the end game on that one I just I dropped

23:48.240 --> 23:52.600
out of my freshman year college because I just like I was cutting classes and

23:52.600 --> 23:56.920
that just yeah this is sad I remember like there was some exam and I like I

23:56.920 --> 24:01.240
was like a baby like I like pretended my mom was sick or something like this is

24:01.240 --> 24:04.320
like you're an adult like just just fucking leave college like what are you

24:04.320 --> 24:08.560
trying to like make excuses no but you chose Japanese because you wanted to

24:08.560 --> 24:12.760
learn Japanese or you're gonna yeah translator I think at the time I thought

24:12.760 --> 24:17.680
maybe I should I should learn how to sell my dad's company like at the time

24:17.680 --> 24:21.120
the Japanese were like the Chinese of the time you know they were like the

24:21.120 --> 24:25.560
big financial thing all the time magazine covers were like you know had

24:25.560 --> 24:30.320
like a like a gay show woman with a microchip and a suitcase you know I

24:30.320 --> 24:44.040
like cover like the new threats land of the rising Nasdaq I like grumpy Dan

24:44.040 --> 24:51.440
you're I like you when you're a little surly I hate society every single human

24:51.440 --> 24:55.000
being like me even in the how cool you think you are right now I fucking hate

24:55.000 --> 25:00.320
you and I've said I'm sick I'm sick of here absolutely the press like

25:00.320 --> 25:03.720
vilifying Antifa like I don't have to suck their dicks or anything but it's

25:03.720 --> 25:07.240
like there's a couple of kids out there that are like willing to be bullies

25:07.240 --> 25:10.720
back towards Nazis if we didn't have them we wouldn't have anybody that was

25:10.720 --> 25:16.280
scaring Nazis give him some slack they're anarchists you know I had when I

25:16.280 --> 25:21.680
was younger I had these foreign exchange students and one of them was his dad was

25:21.680 --> 25:26.480
like from bass country and he was apparently like a freedom fighter against

25:26.480 --> 25:31.200
like Spain or some shit and the other guy was a Russian and he was part of an

25:31.200 --> 25:36.080
anti-nazi gang that would beat the shit out of neo-nazis and it was when I was a

25:36.080 --> 25:42.680
young boy and I remember I told this to everyone I came across and everyone

25:42.680 --> 25:49.000
thought it was really badass what changed it's just cowardice man it's like

25:49.000 --> 25:52.840
okay I'm sorry there's an extreme form of being afraid of Nazis like it doesn't

25:52.840 --> 25:57.360
mean it's like this advocacy for just complacency just fucking pisses me off

25:57.360 --> 26:00.640
it's like lately you're not gonna accomplish I'm so sick of it like

26:00.640 --> 26:04.720
people act like it's based on logic or something it's not it's just fucking

26:04.720 --> 26:09.040
I'm not I'm not a hero either but like stop stop dressing up your fucking

26:09.040 --> 26:14.880
regular ass yellow belly with like a spock face you know like hmm well it

26:14.880 --> 26:19.560
wouldn't really make sense did nothing fucking make sense it doesn't make sense

26:19.560 --> 26:24.360
nothing it's it's fucking it's not politics it's not debate it's not it's

26:24.360 --> 26:29.600
fucking like it's like it's it's it's it's fucking scary that you know how all

26:29.600 --> 26:34.640
20 year olds are dumbasses don't you want some dumbasses to be not Nazis

26:34.640 --> 26:40.160
like like it's kind of easy to be a Nazi when you're a dumbass we should thank

26:40.160 --> 26:44.800
Christ some people who still want to fucking scrap it up actually have the

26:44.800 --> 26:51.640
balls to be like plus I don't want to be a Nazi thank God thank you kids like I

26:51.640 --> 26:56.560
really appreciate it because I'm fucking old my back hurts I can't I can't if I

26:56.560 --> 27:00.520
throw a rock I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna be in a hospital for a week

27:00.520 --> 27:05.800
people's parents will be suing me I you know I gotta just sit in my house and

27:05.800 --> 27:11.760
take shits and and and and you know I'm just gonna I'm targeting 60 and I'm

27:11.760 --> 27:16.400
just gonna fucking kill myself if I'm not dead and but like so just just like

27:16.400 --> 27:19.840
just you're gonna be one of those people that starts saying I'm gonna kill

27:19.840 --> 27:23.040
myself in their 40s and you're gonna end up being 80 and we're all gonna say

27:23.040 --> 27:29.400
fucking didn't do it are you encouraging Dan to kill himself you're gonna be

27:29.400 --> 27:33.240
like Dorothy Parker oh yeah really 83-year-old Dorothy Parker I can talk a

27:33.240 --> 27:37.200
lot of shit back in your 40s about killing yourself well also if you're 16

27:37.200 --> 27:39.760
and you're listening don't take that again it's like you're having a you're

27:39.760 --> 27:43.240
having a bad day like I am especially if you're one of those autistic Nazi

27:43.240 --> 27:48.720
rapists out there no no don't kill yourself if you're depressed this too

27:48.720 --> 27:54.520
shall pass it's a serious issue you know a lot of kids write me on my tumblr you

27:54.520 --> 27:59.680
know Dan's depression is mostly ear pot based like if anything kids if you're

27:59.680 --> 28:03.480
depressed right now you know like like just think about it this way like I'm

28:03.480 --> 28:09.400
confirming for you at 44 that like there are bouts of of feelings and I don't you

28:09.400 --> 28:11.800
know want to be talked out of how you feel but I'm just saying like this too

28:11.800 --> 28:16.640
shall pass like it's like your moods do control they're like very real your

28:16.640 --> 28:19.720
feelings are real they're just not reflective of reality you know what I

28:19.720 --> 28:24.160
mean like your feelings should be very respected and taken seriously but then

28:24.160 --> 28:28.160
there that you don't have to like you can you can acknowledge that you feel

28:28.160 --> 28:31.600
really really sad and that could be the most important thing going on in your

28:31.600 --> 28:36.680
life you don't have to then connect that to reality by saying like therefore I'm

28:36.680 --> 28:41.000
gonna do this or that which you know do as I say not as I do all right but you

28:41.000 --> 28:44.080
know if you're young I'm saying you know you're just you're just sticking out I

28:44.080 --> 28:50.680
promise it'll be it'll it's gonna be great fucking that's not no it's not

28:50.680 --> 28:56.800
gonna be great I know that's not the reason to not kill yourself it's life

28:56.800 --> 29:00.560
is a fucking shit sandwich it's gonna it's not gonna end up delicious but just

29:00.560 --> 29:07.400
like eat it and because I'm telling you no I'm gonna kill myself you fucking just

29:07.400 --> 29:10.760
just just I'm telling you I'll be in it I'll be in a better mood again next week

29:10.760 --> 29:13.760
and then we'll have fun together eating the shit sandwich like the fire will

29:13.760 --> 29:17.440
have moved down here we'll roast some marshmallows do you want to go our

29:17.440 --> 29:22.800
friends from Texas will now be refugees that'll be an ironic twist Dan do you

29:22.800 --> 29:28.240
want to show you up if maybe you could go have a walk in the park with Ann

29:28.240 --> 29:33.240
Margaret at some point sure yeah I can yeah I mean like boy that magic movie you

29:33.240 --> 29:39.240
get a lot magic it's the movie's called magic it's Anthony Hopkins is a magician

29:39.240 --> 29:44.440
and he becomes a ventriloquist and he's a he's a wonderful ventriloquist that

29:44.440 --> 29:49.080
he's crazy either the or the dolls real and then like the movies all over and

29:49.080 --> 29:54.120
Cody goes like wait I don't understand aren't ventriloquist comedians they're

29:54.120 --> 29:57.640
not magicians I'm like yeah that's what it's something off about this movie the

29:57.640 --> 30:01.600
outside again what the fuck wait why was he a magician and then he like picked up

30:01.600 --> 30:05.080
a dummy it was like I'll try this magic trick that's not the category that

30:05.080 --> 30:10.120
ventriloquist it's a it's a comedy act that people were and that movie's weird

30:10.120 --> 30:13.400
man it's actually it is worth watching though like Anthony have you seen Viva

30:13.400 --> 30:18.760
Las Vegas yeah of course yeah that movie with Elvis that movie's pretty insane

30:18.760 --> 30:23.440
because there's a big car race at the end and then people die there's a big

30:23.440 --> 30:28.520
car wreck but it's this open like old-school hot rod like race cars where

30:28.520 --> 30:31.640
there's no cockpit that you're just a dude with a helmet sticking out the top

30:31.640 --> 30:36.280
and when you flip over your head comes off and it's pretty bad a lot of people

30:36.280 --> 30:40.600
seem to crash and burn and die and then it cuts straight to Elvis and then

30:40.600 --> 30:45.520
Margaret just hey Viva Las Vegas the end credits that's that's it there's no

30:45.520 --> 30:49.240
fucking there's no requiem for all the fucking people that just got murdered

30:49.240 --> 30:54.080
and they don't waste a moment of sadness before they start dancing that would be

30:54.080 --> 30:57.360
amazing if like they started dancing and instead of going to the credits it

30:57.360 --> 31:02.280
just like slowed down and faded to like grayscale and then said like to like it

31:02.280 --> 31:11.000
had a dates and stuff all the drivers deal deal Earnhardt and there was deal

31:11.000 --> 31:15.760
Earnhardt senior senior and then the way senior passed away as they were in the

31:15.760 --> 31:21.800
same race and he was like boxing out his son his son was in the lead or like in

31:21.800 --> 31:26.280
second place and his dad was behind him and he was like boxing out competitors

31:26.280 --> 31:31.800
it's like protecting his son you know giving his son some space to and then

31:31.800 --> 31:37.320
his daddy fucking flipped out and got killed I don't really and then his son

31:37.320 --> 31:43.120
didn't win but he had an excuse like if anybody was like you didn't win he's

31:43.120 --> 31:48.760
like my dad died yeah so yeah junior was in the race when his father died I

31:48.760 --> 31:51.960
thought yeah I don't think so that's what Mike Waldron told me take it up with him

31:51.960 --> 31:56.880
now who told you that Mike Waldron from Atlanta I think he said my brother and

31:56.880 --> 32:01.400
I was like what no no I think it's just Dale senior went into a wall and did

32:01.400 --> 32:03.960
his and he broke his neck and that was that I don't think junior was in the

32:03.960 --> 32:08.280
race well I don't think he was okay well you know I don't want to fucking

32:08.280 --> 32:12.600
argue in here I mean is it any for Japanese people know how about NASCAR as

32:12.600 --> 32:21.720
well huh he was in the race holy shit that's fucked up the way you emphasized

32:21.720 --> 32:25.480
was made it seem like you you were bursting at the seams to say but

32:25.480 --> 32:30.280

freeway and you're in a car as you did as I hope you are or you're Martin Lawrence

44:26.160 --> 44:32.560
the the the if someone is pulling up next to you if someone is you know there's a

44:32.560 --> 44:38.200
person he's a stranger in another car I think you can visualize this do you so

44:38.200 --> 44:43.720
there are some people that you you're like I'll you you'll pick your nose

44:43.720 --> 44:49.600
freely because you'll and your justification for it is logical which is

44:49.600 --> 44:55.680
that you're never gonna see that person again right fuck but I just I I want to

44:55.680 --> 44:59.320

strangers think of me it's like another reason to just hate myself fucking

45:15.920 --> 45:21.400

45:21.400 --> 45:26.080

45:31.440 --> 45:36.320
other room and pick my nose now and then in front of a stranger and if the

45:36.320 --> 45:39.240

me you'd be like yeah well make friends with me you dickbag maybe I'll treat you

45:44.440 --> 45:49.960
with some respect give me a chance stranger there's a story I'll get it all

45:49.960 --> 45:53.560
wrong but it was like James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart were both up for the same

45:53.560 --> 45:57.040
role and there was some kind of studio dispute on it and they were having some

45:57.040 --> 46:00.320
kind of rivalry but who's the biggest star and I don't want to take that guy's

46:00.320 --> 46:03.960
role if he already passed on it because it lowers my fucking status or whatever

46:03.960 --> 46:09.200
the fuck but apparently Humphrey Bogart saw James Cagney like driving down

46:09.200 --> 46:13.400
the street in Hollywood picking his nose in the back of his limousine and I see

46:13.400 --> 46:17.720
the Cagney sent a poem to Bogart or vice versa I think Bogart wrote a poem and

46:17.720 --> 46:23.560
sent it to Cagney about how famous people shouldn't pick their noses like

46:23.560 --> 46:28.600
he fucking nose pick shamed him in a poem and sent it to him like roses are

46:28.600 --> 46:37.360
red violets are like famous people you dirty rat famous people famous people

46:37.360 --> 46:41.320
famous people and like driving in famous places shouldn't go around picking

46:41.320 --> 46:44.320
their famous faces like something like that like he's like I saw you picking

46:44.320 --> 46:50.880

guy's face in Indiana Jones and he just crawled in his mouth and he ate it you

47:04.400 --> 47:08.520

mafia king of the neighborhood and he's like no everybody give me some of the

55:11.040 --> 55:17.480

way to do this to you know like it's like you got to give this guy all your

55:44.960 --> 55:51.080
money and so that he and then he he just shoots him and then it's just like

55:51.080 --> 55:57.800
that's it that he just takes over like I don't think that's I mean what there's

55:57.800 --> 56:02.920
no what you just shoot the guy no one thought of that that's what it takes to

56:02.920 --> 56:07.680
be a godfather must be nice you know it's like rap in the 80s you can just

56:07.680 --> 56:15.040
fucking ha ha ha ha ha ha ha you know like you could just be a mafia guy by

56:15.040 --> 56:18.880
just killing one guy every 30 years but then you got to be good at not being

56:18.880 --> 56:22.720
killed you got a you got to be the guy that doesn't get killed that easy yeah

56:22.720 --> 56:25.560
why didn't the first guy think of that though like what he would think this guy

56:25.560 --> 56:29.120
like lived alone in an apartment and like he just walked up the stairs and

56:29.120 --> 56:31.760
it's like Robert De Niro what are you doing here and he's like shooting you

56:31.760 --> 56:36.920
and then the guy's like I can't believe this happened all I did was take all

56:36.920 --> 56:42.960
of everybody's money and and the godfather movies every time you see

56:42.960 --> 56:45.520
an orange someone's about to die you know if you notice that there's always a

56:45.520 --> 56:48.200

57:15.440 --> 57:28.680

57:28.680 --> 57:34.760
opening act of Remo Williams the adventure continues to the flies not

stone-cold fly killer I could land on anybody holding a drink in an iPhone so

57:48.160 --> 57:54.160
like yeah there's one last thing that I'm just like I just say and then I'm

57:54.160 --> 57:56.880
not I won't be in a bad mood anymore because I just like I just wanted to get

57:56.880 --> 58:03.680

58:13.840 --> 58:17.000
over again like you're gonna write your social secure what why do you why do

58:17.000 --> 58:20.680
they get your social security number isn't that an important number

58:20.680 --> 58:24.080

and you didn't say you wanted that like fix my back I I learned to not be

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.240
honest on those on those things now because one time on a TV show a long

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.680
time ago I was honest about whether or not I'd ever tried drugs and I said yes

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.880
and then a team of lawyers came from the studio a major studio came and I had

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.440
to fucking deal with a big-ass law like kerfuffle and fill out a bunch of shit

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.680
and I was like do you think look at the rest of this cast they're all from

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.600
Chicago from the 80s if you don't think they thought they all didn't eat their

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.120
weight and coke every afternoon you're out of your fucking minds I was the only

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.240
guy I talked to some of these older actors like oh no no you never say yes

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:36.920
on that shit I think terrific fucking doctors fucking people you know they

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.840
went I gotta go back in for another endoscopy they upsold me on another

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.200
one you know they're like look I got I went I went because I was like oh I got

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.080
I've been taking prilosec every day for my heartburn that can't be good I just

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.560
heard it's linked to Alzheimer's and I went into the thing and the guys like

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:56.160
well here's the thing or I told you that I went to my doctor I said I said hey

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.240
man I've been taking prilosec for a really long time and I see on the box it

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.280
says you're not supposed to take it that much and and I heard this study it says

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.480
it's linked to Alzheimer's and stuff and and he's like well what happened didn't

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.360
I refer you to that one guy I'm like yeah you got remember you guys like

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.680
started obsessing about my lymph nodes and give me a biopsy and told me I had

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.960
sarcoidosis and then I was like so what's with my heartburn and you were

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.360
like oh no and so I'm like okay so for real it's been okay like what about my

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.720
heartburn and my doctor goes he goes hey listen so go back to that guy but

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.600
listen this time when you talk to him just just stay on the heartburn topic you

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:38.080

a babble when you go to the doctor so maybe you maybe it's your fault that we

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.320
like went off on some weird fucking expensive tangent with MRIs like making

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.200
sure you don't have lymphatic cancer instead of like telling you about your

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:13.360
heartburn remember that that sound I may go to do it I don't know sometimes it

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.280
comes back but it's like that was the thing at the end of it all make so what

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.840
so is that what made that sound the sarcoidosis they're like I don't know

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.960

any day now I'm gonna get like you know it's like I got my health right now and

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.600
I should be happy and I got everything that everybody wants and I'm like I'm

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.160
just like pissing around my house like like yelling at my dog for eating my

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.720
underwear and like like the big scowl on my face there's a dude chasing an alligator

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.360
out of his living room in Texas he's probably laughing about it like you

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.360
haven't a better life than me I'm fucking had I've been had I've been had by

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.520
God I've been had by society but had my morons as I like I just want to watch

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:00.600
forensic VX it's our two to the front two to the side I'm glad Burbank's on

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:09.800
fire deserve it hope all your Burbank crops burn was there one event like

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.920
today or yesterday like like one little small my AirPods it was what that said

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.440
that that was a tipping point that that's when I and then I had a candle in my hand

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.520
looking for my AirPods and I threw it out the window in Burbank

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:32.040
fucking knew it you don't think oh oh your power went out too it's fucking

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:36.640
freaky right the power went out of your your crib right I don't think I think

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.720
Dan's oh yeah okay there's a way to yell that and waited to not terrify

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.120
everybody I've been meaning to I've been meaning to say I've been meaning I think

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:51.760
that when when we point out it's 9-11 we should we should do it like that's the

01:06:51.760 --> 01:07:02.440
start of a musical like it's like that we shouldn't do it like that because that

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.640
that legitimately scared me thought it was we thought it was no I thought we

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:12.600
got 11 we got ISIS I want to circle back and admire their enthusiasm you

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.200
know I never came from that's a good thing that's what this country needs

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.960
more of I got a flight coming up on 9-11 and I keep getting these reminders

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.120
hey remember you're why would you do that I cuz I got a show on the 12th well

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.280
show up on the 12th no but it's in Ontario Canada I can't I can't fly

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:38.000
data I've got a fly on 9-11 like a terrorist what's the deal with John

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.880
Snow's thumb you know it looks like a weird fucking toe did no one else notice

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.320
that it was like I was trying to be like sentimental and sexy you know but

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.120
it's like he's he has a giant fucking toe on his hand I've never noticed that

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.600
what about his hairline is weird-ass hair like I you know I don't know about

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:03.040
that I trust your judgment there but I was looking right like the Dow Jones you

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.720
know I got a problem with that last episode what they never showed the

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.640
fact that the wall just goes into a lake and you could just say they just walk

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.000
you could have just like like like just swung around on a rope also they

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.920
could have just like walked in like knee-deep water they kept saying oh but

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.720
the dead don't swim the wall goes just to the fucking water's edge and you

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:31.360
could just you know catch a ferry I mean it's gotta end somewhere I guess but I

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.080
mean we did we think it went all the way around the world I just thought that

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.680
they kind of I thought it was on the top of a high cliff or something when it

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.280
meant the ocean I mean my one beef was like you know if it's something

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.840
collapses like that there's not just gonna be like this path it's like they

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.080
should have been they should have shown him like crawling over rubble being like

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.880
goddamn this is like a quarter of a wall yeah it's kind of what happens when

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.440
you collapse a wall as you have like about a quarter of a wall yeah that it

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.720
was convenient they like cut it off halfway and then it went all the way

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.480
down also that fucking ice dragon that dead ice dragon they got holes all up on

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.760
those wings how you gonna fly when you got holes in your wings that's where's

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.320
the fucking aerodynamic integrity of the flight surface well it's flying with

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.480
magic isn't it I mean is it magic well proud I mean probably a dragon at least

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.960
has some sort of magic flotation because they're a heavy thing you know you need

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.160
a huge wing to well combination also like

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.720
zombie is him because the you know the the white walker people you know they

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.960
got the they don't got no muscles like some of them got like a whole skeleton

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.480
leg and they're super missing a button like how you gonna walk around with no

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:48.520
but but if you can if you can make a holy winged dragon fly with your white

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.400
walker magic then why don't you just make a skeleton fly just make him like

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.920
like give him some of that dragon this is my favorite song from the movie Dumbo

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:02.840
yeah they got the holes in the wings what was my other fucking beef of that

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:09.400
shit there was some other so I though I just thought of that today the giant the

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.240
giant cultures have the giant chains and they zombified the yeah but that was a

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.800
lot of chain man yeah they were a whole society thriving but they had him in a

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.920
cart in the back of the goddamn fucking army oh yeah they're always ready they

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.160
brought all their stuff with them okay also how about this remember when they

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.200
bring out the the the dead boogins and they're bringing them out to show

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.320
sursy and the whole gang that there's there's dead people and the chop the guy

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.080
and he's still crawling and kicking ass until they fucking dragon glass them but

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.920
then the rest of the time they fight him they go chop and they just fucking go

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.400
poof like like they now now they live away they live a lot longer when it's a

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.960
story beat my my concern with the Cersei plan was that I thought she was gonna

01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:00.640
look at the zombie and go like yeah I have one for a butler like I am well

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.400
aware you could make dead people hang out like I yeah I didn't think about that

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:12.360
like my chauffeur is a fucking mountain of zombie pleasure driving miss Cersei

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:18.040
there's your spinoff HBO I we should do a show cheaper zombie and you're Dan

Brains or other dog brains? Zombie dog. Cat brains.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:28.120
Do we have a leave here or is the leave still out of town?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120
He's gone. Did he just leave us?

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.120
Yeah. Get it. Steve, Steve, leave us.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.120
Yeah. Where is everything?

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.120
What are you? We don't have a screen.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120
Yeah, where was the screen? I thought we could have...

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.120
Jesus Christ. I hope I do die.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120
I don't care.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.120
The screen is up there.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.120
Dan, you have so much to be thankful for and happy about.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.120
I know. I crashed from that. You should have seen me on Wednesday.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.120
It would have been a great podcast.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.120
I've been grouchy all day because it's hot.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.120
I had dinner with church and it was being a pain in the butt

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.120
and I was just being a grouchy asshole all day long.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.120
I told you to stay in the van.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.120
Remember when that awesome blind dude joined us for our show

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.120
and then the next week he was like peace?

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.120
Because he just secretly didn't even like us.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.120
Wait, what? We found out he didn't like us?

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.120
Well, he didn't even come back.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.120
Someone on Reddit saw that he has a short film made about his life.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.120
Well, ooh la la.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120
Yeah.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.120
You have a long film made about your life.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.120
I had to make it myself.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.120
And I still look shitty in it.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.120
Can we go out? We've talked kind of semi-seriously

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.120
about going out and doing another Harmon tour.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.120
Like maybe like go to Europe or go somewhere fun

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.120
or maybe like not film it but just travel around a bunch

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.120
or maybe film it again. Are you still up for that?

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120
I can't be nailed down.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.120
I mean it sounds like when we did that last one

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.120
you were kind of going through a little bit of a crisis

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.120
because you got fired off your show.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.120
You seem like you're pretty down right now.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.120
I think maybe it's time to go out there and hit the road.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.120
I don't want to do a tour and be happy.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.120
I want to repeat the same process.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.120
No, we go out and we find happiness by exploring.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.120
By getting out of your comfort zone.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.120
It didn't work that time.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120
Didn't it?

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120
It didn't work? I thought you were happy during that.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120
I think I faked a lot of that.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120
Yeah.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.120
For the movie, right?

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:45.120
Yeah. Because I knew they would sell eight copies.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.120
Yeah, were we happy? I can't tell.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.120
We were trapped.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.120
I avoided everybody.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.120
I just kept leaving and going doing my little disappearing act

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.120
and I would go read a book and get away from everybody.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.120
I brought work on the road with me.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:03.120
I would like to do a tour again but I want to be free to enjoy it.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.120
We can't fly to Europe and then get a tour bus, right?

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.120
Yeah, bands never do that.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.120
I don't know, man.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120
That's what you do. You fly to...

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.120
There's a lot of van travel.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.120
Marilyn Manson doesn't drive around on a van.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120
He's got a fucking sexy tour bus.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.120
Okay.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.120
I'm saying, here's a pitch.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.120
We go out with Marilyn Manson.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.120
Church and I hung out with that guy. He's good fun.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.120
He's a big dork. We should get him on the show.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120
He's good fun.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.120
He's welcome whenever he wants to come by.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.120
Are you going to be all pouty about it when he does?

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.120
I don't know because I don't care.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120
He'll come and everybody will be like,

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.120
I love Marilyn Manson. I wish he would be on the show more often.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.120
But I get it. You don't like me.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.120
Stick it up your ass, you fucking herd of fucking...

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.120
Shhh.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120
She turned me around. She got me.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120
Oh, we did it!

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120
Who was that?

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.120
Whose laugh was that?

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.120
That laughter was...

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120
That was my mistake a little after.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.120
I'm somebody who could not take my bad mood seriously.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.120
She was just like laughing, really entertained.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.120
She felt a little sad for me.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.120
But she was glad she wasn't me.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.120
You know a movie I watched yesterday that does not hold up

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.120
and I was pretty bummed out?

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.120
Spaceballs. Spaceballs is not great.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120
It's got a couple of jokes.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.120
The incredible or the amazing Mr. Limpet with Don Knotts.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.120
I thought that was on.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.120
It's not that good, man.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.120
I really wanted to remember that I loved that movie.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.120
I've never seen it.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.120
He turns into a fish but also he has a superpower

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120
that he makes the loudest noise in the world.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.120
Never explains.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.120
He turns into a fish?

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120
He's already turned into a fish, Spencer.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.120
Don Knotts loves fish while his friend George Stickle

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.120
is trying to clearly fuck his wife.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.120
And they all go out to Coney Island and he loves fish so much

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120
and he goes, I wish I were a fish.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.120
And he falls into the water and he turns into a fish.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120
But he's also a fish that wears glasses

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.120
so we remember it's Don Knotts.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.120
And we can tell him apart from the no other animated fish

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.120
except for weird lady fish.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.120
He almost fucks a fish in the fucking beginning of the second act.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.120
He takes to that pretty quickly.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.120
Then he makes a weird sound.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.120
Then he kills all the Nazis and we win World War II.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.120
Well, how could that possibly be bad?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.120
My childhood, I thought it was awesome but there's a lot of holes.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.120
There's a lot of holes in Mr. Limbin.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.120
Oh, boy.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.120
But the admiral in that movie is the neighbor from Mr. Ed.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.120
So that made me happy.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.120
Mr. Ed's fucking great.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120
All right, we're good to go.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.120
Spencer, you've told us that you've leveled our characters up

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.120
because we've achieved such greatness

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.120
that we are now level three characters.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.120
You've achieved such greatness.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.120
There you go, level three character.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.120
Oh, yeah.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.120
We fucking earned it by lighting doors on fire

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.120
and running away from shit.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.120
It's as much for me as it is for you.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.120
Meaning what exactly?

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120
It's more fun.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120
Does that mean that I...

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.120
Are my loadouts updated?

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120
Oh, yeah.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.120
If they're the ones on the right, yeah.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.120
I mean, yes.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120
All right, but we're still on the same loadout

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.120
that we were on last time as we haven't gone to sleep yet.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.120
Because you haven't gone to sleep yet.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.120
Okay, I need a real refresher on this D&D.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.120
You guys ready for some D&D right now?

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120
No.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.120
Are we going to do this without a diarrhea junior?

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.120
I got it all figured out.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.120
Okay.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120
Which is why I got John Carmen.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.120
It doesn't make any sense, but Steve will hate that.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120
Who's John Carmen?

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120
You're bearing with me.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120
John Carmen is a Steve Levy looking person

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:23.120
that used to be Justin Rowland's assistant.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120
Is he here with us in person tonight?

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.120
No.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.120
It's not for anybody here.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120
It's for Steve Levy.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.120
He's going to get a kick out of that and I'll be satisfied.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.120
Okay.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.120
And we will have burned a minute or two.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120
What about our new intern, Sammy?

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.120
Did you see her?

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120
She kind of had like a Levy kind of vibe.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.120
Oh, she's going to be running this place too.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.120
I'll do it.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.120
Thank you.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120
Is that Sammy that said that?

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.120
No.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.120
Oh, no.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.120
You can't do it.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120
All right.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.120
All right.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.120
You want to give us a recap, Spencer?

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.120
Yeah.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.120
Please.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.120
We had Schrab and things went kind of weird and I don't quite...

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.120
All I remember is that trousers were pulled down at the very end

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120
and that was our cliffhanger.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.120
So Spencer, if you will, the recap of last week's Harmontown.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120
It's the one thing I didn't do.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:17.120
Last time on Harmontown, our heroes were...

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:21.120
They had just defeated or gotten away from the evil cult

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.120
right as it collapsed, like the whole church collapsed.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120
Oh boy.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120
It was a disaster.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.120
The vampire escaped in the form of a mist

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.120
leaving our heroes high and dry in the priory

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.120
where they searched for survivors.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.120
There they became attacked by two little girls

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.120
who knocked Diarrhea Jr. unconscious.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.120
Chad leapt into action, grabbing one of the girls

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.120
and Carlos leapt into action,

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.120
smashing one of the little girls in the face.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.120
After some conversation, Patchens came back

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120
and he needed help.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120
So he took you to the fells house

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.120
where the prior was burning down the house

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120
and trying to murder the family.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.120
But you stopped him.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.120
Now you're outside of the burning down house

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120
with the prior.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.120
He's tied up and you don't know what's going on.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.120
It's been a long night.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.120
The end.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.120
All right.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.120
Wait, did you sit where...

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.120
The most important part was the prayer.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.120
You said we're still outside the fells house with the prior.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.120
Yeah.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.120
We're just right where we left off.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.120
Yeah, he's unconscious.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.120
He's, I think, tied up.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.120
Okay.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.120
Well, and how about the fells? How are they holding up?

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120
They're okay.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:43.120
Tom just had given you a bunch of church relics

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120
that he had stolen.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.120
But they weren't of much value, right?

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:51.120
Well, you don't know that because you're not shop-able.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.120
Well, let's all secure these relics.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.120
Are they small enough to fit in my sack?

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.120
Yeah, they're small enough to fit in your sack.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.120
I say to the fells,

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.120
Tom,

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.120
Maggie.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120
Bonnie.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.120
Bonnie.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.120
Little fell.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.120
Sorry about your home. Good luck.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.120
We may be back to help you out.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.120
But I think the best thing we can do for you

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.120
is get our colleague away from your little boy

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120
while he's still unconscious because he's mixed up.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.120
He thinks your kid is possessed.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.120
Well, we can handle him.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.120
Well, don't handle him.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.120
Well...

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.120
He's only mad because there's been so many shenanigans.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:40.120
We just, you know, attempted murder.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.120
House just got burned down.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.120
But he was doing it because his church was under attack.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.120
You believe me, the people that are responsible

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.120
for your woes mostly,

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.120
if they were here,

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.120
they wouldn't be tied up and they wouldn't be having this conversation.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.120
It was self-defense. He feared for his life.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.120
Well, okay, touchy.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.120
I'm not saying he did a good thing.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.120
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve retribution.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.120
I'm just saying when he wakes up,

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.120
I'd like him to be at the church

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.120
because I still want to talk to him about stuff

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.120
and I don't want him to kill your kid

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.120
and I don't want you to kill him before that.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.120
Carlos, do you think there's a chance that maybe he's pissed off

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.120
because Tom just admitted

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.120
that he stole all of these relics from the church?

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.120
Maybe he's mad about what these relics mean to the church.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120
Why would I be mad about the fact

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.120
someone was trying to murder my family

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.120
and burn down my house? That doesn't make any sense.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.120
Why did you steal these relics from the first place?

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.120
Because we're poor. I haven't been producing stuff with my farm.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.120
The church is supposed to help. They don't do shit.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.120
Who are you going to be selling these relics to?

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120
Where's the market for his church relics?

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120
There was a merchant who was coming by,

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.120
but that plot threat didn't get explored.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.120
Tom, you should have been here weeks ago.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.120
Like I said at the top, Tom,

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.120
we're going to take the prior away,

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120
take him to the church,

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.120
so when he wakes up, your kid can be safe

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120
and we'll send whatever help we can.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.120
And then he'll just go back to terrorizing the town

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.120
and being a dick?

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.120
No, he won't. He's going to be in big trouble.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.120
He lost his whole church. Believe me,

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.120
he's going to be the tomfell of priors.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.120
Great.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.120
I examined the priors body and clothes

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.120
to see if he's holding anything

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.120
that might be of value or interest.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.120
He has the holy symbol of the church,

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120
just like a lot of the clerics have.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.120
He doesn't have any idea or any money on him.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.120
He's not really wearing very much clothes.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.120
He's kind of hastily dressed.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.120
It's not his formal attire in any sense.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.120
So it's kind of like he just came out at night with a sword.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.120
You got a wheelbarrow or something, Tom?

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.120
Yeah, sure.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.120
Let's put the prior in a wheelbarrow

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.120
and cart him back to the church.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120
Take those relics, take the prior back.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120
We'll do a debrief.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.120
I like that.

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.120
I guess we'll follow you.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.120
The fellow family said that?

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.120
No, you guys got a house to reconstruct.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.120
Why would you want to follow us?

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.120
The guy wants to kill your kid.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.120
The church shelters people in need, theoretically.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.120
Yeah, let's all go along.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.120
Okay, cool.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.120
Okay, that makes sense.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.120
Fair enough, Tom.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120
All right.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.120
I take some water out of my little water skin thing

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.120
and I splash it on the prior's face

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.120
and I wake him up.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.120
We should talk to this guy and see if he's cooled out a little bit now.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.120
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.120
All right, you wake him up.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.120
What?

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.120
Hey, we got a job to do.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120
There's evil afoot.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.120
What's the job?

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.120
What's your first item on your to-do list?

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.120
Kill the unclean.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.120
Right, but the unclean of, like, they left.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.120
No, they're right here, among us.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.120
The fellow family, they're just dirty, grubby people.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.120
They're not the real problem.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.120
Your church was infiltrated by horrible evil.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.120
I don't know what you're talking about and you're dumb.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.120
Why do you think the whole family's unclean?

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.120
Yeah, they're protecting a fucking demon child.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.120
Well, we released that demon. The demon was expelled.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.120
That sounds like lies that a demon might say.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.120
So now the demon's in us?

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.120
I don't know.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.120
This guy's just a fucking loony, Tim.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.120
I don't know what to believe.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.120
You're just saying that you got rid of a demon

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.120
when I could see it clearly inside this child?

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.120
You can see it.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.120
Yeah, he's evil. Look at him. He's a piece of shit.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.120
Well, if you're such a hot-shot cleric, are you a cleric?

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.120
No, not by trade.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.120
But you're a holy man.

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.120
Yes.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.120
Then why don't you show us, what would you suggest doing

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.120
to get this demon out of this child?

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.120
I think the sword's in the house.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.120
You want to kill the child?

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120
Yeah.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120
That's what the Church of the Silver Flame does.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.120
We purge evil.

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.120
By killing children?

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.120
You don't, you know, bathe it into cleanly,

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120
like, into goodness.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.120
You kill it. You burn it.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.120
You're just choosing to not believe us when we tell you

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.120
that we've already dealt with this situation

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120
when you weren't here.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.120
You're saying that you're confused,

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.120
but at the same time, you're saying that you know

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.120
exactly what's going on.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.120
Right. You're outsiders who came snooping into our business.

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.120
You don't know our ways or what's going on.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.120
You don't know the score.

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.120
I'm saying that there's evil afoot. I see it.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.120
I guarantee you one thing.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.120
We didn't cause your problems here in this town.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.120
You were on a track to destruction.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.120
You had vampires in your basement.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.120
The Fells had a demon that we released.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.120
You are late to the ballgame

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.120
and you're hogging all the hot dogs.

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.120
I high-five Carlos for that.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.120
By the church bylaws, I am invoking emergency mutiny.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.120
Rule number three, subsection seven.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:12.120
If the prior of a church is demonstrating

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.120
an inability to serve his office,

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.120
he will be bound and put in a wheelbarrow

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:22.120
and the next highest ranking church official

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.120
in the vicinity will take over his duties

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120
until further notice.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120
It's called the 25th Amendment.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120
Oh.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.120
Well, who's the next ranking church official?

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.120
That would be me.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120
Oh.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120
Well, show me your...

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.120
How do we know that's true?

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120
Well, I mean, all that...

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.120
I mean, all that bylaw sounded improvised.

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:43.120
Yeah.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.120
Hey, a prior, do you know a church member

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.120
of your congregation named Arden?

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.120
Yeah.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.120
Do you know that she's a vampire mist right now?

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.120
What?

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.120
Yeah.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.120
She's a vampire that was doing crazy blood magic

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.120
down in your basement in the sanctuary

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120
and we went down there, kicked a bunch of ass,

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.120
but she, you know, weanied out by turning into a mist

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.120
like a piece of vampire shit

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120
and she boned out and now we're looking for her.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.120
So you've been harboring vampire mist ladies

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.120
the whole time and like, what's her deal?

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.120
That's some fucking conspiracy bullshit.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.120
Vampires and demons have nothing to do with each other.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.120
Why would there be a demon-possessed child

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.120
if there was vampires in the church?

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.120
That's what we're trying to find out.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.120
Oh, okay.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.120
All we know is you run a bad church, brother.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.120
Like, you ain't on your shit.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.120
You called me dumb. You're dumb.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.120
You guys are peeing and barrels and keeping it.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.120
Yeah.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.120
Yeah, we found your pee barrels.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.120
We found your pee barrels.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.120
Guess what? Vampires are throwing them at people

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.120
like our friend Diary got covered in pee.

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.120
That stuff's important.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.120
Why do you keep the pee?

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.120
It's for laundry.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120
You wash your clothes in pee?

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.120
Well, kind of, yeah.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.120
So how do you know when you pee your pants?

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.120
What happens when you pee your pants?

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.120
You go, great, now I don't have to laundry?

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120
It's not that simple. It's a process.

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.120
It's a multi-step process.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.120
I'll show you how to do it.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.120
You can accept that much nuance in piss clothes,

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.120
but you can't accept that maybe we know

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.120
we're talking about a little bit with the demon shine.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120
I'm starting to accept that that may be the case,

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.120
but I'm still confused about this whole vampire thing.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.120
Do you know that the sanctuary was exploded

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.120
by a giant explosion and the whole thing is rubble now?

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.120
What?

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.120
I'm wheeling you back to your church.

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.120
Yeah, that's what's happening.

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.120
Come on, fellow family.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.120
We all go back to the church.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.120
All right, yeah, no, you had been.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.120
You're there at the church.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.120
What do you do?

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.120
Patience is there.

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.120
Also, he was with you the whole time.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:41.120
I want to keep wheeling the prior to the hatch

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.120
where the site of egress from the room.

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:50.120
You can't get there with the wheelbarrow

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.120
because it's like a ruined wreck,

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.120
like it's a pile of blocks.

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.120
It became a quarter of a wall.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.120
You can get to that area,

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.120
but not like you have to climb and clamber.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.120
Stand the prior up.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.120
Let's undo his feet but not his hands

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.120
and walk him over the rubble to the site.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.120
You do that.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.120
You understand why I have your hands bound still, sir?

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.120
Yeah.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.120
You do?

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.120
No.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.120
You're threatening the life of an innocent child.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.120
Right.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.120
I'm not doing it because I think that you're a bad person.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.120
I'm trying to protect the innocent.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:28.120
Well, keep an eye on that kid.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.120
Everyone keeps an eye on kids by default.

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120
They're adorable.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120
Okay.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.120
Here we go again.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.120
It's fucking all going to jail.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.120
I don't know how I got this reputation.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:45.120
You keep talking about beautiful, sexy children

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.120
and wanting to smash them.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.120
All right.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.120
So where are you headed to the hatch?

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.120
Yeah.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.120
All right.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.120
You do that.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.120
You open the secret door and he's like,

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.120
yeah, this is the piss basement.

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.120
Yeah.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.120
I don't know about this place.

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.120
Go down there.

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.120
Okay.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.120
My hands are tied.

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:07.120
Well, I'll drop you down.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.120
That sounds painful.

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.120
You go down first.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.120
I'll kind of hand him down to you down the ladder.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120
All right.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.120
If we undo your hands, are you going to be a bad person?

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.120
No.

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.120
Are you lying?

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.120
No.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.120
I'm telling you.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.120
I sense bad question.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120
Sir.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:31.120
If I untie your hands and you try to harm any of the fellow

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.120
family, I have, I'm telling you right now,

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:40.120
I have no choice but to intercede like with extreme

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120
prejudice.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.120
Okay.

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:43.120
Okay.

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.120
How extreme.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:52.120
I undo his hands.

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:57.120
He, he like, he like, you know, if he feels his wrists

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.120
and then he slaps you.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.120
Slaps me?

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.120
Yeah.

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.120
I take it.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.120
Yeah.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.120
That's what, like, that's what he didn't want to happen.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.120
Like he was trying to bait you.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.120
Right.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.120
Yeah.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.120
I say, see?

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.120
Yeah.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.120
Yeah.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.120
Yeah.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.120
I can take a slap, can't I?

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.120
I go up and I slap Carlos just to prove that point.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.120
He's really confused.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.120
He's like, what the fuck?

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.120
Yeah.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.120
I like getting slapped.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.120
Brings me closer to the silver flame.

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.120
I give him like a Steve McQueen, like Ali McGrath slap in the

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.120
getaway.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.120
The forehand, backhand, forehand one.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.120
Who do you hit?

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.120
Carlos.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.120
I'm just showing how much he likes to get slapped.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:44.120
I'm showing those guys, he's like the Hulk.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.120
Like the more you slap him, the more he focuses his rage.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.120
All right.

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.120
He's growing unnerved.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.120
All right.

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:55.120
Now climb down that ladder and check out your piss basement.

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.120
All right.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.120
He climbs down there.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.120
It's all, it's all just collapsed.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.120
There's like, you know.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.120
Yeah.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.120
Well, it's not like a fucking God eraser.

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.120
And like, like, like, like, so some shit collapsed.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.120
There's still evidence of horrific demonic bullshit.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.120
Can we still see the blood all over the table and the altar

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:17.120
kind of thing?

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.120
Yeah.

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.120
Well, not so much.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.120
All that stuff has collapsed.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.120
Are there sanctuaries falling on it?

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.120
Are there the corpses of those, of those blood bugans?

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.120
You can see bits of corpses, like a couple limbs, like coming out of the wreckage and

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.120
stuff.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.120
I walk over and I, and I take one of the, like, like body parts of a clearly mutated

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.120
thing and show this to the prior.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.120
All right.

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.120
It just like, it just like sluffs off of the body.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.120
Like it's not really heavily attached.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.120
And I go, look at this.

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.120
Is this normal to you?

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.120
Is this regular church basement, pee basement kind of activities?

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.120
No.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:54.120
You feel, you probably feel pretty stupid now telling us that we don't know what we're

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.120
talking about.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.120
Yes.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.120
Yeah.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.120
I take that book that says how to, what to do when your church is under attack.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.120
All right.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.120
I said, did you even read this?

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.120
Yeah.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120
Did you?

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.120
Yeah, I did.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.120
Oh shit.

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.120
I don't think you did though, but you could lie.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.120
That's fine.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.120
That's me the GM saying.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.120
When I opened it, the binding cracks like fucking thunder.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.120
That's a fucking lie.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120
Okay.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.120
You're right.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.120
It is.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.120
Okay.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120
Why would you do that?

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.120
Why would I lie?

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.120
Yeah.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.120
I don't know.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.120
I just think it's fucked up that you read this book and then let your church be under

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120
attack.

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.120
I was trying to help.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.120
Yeah.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.120
That's fine.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.120
And failure is fine too.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.120
But then when you find out you failed, you don't take it out on neighbor kids.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120
That's probably true.

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:41.120
Prior, do you know, by the way, where do we leave stiff and weighing the little girls?

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120
Are they still with us?

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.120
They're, yeah, they were with you too.

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.120
So they're here too.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.120
Okay.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.120
Prior, do you know these little children?

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.120
Yeah.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.120
Yeah.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.120
Do you know where they came from?

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.120
Because they don't seem to have any memory of their families or their, you know, their

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.120
whereabouts.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.120
No.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.120
They were found on the church doorstep.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120
And do you know Arden?

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120
Yeah.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.120
Do you know where we could find?

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120
Like where does she live?

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120
Where is she from?

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120
Well, she stayed at the church.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120
We don't know where she's from.

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.120
Convenient.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.120
She's from the church.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120
You know, like you guys.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.120
Where do you think all your church people are?

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.120
Dead.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120
What do you think?

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.120
They're under rubble?

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.120
Yeah.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.120
Well, okay.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.120
So.

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.120
Okay.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120
Yeah.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:25.120
I'm kind of talking about circles here.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.120
All right.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.120
All right.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120
So we've reached a point of agreement here.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:31.120
You agree that your church got infiltrated by Boogans.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.120
Yeah.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.120
It's confusing.

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.120
We need to find Arden.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.120
Shit.

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.120
Well, what do you, what should I do?

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.120
Tell us about her.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.120
Hmm.

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.120
She liked the church.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120
And she liked talking to people.

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.120
And she liked prayer.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120
She likes fire.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.120
Ooh.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.120
That's normal for the church.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.120
Right.

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.120
She never said where she was from?

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120
No.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.120
We never really asked.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.120
We're not very social.

01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:14.120
Why are people in your church turning into vampires and doing cow blood magic in a pee room?

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.120
I don't know.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:20.120
It's possible, I suppose, that she was a vampire before she came to our church.

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.120
I think we need to notify the higher ups.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.120
Yeah.

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.120
No.

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.120
I mean, what, didn't she get sent here on some sort of mission that would then involve

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.120
you like reporting back to the people that sent you on a mission?

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120
Yeah.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.120
Yeah.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.120
I was kind of putting it off.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.120
I think, I think we need to fill them in.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.120
How do we, we got a table talk.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.120
How do we go about reconnecting with our higher ups?

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.120
Well, you could like send them a letter where you could like go in person.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:38:01.120
I say we take the prior and passions and go back with these relics and some evidence

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.120
of what we've done and touch base back home.

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.120
Yeah.

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.120
That sounds like a good idea.

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120
Yeah.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.120
We still got our wagon with those horses.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120
This has been like a day, two days.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120
How long have you been here in this town?

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.120
I think two days.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.120
I hope our horses aren't dead because we just kind of left them behind that barn.

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120
Right.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120
The barn, yeah.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.120
The barn wasn't attached to the fell house.

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.120
It was just nearby.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.120
Okay.

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.120
It's probably not.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.120
All right.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.120
We take the prior.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.120
We take passions and we head back to the church, to touch base.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120
Should we take Stiffen Wang?

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.120
I mean, I know what your answer is going to be.

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.120
They're orphans.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.120
Okay.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.120
We take the children too.

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.120
We take Stiffen Wang.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.120
I mean, they're church orphans.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.120
The priors got a lot of cleaning up to do.

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.120
When you get to them.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.120
We're taking him.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.120
Yeah.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.120
The fells have a lot of cleaning up to do.

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.120
We'll leave them be.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120
They'll be safe now.

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.120
Should we take passions or should we leave passions to clean up?

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120
Or should we take passions with us?

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.120
Okay.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.120
Passions.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.120
And the prior.

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.120
Stiff.

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.120
Stiff.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.120
Wang.

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.120
Let's everybody get in.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.120
No fells.

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.120
No fells.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.120
All right.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120
Take any material you need from the church and the reparation of your home.

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.120
You think we're going to make it into a community center?

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.120
Not a reference.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.120
Just like, you know, the building.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.120
It's interesting.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.120
A secular kind of approach.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120
Obviously religion has failed this community.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.120
Right.

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.120
Perhaps civic mindedness can take its place.

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.120
Perhaps.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.120
I like your style, Tom.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.120
Yeah, man.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:40.120
I think the next time I see you, you're going to be called Tom Rose.

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.120
Because you're Jewish, but like Rose, like he rose up.

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.120
Right.

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.120
Right.

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:47.120
All right.

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:52.120
Away back to our church elders.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.120
All right.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.120
We're so bad at this.

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120
So you're standing.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.120
I can't believe we leveled up in the last one.

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.120
All we did was yell a lot and pull a guy's pants down.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.120
I think if you're level one and you hit a little girl in the face, you just jumped to level

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120
two.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120
We started at level two.

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.120
He gave us level two.

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.120
But now we're level three.

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.120
Right.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.120
Well, you're pretty hard.

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.120
So you're still in the church.

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.120
You're still in the church.

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120
And what do you call it?

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.120
Diarrhea, Jr.

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.120
He looks bad.

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.120
He looks not good.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.120
He's like sweaty.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.120
Oh, boy.

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.120
He looks really sick.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120
Uh-oh.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.120
He falls down.

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120
All right.

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.120
I...

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.120
Shit.

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120
Okay.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.120
Shit.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120
Well, I don't...

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.120
I still have the same old spells.

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.120
I can't detect.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.120
Right, yeah.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.120
Do you want to...

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.120
Hey, prior, you said you had eyes that can see this shit.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.120
Is he succumbing to the pneumonia?

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.120
Or did Arden the Mist vampire go into him?

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.120
I think that and other things.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:04.120
I think he might have a demon in him.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.120
He also looks like he has mummy rot.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.120
DJ's got mummy rot and a demon and vampire mist.

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.120
Oh, no.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.120
Jesus.

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.120
That's my prognosis.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.120
Do you have any spells, Carlos, to help us out or to check him out?

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:31.120
No, I mean, I would be using the offensive load out from when I was level two and all I have left is...

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.120
I use perception on him to see what's going on with him.

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.120
Eleven.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.120
Oh, man.

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:48.120
You can see that his skin is pale in a trackable pattern and it seems to go underneath his clothes.

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.120
Fuck.

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.120
It's like a gradient.

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.120
He's getting progressively more pale underneath his clothes.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120
All right.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.120
Let's get his clothes off.

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.120
We're going to tend to this.

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120
This is an emergency.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.120
All right.

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.120
You see the...

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:08.120
You rip off his shirt and you see on his chest there's like a keyhole and it's like the source of all this paleness.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.120
It's like...

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.120
Oh, the hole above his heart.

01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.120
Yeah.

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.120
I remember something about this.

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120
It happened.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.120
From our backstory.

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120
I look...

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.120
Is one of those relics I took a key?

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.120
No.

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.120
Shit.

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:31.120
He's got... he's slowly dying or slowly being taken over by something.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.120
Yeah.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.120
Right?

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.120
Well, who are you asking?

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.120
You, Spencer.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.120
No, I'm not telling you anything.

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:40.120
Oh, I'm using my perception of watching what's happening here.

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120
Is my knowledge of our...

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.120
He just seems sick.

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.120
I have knowledge, you know, Arcana.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120
I got it.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:54.120
He seems like he has got some sort of crazy magical, like some sort of curse-related magic.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120
Like bad juju magic.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.120
We got to get him back to the church then, probably.

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120
Right?

01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120
Right.

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.120
This isn't like something that happened to him.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.120
This is something that's part of his...

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.120
I remember...

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.120
I have a past with him.

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.120
I remember something about this keyhole in his chest.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.120
You don't remember very much about it, but yes.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.120
But the reason why he's unconscious is he got knocked out by one of the girls, right?

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120
Well, he came back.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.120
He got re-conscious after it.

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.120
Oh, so he's been conscious now.

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120
He's just started to look sick.

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120
Yeah.

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120
Okay.

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.120
Let's get to the wagon and just get him back.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.120
Let's get him home, yeah.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.120
We can't do anything for him.

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120
Absolutely.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.120
All right.

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.120
And we're all coming, right?

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.120
We should maybe get a bigger wagon.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.120
Yeah.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.120
Do you have another wagon here, prior?

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.120
I'll find one.

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.120
Okay, great.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.120
Or stiff and wang.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:48.120
It could be adopted by the fells, and then we don't need a bigger wagon.

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.120
I mean, that's going to be a lot of paperwork.

01:43:53.120 --> 01:44:00.120
Okay, we take the wagon by the fells house and say, hey, do you guys want to take care

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.120
of these little girls?

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.120
The fells aren't there.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.120
Wait, where are they?

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.120
At the church.

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.120
They're with us.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.120
Yep.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.120
We asked them right now.

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.120
Okay.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.120
Hey, do you want to take care of these little girls?

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.120
We don't have room in the wagon.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.120
Sure, why not?

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.120
Let's just live at the church that we're calling the community center now.

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120
Fantastic.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.120
All right.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.120
We've got a church business.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.120
Stiff, wang, Tom, Bonnie, Gary.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.120
Cliff.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120
Cliff.

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.120
It's been real.

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.120
It's been fun.

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:31.120
But it has been real fun.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:35.120
And we pop in our wagon with Patchens and the Pryor.

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.120
And I take one of those.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.120
I think that one, like the mutant boogity arm that I took off.

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.120
I keep that as evidence to show people back home what's going on.

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:44.120
All right.

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.120
Hyah!

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.120
Hyah!

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120
Hyah, indeed.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.120
You're traveling, you're traveling back to the home office.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.120
Oh, man.

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.120
It's mostly uneventful until nightfall.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:00.120
It's been a, let's say it's been a day of travel so you can reset your spells if you

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120
want.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120
We sleep and reset our spells.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.120
All right.

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.120
All right.

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.120
I'm going to pick a load out.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120
Pick a load out, baby.

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.120
Pick a load out.

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.120
Pick a load for me.

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.120
Pick a load for free.

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.120
Pick a load out, Carlos.

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:17.120
And put your spell right on, right on.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.120
You put the spell right on me.

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:26.120
But at night while you're making camp and sleeping and being like blissfully unaware

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.120
and stuff, attacks happen.

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.120
You get attacked.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.120
What?

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.120
Oh, boy.

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.120
It's bad news.

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.560
You're awoken by the sounds of screaming.

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560
It's the Pryor.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.200
It's screaming.

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:43.800
There's a, there's, they look like banditos.

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.440
They're surrounding your encampment.

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:52.120
I have picked the offensive load out to see, you know.

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.120
Banditos.

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.120
All right.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120
Wow.

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.120
Wow.

01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.120
There's banditos and me with my offensive load out.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.240
Gentlemen.

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:09.440
You look like people who have lost your way spiritually.

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:13.440
Sure, yeah.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:15.440
That can be dangerous.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.440
Yeah.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.600
For, for everybody involved.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.600
We have nothing to offer you.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.920
Why don't you just go on your way?

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.120
We are but simple men of a cloth.

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:25.720
The church, the silver flame.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.160
Oh, you got something all right.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.160
Yeah.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.680
I'm going to look at you with like a knowing look.

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.920
I give him a knowing look back and say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.920
We do got something.

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.160
We got a fucking fist to put up your butt.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.160
All right.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:48.120
Well, you know, they got weapons and you guys don't have weapons right now because like

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120
you're asleep.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.120
So do you want to like grab your weapons?

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.600
What do you want to have?

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.360
I always sleep near my chelély.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.320
So I have near your weapons, but it's like, you know, now we're in like combat time kind

01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.320
of so.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.320
I run to my weapons.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.320
Oh, of course.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320
Yeah.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320
Who would?

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320
All right.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.320
Well, they attack you guys then.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320
All right.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:11.320
Well, I think they're going to regret this.

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.320
All right.

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.760
Well, they might.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:21.080
So the ones in back, you see about six of them.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.080
That's all you can see.

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:26.080
But you know, you're just waking up and it's hard to say they shoot arrows, but most of

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.080
the arrows miss.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.760
The only one hits hits Chad for six damage.

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.760
God damn it.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.760
You take an arrow in the shoulder.

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.240
All right.

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.800
I'm using my, let's see.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.920
I'm going to use my defensive load on this one and I, and I cure my light wounds.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:47.920
Oh, guy.

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.240
Sorry.

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.240
You cure five wounds.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.400
How much damage do you take?

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.400
Six.

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.400
Six.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.400
Oh boy.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.400
Yeah.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.400
Yeah.

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:04.080
And I, I take the arrow out and I, and I put it between my fingers and make it like a middle

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:07.000
finger and hold it up like that.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.200
You do that.

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:14.680
And I just fucking hold that like, like that's that, like that was enough for now.

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.680
Is it my turn?

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.680
No, it's Dan.

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:21.080
I know your name.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.560
Can I ask you a quick question about those, those, that, that my ability to convert any

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:32.680
spell of a certain level to a healing spell, does that, so then does that also count for

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.680
level two spells?

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.680
Yeah.

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.680
Okay.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.680
So it keeps going beyond that too.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.680
Yeah.

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.680
That's why I don't have healed spells.

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.680
Right.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.680
I don't.

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.680
Yeah.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.680
I don't put them in any of the loadouts for that reason.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.560
And so it's a level one and level two spells that I, that can be turned into that.

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.560
Okay.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.560
Well, gentlemen, I got to tell you.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:49:05.280
There, salvation takes many forms, and it's about to take the form of a giant ant, summon

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280
giant ant.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.280
All right.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280
Yeah.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.480
Is that a level one or a level two giant?

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480
Level two.

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.480
Okay.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.480
How many level ones and twos do we get?

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480
Three.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480
Three apiece?

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.800
That's not a full question.

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.360
Okay, how many level ones do I get a day?

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.360
Three.

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.360
Okay.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360
Great.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360
And level twos?

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360
Two.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360
Okay.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360
All right.

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360
Use summon a giant ant.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.360
It looks really frenzied and angry.

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.360
It's antennae are waving.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.360
Oh boy.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.200
What do you want it to do?

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200
Attack the banditos.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.480
That makes sense.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.640
All right.

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.280
It misses.

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.840
It lunges at the bandito, but he rolls out of the way.

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.800
The banditos, they continue their onslaught.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:59.760
They close in and they seem to be closing in surrounding pachens and diarrhea, who are

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.320
sleeping nearby each other and both seemingly unconscious even during the melee.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.680
Hey, leave them alone.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.680
They don't.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:15.840
You guys don't have some kind of bandito code?

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.200
What?

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.120
You don't have a bandito code?

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.960
I don't know what you're talking about, Stab.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.640
All right.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.480
You're talking to banditos with stabbing weapons.

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.480
Yeah.

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.720
Diarrhea and pachens get stabbed.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.320
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.120
Diarrhea takes much worse of a stabbing and pachens screams and bolts up right awake.

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.160
This is awful.

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.000
Oh yeah.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.560
This isn't my turn.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.680
Now it's the priors turn.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:52.680
Is he tied up?

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.680
No, no.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.000
He's part of the gang now.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
He runs away.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
What's fucking?

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.360
We don't need that guy.

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.160
The ship sails faster without the anchor, Carlos.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160
All right.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.640
It's Jeff's turn now.

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.680
Is there vegetation where we are right now?

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680
Oh yeah.

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.680
Well then, guess what everybody?

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.680
Entangle.

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.680
Oh man.

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.680
It's great.

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:25.000
All the plants nearby, they start coming alive, wriggling and waving and entangling.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.680
They're grabbing the banditos.

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.680
Oh man.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.080
How many do they grab?

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:34.880
One, two, three.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:35.880
All right.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.320
They get three of the banditos.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.320
They're caught fast.

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.160
The rest of them are like just hacking at the bushes and trying to stay from being entangled.

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:50.080
They're kind of like being, what do you call it, occupied by the vines and stuff.

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.840
It's taken their attentions away.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:52.840
All right, Carlos.

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.320
I got distracted by plant life.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:03.040
Sounds like a good time to inflict light wounds.

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.960
Can I make a pitch?

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.440
Inflict heavy wounds.

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:10.960
Well, I don't know how to do that yet.

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.640
I mean, you have a weapon.

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:16.240
I'm still working my way up the bridge.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.240
Okay.

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.240
All right.

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.240
Starting light.

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.240
All right.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:26.720
You grab one of the guy's arms, his sword-wielding arm, and it shrivels in skinny fies like it's

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:29.080
withering before your very eyes.

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.680
Like a big part of his body just kind of shrivels up like a husk.

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.680
Nice.

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:41.120
And that was a light wound.

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.120
All right.

01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.120
The banditos do stuff.

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:44.120
What about my aunt, though?

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.120
Not to be too much of an expert.

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.920
No, that's a good call.

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:47.920
I forgot.

01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.920
He misses again.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.920
That's, sorry.

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:54.040
I'm going to switch dice, how about?

01:52:54.040 --> 01:53:00.280
I feel like I accidentally summoned like a regular aunt, like a woman that married my

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:07.240
uncle, just swinging a rolling pin.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.240
All right.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.200
The withered guy, he starts making an exit.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.200
He's like trying to escape.

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:19.400
The other two, they kind of, or not the other two, the other banditos, they kind of split

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.400
their forces.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.280
One of them continues, or half of them like continued, they're like grab it, patch it and

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.000
stabbing them and like dragging them away.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.440
And the other ones are turning to fight you guys.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.000
These guys are such bad people.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.840
So they don't actually hurt patchings as far as you can tell.

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.000
But they're trying to drag them off?

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Yeah, they are.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
But they are stabbing at you guys.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Oh, fucking it.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
They only hit you.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.240
They hit you each for two damage.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.160
So that's their turns.

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.760
The prior is still gone.

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.240
A quick question, because that's a new spell for me.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:59.160
If I want to cast a bark skin and harden my skin, is that something I do prior to an

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.080
attack or during an attack?

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:04.880
Well, it's a standard action, so you cast it whenever, but it lasts for like a minute.

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:05.880
So probably do it before.

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.380
Okay, I don't do it.

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.880
I've never seen that before.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:09.880
All right.

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:10.880
Wait, I got tree shape.

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.880
I turn into a tree?

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:12.880
Yeah.

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.880
That'll be helpful.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.000
I'm not doing that.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.800
That's just good to have in the bag.

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.800
Oh, yeah.

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.640
Well, I'm just attacking nearest Bandito with Morningstar.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.640
I think it's Jester.

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.640
Oh.

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.640
Hey, Carlos, start hitting people like they're little girls.

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.560
Man, that's how you smashed that little girl in the face?

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.720
We need to be on the same side.

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:40.320
This couldn't be more metaphorical.

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:43.680
Who cares who voted for Bernie and who voted for Hillary?

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.560
Let's just beat the Banditos.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560
Wow.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.560
Bad hombres.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.680
Jeff, what are you doing?

01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.360
I vote for Bernie.

01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.040
Firebolt.

01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:56.520
Firebolt 101.

01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:02.280
Feel the burn.

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:06.320
All right.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.440
You catch one of them on fire.

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.280
He's got his fire.

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:11.280
He's on fire.

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.280
He's running around on fire.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.280
Yeah.

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.280
Oh, boy.

01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:18.280
We should have just ended down that laugh.

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:21.080
No, we got to beat these Banditos.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:26.600
Yeah, we got one more minute or two, so Carlos, lay it down.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.600
Morningstar.

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.600
On the guy who stabbed Patchens.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:40.760
All right, you miss.

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.160
That makes up my aunt's turn, and his victories will be mine.

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.400
What is he going to do?

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.400
The aunt?

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.400
Yeah.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:49.400
He's just attacking Banditos.

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400
I mean, he's an aunt.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.400
All right.

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.400
How big is his aunt, by the way?

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.400
What are we talking?

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.400
It's a giant aunt.

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:55.400
Yeah.

01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.400
It could be like the size of a bumblebee.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.640
It's as big as a shoe.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.720
It doesn't take much for an aunt to be giant, does it?

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.720
How big an aunt are we looking at right now?

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:07.720
I don't know.

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:10.720
Let's say like the size of a mule.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.720
Oh, shit.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720
That's a big aunt.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720
That's a big aunt.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720
It's thrashing around.

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.720
All right.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.720
Get a muley.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.720
He misses again.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720
He misses again.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.720
He misses again.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720
I'm so sorry.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:22.720
He misses again.

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.720
Every time, like what are the odds of rolling the same number on a dice three times?

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:31.120
Well, it's 80,000.

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120
Who cares?

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.120
All right.

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.800
Well, now it's my turn.

01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:35.800
All right.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.400
The Banditos, they stab Patchen's a couple more times.

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400
She don't.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400
Patchen's.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.200
They're just so cowardly.

01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.440
You see the ones that don't stab him.

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.920
They take everything.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:51.120
They take his clothes off, they like strip his clothes off and then they like strip him

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120
down naked.

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.120
Poor Patchen's.

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.680
All he did was back us up, you know, like it's just feel awful for him.

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.240
All right.

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.920
Those guys, their tasks completed.

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:03.920
They bone out.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.920
What?

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:05.920
They just stole Patchen's and left?

01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.920
Well, no.

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:07.920
They leave him bleeding on the floor.

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.920
They took his clothes?

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:09.920
Yeah.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:17.120
So these are just, just really just Banditos who needed clothes.

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.920
Did they get the relics?

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:19.920
No, no.

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:20.920
Not yet.

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920
You should have clothes?

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.920
Yeah.

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.800
There's still, there's still a couple that are fighting you, but those ones that were

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:28.680
going after Patchen's are kind of boning out.

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.720
We could have had some kind of drive for you guys.

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.920
We're a church and you're stealing clothes from us.

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:41.360
It's like robbing the toys for Tott's barrel.

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.920
It's for Tott's already.

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.920
All right, I attack with my morning star.

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.920
All right.

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.920
Someone.

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.920
Oh man.

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.040
You blast him in the head and he goes down.

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.520
You see his, his helmet is bent.

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.520
He's wearing a helmet.

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.520
This guy.

01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.520
He's the only one.

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:00.920
I walk over and I take his clothes off and I put him on Patchen's.

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.920
Okay.

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:06.920
Oh yeah.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:14.920
Let's hear it for Spencer Crittenden and everybody.

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:21.920
It's here for Kevin Day, Sarah Hill, Harry Foster on Sound Tonight, church.

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.920
Who else we got?

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920
Kris Boruff.

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:27.920
But I already say Kevin Day.

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:29.920
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.920
I'm Jared Harmon.

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:32.920
Thank you so much for coming.

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:33.920
You're mayor.

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.920
Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:57.920
Make it bendy though.

01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920
Did you get any of that?

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:05.920
It's a good show.
