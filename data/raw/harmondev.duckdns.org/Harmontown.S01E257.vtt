like four or five there had to be some reason\n\n20:19.840 --> 20:24.080\nI don't know I think a lot of lift drivers have little phone chargers there\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:27.880\nwas a guy who made me take my foot off his seat like which I thought it was so\n\n20:27.880 --> 20:31.240\nweird because it was a lift and not an Uber it was like a fucking Acura or\n\n20:31.240 --> 20:34.480\nsomething and he was like could you put lower your foot from my seat and I was\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:38.640\nlike what was your foot was like you're crossing your leg and it was like sit on\n\n20:38.640 --> 20:42.680\nmy foot you know like you're kind of sometimes isn't that really uncomfortable\n\n20:42.680 --> 20:47.960\nno I mean what I think it's just I think I'm compensating maybe for like 40\n\n20:47.960 --> 20:52.000\nyears of a wallet I don't know I don't know why it is so I like to tuck my\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.320\nlittle footsie under when he's one of my butt cheeks sometimes and he said get\n\n20:55.320 --> 21:00.520\nyour get your street pavement foot off of my anyways I'm sorry sorry I take sorry\n\n21:00.520 --> 21:04.960\nI take Uber sometimes but but the the the this is thing where they'll go they'll\n\n21:04.960 --> 21:07.760\ndrop you off and then they'll give you a business card they'll try to like\n\n21:07.760 --> 21:12.240\nindoctrinate you into their own like private business like they're like oh\n\n21:12.240 --> 21:18.160\ntake my card so like if you want to if you want to get a ride for me again\n\n21:18.160 --> 21:24.440\ndon't use the service that arranges everything like take my business card\n\n21:24.440 --> 21:28.520\nof like call me on a regular phone and like what what are they how is that\n\n21:28.520 --> 21:32.760\ngonna take off I've never experienced you don't it seems like everyone's doing\n\n21:32.760 --> 21:36.480\nthat now they drop you off and they go by the way here take my card when you if\n\n21:36.480 --> 21:40.680\nyou want to get picked up like take my card like why would I there's an app that\n\n21:40.680 --> 21:45.400\nand so and I was like well I'm gonna make this guy's day I he dropped me off at\n\n21:45.400 --> 21:51.480\nthe at the shitty British restaurant here in Burbank and and he was like hey\n\n21:51.480 --> 21:54.280\nremember me I was that guy that gave you that card I'm like oh yeah yeah do you\n\n21:54.280 --> 21:57.760\nhave another card because this time actually this might work because I'm\n\n21:57.760 --> 22:01.080\ngonna eat here and then I'm gonna just be driving a couple of blocks over to\n\n22:01.080 --> 22:04.680\nthe starburns castle and he's like oh that was done no that makes no sense for\n\n22:04.680 --> 22:06.880\nme\n\n22:06.880 --> 22:11.760\nwell okay so it's

like your feelings should be very respected and taken seriously but then\n\n28:24.160 --> 28:28.160\nthere that you don't have to like you can you can acknowledge that you feel\n\n28:28.160 --> 28:31.600\nreally really sad and that could be the most important thing going on in your\n\n28:31.600 --> 28:36.680\nlife you don't have to then connect that to reality by saying like therefore I'm\n\n28:36.680 --> 28:41.000\ngonna do this or that which you know do as I say not as I do all right but you\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.080\nknow if you're young I'm saying you know you're just you're

same\n\n45:53.560 --> 45:57.040\nrole and there was some kind of studio dispute on it and they were having some\n\n45:57.040 --> 46:00.320\nkind of rivalry but who's the biggest star and I don't want

James Cagney like driving down\n\n46:09.200 --> 46:13.400\nthe street in Hollywood picking his nose in the back of his limousine and I see\n\n46:13.400 --> 46:17.720\nthe Cagney sent a poem to Bogart or vice versa I think Bogart wrote a poem and\n\n46:17.720 --> 46:23.560\nsent it to Cagney about how famous people shouldn't pick their noses like\n\n46:23.560 --> 46:28.600\nhe fucking nose pick

terrorist what's the deal with John\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.880\nSnow's thumb you know it looks like a weird fucking toe did no one else notice\n\n01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.320\nthat it was like I was trying to be like sentimental and sexy you know but\n\n01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.120\nit's like he's he has a giant fucking toe on his hand I've never noticed that\n\n01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.600\nwhat about his hairline is weird-ass hair like I you know I don't know about\n\n01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:03.040\nthat I trust your judgment there but I was looking right like the Dow Jones you\n\n01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.720\nknow I got a problem with that last episode what they never showed the\n\n01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.640\nfact that the wall just goes into a lake and you could just say they just walk\n\n01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.000\nyou could have just like like like just swung around on a rope also they\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.920\ncould have just like walked in like knee-deep water they kept saying oh but\n\n01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:25.720\nthe dead don't swim the wall goes just to the fucking water's edge and you\n\n01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:31.360\ncould just you know catch a ferry I mean it's gotta end somewhere I guess but I\n\n01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.080\nmean we did we think it went all the way around the world I just thought that\n\n01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.680\nthey kind of I thought it was on the top of a high cliff or something when it\n\n01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.280\nmeant the ocean I mean my one beef was like you know if it's something\n\n01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.840\ncollapses like that there's not just gonna be like this path it's like they\n\n01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.080\nshould have been they should have shown him like crawling over rubble being like\n\n01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.880\ngoddamn this is like a quarter of a wall yeah it's kind of what happens when\n\n01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.440\nyou collapse a wall as you have like about a quarter of a wall yeah that it\n\n01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.720\nwas convenient they like cut it off halfway and then it went all the way\n\n01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.480\ndown also that fucking ice dragon that dead ice dragon they got holes all up on\n\n01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.760\nthose wings how you gonna fly when you got holes in your wings that's where's\n\n01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.320\nthe fucking aerodynamic integrity of the flight surface well it's flying with\n\n01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.480\nmagic isn't it I mean is it magic well proud I mean probably a dragon at least\n\n01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.960\nhas some sort of magic flotation because they're a heavy thing you know you need\n\n01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.160\na huge wing to well combination also like\n\n01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.720\nzombie is him because the you know the the white walker people you know they\n\n01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.960\ngot the they don't got no muscles like some of them got like a whole skeleton\n\n01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.480\nleg and they're super missing a button like how you gonna walk around with no\n\n01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:48.520\nbut but if you can if you can make a holy winged dragon fly with your white\n\n01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.400\nwalker magic then why don't you just make a skeleton fly just make him like\n\n01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.920\nlike give him some of that dragon this is my favorite song from the movie Dumbo\n\n01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:02.840\nyeah they got the holes in the wings what was my other fucking beef of that\n\n01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:09.400\nshit there was some other so I though I just thought of that today the giant the\n\n01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.240\ngiant cultures have the giant chains and they zombified the yeah but that was a\n\n01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.800\nlot of chain man yeah they were a whole society thriving but they had him in a\n\n01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.920\ncart in the back of the goddamn fucking army oh yeah they're always ready they\n\n01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.160\nbrought all their stuff with them okay also how about this remember when they\n\n01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.200\nbring out the the the dead boogins and they're bringing them out to show\n\n01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.320\nsursy and the whole gang that there's there's dead people and the chop the guy\n\n01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.080\nand he's still crawling and kicking ass until they fucking dragon glass them but\n\n01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.920\nthen the rest of the time they fight him they go chop and they just fucking go\n\n01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.400\npoof like like they now now they live away they live a lot longer when it's a\n\n01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.960\nstory beat my my

Are you still up for that?\n\n01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120\nI can't be nailed down.\n\n01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.120\nI mean it sounds like when we did that last one\n\n01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.120\nyou were kind of going through a little bit of a crisis\n\n01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.120\nbecause you got fired off your show.\n\n01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.120\nYou seem like you're pretty down right now.\n\n01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.120\nI think maybe it's time to go out there and hit the road.\n\n01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.120\nI don't want to do a tour and be happy.\n\n01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.120\nI want to repeat the same process.\n\n01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.120\nNo, we go out and we find happiness by exploring.\n\n01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.120\nBy getting out of your comfort zone.\n\n01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.120\nIt didn't work that time.\n\n01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120\nDidn't it?\n\n01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120\nIt didn't work? I thought you were happy during that.\n\n01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120\nI think I faked a lot of that.\n\n01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120\nYeah.\n\n01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.120\nFor the movie, right?\n\n01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:45.120\nYeah. Because I knew they would sell eight copies.\n\n01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.120\nYeah, were we happy? I can't tell.\n\n01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.120\nWe were trapped.\n\n01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.120\nI avoided everybody.\n\n01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.120\nI just kept leaving and going doing my little disappearing act\n\n01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.120\nand I would go read a book and get away from everybody.\n\n01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.120\nI brought work on the road with me.\n\n01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:03.120\nI would like to do a tour again but I want to be free to enjoy it.\n\n01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.120\nWe can't fly to Europe and then get a tour bus, right?\n\n01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.120\nYeah, bands never do that.\n\n01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.120\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120\nThat's what you do. You fly to...\n\n01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.120\nThere's a lot of van travel.\n\n01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.120\nMarilyn Manson doesn't drive around on a van.\n\n01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120\nHe's got a fucking sexy tour bus.\n\n01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.120\nOkay.\n\n01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.120\nI'm saying, here's a pitch.\n\n01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.120\nWe go out with Marilyn Manson.\n\n01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.120\nChurch and I hung out with that guy. He's good fun.\n\n01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.120\nHe's a big dork. We should get him on the show.\n\n01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120\nHe's good fun.\n\n01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.120\nHe's welcome whenever he wants to come by.\n\n01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.120\nAre you going to be all pouty about it when he does?\n\n01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.120\nI don't know because I don't care.\n\n01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120\nHe'll come and everybody will be like,\n\n01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.120\nI love Marilyn Manson. I wish he would be on the show more often.\n\n01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.120\nBut I get it. You don't like me.\n\n01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.120\nStick it up your ass, you fucking herd of fucking...\n\n01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.120\nShhh.\n\n01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120\nShe turned me around. She got me.\n\n01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120\nOh, we did it!\n\n01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120\nWho was that?\n\n01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.120\nWhose laugh was that?\n\n01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.120\nThat laughter was...\n\n01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120\nThat was my mistake a little after.\n\n01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.120\nI'm somebody who could not take my bad mood seriously.\n\n01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.120\nShe was just like laughing, really entertained.\n\n01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.120\nShe felt a little sad for me.\n\n01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.120\nBut she was glad she wasn't me.\n\n01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.120\nYou know a movie I watched yesterday that does not hold up\n\n01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.120\nand I was pretty bummed out?\n\n01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.120\nSpaceballs. Spaceballs is not great.\n\n01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120\nIt's got a couple of jokes.\n\n01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.120\nThe incredible or the amazing Mr. Limpet with Don Knotts.\n\n01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.120\nI thought that was on.\n\n01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.120\nIt's not that good, man.\n\n01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.120\nI really wanted to remember that I loved that movie.\n\n01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.120\nI've never seen it.\n\n01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.120\nHe turns into a fish but also he has a superpower\n\n01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120\nthat he makes the loudest noise in the world.\n\n01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.120\nNever explains.\n\n01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.120\nHe turns into a fish?\n\n01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120\nHe's already turned into a fish, Spencer.\n\n01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.120\nDon Knotts loves fish while his friend George Stickle\n\n01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.120\nis trying to clearly fuck his wife.\n\n01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.120\nAnd they all go out to Coney Island and he loves fish so much\n\n01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120\nand he goes, I wish I were a fish.\n\n01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.120\nAnd he falls into the water and he turns into a fish.\n\n01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120\nBut he's also a fish that wears glasses\n\n01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.120\nso we remember it's Don Knotts.\n\n01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.120\nAnd we can tell him apart from the no other animated fish\n\n01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.120\nexcept for weird lady fish.\n\n01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.120\nHe almost fucks a fish in the fucking beginning of the second act.\n\n01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.120\nHe takes to that pretty quickly.\n\n01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.120\nThen he makes a weird sound.\n\n01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.120\nThen he kills all the Nazis and we win World War II.\n\n01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.120\nWell, how could that possibly be bad?\n\n01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.120\nMy childhood, I thought it was awesome but there's a lot of holes.\n\n01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.120\nThere's a lot of holes in Mr. Limbin.\n\n01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.120\nOh, boy.\n\n01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.120\nBut the admiral in that movie is the neighbor from Mr. Ed.\n\n01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.120\nSo that made me happy.\n\n01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.120\nMr. Ed's fucking great.\n\n01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120\nAll right, we're good to go.\n\n01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.120\nSpencer, you've told us that you've leveled our characters up\n\n01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.120\nbecause we've achieved such greatness\n\n01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.120\nthat we are now level three characters.\n\n01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.120\nYou've achieved such greatness.\n\n01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.120\nThere you go, level three character.\n\n01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.120\nWe fucking earned it by lighting doors on fire\n\n01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.120\nand running away from shit.\n\n01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.120\nIt's as much for me as it is for you.\n\n01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.120\nMeaning what exactly?\n\n01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120\nIt's more fun.\n\n01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120\nDoes that mean that I...\n\n01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.120\nAre my loadouts updated?\n\n01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.120\nIf they're the ones on the right, yeah.\n\n01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.120\nI mean, yes.\n\n01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120\nAll right, but we're still on the same loadout\n\n01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.120\nthat we were on last time as we haven't gone to sleep yet.\n\n01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.120\nBecause you haven't gone to sleep yet.\n\n01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.120\nOkay, I need a real refresher on this D&D.\n\n01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.120\nYou guys ready for some D&D right now?\n\n01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120\nNo.\n\n01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.120\nAre we going to do this without a diarrhea junior?\n\n01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.120\nI got it all figured out.\n\n01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.120\nOkay.\n\n01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120\nWhich is why I got John Carmen.\n\n01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.120\nIt doesn't make any sense, but Steve will hate that.\n\n01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120\nWho's John Carmen?\n\n01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120\nYou're bearing with me.\n\n01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120\nJohn Carmen is a Steve Levy looking person\n\n01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:23.120\nthat used to be Justin Rowland's assistant.\n\n01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120\nIs he here with us in person tonight?\n\n01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.120\nNo.\n\n01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.120\nIt's not for anybody here.\n\n01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120\nIt's for Steve Levy.\n\n01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.120\nHe's going to get a kick out of that and I'll be satisfied.\n\n01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.120\nOkay.\n\n01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.120\nAnd we will have burned a minute or two.\n\n01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120\nWhat about our new intern, Sammy?\n\n01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.120\nDid you see her?\n\n01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120\nShe kind of had like a Levy kind of vibe.\n\n01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.120\nOh, she's going to be running this place too.\n\n01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.120\nI'll do it.\n\n01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.120\nThank you.\n\n01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120\nIs that Sammy that said that?\n\n01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.120\nNo.\n\n01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.120\nOh, no.\n\n01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.120\nYou can't do it.\n\n01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120\nAll right.\n\n01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.120\nAll right.\n\n01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.120\nYou want to give us a recap, Spencer?\n\n01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.120\nYeah.\n\n01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.120\nPlease.\n\n01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.120\nWe had Schrab and things went kind of weird and I don't quite...\n\n01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.120\nAll I remember is that trousers were pulled down at the very end\n\n01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120\nand that was our cliffhanger.\n\n01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.120\nSo Spencer, if you will, the recap of last week's Harmontown.\n\n01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120\nIt's the one thing I didn't do.\n\n01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:17.120\nLast time on Harmontown, our heroes were...\n\n01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:21.120\nThey had just defeated or gotten away from the evil cult\n\n01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.120\nright as it collapsed, like the whole church collapsed.\n\n01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120\nOh boy.\n\n01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120\nIt was a disaster.\n\n01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.120\nThe vampire escaped in the form of a mist\n\n01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.120\nleaving our heroes high and dry in the priory\n\n01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.120\nwhere they searched for survivors.\n\n01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.120\nThere they became attacked by two little girls\n\n01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.120\nwho knocked Diarrhea Jr. unconscious.\n\n01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.120\nChad leapt into action, grabbing one of the girls\n\n01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.120\nand Carlos leapt into action,\n\n01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.120\nsmashing one of the little girls in the face.\n\n01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.120\nAfter some conversation, Patchens came back\n\n01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120\nand he needed help.\n\n01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120\nSo he took you to the fells house\n\n01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.120\nwhere the prior was burning down the house\n\n01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120\nand trying to murder the family.\n\n01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.120\nBut you stopped him.\n\n01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.120\nNow you're outside of the burning down house\n\n01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120\nwith the prior.\n\n01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.120\nHe's tied up and you don't know what's going on.\n\n01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.120\nIt's been a long night.\n\n01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.120\nThe end.\n\n01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.120\nAll right.\n\n01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.120\nWait, did you sit where...\n\n01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.120\nThe most important part was the prayer.\n\n01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.120\nYou said we're still outside the fells house with the prior.\n\n01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.120\nYeah.\n\n01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.120\nWe're just right where we left

01:34:55.120\ntalking about.\n\n01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.120\nYes.\n\n01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.120\nYeah.\n\n01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.120\nI take that book that says how to, what to do when your church is under attack.\n\n01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.120\nAll right.\n\n01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.120\nI said, did you even read this?\n\n01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.120\nYeah.\n\n01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120\nDid you?\n\n01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.120\nYeah, I did.\n\n01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.120\nOh shit.\n\n01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.120\nI don't think you did though, but you could lie.\n\n01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.120\nThat's fine.\n\n01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.120\nThat's me the GM saying.\n\n01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.120\nWhen I opened it, the binding cracks like fucking thunder.\n\n01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.120\nThat's a fucking lie.\n\n01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120\nOkay.\n\n01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.120\nYou're right.\n\n01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.120\nIt is.\n\n01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.120\nOkay.\n\n01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120\nWhy would you do that?\n\n01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.120\nWhy would I lie?\n\n01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.120\nYeah.\n\n01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.120\nI just think it's fucked up that you read this book and then let your church be under\n\n01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120\nattack.\n\n01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.120\nI was trying to help.\n\n01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.120\nYeah.\n\n01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.120\nThat's fine.\n\n01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.120\nAnd failure is fine too.\n\n01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.120\nBut then when you find out you failed, you don't take it out on neighbor kids.\n\n01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120\nThat's probably true.\n\n01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:41.120\nPrior, do you know, by the way, where do we leave stiff and weighing the little girls?\n\n01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120\nAre they still with us?\n\n01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.120\nThey're, yeah, they were with you too.\n\n01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.120\nSo they're here too.\n\n01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.120\nOkay.\n\n01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.120\nPrior, do you know these little children?\n\n01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.120\nYeah.\n\n01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.120\nYeah.\n\n01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.120\nDo you know where they came from?\n\n01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.120\nBecause they don't seem to have any memory of their families or their, you know, their\n\n01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.120\nwhereabouts.\n\n01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.120\nNo.\n\n01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.120\nThey were found on the church doorstep.\n\n01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120\nAnd do you know Arden?\n\n01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120\nYeah.\n\n01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.120\nDo you know where we could find?\n\n01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120\nLike where does she live?\n\n01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120\nWhere is she from?\n\n01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120\nWell, she stayed at the church.\n\n01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120\nWe don't know where she's from.\n\n01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.120\nConvenient.\n\n01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.120\nShe's from the church.\n\n01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120\nYou know, like you guys.\n\n01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.120\nWhere do you think all your church people are?\n\n01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.120\nDead.\n\n01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.120\nThey're under rubble?\n\n01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.120\nYeah.\n\n01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.120\nWell, okay.\n\n01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.120\nSo.\n\n01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.120\nOkay.\n\n01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120\nYeah.\n\n01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:25.120\nI'm kind of talking about circles here.\n\n01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.120\nAll right.\n\n01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.120\nAll right.\n\n01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120\nSo we've reached a point of agreement here.\n\n01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:31.120\nYou agree that your church got infiltrated by Boogans.\n\n01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.120\nYeah.\n\n01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.120\nIt's confusing.\n\n01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.120\nWe need to find Arden.\n\n01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.120\nShit.\n\n01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.120\nWell, what do you, what should I do?\n\n01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.120\nTell us about her.\n\n01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.120\nHmm.\n\n01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.120\nShe liked the church.\n\n01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120\nAnd she liked talking to people.\n\n01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.120\nAnd she liked prayer.\n\n01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120\nShe likes fire.\n\n01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.120\nOoh.\n\n01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.120\nThat's normal for the church.\n\n01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.120\nRight.\n\n01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.120\nShe never said where she was from?\n\n01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120\nNo.\n\n01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.120\nWe never really asked.\n\n01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.120\nWe're not very social.\n\n01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:14.120\nWhy are people in your church turning into vampires and doing cow blood magic in a pee room?\n\n01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:20.120\nIt's possible, I suppose, that she was a vampire before she came to our church.\n\n01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.120\nI think we need to notify the higher ups.\n\n01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.120\nYeah.\n\n01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.120\nNo.\n\n01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.120\nI mean, what, didn't she get sent here on some sort of mission that would then involve\n\n01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.120\nyou like reporting back to the people that sent you on a mission?\n\n01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120\nYeah.\n\n01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.120\nYeah.\n\n01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.120\nI was kind of putting it off.\n\n01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.120\nI think, I think we need to fill them in.\n\n01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.120\nHow do we, we got a table talk.\n\n01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.120\nHow do we go about reconnecting with our higher ups?\n\n01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.120\nWell, you could like send them a letter where you could like go in person.\n\n01:37:50.120 --> 01:38:01.120\nI say we take the prior and passions and go back with these relics and some evidence\n\n01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.120\nof what we've done and touch base back home.\n\n01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.120\nYeah.\n\n01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.120\nThat sounds like a good idea.\n\n01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120\nYeah.\n\n01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.120\nWe still got our wagon with those horses.\n\n01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120\nThis has been like a day, two days.\n\n01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120\nHow long have you been here in this town?\n\n01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.120\nI think two days.\n\n01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.120\nI hope our horses aren't dead because we just kind of left them behind that barn.\n\n01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120\nRight.\n\n01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120\nThe barn, yeah.\n\n01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.120\nThe barn wasn't attached to the fell house.\n\n01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.120\nIt was just nearby.\n\n01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.120\nOkay.\n\n01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.120\nIt's probably not.\n\n01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.120\nAll right.\n\n01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.120\nWe take the prior.\n\n01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.120\nWe take passions and we head back to the church, to touch base.\n\n01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120\nShould we take Stiffen Wang?\n\n01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.120\nI mean, I know what your answer is going to be.\n\n01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.120\nThey're orphans.\n\n01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.120\nOkay.\n\n01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.120\nWe take the children too.\n\n01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.120\nWe take Stiffen Wang.\n\n01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.120\nI mean, they're church orphans.\n\n01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.120\nThe priors got a lot of cleaning up to do.\n\n01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.120\nWhen you get to them.\n\n01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.120\nWe're taking him.\n\n01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.120\nYeah.\n\n01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.120\nThe fells have a lot of cleaning up to do.\n\n01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.120\nWe'll leave them be.\n\n01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120\nThey'll be safe now.\n\n01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.120\nShould we take passions or should we leave passions to clean up?\n\n01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120\nOr should we take passions with us?\n\n01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.120\nOkay.\n\n01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.120\nPassions.\n\n01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.120\nAnd the prior.\n\n01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.120\nStiff.\n\n01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.120\nStiff.\n\n01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.120\nWang.\n\n01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.120\nLet's everybody get in.\n\n01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.120\nNo fells.\n\n01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.120\nNo fells.\n\n01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.120\nAll right.\n\n01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120\nTake any material you need from the church and the reparation of your home.\n\n01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.120\nYou think we're going to make it into a community center?\n\n01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.120\nNot a reference.\n\n01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.120\nJust like, you know, the building.\n\n01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.120\nIt's interesting.\n\n01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.120\nA secular kind of approach.\n\n01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120\nObviously religion has failed this community.\n\n01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.120\nRight.\n\n01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.120\nPerhaps civic mindedness can take its place.\n\n01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.120\nPerhaps.\n\n01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.120\nI like your style, Tom.\n\n01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.120\nYeah, man.\n\n01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:40.120\nI think the next time I see you, you're going to be called Tom Rose.\n\n01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.120\nBecause you're Jewish, but like Rose, like he rose up.\n\n01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.120\nRight.\n\n01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.120\nRight.\n\n01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:47.120\nAll right.\n\n01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:52.120\nAway back to our church elders.\n\n01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.120\nAll right.\n\n01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.120\nWe're so bad at this.\n\n01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120\nSo you're standing.\n\n01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.120\nI can't believe we leveled up in the last one.\n\n01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.120\nAll we did was yell a lot and pull a guy's pants down.\n\n01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.120\nI think if you're level one and you hit a little girl in the face, you just jumped to level\n\n01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120\ntwo.\n\n01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120\nWe started at level two.\n\n01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.120\nHe gave us level two.\n\n01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.120\nBut now we're level three.\n\n01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.120\nRight.\n\n01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.120\nWell, you're pretty hard.\n\n01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.120\nSo you're still in the church.\n\n01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.120\nYou're still in the church.\n\n01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120\nAnd what do you call it?\n\n01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.120\nDiarrhea, Jr.\n\n01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.120\nHe looks bad.\n\n01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.120\nHe looks not good.\n\n01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.120\nHe's like sweaty.\n\n01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.120\nOh, boy.\n\n01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.120\nHe looks really sick.\n\n01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120\nUh-oh.\n\n01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.120\nHe falls down.\n\n01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120\nAll right.\n\n01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.120\nI...\n\n01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.120\nShit.\n\n01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120\nOkay.\n\n01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.120\nShit.\n\n01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120\nWell, I don't...\n\n01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.120\nI still have the same old spells.\n\n01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.120\nI can't detect.\n\n01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.120\nRight, yeah.\n\n01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.120\nDo you want to...\n\n01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.120\nHey, prior, you said you had eyes that can see this shit.\n\n01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.120\nIs he succumbing to the pneumonia?\n\n01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.120\nOr did Arden the Mist vampire go into him?\n\n01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.120\nI think that and other things.\n\n01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:04.120\nI think he might have a demon in him.\n\n01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.120\nHe also looks like he has mummy rot.\n\n01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.120\nDJ's got mummy rot and a demon and vampire mist.\n\n01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.120\nOh, no.\n\n01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.120\nJesus.\n\n01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.120\nThat's my prognosis.\n\n01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.120\nDo you have any spells, Carlos, to help us out or to check him out?\n\n01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:31.120\nNo, I mean, I would be using the offensive load out from when I was level two and all I have left is...\n\n01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.120\nI use perception on him to see what's going on with him.\n\n01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.120\nEleven.\n\n01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.120\nOh, man.\n\n01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:48.120\nYou can see that his skin is pale in a trackable pattern and it seems to go underneath his clothes.\n\n01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.120\nFuck.\n\n01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.120\nIt's like a gradient.\n\n01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.120\nHe's getting progressively more pale underneath his clothes.\n\n01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120\nAll right.\n\n01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.120\nLet's get his clothes off.\n\n01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.120\nWe're going to tend to this.\n\n01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120\nThis is an emergency.\n\n01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.120\nAll right.\n\n01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.120\nYou see the...\n\n01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:08.120\nYou rip off his shirt and you see on his chest there's like a keyhole and it's like the source of all this paleness.\n\n01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.120\nIt's like...\n\n01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.120\nOh, the hole above his heart.\n\n01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.120\nYeah.\n\n01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.120\nI remember something about this.\n\n01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120\nIt happened.\n\n01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.120\nFrom our backstory.\n\n01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120\nI look...\n\n01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.120\nIs one of those relics I took a key?\n\n01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.120\nNo.\n\n01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.120\nShit.\n\n01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:31.120\nHe's got... he's slowly dying or slowly being taken over by something.\n\n01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.120\nYeah.\n\n01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.120\nRight?\n\n01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.120\nWell, who are you asking?\n\n01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.120\nYou, Spencer.\n\n01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.120\nNo, I'm not telling you anything.\n\n01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:40.120\nOh, I'm using my perception of watching what's happening here.\n\n01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120\nIs my knowledge of our...\n\n01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.120\nHe just seems sick.\n\n01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.120\nI have knowledge, you know, Arcana.\n\n01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120\nI got it.\n\n01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:54.120\nHe seems like he has got some sort of crazy magical, like some sort of curse-related magic.\n\n01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120\nLike bad juju magic.\n\n01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.120\nWe got to get him back to the church then, probably.\n\n01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120\nRight?\n\n01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120\nRight.\n\n01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.120\nThis isn't like something that happened to him.\n\n01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.120\nThis is something that's part of his...\n\n01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.120\nI remember...\n\n01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.120\nI have a past with him.\n\n01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.120\nI remember something about this keyhole in his chest.\n\n01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.120\nYou don't remember very much about it, but yes.\n\n01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.120\nBut the reason why he's unconscious is he got knocked out by one of the girls, right?\n\n01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120\nWell, he came back.\n\n01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.120\nHe got re-conscious after it.\n\n01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.120\nOh, so he's been conscious now.\n\n01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120\nHe's just started to look sick.\n\n01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120\nYeah.\n\n01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120\nOkay.\n\n01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.120\nLet's get to the wagon and just get him back.\n\n01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.120\nLet's get him home, yeah.\n\n01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.120\nWe can't do anything for him.\n\n01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.120\nAll right.\n\n01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.120\nAnd we're all coming, right?\n\n01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.120\nWe should maybe get a bigger wagon.\n\n01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.120\nYeah.\n\n01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.120\nDo you have another wagon here, prior?\n\n01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.120\nI'll find one.\n\n01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.120\nOkay, great.\n\n01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.120\nOr stiff and wang.\n\n01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:48.120\nIt could be adopted by the fells, and then we don't need a bigger wagon.\n\n01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.120\nI mean, that's going to be a lot of paperwork.\n\n01:43:53.120 --> 01:44:00.120\nOkay, we take the wagon by the fells house and say, hey, do you guys want to take care\n\n01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.120\nof these little girls?\n\n01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.120\nThe fells aren't there.\n\n01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.120\nWait, where are they?\n\n01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.120\nAt the church.\n\n01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.120\nThey're with us.\n\n01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.120\nYep.\n\n01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.120\nWe asked them right now.\n\n01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.120\nOkay.\n\n01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.120\nHey, do you want to take care of these little girls?\n\n01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.120\nWe don't have room in the wagon.\n\n01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.120\nSure, why not?\n\n01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:16.120\nLet's just live at the church that we're calling the community center now.\n\n01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120\nFantastic.\n\n01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.120\nAll right.\n\n01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.120\nWe've got a church business.\n\n01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.120\nStiff, wang, Tom, Bonnie, Gary.\n\n01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.120\nCliff.\n\n01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120\nCliff.\n\n01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.120\nIt's been real.\n\n01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.120\nIt's been fun.\n\n01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:31.120\nBut it has been real fun.\n\n01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:35.120\nAnd we pop in our wagon with Patchens and the Pryor.\n\n01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.120\nAnd I take one of those.\n\n01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.120\nI think that one, like the mutant boogity arm that I took off.\n\n01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.120\nI keep that as evidence to show people back home what's going on.\n\n01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:44.120\nAll right.\n\n01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.120\nHyah!\n\n01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.120\nHyah!\n\n01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120\nHyah, indeed.\n\n01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.120\nYou're traveling, you're traveling back to the home office.\n\n01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.120\nOh, man.\n\n01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.120\nIt's mostly uneventful until nightfall.\n\n01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:00.120\nIt's been a, let's say it's been a day of travel so you can reset your spells if you\n\n01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120\nwant.\n\n01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120\nWe sleep and reset our spells.\n\n01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.120\nAll right.\n\n01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.120\nAll right.\n\n01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.120\nI'm going to pick a load out.\n\n01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120\nPick a load out, baby.\n\n01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.120\nPick a load out.\n\n01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.120\nPick a load for me.\n\n01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.120\nPick a load for free.\n\n01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.120\nPick a load out, Carlos.\n\n01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:17.120\nAnd put your spell right on, right on.\n\n01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.120\nYou put the spell right on me.\n\n01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:26.120\nBut at night while you're making camp and sleeping and being like blissfully unaware\n\n01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.120\nand stuff, attacks happen.\n\n01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.120\nYou get attacked.\n\n01:45:30.120 -->

screaming.\n\n01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560\nIt's the Pryor.\n\n01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.200\nIt's screaming.\n\n01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:43.800\nThere's a, there's, they look like banditos.\n\n01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.440\nThey're surrounding your encampment.\n\n01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:52.120\nI have picked the offensive load out to see, you know.\n\n01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.120\nBanditos.\n\n01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.120\nAll right.\n\n01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120\nWow.\n\n01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.120\nWow.\n\n01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.120\nThere's banditos

up like that.\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.200\nYou do that.\n\n01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:14.680\nAnd I just fucking hold that like, like that's that, like that was enough for now.\n\n01:48:14.680 -->

those, those, that, that my ability to convert any\n\n01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:32.680\nspell of a certain level to a healing spell, does that, so then does that also count for\n\n01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.680\nlevel two spells?\n\n01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.680\nYeah.\n\n01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.680\nOkay.\n\n01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.680\nSo it keeps going beyond that too.\n\n01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.680\nYeah.\n\n01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.680\nThat's why I don't have healed spells.\n\n01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.680\nRight.\n\n01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.680\nI don't.\n\n01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.680\nYeah.\n\n01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.680\nI don't put them in any of the loadouts for that reason.\n\n01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.560\nAnd so it's a level one and level two spells that I, that can be turned into that.\n\n01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.560\nOkay.\n\n01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.560\nWell, gentlemen, I got to tell you.\n\n01:48:52.560 --> 01:49:05.280\nThere, salvation takes many forms, and it's about to take the form of a giant ant, summon\n\n01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280\ngiant ant.\n\n01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.280\nAll right.\n\n01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280\nYeah.\n\n01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.480\nIs that a level one or a level two giant?\n\n01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480\nLevel two.\n\n01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.480\nOkay.\n\n01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.480\nHow many level ones and twos do we get?\n\n01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480\nThree.\n\n01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480\nThree apiece?\n\n01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.800\nThat's not a full question.\n\n01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.360\nOkay, how many level ones do I get a day?\n\n01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.360\nThree.\n\n01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.360\nOkay.\n\n01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360\nGreat.\n\n01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.360\nAnd level twos?\n\n01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360\nTwo.\n\n01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360\nOkay.\n\n01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360\nAll right.\n\n01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360\nUse summon a giant ant.\n\n01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.360\nIt looks really frenzied and angry.\n\n01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.360\nIt's antennae are waving.\n\n01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.360\nOh boy.\n\n01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.200\nWhat do you want it to do?\n\n01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200\nAttack the banditos.\n\n01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.480\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.640\nAll right.\n\n01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.280\nIt misses.\n\n01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.840\nIt lunges at the bandito, but he rolls out of the way.\n\n01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.800\nThe banditos, they continue their onslaught.\n\n01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:59.760\nThey close in and they seem to be closing in surrounding pachens and diarrhea, who are\n\n01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.320\nsleeping nearby each other and both seemingly unconscious even during the melee.\n\n01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.680\nHey, leave them alone.\n\n01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.680\nThey don't.\n\n01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:15.840\nYou guys don't have some kind of bandito code?\n\n01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.200\nWhat?\n\n01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.120\nYou don't have a bandito code?\n\n01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.960\nI don't know what you're talking about, Stab.\n\n01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.640\nAll right.\n\n01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.480\nYou're talking to banditos with stabbing weapons.\n\n01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.480\nYeah.\n\n01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.720\nDiarrhea and pachens get stabbed.\n\n01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.320\nOh Jesus Christ.\n\n01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.120\nDiarrhea takes much worse of a stabbing and pachens screams and bolts up right awake.\n\n01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.160\nThis is awful.\n\n01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.000\nOh yeah.\n\n01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.560\nThis isn't my turn.\n\n01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.680\nNow it's the priors turn.\n\n01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:52.680\nIs he tied up?\n\n01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.680\nNo, no.\n\n01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.000\nHe's part of the gang now.\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nHe runs away.\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000\nWhat's fucking?\n\n01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.360\nWe don't need that guy.\n\n01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.160\nThe ship sails faster without the anchor, Carlos.\n\n01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160\nAll right.\n\n01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.640\nIt's Jeff's turn now.\n\n01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.680\nIs there vegetation where we are right now?\n\n01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680\nOh yeah.\n\n01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.680\nWell then, guess what everybody?\n\n01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.680\nEntangle.\n\n01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.680\nOh man.\n\n01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.680\nIt's great.\n\n01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:25.000\nAll the plants nearby, they start coming alive, wriggling and waving and entangling.\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.680\nThey're grabbing the banditos.\n\n01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.680\nOh man.\n\n01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.080\nHow many do they grab?\n\n01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:34.880\nOne, two, three.\n\n01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:35.880\nAll right.\n\n01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.320\nThey get three of the banditos.\n\n01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:38.320\nThey're caught fast.\n\n01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.160\nThe rest of them are like just hacking at the bushes and trying to stay from being entangled.\n\n01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:50.080\nThey're kind of like being, what do you call it, occupied by the vines and stuff.\n\n01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.840\nIt's taken their attentions away.\n\n01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:52.840\nAll right, Carlos.\n\n01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.320\nI got distracted by plant life.\n\n01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:03.040\nSounds like a good time to inflict light wounds.\n\n01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.960\nCan I make a pitch?\n\n01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.440\nInflict heavy wounds.\n\n01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:10.960\nWell, I don't know how to do that yet.\n\n01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:13.640\nI mean, you have a weapon.\n\n01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:16.240\nI'm still working my way up the bridge.\n\n01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.240\nOkay.\n\n01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.240\nAll right.\n\n01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.240\nStarting light.\n\n01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.240\nAll right.\n\n01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:26.720\nYou grab one of the guy's arms, his sword-wielding arm, and it shrivels in skinny fies like it's\n\n01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:29.080\nwithering before your very eyes.\n\n01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.680\nLike a big part of his body just kind of shrivels up like a husk.\n\n01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.680\nNice.\n\n01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:41.120\nAnd that was a light wound.\n\n01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.120\nAll right.\n\n01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.120\nThe banditos do stuff.\n\n01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:44.120\nWhat about my aunt, though?\n\n01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.120\nNot to be too much of an expert.\n\n01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.920\nNo, that's a good call.\n\n01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:47.920\nI forgot.\n\n01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.920\nHe misses again.\n\n01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.920\nThat's, sorry.\n\n01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:54.040\nI'm going to switch dice, how about?\n\n01:52:54.040 --> 01:53:00.280\nI feel like I accidentally summoned like a regular aunt, like a woman that married my\n\n01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:07.240\nuncle, just swinging a rolling pin.\n\n01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.240\nAll right.\n\n01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.200\nThe withered guy, he starts making an exit.\n\n01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.200\nHe's like trying to escape.\n\n01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:19.400\nThe other two, they kind of, or not the other two, the other banditos, they kind of split\n\n01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.400\ntheir forces.\n\n01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.280\nOne of them continues, or half of them like continued, they're like grab it, patch it and\n\n01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.000\nstabbing them and like dragging them away.\n\n01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.440\nAnd the other ones are turning to fight you guys.\n\n01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.000\nThese guys are such bad people.\n\n01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.840\nSo they don't actually hurt patchings as far as you can tell.\n\n01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.000\nBut they're trying to drag them off?\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000\nYeah, they are.\n\n01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000\nBut they are stabbing at you guys.\n\n01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000\nOh, fucking it.\n\n01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nThey only hit you.\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.240\nThey hit you each for two damage.\n\n01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.160\nSo that's their turns.\n\n01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.760\nThe prior is still gone.\n\n01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.240\nA quick question, because that's a new spell for me.\n\n01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:59.160\nIf I want to cast a bark skin and harden my skin, is that something I do prior to an\n\n01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.080\nattack or during an attack?\n\n01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:04.880\nWell, it's a standard action, so you cast it whenever, but it lasts for like a minute.\n\n01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:05.880\nSo probably do it before.\n\n01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.380\nOkay, I don't do it.\n\n01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.880\nI've never seen that before.\n\n01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:09.880\nAll right.\n\n01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:10.880\nWait, I got tree shape.\n\n01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.880\nI turn into a tree?\n\n01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:12.880\nYeah.\n\n01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.880\nThat'll be helpful.\n\n01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.000\nI'm not doing that.\n\n01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.800\nThat's just good to have in the bag.\n\n01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.800\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.640\nWell, I'm just attacking nearest Bandito with Morningstar.\n\n01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.640\nI think it's Jester.\n\n01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.640\nOh.\n\n01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.640\nHey, Carlos, start hitting people like they're little girls.\n\n01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.560\nMan, that's how you smashed that little girl in the face?\n\n01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.720\nWe need to be on the same side.\n\n01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:40.320\nThis couldn't be more metaphorical.\n\n01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:43.680\nWho cares who voted for Bernie and who voted for Hillary?\n\n01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.560\nLet's just beat the Banditos.\n\n01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560\nWow.\n\n01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.560\nBad hombres.\n\n01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.680\nJeff, what are you doing?\n\n01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.360\nI vote for Bernie.\n\n01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.040\nFirebolt.\n\n01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:56.520\nFirebolt 101.\n\n01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:02.280\nFeel the burn.\n\n01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:06.320\nAll right.\n\n01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.440\nYou catch one of them on fire.\n\n01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.280\nHe's got his fire.\n\n01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:11.280\nHe's on fire.\n\n01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.280\nHe's running around on fire.\n\n01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.280\nYeah.\n\n01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.280\nOh, boy.\n\n01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:18.280\nWe should have just ended down that laugh.\n\n01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:21.080\nNo, we got to beat these Banditos.\n\n01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:26.600\nYeah, we got one more minute or two, so Carlos, lay it down.\n\n01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.600\nMorningstar.\n\n01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.600\nOn the guy who stabbed Patchens.\n\n01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:40.760\nAll right, you miss.\n\n01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.160\nThat makes up my aunt's turn, and his victories will be mine.\n\n01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.400\nWhat is he going to do?\n\n01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.400\nThe aunt?\n\n01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.400\nYeah.\n\n01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:49.400\nHe's just attacking Banditos.\n\n01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400\nI mean, he's an aunt.\n\n01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.400\nAll right.\n\n01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.400\nHow big is his aunt, by the way?\n\n01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.400\nWhat are we talking?\n\n01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.400\nIt's a giant aunt.\n\n01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:55.400\nYeah.\n\n01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.400\nIt could be like the size of a bumblebee.\n\n01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.640\nIt's as big as a shoe.\n\n01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.720\nIt doesn't take much for an aunt to be giant, does it?\n\n01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.720\nHow big an aunt are we looking at right now?\n\n01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:07.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:10.720\nLet's say like the size of a mule.\n\n01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.720\nOh, shit.\n\n01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720\nThat's a big aunt.\n\n01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720\nThat's a big aunt.\n\n01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720\nIt's thrashing around.\n\n01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.720\nAll right.\n\n01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.720\nGet a muley.\n\n01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.720\nHe misses again.\n\n01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720\nHe misses again.\n\n01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.720\nHe misses again.\n\n01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:22.720\nHe misses again.\n\n01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.720\nEvery time, like what are the odds of rolling the same number on a dice three times?\n\n01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:31.120\nWell, it's 80,000.\n\n01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120\nWho cares?\n\n01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.120\nAll right.\n\n01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.800\nWell, now it's my turn.\n\n01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:35.800\nAll right.\n\n01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.400\nThe Banditos, they stab Patchen's a couple more times.\n\n01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400\nShe don't.\n\n01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400\nPatchen's.\n\n01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.200\nThey're just so cowardly.\n\n01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:45.440\nYou see the ones that don't stab him.\n\n01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.920\nThey take everything.\n\n01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:51.120\nThey take his clothes off, they like strip his clothes off and then they like strip him\n\n01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120\ndown naked.\n\n01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.120\nPoor Patchen's.\n\n01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.680\nAll he did was back us up, you know, like it's just feel awful for him.\n\n01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.240\nAll right.\n\n01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.920\nThose guys, their tasks completed.\n\n01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:03.920\nThey bone out.\n\n01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.920\nWhat?\n\n01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:05.920\nThey just stole Patchen's and left?\n\n01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.920\nWell, no.\n\n01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:07.920\nThey leave him bleeding on the floor.\n\n01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.920\nThey took his clothes?\n\n01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:09.920\nYeah.\n\n01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:17.120\nSo these are just, just really just Banditos who needed clothes.\n\n01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.920\nDid they get the relics?\n\n01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:19.920\nNo, no.\n\n01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:20.920\nNot yet.\n\n01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920\nYou should have clothes?\n\n01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.920\nYeah.\n\n01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.800\nThere's still, there's still a couple that are fighting you, but those ones that were\n\n01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:28.680\ngoing after Patchen's are kind of boning out.\n\n01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.720\nWe could have had some kind of drive for you guys.\n\n01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.920\nWe're a church and you're stealing clothes from us.\n\n01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:41.360\nIt's like robbing the toys for Tott's barrel.\n\n01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.920\nIt's for Tott's already.\n\n01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.920\nAll right, I attack with my morning star.\n\n01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.920\nAll right.\n\n01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.920\nSomeone.\n\n01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.920\nOh man.\n\n01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.040\nYou blast him in the head and he goes down.\n\n01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.520\nYou see his, his helmet is bent.\n\n01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.520\nHe's wearing a helmet.\n\n01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.520\nThis guy.\n\n01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.520\nHe's the only one.\n\n01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:00.920\nI walk over and I take his clothes off and I put him on Patchen's.\n\n01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.920\nOkay.\n\n01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:06.920\nOh yeah.\n\n01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:14.920\nLet's hear it for Spencer Crittenden and everybody.\n\n01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:21.920\nIt's here for Kevin Day, Sarah Hill, Harry Foster on Sound Tonight, church.\n\n01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.920\nWho else we got?\n\n01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920\nKris Boruff.\n\n01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:27.920\nBut I already say Kevin Day.\n\n01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:29.920\nI'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.\n\n01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.920\nI'm Jared Harmon.\n\n01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:32.920\nThank you so much for coming.\n\n01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:33.920\nYou're mayor.\n\n01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.920\nMr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:57.920\nMake it bendy though.\n\n01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:05.920\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.004s"],"str_size":[167508]}
