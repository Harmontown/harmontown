{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.600\nHello Johnny Dees in Somerville, Massachusetts, welcome!\n\n00:23.600 --> 00:32.480\nHarmontown is now in session! Won't you please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown,\n\n00:32.480 --> 01:01.480\nDan Harmon! Well, thank you Somerville! We've already had our first injury Jeff, I don't know if you saw my entrance, but it was less than graceful, I took out either a busboy or a cop or I don't know, I'll find out later in the basement.\n\n01:01.480 --> 01:30.480\nThis used to be an old cop bar, they say, it's a very old architecture in the basement, you can see the first hand effects of the fact that in the turn of the century, people, they never grew beyond three feet tall, everything, there's just a system of hobbit holes down there, there's just millions of miles of concrete, stucco, half built chairs, old bull whips, like a corpse of a guy dressed as Santa Claus in a bathtub,\n\n01:30.480 --> 01:56.480\nJust weird shit from like, weird old days when Somerville was not the best managed town in the United States, voted in the Boston Globe, best managed town, I Wikipedia'd you motherfuckers, there is some funny shit in their Wikipedia entry, I don't think the guy that did most of the editing of your Wikipedia entry was on the tourist board, but I'm all over the place, what am I doing?\n\n01:56.480 --> 02:16.480\nAnyways, I wiped some guy out, somebody write him a check, that was my point, I guess in the 1890s, when this place was probably built, I think people just ate dirt and smoked cigarettes all day, they didn't have vitamins, so everything was kind of shrunken down down there, so I have a lot of stuff.\n\n02:16.480 --> 02:27.480\nThe mirrors are all because the ceilings are so low, the mirrors just give you a perfect view of your balls, it's just like everything was hung by like a deranged midget leprechaun down there.\n\n02:27.480 --> 02:45.480\nSomerville, Jeff, some facts about it, just to get to know each other, most important fact I think, I'm assuming that the Somervillians would have you know, it's not Boston, but there's probably a lot of Bostonians here that made the drive.\n\n02:45.480 --> 02:58.480\nBut Somerville's very proud of its independence I think, you know, we're just north of Boston, might as well be Boston, but maybe it's a little more wicked, a little less retarded.\n\n02:58.480 --> 03:00.480\nWe don't know, let's find out, we don't know.\n\n03:00.480 --> 03:03.480\nWe'll find out the wickedness to retarded ratio.\n\n03:03.480 --> 03:11.480\nMajor exports, goodwill hunting photos, a lot of bars, a lot of Matt Damon have been applicant on the wall here.\n\n03:11.480 --> 03:14.480\nA lot of Colin Quinn looking likes walking around.\n\n03:14.480 --> 03:23.480\nYeah, I'm from Milwaukee, so I know, yeah, there's a lot of my uncles here in Spare, that's good, that makes me feel at home.\n\n03:23.480 --> 03:27.480\nYeah, I know how you guys like them apples, or I guess I don't.\n\n03:27.480 --> 03:31.480\nI know you like your screenplays horrible, but I don't know how you like your apples.\n\n03:31.480 --> 03:37.480\nYeah, yeah, you know what, everyone gets a pet peeve, everyone gets one.\n\n03:37.480 --> 03:46.480\nYeah, I'm not gonna go around to the bars and take all the Matt Damon photos off the wall, I'm just a petty jealous asshole.\n\n03:46.480 --> 03:48.480\nWilliam Goldman wrote that script.\n\n03:48.480 --> 03:53.480\nOkay, but you hate that one scene with the apples more than anything, that really sticks in your throat.\n\n03:53.480 --> 03:58.480\nThat really fucking sticks, I do not like those apples, I do not like that scene, I don't understand.\n\n03:58.480 --> 04:03.480\nIs that banging on a window, how do you like them apples, and the guy bothers to say yes?\n\n04:03.480 --> 04:12.480\nI like them, I let's continue to have this conversation, who would ever do that, it completely removes me from the movie.\n\n04:12.480 --> 04:18.480\nAnd then if that didn't remove you from the movie, mini-drivers face.\n\n04:18.480 --> 04:27.480\nNo, I don't know, it's the Boston air, I'm getting a jocular and mean, I don't mean to do that, I'm sorry.\n\n04:27.480 --> 04:32.480\nThere's a ghost of police brutality in the basement.\n\n04:32.480 --> 04:37.480\nI can just tell, it was an old cop bar and you just know that unofficial police procedures happened down there.\n\n04:37.480 --> 04:43.480\nThere's too many choices walking up to the stage, we walked six miles, remember the scene in Spinal Tap?\n\n04:43.480 --> 04:50.480\nWe have a shot of us walking, but beyond the scene in Spinal Tap, every three feet there was a way to go that way, a way to go that way,\n\n04:50.480 --> 04:54.480\nand you would just see a glimpse of a sink with a wig.\n\n04:54.480 --> 04:57.480\nWe should play our D&D down there.\n\n04:57.480 --> 05:03.480\nWe could, I think they call it LARPing, live action role-playing.\n\n05:03.480 --> 05:07.480\nFacts about Somerville, the typewriter was invented here?\n\n05:07.480 --> 05:09.480\nNot true.\n\n05:09.480 --> 05:12.480\nSometimes you get lazy.\n\n05:12.480 --> 05:19.480\nThe original choice for Somerville's new name when they broke away from Charleston, Charlestown?\n\n05:19.480 --> 05:29.480\nThey broke away from those assholes and their original choice for a name was Walford after the first settler,\n\n05:29.480 --> 05:35.480\nbut then they just changed it to Somerville, which means this Walford guy, something turned up, right?\n\n05:35.480 --> 05:38.480\nThere's no mention, no one knows why they changed it to Somerville.\n\n05:38.480 --> 05:43.480\nThat sounds like a hasty decision after you went to Walford's house to go,\n\n05:43.480 --> 05:50.480\ncongratulations, here's your plaque, what is that in your living room? That's my daughter and my mom.\n\n05:50.480 --> 05:54.480\nIt's the old junkie. You fuck one sheep.\n\n05:54.480 --> 05:59.480\nSomething went down at the Walford estate and they just picked the name Somerville,\n\n05:59.480 --> 06:02.480\nand no one here knows why they picked the name Somerville.\n\n06:02.480 --> 06:10.480\nThey actually had a historical commission look into it and it just seems like it was a purely fanciful name.\n\n06:10.480 --> 06:14.480\nIt's adorable. It's better than Boston.\n\n06:14.480 --> 06:16.480\nBoston!\n\n06:16.480 --> 06:18.480\nWho picked that name?\n\n06:18.480 --> 06:22.480\nA lot of those, like in California where we're from, there's places like Thousand Oaks,\n\n06:22.480 --> 06:25.480\nand there's no oaks, there's not a thousand of them anyway,\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:29.480\nand those used to be really embarrassing names like Buttcrack Creek and stuff like that.\n\n06:29.480 --> 06:36.480\nThey were old, like it was the West, and so a lot of things were called the Big Titty Mountains, that's the Grand Teton.\n\n06:36.480 --> 06:40.480\nYeah, we have history too, where we come from.\n\n06:40.480 --> 06:47.480\nBut listen to this bit of history, Jeff, this is the first town that I want to read entire sections of the Wikipedia entry.\n\n06:47.480 --> 06:52.480\nI think this is just so interesting and uncomfortable.\n\n06:52.480 --> 06:58.480\nJust hold your applause until the end of this paragraph, or laughter, or cringing or crying, or walking out,\n\n06:58.480 --> 07:01.480\nwhatever your reaction you have to this, hold it until the end.\n\n07:01.480 --> 07:08.480\nPaul Revere, in one account he wrote of his ride to warn the colonists, mentions a location in Somerville, then part of Charleston.\n\n07:08.480 --> 07:15.480\nThe location was the site where 20 years earlier a local slave, known as Mark, owned by John Codman, was publicly gibbeted.\n\n07:15.480 --> 07:17.480\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n07:17.480 --> 07:20.480\nMore on that later.\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:27.480\nThe location is probably near the site of the present-day Holiday Inn on Washington Street.\n\n07:27.480 --> 07:33.480\nNot written by the Holiday Inn people, not written by Somerville's Tourism Bureau.\n\n07:33.480 --> 07:35.480\nBye-bye.\n\n07:35.480 --> 07:37.480\nContinental breakfast on Sundays.\n\n07:37.480 --> 07:41.480\nAlso, a black person got gibbeted.\n\n07:41.480 --> 07:45.480\nBut Dan, that means he was treated to expert luxury and comfort.\n\n07:45.480 --> 07:49.480\nNo, I looked it up. I wanted to know what gibbeted.\n\n07:49.480 --> 07:57.480\nGibbeted is like, and it's most humane, it's basically just putting a dude in a cage and letting him die of thirst.\n\n07:57.480 --> 08:07.480\nThey did it at crossroads and things to like, if you murdered or stole or whatever, God knows what this poor guy did.\n\n08:07.480 --> 08:13.480\nSo it was like a public warning and probably counts as torture, I think.\n\n08:13.480 --> 08:15.480\nI don't know where we stand on that now.\n\n08:15.480 --> 08:17.480\nWait, so they put you in a cage and you're left there?\n\n08:17.480 --> 08:19.480\nYeah, and then you just die in a cage.\n\n08:19.480 --> 08:23.480\nSo I have been gibbeted at Holiday Inn before.\n\n08:23.480 --> 08:25.480\nNice.\n\n08:29.480 --> 08:31.480\nWhite people problems.\n\n08:31.480 --> 08:36.480\nI went to a Holiday Inn in somewhere, it was called like Indiana, Pennsylvania.\n\n08:36.480 --> 08:41.480\nIt was the most complicated little turnpike town and there was nothing to do.\n\n08:41.480 --> 08:47.480\nI went to a Holiday Inn and it's the only hotel I've ever been in. Not only was there no closet, there was no...\n\n08:47.480 --> 08:50.480\nThe hairdryer and the TV didn't work at the same time.\n\n08:50.480 --> 08:55.480\nI haven't seen that since the 70s where the hairdryer affected the reception on the TV.\n\n08:55.480 --> 08:59.480\nBut also no windows. No windows in a hotel room. It was really, really creepy.\n\n08:59.480 --> 09:02.480\nIt was really like being in a prison cell.\n\n09:02.480 --> 09:04.480\nI had some hotel complaints along the way.\n\n09:04.480 --> 09:11.480\nAnd then the slogan downstairs is, relax. It's Holiday Inn. But the line reading is, relax.\n\n09:11.480 --> 09:13.480\nIt's Holiday Inn.\n\n09:13.480 --> 09:18.480\nThis is America. You live in a honeycomb of cement and glass.\n\n09:18.480 --> 09:21.480\nStart your own hotel. Good luck.\n\n09:24.480 --> 09:28.480\nWe're part of the... relax. It's a military industrial complex.\n\n09:29.480 --> 09:33.480\nYou're sleeping in a bed made by people who make missiles probably.\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:38.480\nEverything's taken care of. Just dig your ditch and die.\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:43.480\nHoliday Inn. Gibbetting since 1742.\n\n09:43.480 --> 09:47.480\nWho says gibbetting has to be uncomfortable?\n\n09:47.480 --> 09:53.480\nSlowly die of thirst. Do you know what's weird is at this Comfort Inn that we're at, like another Ironically...\n\n09:53.480 --> 09:55.480\nDamn, another all going to come over.\n\n09:55.480 --> 09:57.480\nNo, they're not. It's 48,000 miles.\n\n09:57.480 --> 10:08.480\nEveryone come over to the Comfort Inn where the East 93 meets the fucking cave where the Pirates of the Caribbean are.\n\n10:08.480 --> 10:12.480\nWe are out of town. We are out of town.\n\n10:12.480 --> 10:16.480\nAnd there's no water in the hotel. That was a new thing.\n\n10:16.480 --> 10:20.480\nThere was a machine in the lobby that has a water button and I pressed it and nothing came out.\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:24.480\nAnd we all know when you press a water button, you're thirsty.\n\n10:24.480 --> 10:29.480\nYou usually accidentally get the amount of water you kind of feel like getting.\n\n10:29.480 --> 10:35.480\nWhen you're thirsty enough to seek out a water button, you get bummed when water don't come out.\n\n10:35.480 --> 10:38.480\nThat was some Wiley Coyote shit that they pulled.\n\n10:38.480 --> 10:41.480\nAnd then I started pressing juice buttons and none of them worked.\n\n10:41.480 --> 10:47.480\nI think that's the continental breakfast machine that you get water and juice from 7 to 9.30 a.m.\n\n10:47.480 --> 10:51.480\nHey, Jeff.\n\n10:51.480 --> 10:56.480\nFluff the marshmallow cream was invented here in Somerville.\n\n10:56.480 --> 10:59.480\nThere's a look of real pride in the crowd right now.\n\n10:59.480 --> 11:04.480\nWell, they're into it. Don't people eat marshmallow cream and...\n\n11:04.480 --> 11:06.480\nFluffer butters.\n\n11:06.480 --> 11:09.480\nThat sounds good. I will take that.\n\n11:09.480 --> 11:12.480\nDo you do it with Nutella ever?\n\n11:12.480 --> 11:15.480\nWe're not so different.\n\n11:15.480 --> 11:18.480\nWe can get along.\n\n11:18.480 --> 11:21.480\nSomerville's the home of Fluff?\n\n11:21.480 --> 11:26.480\nIt was invented here. It doesn't say when, but I assume when...\n\n11:26.480 --> 11:29.480\n1325.\n\n11:29.480 --> 11:32.480\nBlackbeard is here.\n\n11:32.480 --> 11:34.480\nFluffbeard.\n\n11:34.480 --> 11:36.480\nI was a member of the Mohawk tribe.\n\n11:36.480 --> 11:43.480\nThere's a druid in the audience that turned lead into fluffy marshmallow cream\n\n11:43.480 --> 11:52.480\nusing the moon and a gibbeted woman.\n\n11:52.480 --> 11:54.480\nOkay, just a couple more things.\n\n11:54.480 --> 11:58.480\nI don't know. I'm fascinated, Jeff. I love history. I love Somerville.\n\n11:58.480 --> 12:00.480\nSomerville.\n\n12:00.480 --> 12:02.480\nThe first residential phone line...\n\n12:02.480 --> 12:04.480\nThis is interesting to me.\n\n12:04.480 --> 12:10.480\nThe first residential phone line in the United States in 1877 was installed here.\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:15.480\nIt was invented from Charles Williams Jr.'s house to Alexander Graham Bell's place in Boston\n\n12:15.480 --> 12:17.480\nwhere he was working on telephonics.\n\n12:17.480 --> 12:21.480\nThere was some guy that lived here that was so rich and powerful\n\n12:21.480 --> 12:24.480\nthat as soon as he heard there was a phone being invented,\n\n12:24.480 --> 12:26.480\nit's like an equivalent of this.\n\n12:26.480 --> 12:28.480\nI was an iPhone douche for a while.\n\n12:28.480 --> 12:31.480\nWhen's it coming out? I want my assistant to stand in line for it.\n\n12:31.480 --> 12:35.480\nSome guy was like, what's Alexander Graham Bell working on in Boston?\n\n12:35.480 --> 12:38.480\nIt's some kind of thing. You can talk to people without me in there.\n\n12:38.480 --> 12:40.480\nI want the first door...\n\n12:40.480 --> 12:44.480\nHe just called Alexander Graham Bell every day.\n\n12:44.480 --> 12:48.480\nWhat's going on? I'm working on the fucking thing you're talking to me on.\n\n12:48.480 --> 12:51.480\nCan you hang up so I can test it some more?\n\n12:51.480 --> 12:53.480\nJust making sure it still works.\n\n12:53.480 --> 12:57.480\nI'm not going to pay my bill at the end of the month if it's not...\n\n12:57.480 --> 12:59.480\nI'm not working on it.\n\n12:59.480 --> 13:01.480\nI think that's about it for the history of Somerville.\n\n13:01.480 --> 13:05.480\nExcept most recently, Jeff, there's a big rebirth story here.\n\n13:05.480 --> 13:07.480\nWhat were you going to say?\n\n13:07.480 --> 13:09.480\nNo, baby, come on.\n\n13:09.480 --> 13:11.480\nI was going to open it to the floor and...\n\n13:11.480 --> 13:13.480\nBaby, let's not fight, baby.\n\n13:13.480 --> 13:15.480\nDon't do me that way.\n\n13:15.480 --> 13:20.480\nI was going to say, maybe someone out there has some historical tidbits and nuggets.\n\n13:20.480 --> 13:24.480\nI bet they do. That segues into this one little chapter.\n\n13:24.480 --> 13:27.480\nI read another thing in the Wikipedia page.\n\n13:27.480 --> 13:29.480\nRight before the 90s...\n\n13:29.480 --> 13:34.480\nThis place in the 90s had this incredible gentrification effort that happened.\n\n13:34.480 --> 13:38.480\nBefore that, they had a nickname for this place, Slumberville.\n\n13:38.480 --> 13:44.480\nIt was the car theft capital of the United States.\n\n13:44.480 --> 13:47.480\nThat's pretty amazing.\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:49.480\nWhy isn't that New York?\n\n13:49.480 --> 13:56.480\nYou've got to steal a lot of cars to not be New York or LA as either car theft capital.\n\n13:56.480 --> 13:58.480\nI don't know if it was per capita. Maybe that's what it was.\n\n13:58.480 --> 14:00.480\nMaybe people have six cars each here.\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:02.480\nSay what?\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:04.480\nIt was a racket.\n\n14:04.480 --> 14:07.480\nWhat do you mean? You were falsely branded?\n\n14:07.480 --> 14:09.480\nWait, what did you say?\n\n14:09.480 --> 14:11.480\nMy birth was financed that way.\n\n14:11.480 --> 14:13.480\nYour birth was financed that way?\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:15.480\nWait, was it like a mob racket?\n\n14:15.480 --> 14:17.480\nMy family car was stolen.\n\n14:17.480 --> 14:19.480\nAre you willing to come up here?\n\n14:19.480 --> 14:23.480\nOr do you need to have a shadow across your face and your voice change?\n\n14:23.480 --> 14:26.480\nAre you in the relocation program?\n\n14:26.480 --> 14:29.480\nWhat it sounds like we're hearing is that...\n\n14:29.480 --> 14:31.480\nGet on up here. What's your name?\n\n14:31.480 --> 14:38.480\nI think what she might be saying...\n\n14:38.480 --> 14:40.480\nOh, she's got like a Harmontown t-shirt.\n\n14:40.480 --> 14:42.480\nDid you make that?\n\n14:42.480 --> 14:43.480\nI did.\n\n14:43.480 --> 14:50.480\nI get off on t-shirts?\n\n14:50.480 --> 14:51.480\nVery nice.\n\n14:51.480 --> 14:53.480\nAlright, Summerville.\n\n14:53.480 --> 14:55.480\nWe may do some crowd surfing yet.\n\n14:55.480 --> 14:57.480\nI don't know if you heard Brooklyn,\n\n14:57.480 --> 15:00.480\nbut I indulged a 40th birthday fantasy.\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:02.480\nAnd crowd surfed there.\n\n15:02.480 --> 15:05.480\nHere I think I'll just end up with an ass full of hot wings.\n\n15:05.480 --> 15:07.480\nThat's not your fault.\n\n15:07.480 --> 15:10.480\nYou have more comfortable seating than in Brooklyn.\n\n15:10.480 --> 15:13.480\nThey were able to lift my fat ass to the back of the room.\n\n15:13.480 --> 15:18.480\nAnyways, Cara, I'm assuming what you're alluding to is like some kind of organized crime chapter of your history?\n\n15:18.480 --> 15:19.480\nYeah, exactly.\n\n15:19.480 --> 15:23.480\nSo they were just... cars were being stolen and re-stolen and...\n\n15:23.480 --> 15:24.480\nExactly, yeah.\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:27.480\nSo you would pretend your car got stolen as an insurance racket or what?\n\n15:27.480 --> 15:29.480\nYeah, basically that was it.\n\n15:29.480 --> 15:31.480\nAnd I have to say this story runs to my family.\n\n15:31.480 --> 15:33.480\nObviously, I wasn't there.\n\n15:33.480 --> 15:35.480\nBut the hospital bill needed to get paid,\n\n15:35.480 --> 15:37.480\nand so, yeah, there was an insurance policy on the car,\n\n15:37.480 --> 15:38.480\nand it just happened to get left,\n\n15:38.480 --> 15:40.480\nso the door was open and the key is in it.\n\n15:40.480 --> 15:42.480\nWhat's that square that used to be,\n\n15:42.480 --> 15:44.480\nthat was the most notorious place for theft?\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:45.480\nWhat was it, Assembly Square?\n\n15:45.480 --> 15:46.480\nAssembly Square, yeah.\n\n15:46.480 --> 15:49.480\nSo you couldn't leave anything if it wasn't nailed down.\n\n15:49.480 --> 15:51.480\nAnd then in the 90s, how does that work?\n\n15:51.480 --> 15:53.480\nThere were artists and...\n\n15:53.480 --> 15:54.480\nThe T-station came in.\n\n15:54.480 --> 15:56.480\nDavis Square T-station.\n\n15:56.480 --> 15:58.480\nOh, the MBTA, the subway.\n\n15:58.480 --> 16:00.480\nOh, okay, so the subway was built\n\n16:00.480 --> 16:03.480\nthat allowed people to kind of flood into Somerville\n\n16:03.480 --> 16:07.480\nand turn it into what the Boston Globe called\n\n16:07.480 --> 16:11.480\nthe best-managed city in the United States.\n\n16:11.480 --> 16:14.480\nI assume that means the cleanest government in the...\n\n16:14.480 --> 16:17.480\nI don't know, like if I'm about to spit out my gum,\n\n16:17.480 --> 16:19.480\nlike a robot comes by and grabs it,\n\n16:19.480 --> 16:21.480\nor I don't know what does best-managed city mean,\n\n16:21.480 --> 16:22.480\nbut it sounds good.\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:24.480\nSo, I mean, didn't the insurance companies here\n\n16:24.480 --> 16:26.480\nkind of like... didn't they smell a rat?\n\n16:26.480 --> 16:28.480\nOr was everybody profiting off of this?\n\n16:28.480 --> 16:31.480\nI mean, I hear it was a pretty good time\n\n16:31.480 --> 16:33.480\nfor a pretty long time.\n\n16:33.480 --> 16:35.480\nYou're getting nervous.\n\n16:35.480 --> 16:38.480\nThere's a red dot on your forehead.\n\n16:38.480 --> 16:39.480\nThe laser...\n\n16:39.480 --> 16:41.480\nYeah, are we sure there's not a statute of limitations on that?\n\n16:41.480 --> 16:44.480\nYour parents are going to go to jail after this podcast drops?\n\n16:44.480 --> 16:45.480\nShould we arrange that?\n\n16:45.480 --> 16:47.480\nYeah.\n\n16:47.480 --> 16:49.480\nAll right, let's talk about this.\n\n16:49.480 --> 16:51.480\nIt's going to be a new crime wave.\n\n16:51.480 --> 16:53.480\nSomerville's going to be the murder...\n\n16:53.480 --> 16:55.480\nthe falling downstairs capital of the world.\n\n16:55.480 --> 16:58.480\nThe starving artists that flooded into the 90s\n\n16:58.480 --> 17:01.480\nare now realizing that they need to weld something for a living.\n\n17:01.480 --> 17:03.480\nIs there trouble at home?\n\n17:03.480 --> 17:06.480\nI'm just trying to keep up the tradition of, you know,\n\n17:06.480 --> 17:09.480\nmob... mob death.\n\n17:09.480 --> 17:10.480\nI don't know.\n\n17:10.480 --> 17:12.480\nMob whacking your family?\n\n17:12.480 --> 17:15.480\nI'm trying... hey, I'm trying to get made, you know.\n\n17:15.480 --> 17:16.480\nAre you Italian?\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:18.480\nI am, yeah.\n\n17:18.480 --> 17:20.480\nFull 100% Italian?\n\n17:20.480 --> 17:21.480\nSiciliana.\n\n17:21.480 --> 17:23.480\nWow.\n\n17:23.480 --> 17:25.480\nOkay.\n\n17:28.480 --> 17:30.480\nYeah, I know.\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:33.480\nIs there... anybody Polish here?\n\n17:33.480 --> 17:35.480\nI don't know.\n\n17:35.480 --> 17:37.480\nWash your dupa.\n\n17:37.480 --> 17:39.480\nWash your dupa.\n\n17:39.480 --> 17:41.480\nYeah, dup... dupa means butt.\n\n17:41.480 --> 17:43.480\nMy... my... my... my... my... my Boucha,\n\n17:43.480 --> 17:46.480\nmy grandma used to tell me to wash my dupa.\n\n17:46.480 --> 17:47.480\nNice.\n\n17:47.480 --> 17:49.480\nNever tell you about my great-grandma Boucha, Jeff.\n\n17:49.480 --> 17:51.480\nI think you... a little bit.\n\n17:51.480 --> 17:53.480\nShe murdered some people.\n\n17:53.480 --> 17:56.480\nI think it's safe to say now that she's... she's... she's dead.\n\n17:56.480 --> 17:58.480\nI was gonna say, finally dead, but that would sound mean.\n\n17:58.480 --> 18:00.480\nI just mean, finally, in the sense that she lived to, like,\n\n18:00.480 --> 18:02.480\n108 or something.\n\n18:02.480 --> 18:04.480\nAnd she took some fuckers out with her.\n\n18:04.480 --> 18:06.480\nLike, she was a...\n\n18:06.480 --> 18:07.480\nDid she drink the blood or something?\n\n18:07.480 --> 18:09.480\nShe was... she was just hard... she was a...\n\n18:09.480 --> 18:11.480\nshe was a hard drinker. She was a vaudevillian.\n\n18:11.480 --> 18:12.480\nShe was a...\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:14.480\nSound familiar?\n\n18:14.480 --> 18:16.480\nYeah, no, they say, they always said,\n\n18:16.480 --> 18:18.480\nyou should talk to... talk to grandma Boucha.\n\n18:18.480 --> 18:20.480\nYou know, like, you... you guys share something.\n\n18:20.480 --> 18:22.480\nLike, maybe it... maybe it skips two generations.\n\n18:22.480 --> 18:24.480\nLike, whatever you are.\n\n18:24.480 --> 18:26.480\nAnd then I... so I'd go in and,\n\n18:26.480 --> 18:27.480\nwhat was vaudeville like?\n\n18:27.480 --> 18:29.480\nIf she'd go, what the fuck do you think it was like?\n\n18:29.480 --> 18:31.480\nGive me a drink.\n\n18:31.480 --> 18:33.480\nIt was... it was... it was on stage.\n\n18:33.480 --> 18:35.480\nI had an umbrella. It was a poodle. I don't know.\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:37.480\nBut then she would, like, you know,\n\n18:37.480 --> 18:39.480\nwe had to boycott Christmas a lot because she would...\n\n18:39.480 --> 18:41.480\nshe would... she would do one of those things\n\n18:41.480 --> 18:43.480\nwhere she would point at her cheek and say,\n\n18:43.480 --> 18:44.480\ngive me... give me a kiss.\n\n18:44.480 --> 18:46.480\nAnd then she'd swivel into it and, like,\n\n18:46.480 --> 18:49.480\nbasically French her grandsons.\n\n18:49.480 --> 18:51.480\nLike, she was... she was into it.\n\n18:51.480 --> 18:54.480\nWait, didn't she... didn't she, like, stab a dude?\n\n18:54.480 --> 18:56.480\nShe stabbed a dude.\n\n18:56.480 --> 19:00.480\nShe said he fell on the scissors.\n\n19:00.480 --> 19:02.480\nNine times.\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:04.480\nI don't know how you fall on scissors\n\n19:04.480 --> 19:06.480\nnine times in your crotch area.\n\n19:06.480 --> 19:07.480\nOn a trampoline?\n\n19:07.480 --> 19:09.480\nYeah, I think I'm pretty sure.\n\n19:09.480 --> 19:10.480\nBut... and I think that...\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:12.480\nthat was, like, when she was in her 70s,\n\n19:12.480 --> 19:14.480\nso I think the cops thought...\n\n19:14.480 --> 19:16.480\nbecause we were... we were watching a packer game\n\n19:16.480 --> 19:19.480\nin... in Wisconsin and, uh,\n\n19:19.480 --> 19:21.480\nlike, this thing came over the... you know,\n\n19:21.480 --> 19:23.480\nthey'd do local news stuff over the packer game\n\n19:23.480 --> 19:25.480\nand some, you know, some local guy said...\n\n19:25.480 --> 19:28.480\nsaid, oh, here's a human interest piece.\n\n19:28.480 --> 19:32.480\nA 77-year-old woman was being brought in for questioning\n\n19:32.480 --> 19:35.480\nregarding the possible homicide of a...\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:37.480\nof her roommate.\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:39.480\nSounds funny.\n\n19:39.480 --> 19:41.480\nAnd we all joked in the living room,\n\n19:41.480 --> 19:43.480\nlike, oh, Grandma Boucher.\n\n19:43.480 --> 19:45.480\nAnd then the phone rang.\n\n19:45.480 --> 19:47.480\nAnd it was the police.\n\n19:47.480 --> 19:49.480\nAnd it was, like, her one phone call.\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:52.480\nAnd, like, she had, like, she had had a quarrel\n\n19:52.480 --> 19:54.480\nwith this lover of hers that she was living with.\n\n19:54.480 --> 19:57.480\nAnd then we don't know what happened from there,\n\n19:57.480 --> 19:59.480\nbut we know it ended with him dying\n\n19:59.480 --> 20:02.480\nafter receiving a few... a few punctures\n\n20:02.480 --> 20:05.480\nwith a pair of scissors below his waistline.\n\n20:05.480 --> 20:06.480\nOh!\n\n20:06.480 --> 20:08.480\nAnd I think that the cops thought,\n\n20:08.480 --> 20:10.480\nshe's 70, any sentence is a life sentence,\n\n20:10.480 --> 20:11.480\nlet her go.\n\n20:11.480 --> 20:13.480\nAnd she... and she went on a fucking spree\n\n20:13.480 --> 20:15.480\nfor 30 years.\n\n20:15.480 --> 20:17.480\n14 people dead.\n\n20:17.480 --> 20:19.480\nLike, they're starting to...\n\n20:19.480 --> 20:21.480\nGrandma Boucher's amazing, like, she...\n\n20:21.480 --> 20:23.480\nI have news items on tape.\n\n20:23.480

Mima, and, you know,\n\n21:39.480 --> 21:41.480\nsome people say Pop Pop for, like, Grandpa.\n\n21:41.480 --> 21:42.480\nIt's like...\n\n21:42.480 --> 21:44.480\nBoucher, she was Grandma Boucher,\n\n21:44.480 --> 21:45.480\nso she was Grandma Grandma.\n\n21:45.480 --> 21:47.480\nYeah.\n\n21:47.480 --> 21:49.480\nYeah, yeah, she's 600.\n\n21:49.480 --> 21:51.480\nSo she...\n\n21:51.480 --> 21:53.480\nShe was on the news again,\n\n21:53.480 --> 21:57.480\ndecades after successfully murdering a man.\n\n22:00.480 --> 22:02.480\nThis blows my mind.\n\n22:02.480 --> 22:03.480\nShe...\n\n22:03.480 --> 22:06.480\nSomeone tried to steal her microwave.\n\n22:06.480 --> 22:08.480\nWe think it was like a drinking buddy\n\n22:08.480 --> 22:10.480\nthat she owed money to, and, like...\n\n22:10.480 --> 22:11.480\nShe was 90?\n\n22:11.480 --> 22:13.480\nShe was, like, at least 90, yeah,\n\n22:13.480 --> 22:14.480\nsomething like that.\n\n22:14.480 --> 22:16.480\nAwesome.\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:19.480\nAnd she had a scuffle with this person\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:21.480\nthat tried to steal her microwave,\n\n22:21.480 --> 22:24.480\nand the person took a butcher knife\n\n22:24.480 --> 22:27.480\nand slashed her in the throat.\n\n22:27.480 --> 22:30.480\nIt's a happy ending.\n\n22:30.480 --> 22:32.480\nDepending on where you fall on,\n\n22:32.480 --> 22:35.480\nGrandma Boucher being out there.\n\n22:35.480 --> 22:37.480\nMaybe not for the police, it's not a happy ending.\n\n22:37.480 --> 22:41.480\nNot for the DA.\n\n22:41.480 --> 22:43.480\nThat she...\n\n22:43.480 --> 22:44.480\nAnd then she...\n\n22:44.480 --> 22:46.480\nAccording to her recollection of the event,\n\n22:46.480 --> 22:48.480\nlike, she was...\n\n22:48.480 --> 22:50.480\nThis person got away with the microwave,\n\n22:50.480 --> 22:51.480\nslashed her in the throat,\n\n22:51.480 --> 22:52.480\nand she was laying there for a while.\n\n22:52.480 --> 22:54.480\nIt was like, oh, someone will come find me.\n\n22:54.480 --> 22:55.480\nAnd then she thought,\n\n22:55.480 --> 22:57.480\nno one's gonna come find me.\n\n22:57.480 --> 22:59.480\nI'm Grandma Boucher.\n\n22:59.480 --> 23:00.480\nSo she got up,\n\n23:00.480 --> 23:02.480\nwrapped a towel around her neck,\n\n23:02.480 --> 23:04.480\nand walked to the emergency room,\n\n23:04.480 --> 23:07.480\nwhere they sewed her neck back up.\n\n23:07.480 --> 23:10.480\nAnd there's a tape\n\n23:10.480 --> 23:12.480\nthat circulates among my family\n\n23:12.480 --> 23:14.480\nof the local news report that's like,\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:16.480\noh, they didn't know.\n\n23:16.480 --> 23:18.480\nThey should have done their research\n\n23:18.480 --> 23:20.480\nand made this into more of a character,\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:22.480\nbut this is a whole new generation of news reporters\n\n23:22.480 --> 23:24.480\njust going, hey, here's a funny thing.\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:26.480\nThere's a really old lady got slashed on the throat,\n\n23:26.480 --> 23:28.480\nand she lived, and she wrapped the towel,\n\n23:28.480 --> 23:30.480\nand then they show this doctor.\n\n23:30.480 --> 23:31.480\nThey get the statement from him,\n\n23:31.480 --> 23:33.480\nand you can see the emergency room behind him,\n\n23:33.480 --> 23:35.480\ngiving a statement, and he's just looking at his face,\n\n23:35.480 --> 23:37.480\nlike he just watched an episode of The Monsters\n\n23:37.480 --> 23:38.480\nor something like that.\n\n23:38.480 --> 23:40.480\nHe doesn't know what, he's going,\n\n23:40.480 --> 23:42.480\na woman came in,\n\n23:42.480 --> 23:45.480\nand about 90 years old,\n\n23:45.480 --> 23:48.480\nand she had her neck slashed,\n\n23:48.480 --> 23:50.480\nlike all the way across,\n\n23:50.480 --> 23:53.480\nand I put some stitches in it,\n\n23:53.480 --> 23:56.480\nand she left.\n\n23:56.480 --> 23:58.480\nAnd he's so confused,\n\n23:58.480 --> 24:01.480\nbecause everything he's learned about medicine\n\n24:01.480 --> 24:03.480\nhas gone out the window.\n\n24:03.480 --> 24:05.480\nBut the weird thing was,\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:07.480\nshe left through the air conditioning duct in the ceiling.\n\n24:07.480 --> 24:11.480\nI think I just, I patched a golem?\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:13.480\nI don't know what I did.\n\n24:13.480 --> 24:15.480\nWas it masonry that I did?\n\n24:15.480 --> 24:17.480\nAlright, anyways, back to you, Kara.\n\n24:17.480 --> 24:19.480\nDid you get off on that tangent?\n\n24:19.480 --> 24:22.480\nWe're in polite company, I should start.\n\n24:22.480 --> 24:24.480\nSorry.\n\n24:24.480 --> 24:26.480\nAlright, Kara, what can we do for you\n\n24:26.480 --> 24:28.480\nbefore you leave us?\n\n24:28.480 --> 24:30.480\nLet's reward you for coming up here\n\n24:30.480 --> 24:32.480\nand possibly incriminating yourself and your family.\n\n24:32.480 --> 24:35.480\nWas this some Harmontown wish fulfillment up here?\n\n24:35.480 --> 24:38.480\nYeah, yeah, like, what, what, I don't know,\n\n24:38.480 --> 24:41.480\nI could go, what's your big ambition in life?\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:44.480\nLike, what's your unfulfilled?\n\n24:44.480 --> 24:46.480\nUnfulfilled ambition.\n\n24:46.480 --> 24:48.480\nI'm a costume designer.\n\n24:48.480 --> 24:50.480\nAnd so do you want to be a big time costume designer?\n\n24:50.480 --> 24:51.480\nYeah, that'd be great.\n\n24:51.480 --> 24:53.480\nWhat does that entail?\n\n24:53.480 --> 24:55.480\nBeing just about as poor as I am now,\n\n24:55.480 --> 24:57.480\nbut probably in New York.\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:00.480\nYou do it for film or for print or fashion?\n\n25:00.480 --> 25:01.480\nTheater?\n\n25:01.480 --> 25:02.480\nYeah.\n\n25:02.480 --> 25:05.480\nAlright, so, and currently you do it here locally?\n\n25:05.480 --> 25:06.480\nYeah.\n\n25:06.480 --> 25:08.480\nOh, okay, and do you pay your rent doing it?\n\n25:08.480 --> 25:09.480\nYeah, just about.\n\n25:09.480 --> 25:13.480\nI have a day job at a self-defense non-profit.\n\n25:13.480 --> 25:15.480\nA self-defense non-profit?\n\n25:15.480 --> 25:16.480\nYes.\n\n25:16.480 --> 25:19.480\nBut that's not a very good day job, it's a non-profit.\n\n25:19.480 --> 25:21.480\nIt's true, it's all...\n\n25:21.480 --> 25:23.480\nYou keep looking at your time card and going,\n\n25:23.480 --> 25:25.480\nGod, am I doing this wrong?\n\n25:25.480 --> 25:27.480\nSliding in the machine?\n\n25:27.480 --> 25:29.480\nIt's a non-profit, Kara.\n\n25:29.480 --> 25:32.480\nOkay, so, alright, I think we can...\n\n25:32.480 --> 25:36.480\nLet's thank Kara for coming up and let's reward her.\n\n25:36.480 --> 25:38.480\nThank you, Kara.\n\n25:38.480 --> 25:41.480\nThank you for making that t-shirt.\n\n25:41.480 --> 25:42.480\nYou can...\n\n25:42.480 --> 25:43.480\nSit down, Kara.\n\n25:43.480 --> 25:44.480\nOkay, bye.\n\n25:44.480 --> 25:45.480\nI didn't know...\n\n25:45.480 --> 25:46.480\nWe're from Los Angeles.\n\n25:46.480 --> 25:49.480\nWe have, like, showbiz shorthand.\n\n25:49.480 --> 25:53.480\nWhen you thank someone, it means fuck off.\n\n25:53.480 --> 25:56.480\nWhen you say I love it, it means I don't...\n\n25:56.480 --> 25:58.480\nI didn't see it.\n\n25:58.480 --> 25:59.480\nYeah.\n\n25:59.480 --> 26:02.480\nI'm not gonna say anything about it until someone else says something about it\n\n26:02.480 --> 26:05.480\nand then I can see whether I can make money off of it.\n\n26:05.480 --> 26:08.480\nBut, no, we would never say fuck off to Kara.\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:10.480\nThank you, Kara.\n\n26:10.480 --> 26:12.480\nSo, let's do...\n\n26:12.480 --> 26:13.480\nLet's just do the...\n\n26:13.480 --> 26:14.480\nLet's do her big movie.\n\n26:14.480 --> 26:16.480\nLet's do her biopic.\n\n26:16.480 --> 26:17.480\nIs it Kara or Kara?\n\n26:17.480 --> 26:18.480\nKara.\n\n26:18.480 --> 26:19.480\nKara.\n\n26:19.480 --> 26:27.480\nThe story of Kara going from being a down-and-out Somerville costume designer,\n\n26:27.480 --> 26:33.480\nworking at a nonprofit for a self-defense organization,\n\n26:33.480 --> 26:35.480\nand making it big.\n\n26:35.480 --> 26:36.480\nHere it is.\n\n26:36.480 --> 26:38.480\nIt's gonna be four minutes long.\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:51.480\nI love it.\n\n26:51.480 --> 26:59.480\nI'm at a sewing machine.\n\n26:59.480 --> 27:01.480\nOh, God.\n\n27:01.480 --> 27:02.480\nKara?\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:04.480\nYes, Mr. Haberstrom.\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:06.480\nI have some bad news for you.\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:11.480\nYour parents, that are both in jail for fraud,\n\n27:11.480 --> 27:15.480\nthey were murdered by Grandma Boucher.\n\n27:15.480 --> 27:17.480\nThey'll finally...\n\n27:17.480 --> 27:18.480\nWait, wait.\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:19.480\nWas there any payout?\n\n27:19.480 --> 27:20.480\nNope.\n\n27:20.480 --> 27:24.480\nOh, damn, my Italian blood.\n\n27:24.480 --> 27:29.480\nGet back to work and sew those socks.\n\n27:29.480 --> 27:35.480\nI should have stole my own cars like Dad.\n\n27:35.480 --> 27:36.480\nUgh.\n\n27:36.480 --> 27:40.480\nWhat chance does an honest girl like me have in this racket?\n\n27:40.480 --> 27:41.480\nHarmontown tickets.\n\n27:41.480 --> 27:43.480\nGet your Harmontown tickets.\n\n27:43.480 --> 27:46.480\nBig famous screenwriter from Hollywood, California.\n\n27:46.480 --> 27:49.480\nComing out to Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\n27:49.480 --> 27:52.480\nMaking dreams come true.\n\n27:52.480 --> 27:53.480\nHarmontown.\n\n27:53.480 --> 27:58.480\nThat's the podcast I get off to.\n\n27:58.480 --> 28:02.480\nSir, sir, I'm just a poor costume designer.\n\n28:02.480 --> 28:03.480\nI only work in Somerville.\n\n28:03.480 --> 28:06.480\nEveryone basically wears whatever they want here.\n\n28:06.480 --> 28:09.480\nYou should come on down to Harmontown.\n\n28:09.480 --> 28:15.480\nI gotta warn you, the tickets are pretty overpriced for the content value.\n\n28:15.480 --> 28:21.480\nSeems to me, just two jackasses grab assing for an hour and a half.\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:24.480\nGuy rapping about fucking everybody's mama.\n\n28:24.480 --> 28:26.480\nThat's not show business.\n\n28:26.480 --> 28:29.480\nGet a real job.\n\n28:29.480 --> 28:30.480\nDon't follow your dreams.\n\n28:30.480 --> 28:32.480\nI'm a threshold guardian.\n\n28:32.480 --> 28:34.480\nFuck you, stranger.\n\n28:34.480 --> 28:36.480\nYou're wrong, mister.\n\n28:36.480 --> 28:38.480\nI leave, but I accidentally drop a Harmontown ticket.\n\n28:38.480 --> 28:41.480\nBut one stupid Italian piece of shit.\n\n28:41.480 --> 28:42.480\nFuck her.\n\n28:42.480 --> 28:44.480\nI got shit to do.\n\n28:44.480 --> 28:51.480\nI got a worthless ticket to a relatively worthless show.\n\n28:51.480 --> 28:56.480\nI'm gonna go to Chinese D's where everyone else wants to go.\n\n28:56.480 --> 29:01.480\nEverybody put your hands together for Dad Harmontown.\n\n29:01.480 --> 29:03.480\nHey, Somerville.\n\n29:03.480 --> 29:05.480\nWaka, waka, waka.\n\n29:05.480 --> 29:08.480\nI farted the other day.\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:10.480\nIt was so interesting.\n\n29:10.480 --> 29:12.480\nI got fired from community.\n\n29:12.480 --> 29:15.480\nBooty-dooty-booty-doo.\n\n29:15.480 --> 29:17.480\nOh, my God.\n\n29:17.480 --> 29:18.480\nIt's two years later.\n\n29:18.480 --> 29:22.480\nI'm Kara, but now I'm taller and better looking.\n\n29:22.480 --> 29:25.480\nThis guy, God, I just had four orgasms on that content.\n\n29:25.480 --> 29:27.480\nAnd the tangent, he went off on.\n\n29:27.480 --> 29:32.480\nChevy Chase.\n\n29:32.480 --> 29:35.480\nCan I come up on stage?\n\n29:35.480 --> 29:40.480\nAnd then I saw her.\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:45.480\nThat's when I saw her.\n\n29:45.480 --> 29:46.480\nOh, my God.\n\n29:46.480 --> 29:50.480\nSorry, I just came again.\n\n29:50.480 --> 29:51.480\nWhat's your name, ma'am?\n\n29:51.480 --> 29:53.480\nKara.\n\n29:53.480 --> 29:58.480\nGrubetz Leoni.\n\n29:58.480 --> 30:00.480\nTen minutes later, at the end of the show.\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:05.480\nOh.\n\n30:05.480 --> 30:07.480\nDo I get the job?\n\n30:07.480 --> 30:12.480\nYes.\n\n30:12.480 --> 30:14.480\nAll right.\n\n30:14.480 --> 30:16.480\nWell, that seemed...\n\n30:16.480 --> 30:17.480\nI don't know.\n\n30:17.480 --> 30:19.480\nThat felt...\n\n30:19.480 --> 30:20.480\nThat felt raucous.\n\n30:20.480 --> 30:23.480\nThat felt inappropriate.\n\n30:23.480 --> 30:25.480\nIt felt...\n\n30:25.480 --> 30:26.480\nIt wasn't happy, I think.\n\n30:26.480 --> 30:27.480\nYeah, it wasn't happy.\n\n30:27.480 --> 30:28.480\nIt wasn't happy.\n\n30:28.480 --> 30:29.480\nGet it?\n\n30:29.480 --> 30:30.480\nOh.\n\n30:30.480 --> 30:31.480\nThey're moving grossly.\n\n30:31.480 --> 30:32.480\nWait.\n\n30:32.480 --> 30:34.480\nThere's a fine line we're treading here.\n\n30:34.480 --> 30:36.480\nWait, you were about to go to another beat.\n\n30:36.480 --> 30:39.480\nWhere were you going to take it before I did a cheap shot?\n\n30:39.480 --> 30:40.480\nIf I had done it, it would have been...\n\n30:40.480 --> 30:42.480\nBecause I was thinking we were crossing the threshold of a love story.\n\n30:42.480 --> 30:44.480\nAnd then we would have gotten an apartment together.\n\n30:44.480 --> 30:47.480\nI would have probably thrown an ashtray at her and accidentally killed her.\n\n30:47.480 --> 30:49.480\nI don't know.\n\n30:49.480 --> 30:52.480\nI was thinking to myself, it was like Richard Gere in a thriller.\n\n30:52.480 --> 30:54.480\nYour choice was better.\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:55.480\nIt was better.\n\n30:55.480 --> 30:56.480\nIt was way better.\n\n30:56.480 --> 31:00.480\nI said four minutes, you delivered.\n\n31:00.480 --> 31:01.480\nI don't...\n\n31:01.480 --> 31:05.480\nJeff, don't go to me for the professional entertainment.\n\n31:05.480 --> 31:08.480\nI'm just saying, Kara, your path is clear tonight.\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:12.480\nThat's not.\n\n31:12.480 --> 31:17.480\nOr any man or woman here looking for a job in Hollywood.\n\n31:17.480 --> 31:19.480\nI have a perfect girlfriend.\n\n31:19.480 --> 31:24.480\nWe'll check in with her later about how our relationship is holding up to this tour.\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:30.480\nI wanted to talk to you, Jeff, about the...\n\n31:30.480 --> 31:31.480\nOkay.\n\n31:31.480 --> 31:32.480\nAll right.\n\n31:32.480 --> 31:33.480\nWe have...\n\n31:33.480 --> 31:37.480\nI don't know if we roll into this now, because we just had a guest up here.\n\n31:37.480 --> 31:43.480\nBut you guys listen to the podcast and...\n\n31:43.480 --> 31:52.480\nSo there's this guy, Adam Goldberg, who's in the show, kind of by sheer force of will.\n\n31:52.480 --> 31:54.480\nHe's in the show.\n\n31:54.480 --> 31:59.480\nHe described his origin story for the people that don't know him from the podcast.\n\n31:59.480 --> 32:01.480\nHe's this kid who...\n\n32:01.480 --> 32:03.480\nI guess he was like an extra in community.\n\n32:03.480 --> 32:04.480\nThat's what he said.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:09.480\nHis origins are, I pulled him out of the audience to read some of my brother's emails.\n\n32:09.480 --> 32:13.480\nAnd I went to go get another drink, and then he...\n\n32:13.480 --> 32:19.480\nSpeaking of which, the law says we're not allowed to have our bottle of kettle up here.\n\n32:19.480 --> 32:20.480\nCan we...\n\n32:20.480 --> 32:22.480\nI don't know who our dedicated server is.\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:24.480\nIs it the guy I wiped out with the door?\n\n32:24.480 --> 32:25.480\nCan it...\n\n32:25.480 --> 32:26.480\nWith ice?\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:27.480\nTwo.\n\n32:27.480 --> 32:28.480\nTwo?\n\n32:28.480 --> 32:29.480\nTwo?\n\n32:29.480 --> 32:33.480\nJust the swish of that John Ritter door.\n\n32:33.480 --> 32:36.480\nThat's the only answer.\n\n32:36.480 --> 32:38.480\nI mean, we can have a bucket of...\n\n32:38.480 --> 32:40.480\nIt's so weird, the laws.\n\n32:40.480 --> 32:41.480\nIt's different everywhere.\n\n32:41.480 --> 32:43.480\nEvery city has fucked up laws about liquor.\n\n32:43.480 --> 32:50.480\nWe were in Atlanta where they had just recently overcome the idea that you couldn't buy liquor on Sunday, period.\n\n32:50.480 --> 32:51.480\nI forget.\n\n32:51.480 --> 32:52.480\nIt was in some city.\n\n32:52.480 --> 32:55.480\nThey were, believe me, like, it's like these...\n\n32:55.480 --> 32:58.480\nYeah, it's like, how does it...\n\n32:58.480 --> 33:00.480\nI don't even know what to say about it.\n\n33:00.480 --> 33:01.480\nIt's insane.\n\n33:01.480 --> 33:03.480\nPeople are going to stop making laws, man.\n\n33:03.480 --> 33:12.480\nThey have that program where we're turning Russian nukes into nuclear reactors for America.\n\n33:12.480 --> 33:16.480\nIt's called something like megatons to megawatts or something like that.\n\n33:16.480 --> 33:19.480\nIt's like a program which is really just in your fucking face.\n\n33:19.480 --> 33:20.480\nWe won the Cold War.\n\n33:20.480 --> 33:25.480\nGive us all your dicks and we're going to turn them into toothbrush runners.\n\n33:25.480 --> 33:35.480\nWe're just going to use your old world penises to now just make our seal-y, posture-pedic beds work.\n\n33:35.480 --> 33:39.480\nIt's pretty brutal end to the Cold War.\n\n33:39.480 --> 33:42.480\nThat's an example.\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:46.480\nDisarmament, sometimes we realize that we've stockpiled too much shit.\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:48.480\nWe need to start reducing it a little bit.\n\n33:48.480 --> 33:49.480\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n33:49.480 --> 33:50.480\nWhat

laws and boil them down into a couple of simple rules?\n\n34:06.480 --> 34:08.480\nDon't be a dick and stuff.\n\n34:08.480 --> 34:11.480\nYeah, well, one guy tried it and they put him on a cross.\n\n34:16.480 --> 34:17.480\nToo soon.\n\n34:17.480 --> 34:18.480\nOh, thank you. Perfect.\n\n34:20.480 --> 34:21.480\nToo soon.\n\n34:21.480 --> 34:24.480\nMuch too late.\n\n34:24.480 --> 34:28.480\nBut it was too late like the next day.\n\n34:30.480 --> 34:36.480\nYeah, well, you know what? Hey, maybe it's time for a lazy Jesus that doesn't get crucified to come through.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:41.480\nAnd instead of getting killed, maybe I could just live to 80 and tell people what to do.\n\n34:41.480 --> 34:43.480\nI'll volunteer.\n\n34:43.480 --> 34:47.480\nThat's a form of crucifixion, like playing video games and masturbating.\n\n34:47.480 --> 34:50.480\nYou do actually have kind of a Christ complex, don't you?\n\n34:50.480 --> 34:53.480\nYeah, yeah, I feel burdened by these people's niche.\n\n34:57.480 --> 34:59.480\nTalk about armaments.\n\n34:59.480 --> 35:01.480\nWe got a vodka stockpile.\n\n35:01.480 --> 35:04.480\nSo the rules say we can't have a bottle up on the table, but we can't.\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:07.480\nSo we can just have a choo-choo train of...\n\n35:09.480 --> 35:14.480\nSo whatever that law was protecting, whatever good it was doing, like how is that?\n\n35:14.480 --> 35:20.480\nYou know, ostensibly there's a 19-year-old girl in the audience deciding whether or not drinking is cool.\n\n35:20.480 --> 35:26.480\nGod forbid she see that bottle, but this is going to make it so much harder for her to go down my path.\n\n35:29.480 --> 35:31.480\nDid you bring them, sir?\n\n35:31.480 --> 35:32.480\nWhat's your name?\n\n35:32.480 --> 35:33.480\nMatt.\n\n35:33.480 --> 35:34.480\nMatt, everybody.\n\n35:34.480 --> 35:36.480\nDid I hit you with the door?\n\n35:36.480 --> 35:38.480\nSorry, Matt. Are you okay?\n\n35:38.480 --> 35:40.480\nCan you come up and tell everyone you're okay?\n\n35:40.480 --> 35:44.480\nTo ask you to do that?\n\n35:47.480 --> 35:48.480\nI'm fine.\n\n35:48.480 --> 35:50.480\nI'm actually doing pretty well today.\n\n35:50.480 --> 35:51.480\nOkay.\n\n35:51.480 --> 35:52.480\nYou didn't hit me that hard.\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:53.480\nOkay.\n\n35:53.480 --> 35:55.480\nWere you standing in front of the door because you were going to open it for me?\n\n35:55.480 --> 35:58.480\nI was. I was about to serve one of my tables.\n\n35:58.480 --> 36:01.480\nThat would have been the first cool...\n\n36:01.480 --> 36:06.480\nNo one ever opened a door for me, and I just banged into him.\n\n36:06.480 --> 36:10.480\nHe was going to go like this, like I'm Batman or something, and he's Alfred.\n\n36:10.480 --> 36:14.480\nHe was going to go like, here you are, and I fucked him up.\n\n36:14.480 --> 36:16.480\nWhat'd you say?\n\n36:16.480 --> 36:17.480\nRestart.\n\n36:17.480 --> 36:18.480\nRestart?\n\n36:18.480 --> 36:20.480\nOh, well, I don't know.\n\n36:20.480 --> 36:22.480\nSomebody said restart, let him open the door for you.\n\n36:22.480 --> 36:25.480\nI think the ratio of time spent to entertainment received...\n\n36:25.480 --> 36:26.480\nI don't know.\n\n36:26.480 --> 36:30.480\nIt's hard to make a judgment call there, but then again you go, why are you bringing him up on stage?\n\n36:30.480 --> 36:34.480\nHow do you explain the first 40 minutes of your show?\n\n36:34.480 --> 36:38.480\nThank you very much.\n\n36:38.480 --> 36:40.480\nEveryone's a critic.\n\n36:40.480 --> 36:41.480\nBecause I mean...\n\n36:41.480 --> 36:44.480\nWhy don't you go watch Good Will Hunting again?\n\n36:44.480 --> 36:46.480\nInception.\n\n36:46.480 --> 36:48.480\nInception, yes.\n\n36:48.480 --> 36:50.480\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n36:50.480 --> 36:52.480\nYou didn't buy a ticket to this ride.\n\n36:52.480 --> 36:55.480\nHow long have you worked here?

Providence, Rhode Island?\n\n40:38.480 --> 40:40.480\nThis is the segment of the show where we ask for shit.\n\n40:40.480 --> 40:42.480\nYeah, we'll be in Rhode Island.\n\n40:42.480 -->

and safety pins.\n\n41:02.480 --> 41:03.480\nOkay, all right.\n\n41:03.480 --> 41:06.480\nSo if you're coming to Rhode Island, are you listening?\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:09.480\nCome with a

Let's Make a Deal.\n\n41:44.480 --> 41:46.480\nI didn't mean gypsies as an ethnic phrase.\n\n41:46.480 --> 41:50.480\nI think that's become an offensive ethnic term.\n\n41:50.480 --> 41:57.480\nI just meant traveling vendors of fortune telling and werewolf curses.\n\n41:57.480 --> 42:00.480\nThis show brought to you by the all-new Oral B Advantage.\n\n42:00.480 --> 42:01.480\nHoly

toothbrushes at your home.\n\n42:29.480 --> 42:30.480\nYeah.\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:34.480\nIt's not a competition, ma'am.\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:36.480\nYou really work for a toothbrush company?\n\n42:36.480 --> 42:37.480\nYeah.\n\n42:37.480 --> 42:38.480\nOh.\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:42.480\nSo you have a factory of toothbrushes and Brighton.\n\n42:42.480 --> 42:48.480\nWere they being cutesy by putting it in Brighton?\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:51.480\nMy question is, were they being cutesy?\n\n42:51.480 --> 42:53.480\nI wasn't being cutesy.\n\n42:53.480 --> 42:54.480\nYou can't groan me.\n\n42:54.480 --> 42:57.480\nThis woman right here works in a dental office.\n\n42:57.480 --> 42:59.480\nLet's get them up and have them fight.\n\n42:59.480 --> 43:01.480\nWe didn't know until now.\n\n43:01.480 --> 43:07.480\nWe didn't know that we could put you motherfuckers to work like this.\n\n43:07.480 --> 43:08.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:09.480\nWell, we are humble people.\n\n43:09.480 --> 43:13.480\nWe live in a world where bus boys shake us down for 50 bucks.\n\n43:13.480 --> 43:16.480\nThat's the treatment we're used to.\n\n43:16.480 --> 43:18.480\nThis much love we're not used to.\n\n43:18.480 --> 43:20.480\nI think it's a bad rap.\n\n43:20.480 --> 43:21.480\nWe're really nice.\n\n43:21.480 --> 43:25.480\nOh, no, no, no, I didn't mean Boston.\n\n43:25.480 --> 43:27.480\nOh, nobody's ripping on Boston.\n\n43:27.480 --> 43:28.480\nBoston's ripping on everybody.\n\n43:28.480 --> 43:32.480\nOh, that's an example of ripping on

friends from Boston in LA.\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:16.480\nThey have a certain swagger that reminds us of shitty Matt Damon movies.\n\n44:16.480 --> 44:18.480\nIs Jen Kirkman from Boston?\n\n44:18.480 --> 44:19.480\nYeah.\n\n44:19.480 --> 44:20.480\nI don't know.\n\n44:20.480 --> 44:21.480\nJen Kirkman's a good friend of ours.\n\n44:21.480 --> 44:22.480\nLowell.\n\n44:22.480 --> 44:23.480\nWhat?\n\n44:23.480 --> 44:24.480\nWhat?\n\n44:24.480 --> 44:25.480\nLowell.\n\n44:25.480 --> 44:26.480\nOh, Lowell.\n\n44:26.480 --> 44:27.480\nYeah.\n\n44:27.480 --> 44:30.480\nIs this one of those towns in Massachusetts\n\n44:30.480 --> 44:33.480\nwhere the science is now entering Somerville?\n\n44:33.480 --> 44:35.480\nBut it's really funny when like now entering Beverly,\n\n44:35.480 --> 44:39.480\nwhich sounds like a porn title.\n\n44:39.480 --> 44:43.480\nJessica, Massachusetts.\n\n44:43.480 --> 44:44.480\nAll right.\n\n44:44.480 --> 44:45.480\nSo I got it off on a lot of tangents there\n\n44:45.480 --> 44:47.480\nbecause we were about to...\n\n44:47.480 --> 44:49.480\nWe got this guy, Adam Goldberg.\n\n44:49.480 --> 44:50.480\nWow.\n\n44:50.480 --> 44:52.480\nRemember?\n\n44:52.480 --> 44:57.480\nThe greatest adventure is what lies ahead.\n\n44:57.480 --> 45:02.480\nRemember at 8.15 when I mentioned Adam Goldberg?\n\n45:02.480 --> 45:05.480\nHe's like a regular in the LA shows.\n\n45:05.480 --> 45:06.480\nHe's like this.\n\n45:06.480 --> 45:09.480\nIt's like, you know how Indiana Jones had bellock?\n\n45:09.480 --> 45:12.480\nLike every hero has a shadow he casts.\n\n45:12.480 --> 45:14.480\nAnd you don't know whether to like him\n\n45:14.480 --> 45:16.480\nor he's like a brother demon.\n\n45:16.480 --> 45:20.480\nYou know, like a lot of my fans are self-styled Dan Harmon's\n\n45:20.480 --> 45:24.480\nlike talented writers who can't make eye contact.\n\n45:24.480 --> 45:27.480\nAnd like a lot of my conversations with my fans\n\n45:27.480 --> 45:29.480\nlook like two guys staring at the floor\n\n45:29.480 --> 45:32.480\nand accidentally insulting each other back and forth.\n\n45:32.480 --> 45:35.480\nLike guys, there's a lot of...\n\n45:35.480 --> 45:37.480\nHey, well no, it's not just you.\n\n45:37.480 --> 45:39.480\nI was thinking about you.\n\n45:39.480 --> 45:42.480\nBut yeah, it's kind of...\n\n45:42.480 --> 45:45.480\nI'm an awkward person and I have an awkward flock\n\n45:45.480 --> 45:48.480\nSo Adam is this little guy and he comes up on stage\n\n45:48.480 --> 45:50.480\nand the Harmontown like clearly we've proven that\n\n45:50.480 --> 45:52.480\nlike people, like a lot of it is people coming up\n\n45:52.480 --> 45:55.480\nand like us getting to know who's out there and stuff.\n\n45:55.480 --> 45:58.480\nAnd now Adam has got this sort of swagger now\n\n45:58.480 --> 46:01.480\nthat he just kind of storms the stage like a spool.\n\n46:01.480 --> 46:03.480\nHe's become our hamburger.\n\n46:03.480 --> 46:07.480\nLike in the mythology, like he's like a guy.\n\n46:07.480 --> 46:10.480\nPeople in the live LA audiences don't like him\n\n46:10.480 --> 46:12.480\nas much as the podcast listeners\n\n46:12.480 --> 46:14.480\nbecause people in the live LA audiences\n\n46:14.480 --> 46:16.480\nare sitting next to the stage and they're like,\n\n46:16.480 --> 46:18.480\nI could get up there too but I don't, you're a dick.\n\n46:18.480 --> 46:20.480\nBut people listening are going,\n\n46:20.480 --> 46:22.480\nI can't ever get up there so he's my hero.\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:24.480\nHe's like one of those bomb diffusing robots\n\n46:24.480 --> 46:27.480\nlike just putting himself into the hurt locker every time.\n\n46:27.480 --> 46:30.480\nAnd then we're mean to him\n\n46:30.480 --> 46:32.480\nand then he comes back for more and we like him\n\n46:32.480 --> 46:34.480\nand it's like are we being Howard Stern\n\n46:34.480 --> 46:36.480\nor is that good or bad?\n\n46:36.480 --> 46:38.480\nIs this guy a genius or an idiot?\n\n46:38.480 --> 46:40.480\nIs he a hero or a villain?\n\n46:40.480 --> 46:42.480\nIt seems to be kind of like a weird...\n\n46:42.480 --> 46:44.480\namong our audience.\n\n46:44.480 --> 46:46.480\nSome people really like support and love him.\n\n46:46.480 --> 46:48.480\nSome people don't know.\n\n46:48.480 --> 46:50.480\nSome people wish he wouldn't do that so much.\n\n46:50.480 --> 46:52.480\nWe don't really know where it stands.\n\n46:52.480 --> 46:54.480\nAnd we're fascinated with him and that's the important thing.\n\n46:54.480 --> 46:56.480\nBut more important than that.\n\n46:56.480 --> 46:58.480\nTonight, here in Somerville,\n\n46:58.480 --> 47:00.480\nit turns out, no, no,\n\n47:00.480 --> 47:02.480\nAdam's not with us for the simple reason\n\n47:02.480 --> 47:04.480\nthat we have a special unit\n\n47:04.480 --> 47:06.480\nof the police check the bottom of the bus every night\n\n47:06.480 --> 47:08.480\nwith what I call\n\n47:08.480 --> 47:10.480\nCape Fear Mirrors.\n\n47:10.480 --> 47:12.480\nAdam is not here.\n\n47:12.480 --> 47:14.480\nBut Adam Goldberg's\n\n47:14.480 --> 47:16.480\ntwo brothers are here.\n\n47:16.480 --> 47:18.480\nAdam Goldberg's two brothers are here.\n\n47:18.480 --> 47:20.480\nAdam Goldberg's two brothers are here.\n\n47:20.480 --> 47:22.480\nNoah and\n\n47:22.480 --> 47:24.480\nand Harry?\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:26.480\nAre you guys willing to come up?\n\n47:26.480 --> 47:28.480\nNoah and Harry?\n\n47:28.480

47:36.480\nHello.\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:38.480\nHoly crap, wait.\n\n47:38.480 --> 47:40.480\nHere we go.\n\n47:40.480 --> 47:42.480\nThere you go.\n\n47:42.480 --> 47:44.480\nShake your hand.\n\n47:44.480 --> 47:46.480\nNoah.\n\n47:46.480 --> 47:48.480\nHe said, I don't know if I should shake your hand.\n\n47:48.480 --> 47:50.480\nI've listened to you.\n\n47:50.480 --> 47:52.480\nIt's always been a little bit nicer.\n\n47:52.480 --> 47:54.480\nJeff's always been the one to really just\n\n47:54.480 --> 47:56.480\nshit pretty hard.\n\n47:56.480 --> 47:58.480\nReally? Well, Jeff will say stuff like\n\n47:58.480 --> 48:00.480\nshut the fuck up, Adam. Get off stage.\n\n48:00.480 --> 48:02.480\nRight.\n\n48:02.480 --> 48:04.480\nAnd Dan will say, please shut the fuck up.\n\n48:04.480 --> 48:06.480\nRight. Or I'll say\n\n48:06.480 --> 48:08.480\nlike, well, we're all Adam Goldberg a little bit.\n\n48:08.480 --> 48:10.480\nLike, you know, like, at what point do I,\n\n48:10.480 --> 48:12.480\nyou know, where does the bully become the victim?\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:14.480\nMy question, like,\n\n48:14.480 --> 48:16.480\nwe love Adam, but we kind of\n\n48:16.480 --> 48:18.480\nhate him a little bit, too.\n\n48:18.480 --> 48:20.480\nSo are we all right? Are you listening, Adam?\n\n48:20.480 --> 48:22.480\nYeah.\n\n48:22.480 --> 48:24.480\nAll the questions that you've asked, we've asked ourselves.\n\n48:26.480 --> 48:28.480\nI thought we'd get answers, but it's a special kind\n\n48:28.480 --> 48:30.480\nof answer that there's just more questions.\n\n48:30.480 --> 48:32.480\nThat's fine, too. It's like black hole\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:34.480\nresearch.\n\n48:34.480 --> 48:36.480\nIt's to the point now, you guys, that\n\n48:36.480 --> 48:38.480\nafter the show, he follows me to my car,\n\n48:38.480 --> 48:40.480\nand if we go to a bar after the show, then he fall,\n\n48:40.480 --> 48:42.480\neven if I don't say the bar I'm going to, sometimes\n\n48:42.480 --> 48:44.480\nhe's just there, and he'll follow me to my car then.\n\n48:44.480 --> 48:46.480\nLike, I know he's harmless.\n\n48:46.480 --> 48:48.480\nHe told, there's no concern there, but\n\n48:48.480 --> 48:50.480\nhe's a very forward guy.\n\n48:50.480 --> 48:52.480\nRight? You'd have to. Absolutely.\n\n48:52.480 --> 48:54.480\nYou'd have to allow that. He's diabolical.\n\n48:54.480 --> 48:56.480\nI mean, he's a genius. Like, he's always\n\n48:56.480 --> 48:58.480\ncalculating. A genius. Yeah, possibly\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:00.480\nevil.

Yeah.\n\n49:08.480 --> 49:10.480\nMy dad says that the worst day of\n\n49:10.480 --> 49:12.480\nhis life was when he realized that the kid\n\n49:12.480 --> 49:14.480\ntormenting him was actually two kids tormenting\n\n49:14.480 --> 49:16.480\nhim.\n\n49:16.480 --> 49:18.480\nBecause we're twins, so we work as a team.\n\n49:18.480 --> 49:20.480\nOh, you guys are twins. Oh. So we work\n\n49:20.480 --> 49:22.480\nas a team, and, you know, it's easy to trick\n\n49:22.480 --> 49:24.480\nyour three-year-old brother, three years younger,\n\n49:24.480 --> 49:26.480\ninto doing whatever you want.\n\n49:26.480 --> 49:28.480\nYeah, and then when you get tired of\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:30.480\nfucking with him and you just tag out and the other guy comes in.\n\n49:30.480 --> 49:32.480\nYeah, we used to\n\n49:32.480 --> 49:34.480\npull him out of his crib to play.\n\n49:34.480 --> 49:36.480\nLike, this was harmless.

and he ends up running a studio\n\n56:54.480 --> 57:02.120\nin Hollywood, simply out of will, and the idea that there's no such thing as a human\n\n57:02.120 --> 57:03.120\nobstacle.\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:07.400\nPeople are things you can just move around like chess pieces, and it's not willfully\n\n57:07.400 --> 57:11.960\nmean, it's just the idea that the goal is something that's more important than the steps\n\n57:11.960 --> 57:12.960\nalong the way.\n\n57:12.960 --> 57:16.760\nAnd is it genetics that makes your brain like that, or is it your older brother's playing\n\n57:16.760 --> 57:17.760\nhead injuries?\n\n57:17.760 --> 57:21.960\nCatch the baby out of the cradle.\n\n57:21.960 --> 57:24.200\nProbably a combination of that and head injuries.\n\n57:24.200 -->

bring random people up on stage, and you're trained for the stand-up mythology\n\n57:43.640 --> 57:45.680\nand TV and stuff.\n\n57:45.680 --> 57:49.800\nWhen somebody starts popping off in the audience, everyone gets as uncomfortable as when a baby\n\n57:49.800 --> 57:51.040\nis crying on an airplane.\n\n57:51.040 --> 57:52.520\nIt's like, there's a crisis.\n\n57:52.520 --> 57:53.520\nThere's something happening.\n\n57:53.520 --> 57:54.520\nThere's going to go bad.\n\n57:54.520 --> 57:58.680\nLike, what's Rob Schneider going to do?\n\n57:58.680 --> 58:02.680\nBut at our show, I know we're spoiled because all these audiences are people who listen to\n\n58:02.680 --> 58:03.680\nthe podcast.\n\n58:03.680 --> 58:05.560\nThey come out, they drive a long way, and they pay money, but then they're ready to have\n\n58:05.560 --> 58:06.560\na good time.\n\n58:06.560 --> 58:09.560\nBut I just love the human experiment.\n\n58:09.560 --> 58:13.320\nYou can just drag people up, and they're like, I don't know, and then they start rapping\n\n58:13.320 --> 58:15.200\nand they fucking bury the show.\n\n58:15.200 --> 58:19.480\nBut when Noah came up, he gave me a pretty stern look, and he goes, I don't even know\n\n58:19.480 --> 58:20.720\nif I should shake your hand.\n\n58:20.720 --> 58:23.200\nI thought it was because he was protective of Adam.\n\n58:23.200 --> 58:25.480\nYeah, and then he just completely threw Adam under the bus.\n\n58:25.480 --> 58:26.480\nYeah.\n\n58:26.480 --> 58:27.480\nI mean, he really meant it.\n\n58:27.480 --> 58:29.120\nI don't know if I should shake your hand.\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:30.120\nI don't know.\n\n58:30.120 --> 58:31.520\nYeah, that's his...\n\n58:31.520 --> 58:32.720\nAaron texted me.\n\n58:32.720 -->

--> 58:44.160\nI mean, I never know what this one.\n\n58:44.160 --> 58:48.400\nAaron, well, all I was going to say is that Adam just texted me.\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:49.720\nWe're my brother's

the seats at the Rhode\n\n01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040\nIsland show.\n\n01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040\nLet them be.\n\n01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040\nShoe goo.\n\n01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040\nShoe goo.\n\n01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040\nWell, that's all, that's all incentive for us.\n\n01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.040\nWe're going to be at the comedy connection in, on Warren Avenue, East Providence, Rhode\n\n01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040\nIsland tomorrow night.\n\n01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040\nRight.\n\n01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040\nAll right.\n\n01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:43.320\nWell, Aaron says you'll get a special button if you use the past phrase, I came here from\n\n01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320\nJohnny Deese.\n\n01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.320\nAlso, Spencer will give the first 40 people in the door a 20 minute deep tissue massage.\n\n01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.320\nSpeaking of which, let's bring Spencer up on stage.\n\n01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.320\nSpencer, get up here.\n\n01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.320\nOh shit, Spencer.\n\n01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320\nYep.\n\n01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.320\nHe's wearing his Apple store sweatshirt.\n\n01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.320\nSpencer was sharing a table tonight.\n\n01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320\nKind of.\n\n01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320\nI got my little dead soldiers.\n\n01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320\nDo you want me to slide over?\n\n01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320\nAll right.\n\n01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320\nYou're fine.\n\n01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320\nWhat up?\n\n01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.040\nAgain, for those of you who already know Spencer, he's our Dungeon Master.\n\n01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:28.120\nFor those of you who don't, he's going to master a dungeon later on and God bless him,\n\n01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:34.320\nbut we didn't know this guy really from Adam, and not Adam Goldberg, from the old Adam when\n\n01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.320\nwe embarked on our tour.\n\n01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.320\nBut I find Spencer, you've been an absolute gem of a tour companion to have on the bus.\n\n01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320\nJeff, really quick.\n\n01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320\nI want to roll out the chicken noodle.\n\n01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320\nChicken noodle.\n\n01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.320\nSpencer, did you help write the chicken noodle song?\n\n01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320\nNo, I came in during the end.\n\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.320\nI might be able to help you guys out though.\n\n01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.320\nOkay, so Dan, I have some stupid tour bus songs about like I hold like things up to my\n\n01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.320\ndick and like there's Pringles Dick.\n\n01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.320\nThat was take a sip of my dick.\n\n01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.320\nSome people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out why.\n\n01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320\nYou're holding the Pringles Dick.\n\n01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320\nI don't really have a Pringles Dick.\n\n01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.320\nI just keep my dick inside.\n\n01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.320\nI keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.\n\n01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.320\nI don't really, some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out.\n\n01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320\nNo, I never found out, never really found out why.\n\n01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.320\nThat's a song you can sing while you hold a Pringles can on your dick.\n\n01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.320\nAll right, Summerville?\n\n01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.320\nSo Dan Harmon was laying a supine on the fork, the fork, the folksle of the tour bus.\n\n01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.320\nI don't know, the four room and the thing and there's a big couch and he's reclined back\n\n01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.320\nthere and we're all, you know, this is, we were leaving Brooklyn last night on a big\n\n01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.320\nhigh from the Brooklyn show, which was immensely good last night and we're driving back.\n\n01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320\nNot as good as this.\n\n01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320\nNo, no, no, this is fucking, this is way better.\n\n01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.320\nStage drive.\n\n01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320\nStage drive.\n\n01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.320\nI mean, later in a couple minutes.\n\n01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.320\nCan we get the biggest guys up front?\n\n01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.320\nSo Dan was laying there and I started handing Dan various objects because Dan expressed\n\n01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.320\na desire to sing, like, try his own hand that these improvised, my dick is shaped like\n\n01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320\nsomething else.\n\n01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320\nYeah, I want to have fun with the dick songs.\n\n01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.320\nSo we tried, we tried the little honey bear thing or we tried a honey bear dick and that\n\n01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320\ndidn't go so well.\n\n01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320\nHoney bear dick, honey bear dick.\n\n01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.320\nI got a honey, fuck it.\n\n01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320\nAspirin dick was no good.\n\n01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.320\nMy Aspirin dick, I can't do it.\n\n01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.320\nYeah, I knew it kind of fell.\n\n01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.320\nIt kept failing, kept failing.\n\n01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:36.320\nSo we found a kind of progressive chicken noodle soup.\n\n01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.320\nHe just kept swapping objects under my dick and like making me get out of my head space.\n\n01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.320\nHe was like, you were like a great Iron Eagles, Lou Gossett Jr. like mentor.\n\n01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.320\nJust stop thinking about it, stop thinking about it.\n\n01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.320\nAnd then finally the last object was a can of chicken noodle soup, a big fat, progressive\n\n01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.320\ncan of chicken noodle soup.\n\n01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.320\nAnd I went, here I am.\n\n01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.320\nAnd then we wrote the song for him.\n\n01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320\nWe were like, no, I don't know.\n\n01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320\nWe could tell, like I got like a Tin Pan Alley songwriter.\n\n01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320\nSo we do, there's a gem there.\n\n01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320\nThere's a kernel.\n\n01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320\nHere I am.\n\n01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320\nI ain't got a dick.\n\n01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.320\nI got a chicken noodle can.\n\n01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320\nAll my life.\n\n01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320\nI've been put in my hands.\n\n01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320\nI'm a chicken noodle wife.\n\n01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320\nChicken noodle can come down from the mountains.\n\n01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.320\nChicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.\n\n01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.320\nChicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.\n\n01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:31.320\nYou need the devil's soup until your troubles go away.\n\n01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.320\nIt's a spiritual.\n\n01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.320\nI mean, for the lack of a writer, it's a Negro spiritual about God cursing you with a strange\n\n01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.320\ndick and forcing you to work your whole life and struggle.\n\n01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.320\nIt's about being jibbeded by God.\n\n01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.320\nBut the payoff is the curse of this chicken noodle can.\n\n01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.320\nYou can feed the devil's soup and make your troubles go away.\n\n01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320\nIt's like a hard working fucking life.\n\n01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.320\nWe should, if anyone not listening wants to remix that, put some like some acts, like\n\n01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.320\nsome pics on there.\n\n01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.320\nBut just give it one clean audio track.\n\n01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.320\nLet's do it one more time.\n\n01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320\nHere I am.\n\n01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320\nI ain't got a dick.\n\n01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320\nI got a chicken noodle can.\n\n01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.320\nDon't start clapping until chicken noodle.\n\n01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320\nI'll give you the cue for the clapping.\n\n01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320\nSo it's going to start out without the clapping.\n\n01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320\nI think it works better.\n\n01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.320\nAnd then you, sir, wear a diaper and fly across with a banner.\n\n01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320\nLet's not get too...\n\n01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320\n76 trombones.\n\n01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320\nRight.\n\n01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320\nWe need Karen on costume design.\n\n01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.320\nJesus, I'm falling everywhere.\n\n01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320\nAll right.\n\n01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320\nOkay, here we go.\n\n01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320\nOne, two, one, two, three.\n\n01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320\nHere I am.\n\n01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320\nAll right.\n\n01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.320\nFuck.\n\n01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.320\nHere I am.\n\n01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.320\nOh, start over.\n\n01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320\nThat was terrible.\n\n01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320\nHere... sorry.\n\n01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.320\nIt's on the end.\n\n01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320\nHere... here I am.\n\n01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.320\nStop it.\n\n01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:59.320\nOne, two, one, two, three, four.\n\n01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.320\nHere I am.\n\n01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320\nI ain't got a dick.\n\n01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.320\nI got a chicken noodle can.\n\n01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320\nOh, my life.\n\n01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.320\nI've been putting my hands on my chicken noodle wife.\n\n01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.320\nChicken noodle got down from the mountains.\n\n01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.320\nChicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.\n\n01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.320\nChicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.\n\n01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.320\nSee the devil scoop and say your troubles go away.\n\n01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.320\nGot a devil soup until your troubles go away.\n\n01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.320\nYeah.\n\n01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.320\nWe can make some more verses to that too, I think, as we go.\n\n01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.320\nYeah, I think the next verse has to be about the chicken noodle wife.\n\n01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.320\nI'm concerned about her.\n\n01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.320\nYeah, she's at home like...\n\n01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.320\nYeah, she's like, keep getting fucked by a chicken noodle can.\n\n01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.320\nThat doesn't make me a chicken noodle wife.\n\n01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320\nI'm a person.\n\n01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.320\nShe's a big job for him.\n\n01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.320\nPutting this can of chicken noodle wife poor baby.\n\n01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320\nIt's a very sexist song.\n\n01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.320\nAnd also all my life, you're like, really?\n\n01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320\nWe met when you were 20.\n\n01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.320\nBut in his defense, he's probably like building a lot of railroad\n\n01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320\nand not for a lot of pay.\n\n01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.320\nIf shit rolls downhill a little bit to the woman he loves,\n\n01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.320\nlike maybe there could be some support there.\n\n01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320\nMaybe she gets her own song.\n\n01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320\nMaybe she can be like a Dolly Parton figure\n\n01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.320\nand go like, oh, little girl, when you wait for your man to come home,\n\n01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.320\ndon't you want home?\n\n01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320\nNo, baby, no, no, no.\n\n01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.320\nAin't enough chicken noodle in the can for me.\n\n01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.320\nAin't that right?\n\n01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.320\nYou know, kind of rise up, sisters.\n\n01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.320\nPut them in his place.\n\n01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.320\nYeah, if people feel like they have a verse to add to that,\n\n01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.320\nplease tumble that shit.\n\n01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.320\nAll right, can we do our regular segment?\n\n01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320\nI'm really convinced this is going to pay off.\n\n01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:49.320\nIt's called Spencer's Complaints about Looney Tunes cartoons.\n\n01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.320\nSpencer comes down.\n\n01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.320\nYou think he'd have a softness in his heart for the Looney Tunes characters,\n\n01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.320\nbut he really comes down like a ton of lead.\n\n01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320\nThe more you find out about this guy, the more you love him.\n\n01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.320\nWe took him to Charlotte.\n\n01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.320\nHe loved the sleet.\n\n01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.320\nThen we took him to Times Square.\n\n01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320\nHe hated Times Square.\n\n01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.320\nAnd you go like, yeah, good.\n\n01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320\nHe's a barometer.\n\n01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320\nHe's like Henry David Thoreau.\n\n01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.320\nAnd he's not fallen for any of those

that's been applauded anywhere near Boston.\n\n01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320\nWe're in Brooklyn as a sold out crowd.\n\n01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.320\nIt's like the people are cheering for Ray of Frost spells.\n\n01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320\nWhat have we brought?\n\n01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.320\nWe have to welcome Mulrainee Sidhanna, Erin McGathy to the stage.\n\n01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.320\nHey, really quick.\n\n01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.320\nMaybe this is just in my head,\n\n01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.320\nbut it feels like there have been a lot of references to you getting blown\n\n01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.320\nand you getting laid.\n\n01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320\nI just want to know if we're okay.\n\n01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320\nYeah, we're fine.\n\n01:10:38.320

were talking about me.\n\n01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320\nMaybe you're worried about enticing me.\n\n01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320\nAaron, Aaron,

girlfriend.\n\n01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.320\nHe brought his portable hole.\n\n01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.320\nDo it yourself, okay.\n\n01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.320\nThere's 850,000 reasons never to be in a relationship with me.\n\n01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:35.320\nThe only one that there isn't is that I would ever, I just don't, I don't have the capacity.\n\n01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320\nNo, I know, I know.\n\n01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320\nI've never done it.\n\n01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320\nI'm 40.\n\n01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320\nHe's a great guy.\n\n01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320\nHe's a great guy, everybody.\n\n01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.320\nAnd a great boyfriend.\n\n01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.320\nI'm not, like, the road is hard for a relationship.\n\n01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.320\nWe're in a tour bus and we're in a hotel room and it's like, well, why aren't we doing it all the time?\n\n01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.320\nWe have sex with wood.\n\n01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320\nThere's a wood block.\n\n01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.320\nThere's a hole on one side and then, like, a thing on the other.\n\n01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.320\nAnd we have this, like, swing that we sit in.\n\n01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320\nAnd there's no time for it.\n\n01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320\nWe're Orthodox Amish.\n\n01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320\nWe're not allowed to look at each other.\n\n01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.320\nWe have these Iron Man suits made of wood.\n\n01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.320\nAnd I just have an opening for a dick.\n\n01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320\nShe has a dick.\n\n01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320\nAnd we just rub them together.\n\n01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320\nWe're snails.\n\n01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.320\nWe're asexual wooden Iron Men.\n\n01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.320\nI would say, mercifully, I have not caught or heard you guys doing it on the tour bus.\n\n01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:12:24.320 -->

across.\n\n01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320\nAnd, yeah, it would be...\n\n01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.320\nIt'd be weird.\n\n01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.320\nYou'd hear my belt buckle jingling.\n\n01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.320\nIt wouldn't be real sex.\n\n01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320\nIt would be like a hand job or something.\n\n01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320\nAnd it'd be like, you just hear like jingling and...\n\n01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.320\nRight.\n\n01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.320\nAnd I cry pretty loud.\n\n01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.320\nYeah.\n\n01:13:06.320 -->

01:13:35.320\nSomebody's got some subconscious herpes denial.\n\n01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.320\nNo, no, any random jingling on that bus is going to give me nightmares.\n\n01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320\nThat's why I take off my...\n\n01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.320\nI take off my belt in that bunk because I don't want anyone to think I'm jerking off.\n\n01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.320\nAnd it sounds like I'm jerking...\n\n01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.320\nEvery time I roll over, it sounds like I'm jerking off.\n\n01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320\nOh, man.\n\n01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320\nSo

anything over on anyone.\n\n01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.320\nThat's why I came back with a food and you were just asleep with a smile on your face.\n\n01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.320\nNo, I was just watching Harry Potter 2 and...\n\n01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.320\nHe gets me every time.\n\n01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.320\nThey're fighting the evil wizards.\n\n01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320\nNo, I

where's Marissa's mom?\n\n01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.320\n40-year-old man drinking and talking about sex and masturbation.\n\n01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320\nUnderage women on stage.\n\n01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320\nEverybody's having a good time.\n\n01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.320\nBring up the mom, bring up the mom, bring up the mom.\n\n01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.320\nBring up the mom!\n\n01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.320\nHello.\n\n01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.320\nI'm so sorry, ma'am.\n\n01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.320\nI am not sorry at all about this.\n\n01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.320\nMitzi.\n\n01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.320\nMitzi, okay.\n\n01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.320\nAnd so, Marissa told me,\n\n01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320\nwe did a little interview for the little movie we're making.\n\n01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.320\nShe said that you, because she needed to come here.\n\n01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320\nShe can't, it's a club, it's 21 and over.\n\n01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.320\nShe needed a legal guardian to come.\n\n01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.320\nYou listened for the first time to the podcast of this guy she's a fan of.\n\n01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320\nI was glad I was alone.\n\n01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320\nDid you masturbate?\n\n01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.320\nStop, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.\n\n01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.320\nNo, yeah, everybody's having a good time.\n\n01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.320\nAsk your moms if they masturbate in front of their daughters.\n\n01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.320\nInsane, this is officially more insane than Brooklyn.\n\n01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.320\nWe have lost our minds.\n\n01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.320\nYou did it, congratulations.\n\n01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.320\nYou jibbit people and you bring this out of us.\n\n01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320\nI don't know what happens in this.\n\n01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320\nYeah, Yankee suck, right?\n\n01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320\nOh, Yankee suck.\n\n01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.320\nYes.\n\n01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.320\nNow it's happening.\n\n01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320\nThis is where we get stabbed.\n\n01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320\nThe stirring wheel came off.\n\n01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320\nHow are you enjoying the show?\n\n01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320\nI'm absolutely loving it.\n\n01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.320\nBut I actually have a story about Aaron kind of related to masturbation.\n\n01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:34.320\nOh, no.\n\n01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320\nJust hanging out.\n\n01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.320\nAll right, well, I doubt she has any recollection of this whatsoever.\n\n01:19:41.320 --> 01:20:09.320\nBut Aaron actually taught me what feminine wetness was.\n\n01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.320\nSo we went to a very...\n\n01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320\nor the camp is very experimental.\n\n01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320\nWhat's the address of this place?\n\n01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320\nIt's in Maine.\n\n01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.320\nHow did I teach you about feminine wetness?\n\n01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.320\nWell, I remember we were all...\n\n01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:42.320\nin the hard way.\n\n01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.320\nWell, do you remember when we used to like hang out on the porch of the bunk?\n\n01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.320\nLike kind of late at night, we'd talk about boys and men.\n\n01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.320\nIt was this feels terrible, the podcast basically.\n\n01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320\nBut on a porch.\n\n01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.320\nYeah, very early incarnation of this feels terrible.\n\n01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.320\nBut we were like, we were chilling out there.\n\n01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.320\nIt was me and a few of my friends and Aaron comes out and we were like,\n\n01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320\nAaron, what does wet mean?\n\n01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320\nLike, what does it mean when you get wet?\n\n01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.320\nAnd she just got so uncomfortable.\n\n01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320\nAnd that's good.\n\n01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.320\nI'm glad he didn't say a smile, whatever came across her face.\n\n01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.320\nI thought you'd never ask.\n\n01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.320\nCut to Cancun.\n\n01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.320\nCut to a cartoon owl looking at the camera.\n\n01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.320\nWhat did I say was appropriate?\n\n01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.320\nIt was a very clinical definition.\n\n01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:39.320\nYou were just like, when a woman gets aroused,\n\n01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320\nshe...\n\n01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.320\nher vagina gets wet.\n\n01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320\nSay what?\n\n01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.320\nYou know that?\n\n01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.320\nSome day, some day.\n\n01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320\nAll right, okay, let's go.\n\n01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.320\nWell, thank you.\n\n01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.320\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.320\nAll right.\n\n01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.320\nWe learned a lot at Harmontown.\n\n01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320\nTake your mamas, come on down.\n\n01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.320\nEverybody's going to learn a thing or two.\n\n01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, how do you get wet?\n\n01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.320\nThis is insane.\n\n01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.320\nAre there any 14-year-olds in the audience?\n\n01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.320\nCan I get you another root beer float?\n\n01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.320\nWhat do we do, Jeff?\n\n01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.320\nWe have a chorus of spiraling shame and irony up here.\n\n01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.320\nAdam Goldberg's on the air again?\n\n01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.320\nHe rips to me knowing that his brothers are here.\n\n01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320\nHe has a reply.\n\n01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320\nYes, what does Adam Goldberg have to say?\n\n01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.320\nAll right, well, we need you on mic, though, because...\n\n01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320\nLet's just have a...\n\n01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320\nThat'll be the stage.\n\n01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.320\nEveryone at some point is going to get on the stage tonight.\n\n01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.320\nBut first of all, do you know how to get wet?\n\n01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.320\nOkay, I'm sorry, that was too far.\n\n01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:01.320\nCome on up so we can hear the...\n\n01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320\nMatt, right?\n\n01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.320\nSo you have a relationship with Adam Goldberg?\n\n01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.320\nYeah, I know him from the drive.\n\n01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320\nA bar in LA, okay.\n\n01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.320\nAnd so Adam Goldberg sent you a text?\n\n01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.320\nHe knew that his brothers are here, and he has a reply for you.\n\n01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.320\nOkay.\n\n01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320\nDo you want to read it, or...?\n\n01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320\nNo, you read it.\n\n01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:27.320\nIf they are being mean to me, ask Dan how many cool, cool, cool t-shirts he sold.\n\n01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.320\nWhat does he think that makes his fan art...\n\n01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:34.320\nWho does he think that makes his fan art updates his wiki and upvotes his 101 videos?\n\n01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.320\nSure as hell, ain't the Allison Breeze of the world.\n\n01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.320\nI met her though.\n\n01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.320\nPause for a little gravity.\n\n01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.320\nI met her though, she's super nice.\n\n01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.320\nLook, I really...\n\n01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.320\nOh no, everybody's spiraling.\n\n01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.320\nLook, I really hard went to care about how people view me, I really do.\n\n01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.320\nBut I can't recapture the feathers from the pillowcase.\n\n01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.320\nI can't make people like me if they honestly don't want to.\n\n01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:09.320\nI'm a positive person, the best version of my authentic self, and continue to be humorous, honest, and loving.\n\n01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.320\nIf some people think I'm a gremlin, or a robot, or a grembot...\n\n01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.320\nWell, that is the price of entering the public sphere.\n\n01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.320\nWe can't all be Johnny Unitas.\n\n01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.320\nAdam Goldberg dominates...\n\n01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.320\nWait, Adam Goldberg knows what Johnny Unitas is?\n\n01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:36.320\nWell, he certainly spiked that one in the fucking end zone.\n\n01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.320\nWhat's your name? Matt, everybody, thank you.\n\n01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.320\nSo Adam thought that he was really thrown under the bus, which I don't think he was.\n\n01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.320\nWill the court see a rejoiner here on Earth?\n\n01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.320\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320\nCome on up.\n\n01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.320\nNo, no, no, I'm all for this stuff, Matt.\n\n01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.320\nWe've gone off the rails.\n\n01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.320\nI'm just going to remind the listeners that Missy Merse's mom is still in stage.\n\n01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.320\nShe's just standing with her hands folded in front of her.\n\n01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.320\nShe's very patient, best mom in the world.\n\n01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.320\nI can't give a rejoinder.\n\n01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.320\nOh, my name is Nick.\n\n01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.320\nHe's made it up. Fake name.\n\n01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:27.320\nIt's NIC. There's no cash.\n\n01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:33.320\nAll right. This doesn't make it less fake, but it makes it more fake.\n\n01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.320\nMy name is Bob Johnson. That's a fake name.\n\n01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.320\nNo, it's spelled with a Q.\n\n01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.320\nI think he was, yes, the ending U, that it was fake. He's like, yeah, it is fake.\n\n01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.320\nOh, okay. Thank you, sweetie.\n\n01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.320\nAll right, so, all right.\n\n01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.320\nI'm going to think about this later.\n\n01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320\nWhat's the rejoinder?\n\n01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.320\nMy rejoinder would be how...\n\n01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:02.320\nMy rejoinder would be how brilliant you are.\n\n01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.320\nBut the only whack...\n\n01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.320\nNo, don't boo him. Don't boo him. He's you. He's me.\n\n01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.320\nThat means I have to leave. They booed.\n\n01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:17.320\nThank you. I agree. I'm brilliant. Worst rejoinder ever.\n\n01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.320\nThat's what they were booing.\n\n01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:24.320\nAll right. All right. We hit peak of...\n\n01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320\nPeak insanity?\n\n01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.320\nYes.\n\n01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320\nNo, I think we're not even halfway home, baby.\n\n01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320\nYou're right.\n\n01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.320\nIf peak insanity would be like, oh my God, we're going to run out of insanity.\n\n01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.320\nIt's the opposite problem, right?\n\n01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:39.320\nWe've hit the point in Day of the Dead with the elevators coming down.\n\n01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.320\nThe loading dock elevator.\n\n01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:46.320\nSince we have this chorus of beautiful ladies up here, maybe we should try the song.\n\n01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.320\nWe'll teach them the lyrics.\n\n01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.320\nMaybe... I'm sorry, what was your name on the end there?\n\n01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320\nEmma, you probably already know the lyrics to the anthem, right?\n\n01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320\nThey come on down to Harmontown. Do you know?\n\n01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.320\nLet's try that.\n\n01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.320\nYeah, I could probably...\n\n01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320\nOh, shit.\n\n01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.320\nOh, shit.\n\n01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.320\nOh, shit.\n\n01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.320\nCan I just dance?\n\n01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320\nI'll make it quick. Then we gotta play D&D.\n\n01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.320\nYo, okay. Yo, yo.\n\n01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320\nI'll do some rapping.\n\n01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.320\nThen she'll sing the re-anna part.\n\n01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.320\nAnd you'll be clapping in it.\n\n01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.320\nMy name is Dan Harmon. I'm sorry about the show.\n\n01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.320\nI tried to do things by the cup, but sometimes it blows.\n\n01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.320\nCame to Somerville trying to do something nice.\n\n01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.320\nI'm sorry that I couldn't have a lot of ice.\n\n01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.320\nBut I'm still an alcoholic. I still like to drink.\n\n01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.320\nI fucked your mom all up and down the kitchen sink.\n\n01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.320\nPut her pussy in the drain and turned it on.\n\n01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.320\nI saw your mama go down till the break of dawn.\n\n01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.320\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320\nTurn that frown upside down.\n\n01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320\nStrength.\n\n01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320\nHe is yellow, poop is brown.\n\n01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320\nStruggle.\n\n01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.320\nSpeakers in front of me. They look like demons inside.\n\n01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320\nI wanna fuck your mama so hard.\n\n01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.320\nShe gets twice as wide. I fuck your mama at every avenue.\n\n01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.320\nI fucked your mama. I'm so sorry about you being up here.\n\n01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.320\nI'm so sorry. There's a literal mama behind me.\n\n01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.320\nIt's very comfortable.\n\n01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.320\nI don't mean it. It's just an expression.\n\n01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320\nObama's recession.\n\n01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.320\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320\nPolitics.\n\n01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320\nTurn that frown upside down.\n\n01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.320\nFiscal cliff.\n\n01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.320\nHe is yellow, poop is brown.\n\n01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320\nHer pants out.\n\n01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320\nYour ass crack is hanging out.\n\n01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.320\nMy ass crack.\n\n01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.320\nYeah.\n\n01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.320\nAss crack hanging out of the back.\n\n01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.320\nThat means I'm a working class person.\n\n01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.320\nLike people from the city that likes Goodwill Hunting.\n\n01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.320\nSteeple.\n\n01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.320\nMatt Damon likes them apples.\n\n01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.320\nI think that screenplay was stinkier than Crapples.\n\n01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.320\nDon't go to a window and say how do you like them.\n\n01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.320\nAny normal person would say, that's fucking stupid.\n\n01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.320\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320\nMatt Damon.\n\n01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.320\nTurn that frown upside down.\n\n01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320\nAffleck.\n\n01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.320\nHe is yellow, poop is brown.\n\n01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.320\nDuck.\n\n01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320\nCars.\n\n01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320\nThank you ladies.\n\n01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320\nI'm on Miss Amarisa.\n\n01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.320\nThat's how we get them.\n\n01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.320\nThank you.\n\n01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.320\nThank you, Miss Amarisa.\n\n01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.320\nAny other ladies have any questions about why you get wet?\n\n01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.320\nMissy, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.320\nShe has a milk crate for a stare.\n\n01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.320\nAll she wanted to do was raise a good daughter.\n\n01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.320\nAnd she did everything right and then out of, absolutely completely out of her control,\n\n01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.320\nthe internet was invented.\n\n01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.320\nShe had no choice.\n\n01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.320\nShe didn't get to sign off on that.\n\n01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.320\nNo one ever came to her home and said, should we have an internet?\n\n01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.320\nWell, what's that?\n\n01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:54.320\nIt means that a gross, horrible, alcoholic, middle-aged man will be a part of your daughter's life.\n\n01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.320\nThe nays have it.\n\n01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.320\nNo they don't.\n\n01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320\nYou don't get to choose.\n\n01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.320\nIt's the internet.\n\n01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.320\nBut she's a good kid and you've definitely done something right.\n\n01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:11.320\nBecause I met her for the first time tonight and she survived the last year unscathed.\n\n01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.320\nShe's not a dirtbag.\n\n01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.320\nNo, she's a good kid.\n\n01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.320\nShe seems very intelligent too.\n\n01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.320\nSo my takeaway is just keep me in a gross, creepy asshole.\n\n01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.320\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.320\nI'm making better women.\n\n01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.320\nAll right, Spencer, get us up to date.\n\n01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320\nSpencer, catch us up to date.\n\n01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:34.320\nWhen we last met, the trio had just been regrouping after collecting some treasure in a locker room\n\n01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.320\nof a great flying ship.\n\n01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.320\nAscending a magical pole, Sharpie saw a fighting force of dark stars, evil men.\n\n01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:46.320\nThinking quickly, the mage conjured a squid, crushing several of the minions.\n\n01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.320\nThe ship's pilot, the sinister Dave, played by Jason Sudeikis.\n\n01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.320\nLeft into action, blinding, tripping and flatulating on quark in a flurry of humorous combat.\n\n01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:03.320\nThe two fought with knives and after a ray of frost to the eye in a critical arrow, Dave was slain.\n\n01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:07.320\nThe bite-sized armored figure falls onto the floor with a clatter.\n\n01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.320\nThe dead squid dissolves into air, freeing the previously trapped crewmen.\n\n01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.320\nThey cower in fear.\n\n01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320\nGo!\n\n01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.320\nAll right, we did it.\n\n01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320\nSo we got these guys on the run now.\n\n01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.320\nYeah, so that guy's dead.\n\n01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.320\nThose three other guys, they were like trapped under the thing.\n\n01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320\nThey're not trapped, but they're just cowering in fear.\n\n01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.320\nAre they armored or are they kind of innocent?\n\n01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.320\nThey're not wearing much of anything.\n\n01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.320\nLike that whip guy.\n\n01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.320\nThrow on your weapons.\n\n01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320\nI'm saying to them, throw on your weapons.\n\n01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.320\nThey have no weapons.\n\n01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:42.320\nI give them some weapons.\n\n01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.320\nYou give them some throwing knives?\n\n01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.320\nYeah, I give them some throwing knives.\n\n01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.320\nThrow them down.\n\n01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.320\nThey do that.\n\n01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:55.320\nI go pick up my throwing knives and I go, watch it.\n\n01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:59.320\nHow does that feel to be given weapons and then made to surrender them?\n\n01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.320\nNot very well.\n\n01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.320\nSay it again.\n\n01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320\nNot very well.\n\n01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320\nSay it louder.\n\n01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320\nI'm psychologically breaking you.\n\n01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.320\nOne of them breaks psychologically.\n\n01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.320\nI drink his soul.\n\n01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.320\nYou gain three hit points.\n\n01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.320\nUh-oh.\n\n01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.320\nI just went down an Elrond Hubbard road.\n\n01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.320\nYou're just a metaphor for drug abuse or something.\n\n01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.320\nI just found out a new way to...\n\n01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320\nWe don't know what they want, right?\n\n01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.320\nNo.\n\n01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.320\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.320\nIt's diplomacy.\n\n01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.320\nOkay.\n\n01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.320\nSorry.\n\n01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.320\nSo what do you want to say?\n\n01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:44.320\nI want to say sorry about everything, I think.\n\n01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.320\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.320\nWhat are you doing under there?\n\n01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.320\nI don't know how to drive the ship.\n\n01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.320\nOh, shit, is the ship crashing?\n\n01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.320\nYou hear a voice come from the overhead.\n\n01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.320\nAutopilot disengaged.\n\n01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.320\nUh-oh.\n\n01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.320\nThe steering wheel of the ship spins wildly to the right and countless alarms flash disorienting you.\n\n01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.320\nI run...\n\n01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.320\nSorry, I'm a ranger.\n\n01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.320\nNo.\n\n01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.320\nOkay.\n\n01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.320\nRangers have pilot skills?\n\n01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.320\nI run to the steering wheel and grab it.\n\n01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.320\nYou grab it.\n\n01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:24.320\nIt's very difficult to hold on to the terrible bulk of the wheel, but you manage to ride its course.\n\n01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.320\nHey, this thing's hard to hold.\n\n01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.320\nYou're stronger than me.\n\n01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.320\nOkay, would I do better holding the wheel, Spencer?\n\n01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.320\nI go and assist and try my luck at holding the wheel and steadying the ship.\n\n01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:41.320\nAfter it's already been steadied by Sharpie, you find it very, very easy to hold it on a steady course.\n\n01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.320\nHowever, you don't know where the ship's headed.\n\n01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.320\nWhere does it maps in the other room?\n\n01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320\nThat's true.\n\n01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.320\nYou left them there, I think.\n\n01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.320\nOkay, I run back to the other room.\n\n01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.320\nIt's safe going, right?\n\n01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.320\nWe killed everybody on board, right?\n\n01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.320\nYou're holding the wheel.\n\n01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.320\nHey, hot chat, go get those maps, I'll drive.\n\n01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.320\nMulraine, go get the maps.\n\n01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.320\nAre you going to jerk off again?\n\n01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.320\nEvery time she leaves the room, you start masturbating.\n\n01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:10.320\nI'm going to use hypnotism to get some information out of these guys.\n\n01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320\nOkay.\n\n01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.320\nAll right, so I'll go get the maps.\n\n01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.320\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.320\nNo, it's okay.\n\n01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:23.320\nI bound away and my hair flows like a river of kisses.\n\n01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.320\nAnd this scent comes from my hair that's like lilacs and heaven.\n\n01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.320\nAnd I turn back and I giggle, and then I walk into the other room.\n\n01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.320\nYep.\n\n01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.320\nThe sirens are still going off.\n\n01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.320\nI look on the panel for anything that might indicate, can I use my intelligence,\n\n01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:47.320\nmy extreme Dan Harmon type intelligence to determine if I could tell on this panel\n\n01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.320\nif there's anything that will shut these alarms off?\n\n01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.320\nThere's nothing that will shut them off.\n\n01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.320\nIt seemed to be indicating some sort of pressure regulation warnings.\n\n01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.320\nOh, is the hatch still open?\n\n01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.320\nMaybe.\n\n01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.320\nWhich hatch?\n\n01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320\nThe one I entered through from the bottom.\n\n01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.320\nThat one's not open.\n\n01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.320\nWhat about the hatches where the cannons were?\n\n01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.320\nThose were sealed.\n\n01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.320\nAll right, fuck that thing.\n\n01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.320\nIf I want to get information out of people as a sidebar,\n\n01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.320\nis it better to use charm person or hypnotism?\n\n01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.320\nI'd use charm person.\n\n01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.320\nOkay, I cast charm person on one person?\n\n01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320\nThe guy who's soul you broke.\n\n01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320\nThat happens.\n\n01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.320\nOkay, is he my buddy now?\n\n01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.320\nHe's feared of you, but yeah, yeah.\n\n01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.320\nWhat's your name, buddy?\n\n01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320\nGood Clint.\n\n01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.320\nOh, Clint, you having a good time pilot in the ship?\n\n01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320\nI'm in fear.\n\n01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320\nYeah?\n\n01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.320\nMe too, buddy, we're all afraid.\n\n01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.320\nEveryone's afraid of things they don't know,\n\n01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320\nbut you know what always helps me when I'm afraid?\n\n01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.320\nI figure out everything I can about what I do know.\n\n01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320\nSo I go like, where was the ship going?\n\n01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.320\nI was going to the north to regroup.\n\n01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.320\nOkay.\n\n01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.320\nAll right.\n\n01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.320\nThem.\n\n01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.320\nYou know what doesn't help fear?\n\n01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320\nWhat?\n\n01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.320\nThatness.\n\n01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.320\nYou know what always cuts through it?\n\n01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.320\nSpecificity.\n\n01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:16.320\nLike coordinates, like names.\n\n01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.320\nWe don't have the education to understand such coordinate systems.\n\n01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.320\nDo you have the education to understand that I will fuck your world up?\n\n01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.320\nI thought we were friends?\n\n01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.320\nA good friend will fuck you up.\n\n01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.320\nHe's broken again.\n\n01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.320\nSharpie, ask him if he knows how to get the pressure systems back to normal.\n\n01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320\nHow do you get the pressure systems going, Clint?\n\n01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320\nHe's balling on the floor.\n\n01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.320\nClint!\n\n01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.320\nClint!\n\n01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.320\nLook at me.\n\n01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.320\nI step in and play, I step in and play good cop.\n\n01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.320\nI said, listen, sorry about my friend, man.\n\n01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320\nI want a piece of that asshole.\n\n01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\n\n01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.320\nSharpie, don't get a cup of decaf and just take it easy.\n\n01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.320\nI'll be back and then you're fucking dead, Clint.\n\n01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320\nClint, I'm sorry about my partner.\n\n01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.320\nHis wife just was killed by a cabinet.\n\n01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.320\nAn animated cabinet.\n\n01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.320\nYeah, an animated...\n\n01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.320\nStupid presidents.\n\n01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.320\nWhy do they appoint those people?\n\n01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.320\nThey're murderous.\n\n01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.320\nClint, look, man, I don't want, I don't want...\n\n01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320\nYou've been nothing but doing us favors.\n\n01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.320\nDo you know how to stop this, how to repressurize the ship?\n\n01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.320\nYou need to find one of those little black creatures.\n\n01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.320\nThey know how this thing works.\n\n01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.320\nDon't be racist, Clint.\n\n01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.320\nOkay, weird story.\n\n01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.320\nI'm sorry, they're called imps.\n\n01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.320\nIps?\n\n01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.320\nImps.\n\n01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.320\nImps?\n\n01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.320\nIMP.\n\n01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.320\nI do know how to spell various creatures' names.\n\n01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320\nOkay.\n\n01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320\nWhat deck, now?\n\n01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320\nHow do I get to these knowledgeable imps?\n\n01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320\nThey might be in the engine room.\n\n01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320\nAlright, I run off to the engine room.\n\n01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320\nYou head down the ladder into the engine room.\n\n01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.320\nCan I see anything out of the...\n\n01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.320\nIs there a windshield?\n\n01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320\nYeah, there is a windshield.\n\n01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320\nDo I see the other ships?\n\n01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.320\nIs there like a fleet of ships?\n\n01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.320\nThere's actually not.\n\n01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320\nYou can't see any ships around you.\n\n01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.320\nYou find that slightly odd, to be honest.\n\n01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.320\nYeah, we've deviated.\n\n01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.320\nYeah.\n\n01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.320\nI should mention that quark stepped away from the wheel.\n\n01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.320\nWe deviated from the wheel?\n\n01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.320\nWhat?\n\n01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320\nThe quark stepped away from the wheel.\n\n01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.320\nOh, grab the wheel.\n\n01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.320\nShit, I grab it.\n\n01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.320\nI grab it.\n\n01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.320\nYou don't hear him because he's in the engine room at this point.\n\n01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.320\nI climb back up the ladder and yell,\n\n01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.320\nSorry, my bad.\n\n01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.320\nGrab the wheel, Sharpie.\n\n01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320\nAlright, alright, that happens.\n\n01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320\nI come running back into the room.\n\n01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320\nYeah.\n\n01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320\nHow does your hair look?\n\n01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.320\nOh, you did something new, isn't it?\n\n01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320\nBangs?\n\n01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.320\nBangs or rainbows?\n\n01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.320\nYou tell me.\n\n01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.320\nYes, my hair is flowing and my breasts...\n\n01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.320\nLike, they slow motion almost.\n\n01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:44.320\nI go back into the engine room.\n\n01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.320\nSharpie.\n\n01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.320\nYes.\n\n01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.320\nHear the maps.\n\n01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.320\nThank you.\n\n01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.320\nThere's a musical sting indicating that, you know,\n\n01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:03.320\nI too know what it is to be wet.\n\n01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:13.320\nWell, I came into the room with my hair down to here.\n\n01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:18.320\nWe don't have time for this.\n\n01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.320\nHere, hear the maps.\n\n01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.320\nAnd as a ranger, I know that we need to go north.\n\n01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.320\nAlso, I overheard you.\n\n01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320\nShould go north.\n\n01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320\nYeah, yeah, for sure.\n\n01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.320\nI just got to keep this wheel straight.\n\n01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.320\nSharpie, you got some squid glue goo on your shirt.\n\n01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.320\nOh, get that off.\n\n01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320\nThank you.\n\n01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.320\nYou're such a mess.\n\n01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.320\nListen, make sure those three guys don't move, you know,\n\n01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320\nsecure them somehow.\n\n01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.320\nOkay.\n\n01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:49.320\nI fire two arrows.\n\n01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.320\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.320\nWe might need these guys.\n\n01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.320\nWe might need...\n\n01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.320\nThese are not foes right now.\n\n01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.320\nI shoot it out there.\n\n01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.320\nIs there any part of your body that's not painful\n\n01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.320\nto get shot with an arrow?\n\n01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.320\nI shoot it at their hair.\n\n01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.320\nOh, okay.\n\n01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.320\nTheir ear lobes?\n\n01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.320\nYeah.\n\n01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.320\nOh, through their...\n\n01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.320\nThey all have earrings.\n\n01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.320\nShoot through there.\n\n01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.320\nWell, one of them hits the guy in the eye.\n\n01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.320\nTerrific.\n\n01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.320\nMight have needed him.\n\n01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320\nMight have needed him.\n\n01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.320\nThe other hits you on the foot.\n\n01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.320\nStill alive.\n\n01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320\nOkay.\n\n01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320\nYou take...\n\n01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320\nHa!\n\n01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320\nAdventure!\n\n01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320\nOne damage.\n\n01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320\nJesus.\n\n01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.320\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.320\nI've been very distracted lately.\n\n01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320\nJust keep an eye on them.\n\n01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.320\nWell, I'll take one away, apparently.\n\n01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320\nMeanwhile, in the engine room...\n\n01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.320\nI was just going to do that.\n\n01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.320\nYeah, good.\n\n01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.320\nI examine the surroundings in the engine room.\n\n01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.320\nWoosh.\n\n01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.320\nThe engine room slides open.\n\n01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.320\nYou see eight identical machine-like machines.\n\n01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.320\nThey have some vaguely machine-like qualities.\n\n01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.320\nPistons firing and tubes going to and fro.\n\n01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:58.320\nYou see several fluids pumped through the various devices.\n\n01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320\nYou can see one off in the corner.\n\n01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.320\nIt's venting a strange green gas.\n\n01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.320\nAnd you can see two black creatures crawling across it.\n\n01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.320\nHitting it with metal tools.\n\n01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.320\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.320\nBlah.\n\n01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320\nAll right, guys.\n\n01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320\nWhat's going on in here?\n\n01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.320\nThey hiss at you in a language you don't understand.\n\n01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320\nAll right.\n\n01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.320\nWell, did somebody feed you after midnight?\n\n01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.320\nOr get you wet?\n\n01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.320\nA cheddar runder.\n\n01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.320\nWhat do you say, a cheddar runder?\n\n01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.320\nYeah, I cast magic callback.\n\n01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320\nDo I need to...\n\n01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.320\nI approach them to examine the machinery.\n\n01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.320\nThere's a large crack in one of the casings.\n\n01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.320\nThat's why it's venting gas.\n\n01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.320\nThey're not sure what this stuff is.\n\n01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.320\nAre they trying to fix it or destroy it?\n\n01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.320\nThey do appear to be trying to fix it.\n\n01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.320\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.320\nSo I should leave them to their task, probably, right?\n\n01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.320\nMaybe.\n\n01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.320\nMaybe they won't fix it.\n\n01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.320\nAnybody out there got any ideas?\n\n01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320\nWhip one at a wall.\n\n01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.320\nWhip one at a wall?\n\n01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.320\nI take one of them and whip them at a wall.\n\n01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.320\nI pick them up with my strength and throw one at the wall\n\n01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.320\nto send a message to the other one to get on the fucking stick\n\n01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.320\nand stop the gas leak.\n\n01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:29.320\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.320\nHe falls to the ground and is unconscious.\n\n01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:35.320\nAnd I look at the other guy and I'm like,\n\n01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.320\nMo, Mo?\n\n01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.320\nThe other guy's not paying attention.\n\n01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320\nHe's just going back to trying to work on this thing.\n\n01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.320\nOkay.\n\n01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.320\nI go in a system.\n\n01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.320\nOkay.\n\n01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.320\nI mean, he seems like he's doing his job, right?\n\n01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320\nHe asked for some tears.\n\n01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.320\nLook.\n\n01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.320\nHe looks at you expectantly and hisses something at you.\n\n01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320\nDo I have any ability to understand him?\n\n01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.320\nI speak that language in your head.\n\n01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.320\nYou know, I run back upstairs, grab the wheel at the bridge,\n\n01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.320\nrelieve Sharpie, he goes back down into the engine room.\n\n01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.320\nYou tag out.\n\n01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320\nGoldberg style.\n\n01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.320\nYeah.\n\n01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.320\nGo.\n\n01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.320\nAll right.\n\n01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:15.320\nI go to the room.\n\n01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.320\nI carefully follow Jeff's directions.\n\n01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.320\nI say, go left until you get, keep going.\n\n01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.320\nIf you go to the bathroom, you've got too far.\n\n01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.320\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.320\nPass the unconscious lamp laying below the wall.\n\n01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.320\nAll right.\n\n01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.320\nThe other imp is, is hissing about how this was a two-person job.\n\n01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320\nIn the office.\n\n01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.320\nIt's not a two-person job.\n\n01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.320\nBad about a few people.\n\n01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.320\nWell, now it's a one-person job.\n\n01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.320\nHow do we do it?\n\n01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.320\nWhat can I do?\n\n01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320\nFrom a wizard.\n\n01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.320\nWhat about a dog that just can't even?\n\n01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.320\nWell, you speak the language, right?\n\n01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.320\nYeah, yeah, you speak the language.\n\n01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.320\nSo, what do they say?\n\n01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.320\nThe wheels translate, though.\n\n01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.320\nIt's like, I need sovereign glue.\n\n01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.320\nWell, this is hardly the time.\n\n01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.320\nThis is exactly the time.\n\n01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320\nOh, okay.\n\n01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.320\nSorry, I was doing a dumb joke.\n\n01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.320\nIs the sovereign glue that bit glopo-glowing jello\n\n01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.320\nthat was in the other room with the face bubbling up to it?\n\n01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.320\nYou don't know that it's not?\n\n01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.320\nWhat does sovereign glue look like?\n\n01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.320\nIt comes in a yellow bottle.\n\n01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.320\nIt's usually well-labeled.\n\n01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.320\nIt should be in the locker room.\n\n01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.320\nOh, the locker room.\n\n01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.320\nDidn't we get everything out of the locker room?\n\n01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.320\nYou got all the treasure.\n\n01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.320\nGo to the locker room.\n\n01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.320\nYou go to the locker room.\n\n01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.320\nI find that yellow glue.\n\n01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.320\nYou do.\n\n01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.320\nYou find it.\n\n01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.320\nYay!\n\n01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.320\nThat's applause bigger than warranted.\n\n01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.320\nYou found glue?\n\n01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.320\nLook at it.\n\n01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.320\nThey're like, finish it!\n\n01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.320\nThe babysitter's getting extra.\n\n01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.320\nAll right.\n\n01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320\nI take the yellow glue back to the engine room.\n\n01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.320\nThat happens.\n\n01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.320\nYou give them the yellow glue and he sets to work.\n\n01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.320\nHe says, it should be about five minutes.\n\n01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.320\nI think I got this.\n\n01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.320\nFive minutes?\n\n01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.320\nYeah.\n\n01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.320\nThanks, Sam.\n\n01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320\nYou know what?\n\n01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.320\nI can see you retiring one day with a happy in family,\n\n01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:13.320\nbut I guess that's not how impage works.\n\n01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.320\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.320\nAll right.\n\n01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.320\nGood day.\n\n01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.320\nI go back up to the bridge.\n\n01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:27.320\nAs you go back up to the bridge, you can't help but flash back.\n\n01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:32.320\nYou flash back to your mother's tails.\n\n01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.320\nSon, don't forget the Infinifish who will eat you up at night.\n\n01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.320\nHe'll fly past the moon in your window and eat you with a bite.\n\n01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.320\nOh, that terrible Infinifish, he'll give you such a fright.\n\n01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.320\nThat's the last thing you think of before you hear an earth-shattering impact on the\n\n01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320\nwhole.\n\n01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320\nEverything goes black.\n\n01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.320\nCliffhanger.\n\n01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.320\nCliffhanger?\n\n01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320\nCliffhanger.\n\n01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:02.320\nDungeons and Dragons!\n\n01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320\nIt's hip.\n\n01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.320\nIt's cool.\n\n01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.320\nIt's the coolest thing in the world.\n\n01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.320\nIt's my final revenge on the cool population.\n\n01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.320\nI have made Dungeons and Dragons cool.\n\n01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.320\nOne more time for Erin McGathy.\n\n01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:21.320\nIt's Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:28.320\nAnd a fun fuck you to my gym teachers throughout the years.\n\n01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:32.320\nTurns out this is a fine way to pass the time.\n\n01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.320\nHave yet to earn money doing the pull-up.\n\n01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.320\nHaving a pretty good time playing Dungeons and Dragons, Mr. Rainer.\n\n01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.320\nAll right, well, let's...\n\n01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.320\nI think we can bring this train into the station.\n\n01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320\nOf course, of course.\n\n01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.320\nWhat have we learned tonight?\n\n01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.320\nWe're going to get out of here before it's...\n\n01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.320\nFallville.\n\n01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.320\nFallville.\n\n01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320\nBut it's spelled F-O-L-L.\n\n01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.320\nYeah.\n\n01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.320\nHey.\n\n01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.320\nWhy is it S-O-M-M?\n\n01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320\nAnybody know?\n\n01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320\nSomebody's name?\n\n01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320\nThey made it up.\n\n01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320\nThey made it up at a town meeting.\n\n01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320\nNo one knows why.\n\n01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.320\nIt's just because this Wahlberg guy was a fucking...\n\n01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.320\nSheep fucker.\n\n01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.320\nShe was a sheep fucker.\n\n01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.320\nHow many fuckers do you get through up here?\n\n01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.320\nDo you do them all?\n\n01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320\nYou finish mine, by the way.\n\n01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.320\nI can't tell, because I kept marrying them.\n\n01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320\nThat's the danger.\n\n01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.320\nIf we had a fifth up here, then we could monitor it.\n\n01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.320\nWe're the first Matt.\n\n01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320\nWe paid him enough.\n\n01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.320\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.320\nMatt didn't do anything wrong.\n\n01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.320\nMatt didn't.\n\n01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.320\nThere's just a bunch of empty glasses, and I'm happy.\n\n01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320\nI could measure it in happiness.\n\n01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320\nI'm very happy.\n\n01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.320\nI've had a good time in Somerville.\n\n01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.320\nAnybody that...\n\n01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.320\nAaron told me that you guys set a record that we didn't know was setable for a pre-show\n\n01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.320\nsale of merchandise.\n\n01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.320\nI guess you guys bought the most shit before the show.\n\n01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320\nBut can they go for the total?\n\n01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320\nThat's not why we're here.\n\n01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.320\nI'm taking a loss on the tour.\n\n01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:00.320\nI'm doing this to indulge my own 40-year-old fantasies.\n\n01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.320\nWe're not a profiteering people.\n\n01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:08.320\nWe're just coming through town, but we do have t-shirts and maps and photos and whatever\n\n01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.320\nthe hell.\n\n01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320\nI don't know, glow worms, whatever the fuck.\n\n01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.320\nAt the I Love Spencer pin where the heart is a 20-sided die, which is awesome.\n\n01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.320\nAnd if you buy that stuff, I'm happy to sign it now.\n\n01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:25.320\nI can't turn anybody down, so I'll be here all night until the last thing is signed.\n\n01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.320\nDo you think it's possible to do audience passing with tables in here?\n\n01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.320\nIs that really reckless?\n\n01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.320\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.320\nThat would be the ultimate fuck you to Brooklyn.\n\n01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:39.320\nYeah, if we could somehow manage.\n\n01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:49.320\nJust gonna make sure my wallet and my phone.\n\n01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.320\nFind your center first, man.\n\n01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.320\nThank you, Summerville.\n\n01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.320\nFind out what...this is about what Summerville means to us.\n\n01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.320\nWhere are we in our tour?\n\n01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:05.320\nThere are four seasons in the year, but the most special one is right here.\n\n01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:12.320\nIn Summerville, it's where I wanted to kill up on the stage.\n\n01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.320\nAnd I did alright, and I think we all had a halfway decent night.\n\n01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:22.320\nAnd I don't know what you paid, but I think we're gonna be alright.\n\n01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.320\nIn Summerville, I fucked your mama.\n\n01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.320\nShe was on the pill.\n\n01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:36.320\nShe didn't get pregnant, so I will not have a child with her.\n\n01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320\nBut if I did, I'd raise it like Raymond Burr.\n\n01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:46.320\nI'd teach him to be Perry Mason, and he'd solve cases on TV with hastens justice.\n\n01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:53.320\nHe'd cross-examine people and get to the bottom of shit in Harmontown.\n\n01:49:53.320 --> 01:50:01.320\nHarmontown, sing it.\n\n01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.320\nWe're making it up.\n\n01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320\nWe're making it up.\n\n01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.320\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.320\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.320\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.320\nHold on, I'll get it together, don't worry about it.\n\n01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.320\nI fucked your mama tonight.\n\n01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.320\nTo your mama's house, I rang the doorbell and said hello.\n\n01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:33.320\nShe said, come inside of my house and have some ambrosia salad with Jello.\n\n01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.320\nI laid down on the table, it got so nasty.\n\n01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.320\nShe poured it over me, I didn't care.\n\n01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:45.320\nI fucked your mama so hard that she's the color of her hair.\n\n01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:50.320\nWent out in Harmontown, Harmontown.\n\n01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:57.320\nI fucked your mama in Harmontown, where he is yellow and poop is brown.\n\n01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.320\nI fucked your mama so hard in Harmontown.\n\n01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:03.320\nAll right, get the biggest people to look forward.\n\n01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:05.320\nGet the biggest.\n\n01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.320\nWe can do it.\n\n01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.320\nWe're doing it.\n\n01:51:09.320 -->
