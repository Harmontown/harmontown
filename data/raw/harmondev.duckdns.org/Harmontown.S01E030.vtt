00:00.000 --> 00:23.600
Hello Johnny Dees in Somerville, Massachusetts, welcome!

00:23.600 --> 00:32.480
Harmontown is now in session! Won't you please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown,

00:32.480 --> 01:01.480
Dan Harmon! Well, thank you Somerville! We've already had our first injury Jeff, I don't know if you saw my entrance, but it was less than graceful, I took out either a busboy or a cop or I don't know, I'll find out later in the basement.

01:01.480 --> 01:30.480
This used to be an old cop bar, they say, it's a very old architecture in the basement, you can see the first hand effects of the fact that in the turn of the century, people, they never grew beyond three feet tall, everything, there's just a system of hobbit holes down there, there's just millions of miles of concrete, stucco, half built chairs, old bull whips, like a corpse of a guy dressed as Santa Claus in a bathtub,

01:30.480 --> 01:56.480
Just weird shit from like, weird old days when Somerville was not the best managed town in the United States, voted in the Boston Globe, best managed town, I Wikipedia'd you motherfuckers, there is some funny shit in their Wikipedia entry, I don't think the guy that did most of the editing of your Wikipedia entry was on the tourist board, but I'm all over the place, what am I doing?

01:56.480 --> 02:16.480
Anyways, I wiped some guy out, somebody write him a check, that was my point, I guess in the 1890s, when this place was probably built, I think people just ate dirt and smoked cigarettes all day, they didn't have vitamins, so everything was kind of shrunken down down there, so I have a lot of stuff.

02:16.480 --> 02:27.480
The mirrors are all because the ceilings are so low, the mirrors just give you a perfect view of your balls, it's just like everything was hung by like a deranged midget leprechaun down there.

02:27.480 --> 02:45.480
Somerville, Jeff, some facts about it, just to get to know each other, most important fact I think, I'm assuming that the Somervillians would have you know, it's not Boston, but there's probably a lot of Bostonians here that made the drive.

02:45.480 --> 02:58.480
But Somerville's very proud of its independence I think, you know, we're just north of Boston, might as well be Boston, but maybe it's a little more wicked, a little less retarded.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.480
We don't know, let's find out, we don't know.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.480
We'll find out the wickedness to retarded ratio.

03:03.480 --> 03:11.480
Major exports, goodwill hunting photos, a lot of bars, a lot of Matt Damon have been applicant on the wall here.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.480
A lot of Colin Quinn looking likes walking around.

03:14.480 --> 03:23.480
Yeah, I'm from Milwaukee, so I know, yeah, there's a lot of my uncles here in Spare, that's good, that makes me feel at home.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.480
Yeah, I know how you guys like them apples, or I guess I don't.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.480
I know you like your screenplays horrible, but I don't know how you like your apples.

03:31.480 --> 03:37.480
Yeah, yeah, you know what, everyone gets a pet peeve, everyone gets one.

03:37.480 --> 03:46.480
Yeah, I'm not gonna go around to the bars and take all the Matt Damon photos off the wall, I'm just a petty jealous asshole.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.480
William Goldman wrote that script.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.480
Okay, but you hate that one scene with the apples more than anything, that really sticks in your throat.

03:53.480 --> 03:58.480
That really fucking sticks, I do not like those apples, I do not like that scene, I don't understand.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.480
Is that banging on a window, how do you like them apples, and the guy bothers to say yes?

04:03.480 --> 04:12.480
I like them, I let's continue to have this conversation, who would ever do that, it completely removes me from the movie.

04:12.480 --> 04:18.480
And then if that didn't remove you from the movie, mini-drivers face.

04:18.480 --> 04:27.480
No, I don't know, it's the Boston air, I'm getting a jocular and mean, I don't mean to do that, I'm sorry.

04:27.480 --> 04:32.480
There's a ghost of police brutality in the basement.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.480
I can just tell, it was an old cop bar and you just know that unofficial police procedures happened down there.

04:37.480 --> 04:43.480
There's too many choices walking up to the stage, we walked six miles, remember the scene in Spinal Tap?

04:43.480 --> 04:50.480
We have a shot of us walking, but beyond the scene in Spinal Tap, every three feet there was a way to go that way, a way to go that way,

04:50.480 --> 04:54.480
and you would just see a glimpse of a sink with a wig.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.480
We should play our D&D down there.

04:57.480 --> 05:03.480
We could, I think they call it LARPing, live action role-playing.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.480
Facts about Somerville, the typewriter was invented here?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.480
Not true.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.480
Sometimes you get lazy.

05:12.480 --> 05:19.480
The original choice for Somerville's new name when they broke away from Charleston, Charlestown?

05:19.480 --> 05:29.480
They broke away from those assholes and their original choice for a name was Walford after the first settler,

05:29.480 --> 05:35.480
but then they just changed it to Somerville, which means this Walford guy, something turned up, right?

05:35.480 --> 05:38.480
There's no mention, no one knows why they changed it to Somerville.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.480
That sounds like a hasty decision after you went to Walford's house to go,

05:43.480 --> 05:50.480
congratulations, here's your plaque, what is that in your living room? That's my daughter and my mom.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.480
It's the old junkie. You fuck one sheep.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.480
Something went down at the Walford estate and they just picked the name Somerville,

05:59.480 --> 06:02.480
and no one here knows why they picked the name Somerville.

06:02.480 --> 06:10.480
They actually had a historical commission look into it and it just seems like it was a purely fanciful name.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.480
It's adorable. It's better than Boston.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.480
Boston!

06:16.480 --> 06:18.480
Who picked that name?

06:18.480 --> 06:22.480
A lot of those, like in California where we're from, there's places like Thousand Oaks,

06:22.480 --> 06:25.480
and there's no oaks, there's not a thousand of them anyway,

06:25.480 --> 06:29.480
and those used to be really embarrassing names like Buttcrack Creek and stuff like that.

06:29.480 --> 06:36.480
They were old, like it was the West, and so a lot of things were called the Big Titty Mountains, that's the Grand Teton.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.480
Yeah, we have history too, where we come from.

06:40.480 --> 06:47.480
But listen to this bit of history, Jeff, this is the first town that I want to read entire sections of the Wikipedia entry.

06:47.480 --> 06:52.480
I think this is just so interesting and uncomfortable.

06:52.480 --> 06:58.480
Just hold your applause until the end of this paragraph, or laughter, or cringing or crying, or walking out,

06:58.480 --> 07:01.480
whatever your reaction you have to this, hold it until the end.

07:01.480 --> 07:08.480
Paul Revere, in one account he wrote of his ride to warn the colonists, mentions a location in Somerville, then part of Charleston.

07:08.480 --> 07:15.480
The location was the site where 20 years earlier a local slave, known as Mark, owned by John Codman, was publicly gibbeted.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.480
Wait, wait, wait.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.480
More on that later.

07:20.480 --> 07:27.480
The location is probably near the site of the present-day Holiday Inn on Washington Street.

07:27.480 --> 07:33.480
Not written by the Holiday Inn people, not written by Somerville's Tourism Bureau.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.480
Bye-bye.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.480
Continental breakfast on Sundays.

07:37.480 --> 07:41.480
Also, a black person got gibbeted.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.480
But Dan, that means he was treated to expert luxury and comfort.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.480
No, I looked it up. I wanted to know what gibbeted.

07:49.480 --> 07:57.480
Gibbeted is like, and it's most humane, it's basically just putting a dude in a cage and letting him die of thirst.

07:57.480 --> 08:07.480
They did it at crossroads and things to like, if you murdered or stole or whatever, God knows what this poor guy did.

08:07.480 --> 08:13.480
So it was like a public warning and probably counts as torture, I think.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.480
I don't know where we stand on that now.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.480
Wait, so they put you in a cage and you're left there?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.480
Yeah, and then you just die in a cage.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.480
So I have been gibbeted at Holiday Inn before.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.480
Nice.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.480
White people problems.

08:31.480 --> 08:36.480
I went to a Holiday Inn in somewhere, it was called like Indiana, Pennsylvania.

08:36.480 --> 08:41.480
It was the most complicated little turnpike town and there was nothing to do.

08:41.480 --> 08:47.480
I went to a Holiday Inn and it's the only hotel I've ever been in. Not only was there no closet, there was no...

08:47.480 --> 08:50.480
The hairdryer and the TV didn't work at the same time.

08:50.480 --> 08:55.480
I haven't seen that since the 70s where the hairdryer affected the reception on the TV.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.480
But also no windows. No windows in a hotel room. It was really, really creepy.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.480
It was really like being in a prison cell.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
I had some hotel complaints along the way.

09:04.480 --> 09:11.480
And then the slogan downstairs is, relax. It's Holiday Inn. But the line reading is, relax.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.480
It's Holiday Inn.

09:13.480 --> 09:18.480
This is America. You live in a honeycomb of cement and glass.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.480
Start your own hotel. Good luck.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.480
We're part of the... relax. It's a military industrial complex.

09:29.480 --> 09:33.480
You're sleeping in a bed made by people who make missiles probably.

09:33.480 --> 09:38.480
Everything's taken care of. Just dig your ditch and die.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.480
Holiday Inn. Gibbetting since 1742.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.480
Who says gibbetting has to be uncomfortable?

09:47.480 --> 09:53.480
Slowly die of thirst. Do you know what's weird is at this Comfort Inn that we're at, like another Ironically...

09:53.480 --> 09:55.480
Damn, another all going to come over.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.480
No, they're not. It's 48,000 miles.

09:57.480 --> 10:08.480
Everyone come over to the Comfort Inn where the East 93 meets the fucking cave where the Pirates of the Caribbean are.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.480
We are out of town. We are out of town.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.480
And there's no water in the hotel. That was a new thing.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.480
There was a machine in the lobby that has a water button and I pressed it and nothing came out.

10:20.480 --> 10:24.480
And we all know when you press a water button, you're thirsty.

10:24.480 --> 10:29.480
You usually accidentally get the amount of water you kind of feel like getting.

10:29.480 --> 10:35.480
When you're thirsty enough to seek out a water button, you get bummed when water don't come out.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.480
That was some Wiley Coyote shit that they pulled.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.480
And then I started pressing juice buttons and none of them worked.

10:41.480 --> 10:47.480
I think that's the continental breakfast machine that you get water and juice from 7 to 9.30 a.m.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.480
Hey, Jeff.

10:51.480 --> 10:56.480
Fluff the marshmallow cream was invented here in Somerville.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.480
There's a look of real pride in the crowd right now.

10:59.480 --> 11:04.480
Well, they're into it. Don't people eat marshmallow cream and...

11:04.480 --> 11:06.480
Fluffer butters.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.480
That sounds good. I will take that.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.480
Do you do it with Nutella ever?

11:12.480 --> 11:15.480
We're not so different.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.480
We can get along.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.480
Somerville's the home of Fluff?

11:21.480 --> 11:26.480
It was invented here. It doesn't say when, but I assume when...

11:26.480 --> 11:29.480
1325.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.480
Blackbeard is here.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.480
Fluffbeard.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.480
I was a member of the Mohawk tribe.

11:36.480 --> 11:43.480
There's a druid in the audience that turned lead into fluffy marshmallow cream

11:43.480 --> 11:52.480
using the moon and a gibbeted woman.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.480
Okay, just a couple more things.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.480
I don't know. I'm fascinated, Jeff. I love history. I love Somerville.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.480
Somerville.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.480
The first residential phone line...

12:02.480 --> 12:04.480
This is interesting to me.

12:04.480 --> 12:10.480
The first residential phone line in the United States in 1877 was installed here.

12:10.480 --> 12:15.480
It was invented from Charles Williams Jr.'s house to Alexander Graham Bell's place in Boston

12:15.480 --> 12:17.480
where he was working on telephonics.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.480
There was some guy that lived here that was so rich and powerful

12:21.480 --> 12:24.480
that as soon as he heard there was a phone being invented,

12:24.480 --> 12:26.480
it's like an equivalent of this.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.480
I was an iPhone douche for a while.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.480
When's it coming out? I want my assistant to stand in line for it.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.480
Some guy was like, what's Alexander Graham Bell working on in Boston?

12:35.480 --> 12:38.480
It's some kind of thing. You can talk to people without me in there.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.480
I want the first door...

12:40.480 --> 12:44.480
He just called Alexander Graham Bell every day.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.480
What's going on? I'm working on the fucking thing you're talking to me on.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.480
Can you hang up so I can test it some more?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.480
Just making sure it still works.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.480
I'm not going to pay my bill at the end of the month if it's not...

12:57.480 --> 12:59.480
I'm not working on it.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.480
I think that's about it for the history of Somerville.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.480
Except most recently, Jeff, there's a big rebirth story here.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.480
What were you going to say?

13:07.480 --> 13:09.480
No, baby, come on.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.480
I was going to open it to the floor and...

13:11.480 --> 13:13.480
Baby, let's not fight, baby.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.480
Don't do me that way.

13:15.480 --> 13:20.480
I was going to say, maybe someone out there has some historical tidbits and nuggets.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.480
I bet they do. That segues into this one little chapter.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.480
I read another thing in the Wikipedia page.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.480
Right before the 90s...

13:29.480 --> 13:34.480
This place in the 90s had this incredible gentrification effort that happened.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.480
Before that, they had a nickname for this place, Slumberville.

13:38.480 --> 13:44.480
It was the car theft capital of the United States.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.480
That's pretty amazing.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.480
Why isn't that New York?

13:49.480 --> 13:56.480
You've got to steal a lot of cars to not be New York or LA as either car theft capital.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.480
I don't know if it was per capita. Maybe that's what it was.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.480
Maybe people have six cars each here.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.480
Say what?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.480
It was a racket.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.480
What do you mean? You were falsely branded?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
Wait, what did you say?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.480
My birth was financed that way.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.480
Your birth was financed that way?

14:13.480 --> 14:15.480
Wait, was it like a mob racket?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.480
My family car was stolen.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.480
Are you willing to come up here?

14:19.480 --> 14:23.480
Or do you need to have a shadow across your face and your voice change?

14:23.480 --> 14:26.480
Are you in the relocation program?

14:26.480 --> 14:29.480
What it sounds like we're hearing is that...

14:29.480 --> 14:31.480
Get on up here. What's your name?

14:31.480 --> 14:38.480
I think what she might be saying...

14:38.480 --> 14:40.480
Oh, she's got like a Harmontown t-shirt.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
Did you make that?

14:42.480 --> 14:43.480
I did.

14:43.480 --> 14:50.480
I get off on t-shirts?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
Very nice.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.480
Alright, Summerville.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.480
We may do some crowd surfing yet.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.480
I don't know if you heard Brooklyn,

14:57.480 --> 15:00.480
but I indulged a 40th birthday fantasy.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.480
And crowd surfed there.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.480
Here I think I'll just end up with an ass full of hot wings.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.480
That's not your fault.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.480
You have more comfortable seating than in Brooklyn.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.480
They were able to lift my fat ass to the back of the room.

15:13.480 --> 15:18.480
Anyways, Cara, I'm assuming what you're alluding to is like some kind of organized crime chapter of your history?

15:18.480 --> 15:19.480
Yeah, exactly.

15:19.480 --> 15:23.480
So they were just... cars were being stolen and re-stolen and...

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
Exactly, yeah.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.480
So you would pretend your car got stolen as an insurance racket or what?

15:27.480 --> 15:29.480
Yeah, basically that was it.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.480
And I have to say this story runs to my family.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.480
Obviously, I wasn't there.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.480
But the hospital bill needed to get paid,

15:35.480 --> 15:37.480
and so, yeah, there was an insurance policy on the car,

15:37.480 --> 15:38.480
and it just happened to get left,

15:38.480 --> 15:40.480
so the door was open and the key is in it.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.480
What's that square that used to be,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.480
that was the most notorious place for theft?

15:44.480 --> 15:45.480
What was it, Assembly Square?

15:45.480 --> 15:46.480
Assembly Square, yeah.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.480
So you couldn't leave anything if it wasn't nailed down.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.480
And then in the 90s, how does that work?

15:51.480 --> 15:53.480
There were artists and...

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
The T-station came in.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.480
Davis Square T-station.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.480
Oh, the MBTA, the subway.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.480
Oh, okay, so the subway was built

16:00.480 --> 16:03.480
that allowed people to kind of flood into Somerville

16:03.480 --> 16:07.480
and turn it into what the Boston Globe called

16:07.480 --> 16:11.480
the best-managed city in the United States.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.480
I assume that means the cleanest government in the...

16:14.480 --> 16:17.480
I don't know, like if I'm about to spit out my gum,

16:17.480 --> 16:19.480
like a robot comes by and grabs it,

16:19.480 --> 16:21.480
or I don't know what does best-managed city mean,

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
but it sounds good.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.480
So, I mean, didn't the insurance companies here

16:24.480 --> 16:26.480
kind of like... didn't they smell a rat?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.480
Or was everybody profiting off of this?

16:28.480 --> 16:31.480
I mean, I hear it was a pretty good time

16:31.480 --> 16:33.480
for a pretty long time.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.480
You're getting nervous.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.480
There's a red dot on your forehead.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.480
The laser...

16:39.480 --> 16:41.480
Yeah, are we sure there's not a statute of limitations on that?

16:41.480 --> 16:44.480
Your parents are going to go to jail after this podcast drops?

16:44.480 --> 16:45.480
Should we arrange that?

16:45.480 --> 16:47.480
Yeah.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.480
All right, let's talk about this.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.480
It's going to be a new crime wave.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.480
Somerville's going to be the murder...

16:53.480 --> 16:55.480
the falling downstairs capital of the world.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.480
The starving artists that flooded into the 90s

16:58.480 --> 17:01.480
are now realizing that they need to weld something for a living.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
Is there trouble at home?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.480
I'm just trying to keep up the tradition of, you know,

17:06.480 --> 17:09.480
mob... mob death.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.480
I don't know.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.480
Mob whacking your family?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.480
I'm trying... hey, I'm trying to get made, you know.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.480
Are you Italian?

17:16.480 --> 17:18.480
I am, yeah.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.480
Full 100% Italian?

17:20.480 --> 17:21.480
Siciliana.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.480
Wow.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.480
Okay.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.480
Yeah, I know.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.480
Is there... anybody Polish here?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.480
I don't know.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.480
Wash your dupa.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.480
Wash your dupa.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.480
Yeah, dup... dupa means butt.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.480
My... my... my... my... my... my Boucha,

17:43.480 --> 17:46.480
my grandma used to tell me to wash my dupa.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.480
Nice.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.480
Never tell you about my great-grandma Boucha, Jeff.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.480
I think you... a little bit.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.480
She murdered some people.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.480
I think it's safe to say now that she's... she's... she's dead.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
I was gonna say, finally dead, but that would sound mean.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.480
I just mean, finally, in the sense that she lived to, like,

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
108 or something.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.480
And she took some fuckers out with her.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.480
Like, she was a...

18:06.480 --> 18:07.480
Did she drink the blood or something?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.480
She was... she was just hard... she was a...

18:09.480 --> 18:11.480
she was a hard drinker. She was a vaudevillian.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.480
She was a...

18:12.480 --> 18:14.480
Sound familiar?

18:14.480 --> 18:16.480
Yeah, no, they say, they always said,

18:16.480 --> 18:18.480
you should talk to... talk to grandma Boucha.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.480
You know, like, you... you guys share something.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
Like, maybe it... maybe it skips two generations.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.480
Like, whatever you are.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.480
And then I... so I'd go in and,

18:26.480 --> 18:27.480
what was vaudeville like?

18:27.480 --> 18:29.480
If she'd go, what the fuck do you think it was like?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.480
Give me a drink.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.480
It was... it was... it was on stage.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.480
I had an umbrella. It was a poodle. I don't know.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.480
But then she would, like, you know,

18:37.480 --> 18:39.480
we had to boycott Christmas a lot because she would...

18:39.480 --> 18:41.480
she would... she would do one of those things

18:41.480 --> 18:43.480
where she would point at her cheek and say,

18:43.480 --> 18:44.480
give me... give me a kiss.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.480
And then she'd swivel into it and, like,

18:46.480 --> 18:49.480
basically French her grandsons.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.480
Like, she was... she was into it.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.480
Wait, didn't she... didn't she, like, stab a dude?

18:54.480 --> 18:56.480
She stabbed a dude.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.480
She said he fell on the scissors.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.480
Nine times.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.480
I don't know how you fall on scissors

19:04.480 --> 19:06.480
nine times in your crotch area.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
On a trampoline?

19:07.480 --> 19:09.480
Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
But... and I think that...

19:10.480 --> 19:12.480
that was, like, when she was in her 70s,

19:12.480 --> 19:14.480
so I think the cops thought...

19:14.480 --> 19:16.480
because we were... we were watching a packer game

19:16.480 --> 19:19.480
in... in Wisconsin and, uh,

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
like, this thing came over the... you know,

19:21.480 --> 19:23.480
they'd do local news stuff over the packer game

19:23.480 --> 19:25.480
and some, you know, some local guy said...

19:25.480 --> 19:28.480
said, oh, here's a human interest piece.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.480
A 77-year-old woman was being brought in for questioning

19:32.480 --> 19:35.480
regarding the possible homicide of a...

19:35.480 --> 19:37.480
of her roommate.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.480
Sounds funny.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.480
And we all joked in the living room,

19:41.480 --> 19:43.480
like, oh, Grandma Boucher.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.480
And then the phone rang.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.480
And it was the police.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
And it was, like, her one phone call.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.480
And, like, she had, like, she had had a quarrel

19:52.480 --> 19:54.480
with this lover of hers that she was living with.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.480
And then we don't know what happened from there,

19:57.480 --> 19:59.480
but we know it ended with him dying

19:59.480 --> 20:02.480
after receiving a few... a few punctures

20:02.480 --> 20:05.480
with a pair of scissors below his waistline.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
Oh!

20:06.480 --> 20:08.480
And I think that the cops thought,

20:08.480 --> 20:10.480
she's 70, any sentence is a life sentence,

20:10.480 --> 20:11.480
let her go.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.480
And she... and she went on a fucking spree

20:13.480 --> 20:15.480
for 30 years.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.480
14 people dead.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.480
Like, they're starting to...

20:19.480 --> 20:21.480
Grandma Boucher's amazing, like, she...

20:21.480 --> 20:23.480
I have news items on tape.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
I'm sorry, Kara, I just...

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
Pull up some bullet peanuts or something.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.480
I just want to tell you about my grandma.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.480
It's as well worth surrendering the liberty of a member

20:30.480 --> 20:32.480
of my family, you know, through my stories,

20:32.480 --> 20:33.480
to get at yours.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.480
I mean, I would apologize for the tangent, but...

20:35.480 --> 20:36.480
Yeah, exactly.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
I mean...

20:38.480 --> 20:40.480
She's getting off right now.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
Yeah, I should charge you for it.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.480
The...

20:44.480 --> 20:46.480
She at one point, like, she...

20:46.480 --> 20:49.480
There's a news item that I have on VHS tape

20:49.480 --> 20:51.480
for some of you kids, there was a thing called VHS,

20:51.480 --> 20:52.480
isn't it?

20:52.480 --> 20:54.480
The... she...

20:54.480 --> 20:56.480
Thank you, sir.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.480
This guy...

20:58.480 --> 21:01.480
He's like a veteran in a wheelchair.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.480
I remember VHS.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.480
Thank you, sir.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.480
I got Top Gun on Beta Max.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.480
I'm a real American.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.480
Me too.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.480
Sinbad of the 70's, Tron.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.480
Yes.

21:19.480 --> 21:23.480
All right, just leave me alone for a second.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.480
I just want to finish...

21:24.480 --> 21:26.480
I have OCD, like, I want to finish my grandma Boucher thing.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.480
Like, she...

21:27.480 --> 21:28.480
Wait, Boucher means grandma, right?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.480
Boucher means grandma, so she was my...

21:30.480 --> 21:31.480
You know, like...

21:31.480 --> 21:32.480
Grandma, grandma.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like...

21:33.480 --> 21:34.480
It's all the same.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.480
Like, Boucher's like Mima, you know,

21:36.480 --> 21:39.480
Irish people say Mima, and, you know,

21:39.480 --> 21:41.480
some people say Pop Pop for, like, Grandpa.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.480
It's like...

21:42.480 --> 21:44.480
Boucher, she was Grandma Boucher,

21:44.480 --> 21:45.480
so she was Grandma Grandma.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.480
Yeah.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.480
Yeah, yeah, she's 600.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.480
So she...

21:51.480 --> 21:53.480
She was on the news again,

21:53.480 --> 21:57.480
decades after successfully murdering a man.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.480
This blows my mind.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.480
She...

22:03.480 --> 22:06.480
Someone tried to steal her microwave.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
We think it was like a drinking buddy

22:08.480 --> 22:10.480
that she owed money to, and, like...

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
She was 90?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.480
She was, like, at least 90, yeah,

22:13.480 --> 22:14.480
something like that.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.480
Awesome.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.480
And she had a scuffle with this person

22:19.480 --> 22:21.480
that tried to steal her microwave,

22:21.480 --> 22:24.480
and the person took a butcher knife

22:24.480 --> 22:27.480
and slashed her in the throat.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.480
It's a happy ending.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.480
Depending on where you fall on,

22:32.480 --> 22:35.480
Grandma Boucher being out there.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.480
Maybe not for the police, it's not a happy ending.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.480
Not for the DA.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.480
That she...

22:43.480 --> 22:44.480
And then she...

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
According to her recollection of the event,

22:46.480 --> 22:48.480
like, she was...

22:48.480 --> 22:50.480
This person got away with the microwave,

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
slashed her in the throat,

22:51.480 --> 22:52.480
and she was laying there for a while.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.480
It was like, oh, someone will come find me.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
And then she thought,

22:55.480 --> 22:57.480
no one's gonna come find me.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.480
I'm Grandma Boucher.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.480
So she got up,

23:00.480 --> 23:02.480
wrapped a towel around her neck,

23:02.480 --> 23:04.480
and walked to the emergency room,

23:04.480 --> 23:07.480
where they sewed her neck back up.

23:07.480 --> 23:10.480
And there's a tape

23:10.480 --> 23:12.480
that circulates among my family

23:12.480 --> 23:14.480
of the local news report that's like,

23:14.480 --> 23:16.480
oh, they didn't know.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.480
They should have done their research

23:18.480 --> 23:20.480
and made this into more of a character,

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
but this is a whole new generation of news reporters

23:22.480 --> 23:24.480
just going, hey, here's a funny thing.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.480
There's a really old lady got slashed on the throat,

23:26.480 --> 23:28.480
and she lived, and she wrapped the towel,

23:28.480 --> 23:30.480
and then they show this doctor.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.480
They get the statement from him,

23:31.480 --> 23:33.480
and you can see the emergency room behind him,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.480
giving a statement, and he's just looking at his face,

23:35.480 --> 23:37.480
like he just watched an episode of The Monsters

23:37.480 --> 23:38.480
or something like that.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.480
He doesn't know what, he's going,

23:40.480 --> 23:42.480
a woman came in,

23:42.480 --> 23:45.480
and about 90 years old,

23:45.480 --> 23:48.480
and she had her neck slashed,

23:48.480 --> 23:50.480
like all the way across,

23:50.480 --> 23:53.480
and I put some stitches in it,

23:53.480 --> 23:56.480
and she left.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.480
And he's so confused,

23:58.480 --> 24:01.480
because everything he's learned about medicine

24:01.480 --> 24:03.480
has gone out the window.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.480
But the weird thing was,

24:05.480 --> 24:07.480
she left through the air conditioning duct in the ceiling.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.480
I think I just, I patched a golem?

24:11.480 --> 24:13.480
I don't know what I did.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.480
Was it masonry that I did?

24:15.480 --> 24:17.480
Alright, anyways, back to you, Kara.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.480
Did you get off on that tangent?

24:19.480 --> 24:22.480
We're in polite company, I should start.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.480
Sorry.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.480
Alright, Kara, what can we do for you

24:26.480 --> 24:28.480
before you leave us?

24:28.480 --> 24:30.480
Let's reward you for coming up here

24:30.480 --> 24:32.480
and possibly incriminating yourself and your family.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.480
Was this some Harmontown wish fulfillment up here?

24:35.480 --> 24:38.480
Yeah, yeah, like, what, what, I don't know,

24:38.480 --> 24:41.480
I could go, what's your big ambition in life?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.480
Like, what's your unfulfilled?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.480
Unfulfilled ambition.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.480
I'm a costume designer.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
And so do you want to be a big time costume designer?

24:50.480 --> 24:51.480
Yeah, that'd be great.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.480
What does that entail?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.480
Being just about as poor as I am now,

24:55.480 --> 24:57.480
but probably in New York.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.480
You do it for film or for print or fashion?

25:00.480 --> 25:01.480
Theater?

25:01.480 --> 25:02.480
Yeah.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.480
Alright, so, and currently you do it here locally?

25:05.480 --> 25:06.480
Yeah.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.480
Oh, okay, and do you pay your rent doing it?

25:08.480 --> 25:09.480
Yeah, just about.

25:09.480 --> 25:13.480
I have a day job at a self-defense non-profit.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.480
A self-defense non-profit?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.480
Yes.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.480
But that's not a very good day job, it's a non-profit.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.480
It's true, it's all...

25:21.480 --> 25:23.480
You keep looking at your time card and going,

25:23.480 --> 25:25.480
God, am I doing this wrong?

25:25.480 --> 25:27.480
Sliding in the machine?

25:27.480 --> 25:29.480
It's a non-profit, Kara.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.480
Okay, so, alright, I think we can...

25:32.480 --> 25:36.480
Let's thank Kara for coming up and let's reward her.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.480
Thank you, Kara.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.480
Thank you for making that t-shirt.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.480
You can...

25:42.480 --> 25:43.480
Sit down, Kara.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.480
Okay, bye.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.480
I didn't know...

25:45.480 --> 25:46.480
We're from Los Angeles.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.480
We have, like, showbiz shorthand.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.480
When you thank someone, it means fuck off.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.480
When you say I love it, it means I don't...

25:56.480 --> 25:58.480
I didn't see it.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.480
Yeah.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.480
I'm not gonna say anything about it until someone else says something about it

26:02.480 --> 26:05.480
and then I can see whether I can make money off of it.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.480
But, no, we would never say fuck off to Kara.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.480
Thank you, Kara.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.480
So, let's do...

26:12.480 --> 26:13.480
Let's just do the...

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
Let's do her big movie.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.480
Let's do her biopic.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.480
Is it Kara or Kara?

26:17.480 --> 26:18.480
Kara.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.480
Kara.

26:19.480 --> 26:27.480
The story of Kara going from being a down-and-out Somerville costume designer,

26:27.480 --> 26:33.480
working at a nonprofit for a self-defense organization,

26:33.480 --> 26:35.480
and making it big.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.480
Here it is.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.480
It's gonna be four minutes long.

26:38.480 --> 26:51.480
I love it.

26:51.480 --> 26:59.480
I'm at a sewing machine.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.480
Oh, God.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.480
Kara?

27:02.480 --> 27:04.480
Yes, Mr. Haberstrom.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.480
I have some bad news for you.

27:06.480 --> 27:11.480
Your parents, that are both in jail for fraud,

27:11.480 --> 27:15.480
they were murdered by Grandma Boucher.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.480
They'll finally...

27:17.480 --> 27:18.480
Wait, wait.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.480
Was there any payout?

27:19.480 --> 27:20.480
Nope.

27:20.480 --> 27:24.480
Oh, damn, my Italian blood.

27:24.480 --> 27:29.480
Get back to work and sew those socks.

27:29.480 --> 27:35.480
I should have stole my own cars like Dad.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.480
Ugh.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.480
What chance does an honest girl like me have in this racket?

27:40.480 --> 27:41.480
Harmontown tickets.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.480
Get your Harmontown tickets.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.480
Big famous screenwriter from Hollywood, California.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.480
Coming out to Somerville, Massachusetts.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.480
Making dreams come true.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.480
Harmontown.

27:53.480 --> 27:58.480
That's the podcast I get off to.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.480
Sir, sir, I'm just a poor costume designer.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.480
I only work in Somerville.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.480
Everyone basically wears whatever they want here.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.480
You should come on down to Harmontown.

28:09.480 --> 28:15.480
I gotta warn you, the tickets are pretty overpriced for the content value.

28:15.480 --> 28:21.480
Seems to me, just two jackasses grab assing for an hour and a half.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.480
Guy rapping about fucking everybody's mama.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.480
That's not show business.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.480
Get a real job.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.480
Don't follow your dreams.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.480
I'm a threshold guardian.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.480
Fuck you, stranger.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.480
You're wrong, mister.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.480
I leave, but I accidentally drop a Harmontown ticket.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.480
But one stupid Italian piece of shit.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.480
Fuck her.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.480
I got shit to do.

28:44.480 --> 28:51.480
I got a worthless ticket to a relatively worthless show.

28:51.480 --> 28:56.480
I'm gonna go to Chinese D's where everyone else wants to go.

28:56.480 --> 29:01.480
Everybody put your hands together for Dad Harmontown.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
Hey, Somerville.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.480
Waka, waka, waka.

29:05.480 --> 29:08.480
I farted the other day.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
It was so interesting.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.480
I got fired from community.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.480
Booty-dooty-booty-doo.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.480
Oh, my God.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.480
It's two years later.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.480
I'm Kara, but now I'm taller and better looking.

29:22.480 --> 29:25.480
This guy, God, I just had four orgasms on that content.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.480
And the tangent, he went off on.

29:27.480 --> 29:32.480
Chevy Chase.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.480
Can I come up on stage?

29:35.480 --> 29:40.480
And then I saw her.

29:40.480 --> 29:45.480
That's when I saw her.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Oh, my God.

29:46.480 --> 29:50.480
Sorry, I just came again.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
What's your name, ma'am?

29:51.480 --> 29:53.480
Kara.

29:53.480 --> 29:58.480
Grubetz Leoni.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.480
Ten minutes later, at the end of the show.

30:00.480 --> 30:05.480
Oh.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.480
Do I get the job?

30:07.480 --> 30:12.480
Yes.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.480
All right.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.480
Well, that seemed...

30:16.480 --> 30:17.480
I don't know.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.480
That felt...

30:19.480 --> 30:20.480
That felt raucous.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.480
That felt inappropriate.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.480
It felt...

30:25.480 --> 30:26.480
It wasn't happy, I think.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.480
Yeah, it wasn't happy.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.480
It wasn't happy.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.480
Get it?

30:29.480 --> 30:30.480
Oh.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.480
They're moving grossly.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.480
Wait.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.480
There's a fine line we're treading here.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.480
Wait, you were about to go to another beat.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.480
Where were you going to take it before I did a cheap shot?

30:39.480 --> 30:40.480
If I had done it, it would have been...

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
Because I was thinking we were crossing the threshold of a love story.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.480
And then we would have gotten an apartment together.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.480
I would have probably thrown an ashtray at her and accidentally killed her.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.480
I don't know.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.480
I was thinking to myself, it was like Richard Gere in a thriller.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
Your choice was better.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.480
It was better.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
It was way better.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.480
I said four minutes, you delivered.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.480
I don't...

31:01.480 --> 31:05.480
Jeff, don't go to me for the professional entertainment.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.480
I'm just saying, Kara, your path is clear tonight.

31:08.480 --> 31:12.480
That's not.

31:12.480 --> 31:17.480
Or any man or woman here looking for a job in Hollywood.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.480
I have a perfect girlfriend.

31:19.480 --> 31:24.480
We'll check in with her later about how our relationship is holding up to this tour.

31:24.480 --> 31:30.480
I wanted to talk to you, Jeff, about the...

31:30.480 --> 31:31.480
Okay.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.480
All right.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
We have...

31:33.480 --> 31:37.480
I don't know if we roll into this now, because we just had a guest up here.

31:37.480 --> 31:43.480
But you guys listen to the podcast and...

31:43.480 --> 31:52.480
So there's this guy, Adam Goldberg, who's in the show, kind of by sheer force of will.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.480
He's in the show.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.480
He described his origin story for the people that don't know him from the podcast.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.480
He's this kid who...

32:01.480 --> 32:03.480
I guess he was like an extra in community.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.480
That's what he said.

32:04.480 --> 32:09.480
His origins are, I pulled him out of the audience to read some of my brother's emails.

32:09.480 --> 32:13.480
And I went to go get another drink, and then he...

32:13.480 --> 32:19.480
Speaking of which, the law says we're not allowed to have our bottle of kettle up here.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.480
Can we...

32:20.480 --> 32:22.480
I don't know who our dedicated server is.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.480
Is it the guy I wiped out with the door?

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
Can it...

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
With ice?

32:26.480 --> 32:27.480
Two.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.480
Two?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.480
Two?

32:29.480 --> 32:33.480
Just the swish of that John Ritter door.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.480
That's the only answer.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.480
I mean, we can have a bucket of...

32:38.480 --> 32:40.480
It's so weird, the laws.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.480
It's different everywhere.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.480
Every city has fucked up laws about liquor.

32:43.480 --> 32:50.480
We were in Atlanta where they had just recently overcome the idea that you couldn't buy liquor on Sunday, period.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.480
I forget.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.480
It was in some city.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.480
They were, believe me, like, it's like these...

32:55.480 --> 32:58.480
Yeah, it's like, how does it...

32:58.480 --> 33:00.480
I don't even know what to say about it.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.480
It's insane.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.480
People are going to stop making laws, man.

33:03.480 --> 33:12.480
They have that program where we're turning Russian nukes into nuclear reactors for America.

33:12.480 --> 33:16.480
It's called something like megatons to megawatts or something like that.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.480
It's like a program which is really just in your fucking face.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.480
We won the Cold War.

33:20.480 --> 33:25.480
Give us all your dicks and we're going to turn them into toothbrush runners.

33:25.480 --> 33:35.480
We're just going to use your old world penises to now just make our seal-y, posture-pedic beds work.

33:35.480 --> 33:39.480
It's pretty brutal end to the Cold War.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.480
That's an example.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.480
Disarmament, sometimes we realize that we've stockpiled too much shit.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.480
We need to start reducing it a little bit.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.480
Adam Goldberg.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.480
What about...

33:52.480 --> 33:54.480
I'm just trying to get car off.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.480
What about laws?

33:57.480 --> 34:06.480
Jeff, why can't we dig into our vast surplus of ridiculous laws and boil them down into a couple of simple rules?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.480
Don't be a dick and stuff.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.480
Yeah, well, one guy tried it and they put him on a cross.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.480
Too soon.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.480
Oh, thank you. Perfect.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.480
Too soon.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.480
Much too late.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.480
But it was too late like the next day.

34:30.480 --> 34:36.480
Yeah, well, you know what? Hey, maybe it's time for a lazy Jesus that doesn't get crucified to come through.

34:36.480 --> 34:41.480
And instead of getting killed, maybe I could just live to 80 and tell people what to do.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.480
I'll volunteer.

34:43.480 --> 34:47.480
That's a form of crucifixion, like playing video games and masturbating.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.480
You do actually have kind of a Christ complex, don't you?

34:50.480 --> 34:53.480
Yeah, yeah, I feel burdened by these people's niche.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.480
Talk about armaments.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
We got a vodka stockpile.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.480
So the rules say we can't have a bottle up on the table, but we can't.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.480
So we can just have a choo-choo train of...

35:09.480 --> 35:14.480
So whatever that law was protecting, whatever good it was doing, like how is that?

35:14.480 --> 35:20.480
You know, ostensibly there's a 19-year-old girl in the audience deciding whether or not drinking is cool.

35:20.480 --> 35:26.480
God forbid she see that bottle, but this is going to make it so much harder for her to go down my path.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.480
Did you bring them, sir?

35:31.480 --> 35:32.480
What's your name?

35:32.480 --> 35:33.480
Matt.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.480
Matt, everybody.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.480
Did I hit you with the door?

35:36.480 --> 35:38.480
Sorry, Matt. Are you okay?

35:38.480 --> 35:40.480
Can you come up and tell everyone you're okay?

35:40.480 --> 35:44.480
To ask you to do that?

35:47.480 --> 35:48.480
I'm fine.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.480
I'm actually doing pretty well today.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.480
Okay.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.480
You didn't hit me that hard.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
Okay.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.480
Were you standing in front of the door because you were going to open it for me?

35:55.480 --> 35:58.480
I was. I was about to serve one of my tables.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.480
That would have been the first cool...

36:01.480 --> 36:06.480
No one ever opened a door for me, and I just banged into him.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.480
He was going to go like this, like I'm Batman or something, and he's Alfred.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.480
He was going to go like, here you are, and I fucked him up.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.480
What'd you say?

36:16.480 --> 36:17.480
Restart.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.480
Restart?

36:18.480 --> 36:20.480
Oh, well, I don't know.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.480
Somebody said restart, let him open the door for you.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.480
I think the ratio of time spent to entertainment received...

36:25.480 --> 36:26.480
I don't know.

36:26.480 --> 36:30.480
It's hard to make a judgment call there, but then again you go, why are you bringing him up on stage?

36:30.480 --> 36:34.480
How do you explain the first 40 minutes of your show?

36:34.480 --> 36:38.480
Thank you very much.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.480
Everyone's a critic.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.480
Because I mean...

36:41.480 --> 36:44.480
Why don't you go watch Good Will Hunting again?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.480
Inception.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.480
Inception, yes.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.480
You didn't buy a ticket to this ride.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.480
How long have you worked here? Matt, you said, right?

36:55.480 --> 36:56.480
Yeah.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.480
How long have you worked here?

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
About six months or so.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
It's pretty new then.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.480
Yeah?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.480
Sure.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.480
You enjoy it?

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
I love it.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.480
What's the best thing about working here?

37:05.480 --> 37:07.480
Just the kinds of people I meet, I think.

37:07.480 --> 37:11.480
And all the attention I get for no reason like right now.

37:11.480 --> 37:19.480
So how many times in that six months that you've worked here have you done a freestyle rap with somebody up on stage?

37:19.480 --> 37:29.480
Yo, yo, yo, yo, is it Matt?

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
Yeah.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.480
Matt, I'm the mic. I'm talking Matt. He's the guy I like.

37:34.480 --> 37:37.480
Banged into his shoulder when I came through the door.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.480
I fucked your mamas because they all are whores.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.480
I'm sorry.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.480
I didn't mean it.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.480
I fucked your mama.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.480
I tried to clean it up.

37:45.480 --> 37:46.480
After a word.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.480
I fucked your mama.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.480
That's the word.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.480
Matt.

37:50.480 --> 37:57.480
And Matt's gonna rap.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.480
I'm sorry, I'm pretty white.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.480
What's your name again?

38:00.480 --> 38:01.480
Dan.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.480
I'm Dan.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.480
Dan.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.480
Nice to meet you, Dan.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.480
Nice to meet you.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.480
You hit me.

38:06.480 --> 38:10.480
Yo, Dan, you hit me with the door, man.

38:10.480 --> 38:20.480
You're gonna hit my nose, but that's alright because this job is really great.

38:20.480 --> 38:24.480
I'd like to thank you for keeping me up here even though I'm not getting paid for this shit.

38:24.480 --> 38:29.480
I'm not really rhyming, I'm just kind of complaining and you can hear me.

38:29.480 --> 38:34.480
Also, a tip for the vodka would be pretty cool.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.480
Alright, alright, alright.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.480
Okay.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.480
MC Matt!

38:37.480 --> 38:38.480
Thank you, sir.

38:38.480 --> 39:01.480
That's how you use stage time.

39:01.480 --> 39:04.240
You and me are not gonna make money on this tour.

39:04.240 --> 39:07.480
That guy has made $15 more on this trip than I'm going to.

39:07.480 --> 39:14.480
My credit card was shut off today from expenditures on this trip.

39:14.480 --> 39:18.480
Our trail looks like a thief's.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.480
No one hangs out in Austin in Atlanta, like what are you doing?

39:21.480 --> 39:24.480
Charlotte to Brooklyn in one night?

39:24.480 --> 39:25.480
I don't think so.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.480
You stole a TV.

39:27.480 --> 39:31.480
But he did five minutes, turned it into 20, 40 bucks.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.480
I gave him 10, what'd you give him?

39:33.480 --> 39:36.480
I gave him 20.

39:36.480 --> 39:41.480
Yeah, but you're going to drink more of that vodka.

39:41.480 --> 39:48.480
Oh yeah, I will cause damage to this place financially.

39:48.480 --> 39:53.480
The advantage will be mine.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
No, that's not true.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.480
I'm going to keep it straight and narrow tonight.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.480
Now, I want to say something.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.480
There's a girl who came to the show tonight.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
She gave me a gift before the show.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.480
I wear tie clips a lot.

40:04.480 --> 40:09.480
I lost a tie clip once that I had engraved that said Federal Bikini Inspector on it.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
And then I lost it.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.480
And I hope whoever has it enjoys that Federal Bikini Inspector tie clip.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.480
But this girl, Samantha, made me this one.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.480
And it occurred to us.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.480
Thank you, Samantha.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.480
And it occurs to us.

40:22.480 --> 40:27.480
There's been times when we've been on the road and somebody will bring us a bottle of Kettle One backstage.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.480
But I've been looking around town.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.480
The front of my shoe is kind of the leather is kind of coming off.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.480
I'm trying to find some shoo goo, but you can't find it anywhere.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.480
So where are we going? Providence, Rhode Island?

40:38.480 --> 40:40.480
This is the segment of the show where we ask for shit.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
Yeah, we'll be in Rhode Island.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.480
I'll pay for it.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.480
But we just don't have time to stop and do anything.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.480
So I'm saying Providence, little tube of shoo goo.

40:47.480 --> 40:50.480
I could use some Prilosec.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.480
I'm 40 years old.

40:51.480 --> 40:52.480
What is that?

40:52.480 --> 40:53.480
I forgot to leave town with it.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.480
It's heartburn medication.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.480
And again, we will pay you for it.

40:58.480 --> 41:02.480
Aaron wrote down Sharpie pins, two toothbrushes, and safety pins.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.480
Okay, all right.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.480
So if you're coming to Rhode Island, are you listening?

41:06.480 --> 41:09.480
Come with a basket.

41:09.480 --> 41:13.480
This is how Egypt mythology started.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.480
People are just like, hey, I can use a tangerine.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.480
I'll make it rain on Wednesday.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.480
People are just coming.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.480
Well, that's not charismatic of us to ask for shit.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.480
I will pay for the shoo goo.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.480
Do you have toothbrushes?

41:28.480 --> 41:33.480
Are they used?

41:33.480 --> 41:34.480
Bring it out.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.480
This is a weird table full of gypsies that brought toothbrushes.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.480
No, that's really rude.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.480
Gypsies is an offensive phrase.

41:41.480 --> 41:44.480
It's like the end of Let's Make a Deal.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.480
I didn't mean gypsies as an ethnic phrase.

41:46.480 --> 41:50.480
I think that's become an offensive ethnic term.

41:50.480 --> 41:57.480
I just meant traveling vendors of fortune telling and werewolf curses.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.480
This show brought to you by the all-new Oral B Advantage.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.480
Holy shit.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.480
All right.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.480
Well, let's see if things are already working great.

42:04.480 --> 42:08.480
It's like, okay, Providence, we just need one toothbrush now.

42:08.480 --> 42:13.480
I would like to raise a barn in back if, maybe I'll just live here.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.480
Just build me a house.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.480
I have a toothbrush and Brighton.

42:17.480 --> 42:18.480
You have a toothbrush and Brighton?

42:18.480 --> 42:19.480
Yeah.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.480
Is that nearby?

42:20.480 --> 42:21.480
Yeah.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
Go get it.

42:22.480 --> 42:26.480
A lady just called out, I have a toothbrush and Brighton.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.480
Well, hopefully you all have toothbrushes at your home.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
Yeah.

42:30.480 --> 42:34.480
It's not a competition, ma'am.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.480
You really work for a toothbrush company?

42:36.480 --> 42:37.480
Yeah.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.480
Oh.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.480
So you have a factory of toothbrushes and Brighton.

42:42.480 --> 42:48.480
Were they being cutesy by putting it in Brighton?

42:48.480 --> 42:51.480
My question is, were they being cutesy?

42:51.480 --> 42:53.480
I wasn't being cutesy.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.480
You can't groan me.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.480
This woman right here works in a dental office.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.480
Let's get them up and have them fight.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.480
We didn't know until now.

43:01.480 --> 43:07.480
We didn't know that we could put you motherfuckers to work like this.

43:07.480 --> 43:08.480
I'm sorry.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.480
Well, we are humble people.

43:09.480 --> 43:13.480
We live in a world where bus boys shake us down for 50 bucks.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.480
That's the treatment we're used to.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
This much love we're not used to.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.480
I think it's a bad rap.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.480
We're really nice.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.480
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean Boston.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.480
Oh, nobody's ripping on Boston.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.480
Boston's ripping on everybody.

43:28.480 --> 43:32.480
Oh, that's an example of ripping on my...

43:32.480 --> 43:37.480
It is like, you know, it's like when you roll into the town,

43:37.480 --> 43:39.480
like there is like a little whispers of like,

43:39.480 --> 43:40.480
oh, shit, Boston.

43:40.480 --> 43:43.480
That town's legit.

43:43.480 --> 43:46.480
They're working class.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.480
They don't pronounce their R's.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.480
They're going to heckle you.

43:49.480 --> 43:52.480
I wouldn't say people here are rough for me.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.480
Some of them may be a little bit more aggressive,

43:54.480 --> 43:56.480
maybe like a little bit more like upfront,

43:56.480 --> 43:58.480
you know, like candid in your face.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.480
Is that apt?

44:00.480 --> 44:01.480
Yeah.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.480
Hey, take it easy.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.480
Take it easy.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.480
I think that's it.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.480
Yeah, we have friends from Boston in LA.

44:08.480 --> 44:16.480
They have a certain swagger that reminds us of shitty Matt Damon movies.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.480
Is Jen Kirkman from Boston?

44:18.480 --> 44:19.480
Yeah.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.480
I don't know.

44:20.480 --> 44:21.480
Jen Kirkman's a good friend of ours.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.480
Lowell.

44:22.480 --> 44:23.480
What?

44:23.480 --> 44:24.480
What?

44:24.480 --> 44:25.480
Lowell.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
Oh, Lowell.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.480
Yeah.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.480
Is this one of those towns in Massachusetts

44:30.480 --> 44:33.480
where the science is now entering Somerville?

44:33.480 --> 44:35.480
But it's really funny when like now entering Beverly,

44:35.480 --> 44:39.480
which sounds like a porn title.

44:39.480 --> 44:43.480
Jessica, Massachusetts.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
All right.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.480
So I got it off on a lot of tangents there

44:45.480 --> 44:47.480
because we were about to...

44:47.480 --> 44:49.480
We got this guy, Adam Goldberg.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
Wow.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.480
Remember?

44:52.480 --> 44:57.480
The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.

44:57.480 --> 45:02.480
Remember at 8.15 when I mentioned Adam Goldberg?

45:02.480 --> 45:05.480
He's like a regular in the LA shows.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.480
He's like this.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.480
It's like, you know how Indiana Jones had bellock?

45:09.480 --> 45:12.480
Like every hero has a shadow he casts.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.480
And you don't know whether to like him

45:14.480 --> 45:16.480
or he's like a brother demon.

45:16.480 --> 45:20.480
You know, like a lot of my fans are self-styled Dan Harmon's

45:20.480 --> 45:24.480
like talented writers who can't make eye contact.

45:24.480 --> 45:27.480
And like a lot of my conversations with my fans

45:27.480 --> 45:29.480
look like two guys staring at the floor

45:29.480 --> 45:32.480
and accidentally insulting each other back and forth.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.480
Like guys, there's a lot of...

45:35.480 --> 45:37.480
Hey, well no, it's not just you.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.480
I was thinking about you.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.480
But yeah, it's kind of...

45:42.480 --> 45:45.480
I'm an awkward person and I have an awkward flock

45:45.480 --> 45:48.480
So Adam is this little guy and he comes up on stage

45:48.480 --> 45:50.480
and the Harmontown like clearly we've proven that

45:50.480 --> 45:52.480
like people, like a lot of it is people coming up

45:52.480 --> 45:55.480
and like us getting to know who's out there and stuff.

45:55.480 --> 45:58.480
And now Adam has got this sort of swagger now

45:58.480 --> 46:01.480
that he just kind of storms the stage like a spool.

46:01.480 --> 46:03.480
He's become our hamburger.

46:03.480 --> 46:07.480
Like in the mythology, like he's like a guy.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.480
People in the live LA audiences don't like him

46:10.480 --> 46:12.480
as much as the podcast listeners

46:12.480 --> 46:14.480
because people in the live LA audiences

46:14.480 --> 46:16.480
are sitting next to the stage and they're like,

46:16.480 --> 46:18.480
I could get up there too but I don't, you're a dick.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.480
But people listening are going,

46:20.480 --> 46:22.480
I can't ever get up there so he's my hero.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.480
He's like one of those bomb diffusing robots

46:24.480 --> 46:27.480
like just putting himself into the hurt locker every time.

46:27.480 --> 46:30.480
And then we're mean to him

46:30.480 --> 46:32.480
and then he comes back for more and we like him

46:32.480 --> 46:34.480
and it's like are we being Howard Stern

46:34.480 --> 46:36.480
or is that good or bad?

46:36.480 --> 46:38.480
Is this guy a genius or an idiot?

46:38.480 --> 46:40.480
Is he a hero or a villain?

46:40.480 --> 46:42.480
It seems to be kind of like a weird...

46:42.480 --> 46:44.480
among our audience.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.480
Some people really like support and love him.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.480
Some people don't know.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.480
Some people wish he wouldn't do that so much.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.480
We don't really know where it stands.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.480
And we're fascinated with him and that's the important thing.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.480
But more important than that.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.480
Tonight, here in Somerville,

46:58.480 --> 47:00.480
it turns out, no, no,

47:00.480 --> 47:02.480
Adam's not with us for the simple reason

47:02.480 --> 47:04.480
that we have a special unit

47:04.480 --> 47:06.480
of the police check the bottom of the bus every night

47:06.480 --> 47:08.480
with what I call

47:08.480 --> 47:10.480
Cape Fear Mirrors.

47:10.480 --> 47:12.480
Adam is not here.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.480
But Adam Goldberg's

47:14.480 --> 47:16.480
two brothers are here.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.480
Adam Goldberg's two brothers are here.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.480
Adam Goldberg's two brothers are here.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.480
Noah and

47:22.480 --> 47:24.480
and Harry?

47:24.480 --> 47:26.480
Are you guys willing to come up?

47:26.480 --> 47:28.480
Noah and Harry?

47:28.480 --> 47:30.480
Are you here?

47:30.480 --> 47:32.480
All right.

47:32.480 --> 47:34.480
So now we're going to get to the bottom of some shit, I think.

47:34.480 --> 47:36.480
Hello.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.480
Holy crap, wait.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.480
Here we go.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.480
There you go.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.480
Shake your hand.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.480
Noah.

47:46.480 --> 47:48.480
He said, I don't know if I should shake your hand.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.480
I've listened to you.

47:50.480 --> 47:52.480
It's always been a little bit nicer.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.480
Jeff's always been the one to really just

47:54.480 --> 47:56.480
shit pretty hard.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.480
Really? Well, Jeff will say stuff like

47:58.480 --> 48:00.480
shut the fuck up, Adam. Get off stage.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.480
Right.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.480
And Dan will say, please shut the fuck up.

48:04.480 --> 48:06.480
Right. Or I'll say

48:06.480 --> 48:08.480
like, well, we're all Adam Goldberg a little bit.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.480
Like, you know, like, at what point do I,

48:10.480 --> 48:12.480
you know, where does the bully become the victim?

48:12.480 --> 48:14.480
My question, like,

48:14.480 --> 48:16.480
we love Adam, but we kind of

48:16.480 --> 48:18.480
hate him a little bit, too.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.480
So are we all right? Are you listening, Adam?

48:20.480 --> 48:22.480
Yeah.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.480
All the questions that you've asked, we've asked ourselves.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.480
I thought we'd get answers, but it's a special kind

48:28.480 --> 48:30.480
of answer that there's just more questions.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.480
That's fine, too. It's like black hole

48:32.480 --> 48:34.480
research.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.480
It's to the point now, you guys, that

48:36.480 --> 48:38.480
after the show, he follows me to my car,

48:38.480 --> 48:40.480
and if we go to a bar after the show, then he fall,

48:40.480 --> 48:42.480
even if I don't say the bar I'm going to, sometimes

48:42.480 --> 48:44.480
he's just there, and he'll follow me to my car then.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.480
Like, I know he's harmless.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.480
He told, there's no concern there, but

48:48.480 --> 48:50.480
he's a very forward guy.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.480
Right? You'd have to. Absolutely.

48:52.480 --> 48:54.480
You'd have to allow that. He's diabolical.

48:54.480 --> 48:56.480
I mean, he's a genius. Like, he's always

48:56.480 --> 48:58.480
calculating. A genius. Yeah, possibly

48:58.480 --> 49:00.480
evil. So when you guys were growing up,

49:00.480 --> 49:02.480
are you both older brothers? Yeah, we're

49:02.480 --> 49:04.480
three years older. So did you tie him to trees

49:04.480 --> 49:06.480
and like... Oh, we were really bad

49:06.480 --> 49:08.480
to him. Yeah.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.480
My dad says that the worst day of

49:10.480 --> 49:12.480
his life was when he realized that the kid

49:12.480 --> 49:14.480
tormenting him was actually two kids tormenting

49:14.480 --> 49:16.480
him.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.480
Because we're twins, so we work as a team.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.480
Oh, you guys are twins. Oh. So we work

49:20.480 --> 49:22.480
as a team, and, you know, it's easy to trick

49:22.480 --> 49:24.480
your three-year-old brother, three years younger,

49:24.480 --> 49:26.480
into doing whatever you want.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.480
Yeah, and then when you get tired of

49:28.480 --> 49:30.480
fucking with him and you just tag out and the other guy comes in.

49:30.480 --> 49:32.480
Yeah, we used to

49:32.480 --> 49:34.480
pull him out of his crib to play.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.480
Like, this was harmless. I would

49:36.480 --> 49:38.480
climb up and try to toss

49:38.480 --> 49:40.480
him down and...

49:40.480 --> 49:42.480
And, like, he couldn't catch

49:42.480 --> 49:44.480
very well.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.480
Adam, I take it all back, man.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.480
Yeah, we're starting...

49:48.480 --> 49:50.480
Holy shit.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.480
So maybe there's your origin story.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.480
Yes. And, you know, we would

49:54.480 --> 49:56.480
walk into, like, my parents' room

49:56.480 --> 49:58.480
and you go, Dad, the baby's crying.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.480
Don't know what's going on.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.480
This is interesting.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.480
Somebody audibly said,

50:04.480 --> 50:06.480
Jesus.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.480
That's good. This is human, human stuff.

50:08.480 --> 50:10.480
I mean, we did it out of love, but, like...

50:10.480 --> 50:12.480
So, yeah.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.480
Sounds loving. Four-year-olds can't catch.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.480
Like...

50:16.480 --> 50:18.480
It's interesting when you remove the glasses from

50:18.480 --> 50:20.480
Adam Goldberg, age him up a little

50:20.480 --> 50:22.480
and move him to Boston.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.480
It's a Jimmy Kimmel thing that starts to happen.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.480
You guys look like...

50:26.480 --> 50:28.480
Yeah, yeah. But you're twins

50:28.480 --> 50:30.480
and, you know, are you

50:30.480 --> 50:32.480
identical or are you genetically identical?

50:32.480 --> 50:34.480
Oh, okay. All right.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.480
So, I guess...

50:36.480 --> 50:38.480
I guess

50:38.480 --> 50:40.480
when you go home tonight,

50:40.480 --> 50:42.480
you can go, Dan Harmon called me fat,

50:42.480 --> 50:44.480
I guess.

50:44.480 --> 50:46.480
And

50:46.480 --> 50:48.480
used DNA to prove it.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.480
But I

50:50.480 --> 50:52.480
didn't mean it to happen that way.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.480
And I'm not...

50:54.480 --> 50:56.480
I'm fatter than you. I didn't mean it.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.480
I wasn't... I mean...

50:58.480 --> 51:00.480
I stumbled into it.

51:02.480 --> 51:04.480
How many pictures on Google images

51:04.480 --> 51:06.480
come up at you, man? Oh, man, dude.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.480
Yeah.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.480
Yeah. Now, believe me.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.480
Like, before you leak any celebrities'

51:12.480 --> 51:14.480
voice mails, make sure you've taken

51:14.480 --> 51:16.480
a lot of thin pictures.

51:16.480 --> 51:18.480
Yeah. And make sure your teeth

51:18.480 --> 51:20.480
aren't yellow.

51:20.480 --> 51:22.480
That humbled me greatly, that phase.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.480
Like, Dan Harmon's at it again.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.480
The TMZ Photoshopping M&M's

51:28.480 --> 51:30.480
on my chin.

51:30.480 --> 51:32.480
Believe me, I did not mean it.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.480
Wait, which one are you? Noah or Harry?

51:34.480 --> 51:36.480
I'm Harry. Harry, Noah. Okay.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.480
Um, all right. Well, what do we...

51:38.480 --> 51:40.480
What can we do special with him, Jeff?

51:40.480 --> 51:42.480
Like, in preparation of going back home to Adam?

51:42.480 --> 51:44.480
Like, we met your brothers.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.480
He's your problem now.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.480
Oh, yeah.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.480
So, you guys both live here still.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.480
Right. And so, when did he

51:52.480 --> 51:54.480
move away to LA?

51:54.480 --> 51:56.480
About a year and a half or so ago.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.480
How was that partying? Was it bittersweet

51:58.480 --> 52:00.480
or did you, like, get the fuck out of here?

52:00.480 --> 52:02.480
The after-party was way better.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.480
Well, Adam

52:06.480 --> 52:08.480
got on the bus and a guy

52:08.480 --> 52:10.480
in a cop-up bit blew a whistle.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.480
We've always had the plan that somehow

52:16.480 --> 52:18.480
Adam was going to be the one to make all the money

52:18.480 --> 52:20.480
and be able to take care of us.

52:20.480 --> 52:22.480
That hasn't happened.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.480
No, it hasn't happened yet.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.480
He's working on it. How old is Adam?

52:26.480 --> 52:28.480
Like, evil genius.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.480
Like, the key part is genius.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.480
For sure. And, yeah, I think

52:32.480 --> 52:34.480
that's what buys it all back.

52:34.480 --> 52:36.480
Sometimes, yeah, he goes into these

52:36.480 --> 52:38.480
rants that are, like,

52:38.480 --> 52:40.480
they're kind of ill-timed

52:40.480 --> 52:42.480
and his sense of, like, kind of verbal rhythm

52:42.480 --> 52:44.480
kind of, like, doesn't hit the eardrums

52:44.480 --> 52:46.480
in the right pattern.

52:46.480 --> 52:48.480
He's, like, what? He's a kid. He's, like, 20-something.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.480
20-something.

52:50.480 --> 52:52.480
But, you know, when you actually

52:52.480 --> 52:54.480
listen to what he's saying, he's, like,

52:54.480 --> 52:56.480
you know, he's really smart.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.480
A lot of people don't know what to make of him.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.480
Yeah.

53:00.480 --> 53:02.480
But the thing is that once you get

53:02.480 --> 53:04.480
his character and his personality,

53:04.480 --> 53:06.480
a lot of the stuff

53:06.480 --> 53:08.480
he says is pretty genius.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.480
I think he works well with an editor, like...

53:12.480 --> 53:14.480
It's the comedy rule of

53:14.480 --> 53:16.480
three's, right? One out of three things he says is funny.

53:16.480 --> 53:18.480
Like...

53:18.480 --> 53:20.480
Yeah, yeah.

53:20.480 --> 53:22.480
Like, obviously, you're a writer. You know this.

53:22.480 --> 53:24.480
Like, you don't do it all yourself. You need a team around you.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.480
Exactly. Like, if we could have cut out me

53:26.480 --> 53:28.480
accidentally calling you fat, like, I would...

53:28.480 --> 53:30.480
I would be, like, a great fucking

53:30.480 --> 53:32.480
host.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.480
Yeah, I can go...

53:34.480 --> 53:36.480
I will go back and edit that out of the podcast.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.480
And then I'll seem like a very charming guy.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.480
Maybe you guys want to, like,

53:40.480 --> 53:42.480
take this opportunity, because I would...

53:42.480 --> 53:44.480
I presume that Adam will be listening to these

53:44.480 --> 53:46.480
podcasts as they're coming out.

53:46.480 --> 53:48.480
I mean, anybody would, because it's certainly,

53:48.480 --> 53:50.480
like, even just out of simple...

53:50.480 --> 53:52.480
Oh, he doesn't have my phone number. It's cool.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.480
He doesn't have your phone number.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.480
No, I'm kidding.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.480
Maybe, like, you guys could send a little, like,

53:58.480 --> 54:00.480
a little video...

54:00.480 --> 54:02.480
I mean, sorry, an audio letter to him, you know,

54:02.480 --> 54:04.480
like a little wistful, you know,

54:04.480 --> 54:06.480
brotherly contact, you know, over our thing.

54:06.480 --> 54:08.480
Give him a little soundtrack.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.480
That's all you know.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.480
Your open letter to Adam.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.480
Whatever you want to say to him.

54:14.480 --> 54:16.480
Adam, mom and dad just really

54:16.480 --> 54:18.480
want you to get a job.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.480
We know you're trying.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.480
We know you're trying, but

54:22.480 --> 54:24.480
try harder.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.480
Times are tough for everyone.

54:26.480 --> 54:28.480
When they saw you

54:28.480 --> 54:30.480
in the background as a community,

54:30.480 --> 54:32.480
and you looked within 20 years at Chevy Chase,

54:32.480 --> 54:34.480
that is not a good look.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.480
So keep going.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.480
We love you. We support you.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.480
But...

54:40.480 --> 54:42.480
Did the Friars Club sponsor this letter?

54:42.480 --> 54:44.480
All right.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.480
The thing you can do for us

54:46.480 --> 54:48.480
is not let him respond to this.

54:48.480 --> 54:50.480
Because it's going to be way worse for us.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.480
Well, yeah, but, yeah.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.480
So you guys are scared of his, like,

54:54.480 --> 54:56.480
his brain and his mouth, right?

54:56.480 --> 54:58.480
Like, he'll level that weird...

54:58.480 --> 55:00.480
There's still two of us.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.480
Yeah, Lex Luthor death ray.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.480
Yeah, so Adam, okay,

55:04.480 --> 55:06.480
physically they can still kick your ass,

55:06.480 --> 55:08.480
but you got away.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.480
They would like you to make some money.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.480
Can I ask a question here?

55:12.480 --> 55:14.480
For the audience, like,

55:14.480 --> 55:16.480
I know the L.A. audience

55:16.480 --> 55:18.480
is kind of like...

55:18.480 --> 55:20.480
Skeptical. Skeptical.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.480
But, like, of the people listening,

55:22.480 --> 55:24.480
like, how does it play out for

55:24.480 --> 55:26.480
just listening here? Just...

55:26.480 --> 55:28.480
Were you asking these people?

55:28.480 --> 55:30.480
I thought he was a writer in community.

55:30.480 --> 55:32.480
I thought he was a writer in community.

55:32.480 --> 55:34.480
This woman...

55:34.480 --> 55:36.480
This young lady said

55:36.480 --> 55:38.480
I thought he was a writer in community.

55:38.480 --> 55:40.480
He probably texted you and told you that.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.480
There's a diabolical quality to him.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.480
He ends up with everybody's phone number.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.480
One time we were at the drawing room.

55:46.480 --> 55:48.480
Mostly women, though.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.480
Yeah, yeah. After a bar,

55:50.480 --> 55:52.480
after we go to this one bar after our show,

55:52.480 --> 55:54.480
and I was there and

55:54.480 --> 55:56.480
he was working on some girl and

55:56.480 --> 55:58.480
the girl had a friend and he was drunk.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.480
And he's like,

56:00.480 --> 56:02.480
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, give me your phone number.

56:02.480 --> 56:04.480
I'm like, no.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.480
Give me your phone number. Adam.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.480
Fuckin' no way. No.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.480
But he gets all the women's digits

56:10.480 --> 56:12.480
in, like, crazy, weird Jedi ways.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.480
He...

56:14.480 --> 56:16.480
It was present the moment when he walked up to Aaron

56:16.480 --> 56:18.480
and he said, so, Aaron,

56:18.480 --> 56:20.480
AT&T fucked up my phone

56:20.480 --> 56:22.480
and I finally got it back and I lost your number.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.480
I needed your number again.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.480
And Aaron kind of went,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.480
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.480
I gave it to him and he walked away and Aaron had this blank expression.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.480
I never gave him my number.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.480
It's no joke, man. It's no joke.

56:34.480 --> 56:36.480
He's a Jedi.

56:36.480 --> 56:38.480
These are not the droids you want.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.480
I didn't put anything in your drink.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.480
Do you ever read the book by Bud Shillman,

56:42.480 --> 56:44.480
What Makes Sammy Run, about this character, Sammy Glick?

56:44.480 --> 56:46.480
I haven't read it.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.480
Read that book. It's about a guy

56:48.480 --> 56:50.480
that... he's just this little like

56:50.480 --> 56:52.480
newspaper man, a guy that runs the papers

56:52.480 --> 56:54.480
and stuff like that and he ends up running a studio

56:54.480 --> 57:02.120
in Hollywood, simply out of will, and the idea that there's no such thing as a human

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
obstacle.

57:03.120 --> 57:07.400
People are things you can just move around like chess pieces, and it's not willfully

57:07.400 --> 57:11.960
mean, it's just the idea that the goal is something that's more important than the steps

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
along the way.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.760
And is it genetics that makes your brain like that, or is it your older brother's playing

57:16.760 --> 57:17.760
head injuries?

57:17.760 --> 57:21.960
Catch the baby out of the cradle.

57:21.960 --> 57:24.200
Probably a combination of that and head injuries.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.200
Definitely.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.200
All right, Noah and Harry, let's hear it for the Goldberg brothers.

57:28.200 --> 57:31.960
Goldberg brothers.

57:31.960 --> 57:32.960
Thank you guys.

57:32.960 --> 57:33.960
Thank you, Noah.

57:33.960 --> 57:34.960
Thank you, Harry.

57:34.960 --> 57:38.240
We've never had a disaster, Jeff.

57:38.240 --> 57:43.640
We just bring random people up on stage, and you're trained for the stand-up mythology

57:43.640 --> 57:45.680
and TV and stuff.

57:45.680 --> 57:49.800
When somebody starts popping off in the audience, everyone gets as uncomfortable as when a baby

57:49.800 --> 57:51.040
is crying on an airplane.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.520
It's like, there's a crisis.

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
There's something happening.

57:53.520 --> 57:54.520
There's going to go bad.

57:54.520 --> 57:58.680
Like, what's Rob Schneider going to do?

57:58.680 --> 58:02.680
But at our show, I know we're spoiled because all these audiences are people who listen to

58:02.680 --> 58:03.680
the podcast.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.560
They come out, they drive a long way, and they pay money, but then they're ready to have

58:05.560 --> 58:06.560
a good time.

58:06.560 --> 58:09.560
But I just love the human experiment.

58:09.560 --> 58:13.320
You can just drag people up, and they're like, I don't know, and then they start rapping

58:13.320 --> 58:15.200
and they fucking bury the show.

58:15.200 --> 58:19.480
But when Noah came up, he gave me a pretty stern look, and he goes, I don't even know

58:19.480 --> 58:20.720
if I should shake your hand.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.200
I thought it was because he was protective of Adam.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.480
Yeah, and then he just completely threw Adam under the bus.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
Yeah.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
I mean, he really meant it.

58:27.480 --> 58:29.120
I don't know if I should shake your hand.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.120
I don't know.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.520
Yeah, that's his...

58:31.520 --> 58:32.720
Aaron texted me.

58:32.720 --> 58:33.720
What?

58:33.720 --> 58:34.720
Aaron just texted me.

58:34.720 --> 58:35.720
Is he here?

58:35.720 --> 58:36.720
Well, come on, Aaron.

58:36.720 --> 58:37.720
Aaron will go to the stage.

58:37.720 --> 58:38.720
Erin McGathy!

58:38.720 --> 58:39.720
Erin McGathy!

58:39.720 --> 58:40.820
Erin McGathy!

58:40.820 --> 58:41.820
This could go bad.

58:41.820 --> 58:44.160
I mean, I never know what this one.

58:44.160 --> 58:48.400
Aaron, well, all I was going to say is that Adam just texted me.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.720
We're my brother's drips.

58:49.720 --> 58:50.720
Wow.

58:50.720 --> 58:51.720
Yeah.

58:51.720 --> 58:52.880
See you guys.

58:52.880 --> 59:01.160
Here in McGathey, everybody, sniped from a distance by the Goldberg Sniper Rifle.

59:01.160 --> 59:05.960
The blood does kind of run cold, like Beetlejuice, we've mentioned his name so many times, and

59:05.960 --> 59:07.640
he just starts texting people.

59:07.640 --> 59:11.560
That's fucking cool, yeah, he's like Sherlock Holmes on that new remake and the BBC.

59:11.560 --> 59:12.560
I was like, what?

59:12.560 --> 59:14.720
There's text coming up.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.520
He knows we're talking about him.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
Having fun, Mr. Harmon?

59:18.520 --> 59:19.520
Yeah.

59:19.520 --> 59:23.680
Oh, you amused me, so.

59:23.680 --> 59:29.960
He's like Q, he's not my bellock, he's my Q from new Star Trek, I'm going to get laid

59:29.960 --> 59:30.960
in Boston.

59:30.960 --> 59:39.440
Star Trek next generation reference, Jeff, just running through a couple more things.

59:39.440 --> 59:44.360
We're going to be in Rhode Island tomorrow night and we really, is there any incentive

59:44.360 --> 59:48.040
we can give people because it's not that long a drive and apparently we're undersold

59:48.040 --> 59:49.040
there.

59:49.040 --> 59:50.040
We've been here.

59:50.040 --> 59:51.040
We've been...

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
Drugs?

59:52.040 --> 59:53.040
I'm finding out.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
I'll get the location.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.040
Hang on.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.040
Is it 45 minutes?

59:56.040 --> 59:57.040
Yeah, no big deal.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.040
It's like a drive to Grandma's house.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.040
Yeah, Providence, East Providence.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.040
A lot of drugs.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.040
I have a vaporizer in the tour bus.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040
They're saying there's lots of drugs there.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040
Oh.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040
I think, is that what you're saying?

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040
Oh no, no, we're going to Rhode Island.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
No, I think you were speaking the same way.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:18.040
I'm saying, is there anything we can incentivize people to like form a little kind of an incentive?

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.040
People to like form a little caravan and come to, let's just go fill the seats at the Rhode

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040
Island show.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040
Let them be.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040
Shoe goo.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040
Shoe goo.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040
Well, that's all, that's all incentive for us.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.040
We're going to be at the comedy connection in, on Warren Avenue, East Providence, Rhode

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040
Island tomorrow night.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040
Right.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040
All right.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:43.320
Well, Aaron says you'll get a special button if you use the past phrase, I came here from

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320
Johnny Deese.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.320
Also, Spencer will give the first 40 people in the door a 20 minute deep tissue massage.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.320
Speaking of which, let's bring Spencer up on stage.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.320
Spencer, get up here.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.320
Oh shit, Spencer.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320
Yep.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.320
He's wearing his Apple store sweatshirt.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.320
Spencer was sharing a table tonight.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320
Kind of.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
I got my little dead soldiers.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320
Do you want me to slide over?

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320
All right.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320
You're fine.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320
What up?

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.040
Again, for those of you who already know Spencer, he's our Dungeon Master.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:28.120
For those of you who don't, he's going to master a dungeon later on and God bless him,

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:34.320
but we didn't know this guy really from Adam, and not Adam Goldberg, from the old Adam when

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.320
we embarked on our tour.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.320
But I find Spencer, you've been an absolute gem of a tour companion to have on the bus.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320
Jeff, really quick.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320
I want to roll out the chicken noodle.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320
Chicken noodle.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.320
Spencer, did you help write the chicken noodle song?

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320
No, I came in during the end.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.320
I might be able to help you guys out though.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.320
Okay, so Dan, I have some stupid tour bus songs about like I hold like things up to my

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.320
dick and like there's Pringles Dick.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.320
That was take a sip of my dick.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.320
Some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out why.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320
You're holding the Pringles Dick.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320
I don't really have a Pringles Dick.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.320
I just keep my dick inside.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.320
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.320
I don't really, some people call me Pringles Dick, but I never really found out.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320
No, I never found out, never really found out why.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.320
That's a song you can sing while you hold a Pringles can on your dick.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.320
All right, Summerville?

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.320
So Dan Harmon was laying a supine on the fork, the fork, the folksle of the tour bus.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.320
I don't know, the four room and the thing and there's a big couch and he's reclined back

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.320
there and we're all, you know, this is, we were leaving Brooklyn last night on a big

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.320
high from the Brooklyn show, which was immensely good last night and we're driving back.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320
Not as good as this.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320
No, no, no, this is fucking, this is way better.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.320
Stage drive.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320
Stage drive.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.320
I mean, later in a couple minutes.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.320
Can we get the biggest guys up front?

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.320
So Dan was laying there and I started handing Dan various objects because Dan expressed

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.320
a desire to sing, like, try his own hand that these improvised, my dick is shaped like

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320
something else.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320
Yeah, I want to have fun with the dick songs.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.320
So we tried, we tried the little honey bear thing or we tried a honey bear dick and that

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320
didn't go so well.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320
Honey bear dick, honey bear dick.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.320
I got a honey, fuck it.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.320
Aspirin dick was no good.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.320
My Aspirin dick, I can't do it.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.320
Yeah, I knew it kind of fell.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.320
It kept failing, kept failing.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:36.320
So we found a kind of progressive chicken noodle soup.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.320
He just kept swapping objects under my dick and like making me get out of my head space.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.320
He was like, you were like a great Iron Eagles, Lou Gossett Jr. like mentor.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.320
Just stop thinking about it, stop thinking about it.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.320
And then finally the last object was a can of chicken noodle soup, a big fat, progressive

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.320
can of chicken noodle soup.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.320
And I went, here I am.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.320
And then we wrote the song for him.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320
We were like, no, I don't know.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320
We could tell, like I got like a Tin Pan Alley songwriter.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320
So we do, there's a gem there.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320
There's a kernel.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320
Here I am.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320
I ain't got a dick.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.320
I got a chicken noodle can.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320
All my life.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320
I've been put in my hands.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320
I'm a chicken noodle wife.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320
Chicken noodle can come down from the mountains.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.320
Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.320
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:31.320
You need the devil's soup until your troubles go away.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.320
It's a spiritual.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.320
I mean, for the lack of a writer, it's a Negro spiritual about God cursing you with a strange

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.320
dick and forcing you to work your whole life and struggle.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.320
It's about being jibbeded by God.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.320
But the payoff is the curse of this chicken noodle can.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.320
You can feed the devil's soup and make your troubles go away.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320
It's like a hard working fucking life.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.320
We should, if anyone not listening wants to remix that, put some like some acts, like

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.320
some pics on there.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.320
But just give it one clean audio track.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.320
Let's do it one more time.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.320
Here I am.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320
I ain't got a dick.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320
I got a chicken noodle can.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.320
Don't start clapping until chicken noodle.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320
I'll give you the cue for the clapping.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320
So it's going to start out without the clapping.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320
I think it works better.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.320
And then you, sir, wear a diaper and fly across with a banner.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320
No, no, no.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320
Let's not get too...

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320
76 trombones.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320
Right.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320
We need Karen on costume design.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.320
Jesus, I'm falling everywhere.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320
All right.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320
Okay, here we go.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320
One, two, one, two, three.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320
Here I am.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320
All right.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.320
Fuck.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.320
Here I am.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.320
Oh, start over.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
That was terrible.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320
Here... sorry.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.320
It's on the end.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320
Here... here I am.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.320
Stop it.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:59.320
One, two, one, two, three, four.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.320
Here I am.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320
I ain't got a dick.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.320
I got a chicken noodle can.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320
Oh, my life.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.320
I've been putting my hands on my chicken noodle wife.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.320
Chicken noodle got down from the mountains.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.320
Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.320
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.320
See the devil scoop and say your troubles go away.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.320
Got a devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.320
Yeah.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.320
We can make some more verses to that too, I think, as we go.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.320
Yeah, I think the next verse has to be about the chicken noodle wife.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.320
I'm concerned about her.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.320
Yeah, she's at home like...

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.320
Yeah, she's like, keep getting fucked by a chicken noodle can.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.320
That doesn't make me a chicken noodle wife.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320
I'm a person.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.320
She's a big job for him.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.320
Putting this can of chicken noodle wife poor baby.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320
It's a very sexist song.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.320
And also all my life, you're like, really?

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320
We met when you were 20.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.320
But in his defense, he's probably like building a lot of railroad

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320
and not for a lot of pay.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.320
If shit rolls downhill a little bit to the woman he loves,

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.320
like maybe there could be some support there.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320
Maybe she gets her own song.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320
Maybe she can be like a Dolly Parton figure

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.320
and go like, oh, little girl, when you wait for your man to come home,

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.320
don't you want home?

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320
No, baby, no, no, no.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Ain't enough chicken noodle in the can for me.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.320
Ain't that right?

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.320
You know, kind of rise up, sisters.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.320
Put them in his place.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.320
Yeah, if people feel like they have a verse to add to that,

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.320
please tumble that shit.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.320
All right, can we do our regular segment?

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320
I'm really convinced this is going to pay off.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:49.320
It's called Spencer's Complaints about Looney Tunes cartoons.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.320
Spencer comes down.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.320
You think he'd have a softness in his heart for the Looney Tunes characters,

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.320
but he really comes down like a ton of lead.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320
The more you find out about this guy, the more you love him.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.320
We took him to Charlotte.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.320
He loved the sleet.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.320
Then we took him to Times Square.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320
He hated Times Square.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.320
And you go like, yeah, good.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320
He's a barometer.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320
He's like Henry David Thoreau.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.320
And he's not fallen for any of those Tasmanian devil bullshit.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.320
Sorry, somebody probably have a tattoo of him somewhere.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.320
All right, let's play a theme song.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.320
Spencer's Complaints about Looney Tunes.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320
He hates it.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.320
He hates Looney Tunes, period.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:43.320
He always got a dance.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.320
You always got a dance.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320
No, dancing.

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.320
I was just commenting on your dancing.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.320
All right, so do you want to team up with the question, Dan?

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.320
No, no, no.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320
Why are they Coyote and the Roadrunner?

01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.320
Well, I like that.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320
That's like the one Looney Tunes I enjoy.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.320
Well, then don't talk about that.

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.320
Wait, do you guys like her?

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.320
I don't get it.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.320
Honestly confused, not joking.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320
Anyway, why like Coyote?

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.320
I mean, like he has like his dad's credit card.

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.320
I don't know, like where does he get all the money

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.320
for the shit that he buys?

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.320
And not only like just crazy shit,

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.320
but like literally like surreal shit,

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.320
like a paint your own hole in a wall like kit.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.320
But it's just like, does Acme not sell like rotisserie Roadrunner?

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Like it's so easy.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.320
He's spending millions of dollars.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.320
I'm sure there's a restaurant.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.320
All right, all right.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.320
Spencer Hayes Looney Tunes.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.320
Also, that track I just played is one minute and 11 seconds,

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.320
but you ended exactly on time.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.320
I have great back timing.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.320
Here I am.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.320
Ain't gonna dick, I got a chicken noodle can.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320
I love it.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.320
Should we start playing Dungeons & Dragons?

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.320
I think we should.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.320
That's the first time that's been applauded anywhere near Boston.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320
We're in Brooklyn as a sold out crowd.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.320
It's like the people are cheering for Ray of Frost spells.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320
What have we brought?

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.320
We have to welcome Mulrainee Sidhanna, Erin McGathy to the stage.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.320
Hey, really quick.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.320
Maybe this is just in my head,

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.320
but it feels like there have been a lot of references to you getting blown

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.320
and you getting laid.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320
I just want to know if we're okay.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320
Yeah, we're fine.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.320
I was actually specifically going to do a relationship check-in with you.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320
Okay, well then I won't say that.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320
Do that now.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.320
Spencer, get your dice lined up for whatever goes on over there.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.320
How are we doing, baby?

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.320
I think we're doing good.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:59.320
Yeah, the jokes about, you know, Jeff's making jokes like somebody's blowing me.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.320
And then you said, like, I won't get laid in Boston.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.320
Yeah, well, I don't know.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320
No, it's fine.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320
Maybe you were talking about me.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320
Maybe you're worried about enticing me.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.320
She laughs, she laughs.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.320
Aaron, it gets lonely for a guy on the road.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.320
But he brought his girlfriend.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.320
He brought his portable hole.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.320
Do it yourself, okay.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.320
There's 850,000 reasons never to be in a relationship with me.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:35.320
The only one that there isn't is that I would ever, I just don't, I don't have the capacity.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320
No, I know, I know.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320
I've never done it.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320
I'm 40.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320
He's a great guy.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320
He's a great guy, everybody.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.320
And a great boyfriend.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.320
I'm not, like, the road is hard for a relationship.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.320
We're in a tour bus and we're in a hotel room and it's like, well, why aren't we doing it all the time?

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.320
We have sex with wood.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320
There's a wood block.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.320
There's a hole on one side and then, like, a thing on the other.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.320
And we have this, like, swing that we sit in.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320
And there's no time for it.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320
We're Orthodox Amish.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320
We're not allowed to look at each other.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.320
We have these Iron Man suits made of wood.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.320
And I just have an opening for a dick.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320
She has a dick.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320
And we just rub them together.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320
We're snails.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.320
We're asexual wooden Iron Men.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.320
I would say, mercifully, I have not caught or heard you guys doing it on the tour bus.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320
No, no, no, no.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.320
It'd be really hard to do on the tour bus.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320
Boo.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320
Hard and awesome.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.320
Are you booing Jeff not seeing us have sex?

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.320
No, he's booing you guys not fucking on the tour bus.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.320
There's these little, like...

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.320
We spooned.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.320
Yeah, we cradle each other.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.320
There's these little bunks and you draw a little curtain across.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320
And, yeah, it would be...

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.320
It'd be weird.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.320
You'd hear my belt buckle jingling.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.320
It wouldn't be real sex.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320
It would be like a hand job or something.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320
And it'd be like, you just hear like jingling and...

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.320
Right.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.320
And I cry pretty loud.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.320
Yeah.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.320
Chicken noodle man.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.320
I know what.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320
I ate it already.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.320
I'm working on it.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.320
I'm going to write that female part and I'm going to create a fake Twitter account and

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.320
I'll tweet it to you and it'll be like, ah, hasmat45.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.320
What a...

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.320
I don't know why that's my...

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.320
Hasmat45.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:35.320
Somebody's got some subconscious herpes denial.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.320
No, no, any random jingling on that bus is going to give me nightmares.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320
That's why I take off my...

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.320
I take off my belt in that bunk because I don't want anyone to think I'm jerking off.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.320
And it sounds like I'm jerking...

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.320
Every time I roll over, it sounds like I'm jerking off.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320
Oh, man.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320
So have you jerked off on the bus?

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.320
Not on the bus.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:04.320
What have you jerked off on?

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.320
I did it in the hotel room.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.320
I wish I was around for that.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320
Well, you weren't.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.320
You were getting me food.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320
I'm not...

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:24.320
The title of tonight's show isn't I'm a Good Boyfriend or I wouldn't have...

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.320
I'm not trying to pull anything over on anyone.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.320
That's why I came back with a food and you were just asleep with a smile on your face.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.320
No, I was just watching Harry Potter 2 and...

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.320
He gets me every time.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.320
They're fighting the evil wizards.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320
No, I don't know.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.320
It wasn't one of those moments that you're thinking.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.320
I was really discreet about it.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320
You never knew. You never suspected.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320
Aaron, have you masturbated on the bus?

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.320
Hesitation.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.320
Yeah!

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:05.320
They're just like us.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.320
They're like us.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.320
They're just like us.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320
Yeah, you did it, didn't you?

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.320
Well, you know, God, this is such a big room.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.320
Yes, yes, clearly I did it.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.320
See, women get applause for that.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.320
And this is how I did it.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.320
Dan, should I do it?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.320
Sure, sure.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.320
Date line to her bus.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.320
My girlfriend masturbated in a bunk.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320
She's a woman of the people.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.320
Having fun on the road.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.320
Getting it all out there.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320
I just did it to fall asleep a couple of times.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.320
Yeah, that's why I always do it.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.320
Yeah, well, whatever.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.320
This is a great time for me to point out

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.320
that I was a camp counselor for several years.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.320
And one of my campers is here tonight.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.320
Let's get her up here.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.320
Come on up.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.320
I forgot about that.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.320
Specific talk about Bunker Master Mansion.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.320
Yeah, your camp catler was masturbated on the bus today.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.320
I'm a brute, everybody. Hi.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.320
Yeah.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.320
Hey.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320
I can trump that.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.320
The 19-year-old webmaster of my Tumblr blog is here.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.320
Marissa, get up here.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.320
It's a competition to make each other uncomfortable.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.320
I just want to, let's get it all out.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.320
Like, like, like, like, like, it's weird going on TV.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.320
Look, look, look.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.320
Marissa, Marissa, Marissa runs the Having Changed Tumblr blog.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.320
Woo!

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.320
And if you, if you bought Dan's book

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.320
when I was editing Dan's book, Marissa helped me by,

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.320
I called her and asked a million things over,

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.320
and she helped me by finding Tumblr dates and stuff.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320
Her name's in the book.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320
If you wanted to sign your book.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.320
And Emma is super smart and cool,

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.320
and I was her counselor when she was 14,

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320
and I'm sorry I'm masturbated on the bus.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.320
And Marissa brought her mom.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.320
So, like, let's bring her up.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.320
Marissa's mom, where's Marissa's mom?

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.320
40-year-old man drinking and talking about sex and masturbation.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320
Underage women on stage.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320
Everybody's having a good time.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.320
Bring up the mom, bring up the mom, bring up the mom.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.320
Bring up the mom!

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.320
Hello.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.320
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.320
I am not sorry at all about this.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320
What's your name?

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.320
Mitzi.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.320
Mitzi, okay.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.320
And so, Marissa told me,

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320
we did a little interview for the little movie we're making.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.320
She said that you, because she needed to come here.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320
She can't, it's a club, it's 21 and over.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.320
She needed a legal guardian to come.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.320
You listened for the first time to the podcast of this guy she's a fan of.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320
What was your reaction?

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320
I was glad I was alone.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320
Did you masturbate?

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.320
Stop, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.320
No, yeah, everybody's having a good time.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.320
Ask your moms if they masturbate in front of their daughters.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.320
Insane, this is officially more insane than Brooklyn.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.320
We have lost our minds.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.320
You did it, congratulations.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.320
You jibbit people and you bring this out of us.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320
I don't know what happens in this.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320
I'm so sorry.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320
Yeah, Yankee suck, right?

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320
Oh, Yankee suck.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.320
Yes.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.320
Now it's happening.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320
This is where we get stabbed.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320
The stirring wheel came off.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320
How are you enjoying the show?

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320
I'm absolutely loving it.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.320
But I actually have a story about Aaron kind of related to masturbation.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:34.320
Oh, no.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320
Just hanging out.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.320
All right, well, I doubt she has any recollection of this whatsoever.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:20:09.320
But Aaron actually taught me what feminine wetness was.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.320
So we went to a very...

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320
or the camp is very experimental.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320
What's the address of this place?

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320
It's in Maine.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.320
How did I teach you about feminine wetness?

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.320
Well, I remember we were all...

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:42.320
in the hard way.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.320
Well, do you remember when we used to like hang out on the porch of the bunk?

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.320
Like kind of late at night, we'd talk about boys and men.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.320
It was this feels terrible, the podcast basically.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320
But on a porch.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.320
Yeah, very early incarnation of this feels terrible.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.320
But we were like, we were chilling out there.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.320
It was me and a few of my friends and Aaron comes out and we were like,

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320
Aaron, what does wet mean?

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320
Like, what does it mean when you get wet?

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.320
And she just got so uncomfortable.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
And that's good.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.320
I'm glad he didn't say a smile, whatever came across her face.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.320
I thought you'd never ask.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.320
Cut to Cancun.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.320
Cut to a cartoon owl looking at the camera.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.320
What did I say was appropriate?

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.320
It was a very clinical definition.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:39.320
You were just like, when a woman gets aroused,

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320
she...

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.320
her vagina gets wet.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320
Say what?

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.320
You know that?

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.320
Some day, some day.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320
All right, okay, let's go.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.320
Well, thank you.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.320
You're welcome.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.320
All right.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.320
We learned a lot at Harmontown.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320
Take your mamas, come on down.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.320
Everybody's going to learn a thing or two.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, how do you get wet?

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320
What do you do?

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.320
This is insane.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.320
Are there any 14-year-olds in the audience?

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.320
Can I get you another root beer float?

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.320
What do we do, Jeff?

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.320
We have a chorus of spiraling shame and irony up here.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.320
Adam Goldberg's on the air again?

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.320
He rips to me knowing that his brothers are here.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320
He has a reply.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320
Yes, what does Adam Goldberg have to say?

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.320
All right, well, we need you on mic, though, because...

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320
Let's just have a...

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320
That'll be the stage.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.320
Everyone at some point is going to get on the stage tonight.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.320
But first of all, do you know how to get wet?

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.320
Okay, I'm sorry, that was too far.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:01.320
Come on up so we can hear the...

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320
Matt, right?

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.320
So you have a relationship with Adam Goldberg?

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.320
Yeah, I know him from the drive.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320
A bar in LA, okay.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.320
And so Adam Goldberg sent you a text?

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.320
He knew that his brothers are here, and he has a reply for you.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.320
Okay.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320
Do you want to read it, or...?

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320
No, you read it.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:27.320
If they are being mean to me, ask Dan how many cool, cool, cool t-shirts he sold.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.320
What does he think that makes his fan art...

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:34.320
Who does he think that makes his fan art updates his wiki and upvotes his 101 videos?

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.320
Sure as hell, ain't the Allison Breeze of the world.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.320
I met her though.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.320
Pause for a little gravity.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.320
I met her though, she's super nice.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.320
Look, I really...

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.320
Oh no, everybody's spiraling.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.320
Look, I really hard went to care about how people view me, I really do.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.320
But I can't recapture the feathers from the pillowcase.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.320
I can't make people like me if they honestly don't want to.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:09.320
I'm a positive person, the best version of my authentic self, and continue to be humorous, honest, and loving.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.320
If some people think I'm a gremlin, or a robot, or a grembot...

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.320
Well, that is the price of entering the public sphere.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:22.320
We can't all be Johnny Unitas.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.320
Adam Goldberg dominates...

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.320
Wait, Adam Goldberg knows what Johnny Unitas is?

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:36.320
Well, he certainly spiked that one in the fucking end zone.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.320
What's your name? Matt, everybody, thank you.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320
Jesus Christ.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.320
So Adam thought that he was really thrown under the bus, which I don't think he was.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.320
Will the court see a rejoiner here on Earth?

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.320
Jesus Christ.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320
Come on up.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.320
No, no, no, I'm all for this stuff, Matt.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.320
We've gone off the rails.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.320
I'm just going to remind the listeners that Missy Merse's mom is still in stage.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.320
She's just standing with her hands folded in front of her.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.320
She's very patient, best mom in the world.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.320
I can't give a rejoinder.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.320
Oh, my name is Nick.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.320
He's made it up. Fake name.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:27.320
It's NIC. There's no cash.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:33.320
All right. This doesn't make it less fake, but it makes it more fake.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.320
My name is Bob Johnson. That's a fake name.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.320
No, it's spelled with a Q.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.320
I think he was, yes, the ending U, that it was fake. He's like, yeah, it is fake.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.320
Oh, okay. Thank you, sweetie.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.320
All right, so, all right.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.320
I'm going to think about this later.

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320
What's the rejoinder?

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.320
My rejoinder would be how...

01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:02.320
My rejoinder would be how brilliant you are.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.320
But the only whack...

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.320
No, don't boo him. Don't boo him. He's you. He's me.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.320
That means I have to leave. They booed.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:17.320
Thank you. I agree. I'm brilliant. Worst rejoinder ever.

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:20.320
That's what they were booing.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:24.320
All right. All right. We hit peak of...

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320
Peak insanity?

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.320
Yes.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320
No, I think we're not even halfway home, baby.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320
You're right.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.320
If peak insanity would be like, oh my God, we're going to run out of insanity.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.320
It's the opposite problem, right?

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:39.320
We've hit the point in Day of the Dead with the elevators coming down.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.320
The loading dock elevator.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:46.320
Since we have this chorus of beautiful ladies up here, maybe we should try the song.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.320
We'll teach them the lyrics.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.320
Maybe... I'm sorry, what was your name on the end there?

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320
Emma, you probably already know the lyrics to the anthem, right?

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320
They come on down to Harmontown. Do you know?

01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.320
Let's try that.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.320
Yeah, I could probably...

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320
Oh, shit.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.320
Oh, shit.

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.320
Oh, shit.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.320
Can I just dance?

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320
I'll make it quick. Then we gotta play D&D.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.320
Yo, okay. Yo, yo.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320
I'll do some rapping.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.320
Then she'll sing the re-anna part.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.320
And you'll be clapping in it.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.320
My name is Dan Harmon. I'm sorry about the show.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.320
I tried to do things by the cup, but sometimes it blows.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.320
Came to Somerville trying to do something nice.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.320
I'm sorry that I couldn't have a lot of ice.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.320
But I'm still an alcoholic. I still like to drink.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.320
I fucked your mom all up and down the kitchen sink.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.320
Put her pussy in the drain and turned it on.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.320
I saw your mama go down till the break of dawn.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320
Yeah.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.320
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320
Turn that frown upside down.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320
Strength.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320
He is yellow, poop is brown.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320
Struggle.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.320
Speakers in front of me. They look like demons inside.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320
I wanna fuck your mama so hard.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.320
She gets twice as wide. I fuck your mama at every avenue.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.320
I fucked your mama. I'm so sorry about you being up here.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.320
I'm so sorry. There's a literal mama behind me.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.320
It's very comfortable.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.320
I don't mean it. It's just an expression.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320
I'm so sorry.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320
Obama's recession.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.320
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320
Politics.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320
Turn that frown upside down.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.320
Fiscal cliff.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.320
He is yellow, poop is brown.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320
Her pants out.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320
Your ass crack is hanging out.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.320
My ass crack.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.320
Yeah.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.320
Ass crack hanging out of the back.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.320
That means I'm a working class person.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.320
Like people from the city that likes Goodwill Hunting.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.320
Steeple.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.320
Matt Damon likes them apples.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.320
I think that screenplay was stinkier than Crapples.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.320
Don't go to a window and say how do you like them.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.320
Any normal person would say, that's fucking stupid.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.320
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320
Matt Damon.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.320
Turn that frown upside down.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320
Affleck.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.320
He is yellow, poop is brown.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.320
Duck.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320
Cars.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320
Thank you ladies.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320
I'm on Miss Amarisa.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.320
That's how we get them.

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.320
Thank you.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.320
Thank you, Miss Amarisa.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.320
Any other ladies have any questions about why you get wet?

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.320
Missy, I'm so sorry.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.320
She has a milk crate for a stare.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.320
All she wanted to do was raise a good daughter.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.320
And she did everything right and then out of, absolutely completely out of her control,

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.320
the internet was invented.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.320
She had no choice.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.320
She didn't get to sign off on that.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.320
No one ever came to her home and said, should we have an internet?

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.320
Well, what's that?

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:54.320
It means that a gross, horrible, alcoholic, middle-aged man will be a part of your daughter's life.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.320
The nays have it.

01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.320
No they don't.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320
You don't get to choose.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.320
It's the internet.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.320
But she's a good kid and you've definitely done something right.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:11.320
Because I met her for the first time tonight and she survived the last year unscathed.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.320
She's not a dirtbag.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.320
No, she's a good kid.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.320
She seems very intelligent too.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.320
So my takeaway is just keep me in a gross, creepy asshole.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.320
Absolutely.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.320
I'm making better women.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.320
All right, Spencer, get us up to date.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320
Spencer, catch us up to date.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:34.320
When we last met, the trio had just been regrouping after collecting some treasure in a locker room

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.320
of a great flying ship.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.320
Ascending a magical pole, Sharpie saw a fighting force of dark stars, evil men.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:46.320
Thinking quickly, the mage conjured a squid, crushing several of the minions.

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.320
The ship's pilot, the sinister Dave, played by Jason Sudeikis.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.320
Left into action, blinding, tripping and flatulating on quark in a flurry of humorous combat.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:03.320
The two fought with knives and after a ray of frost to the eye in a critical arrow, Dave was slain.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:07.320
The bite-sized armored figure falls onto the floor with a clatter.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.320
The dead squid dissolves into air, freeing the previously trapped crewmen.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.320
They cower in fear.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320
Go!

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.320
All right, we did it.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320
So we got these guys on the run now.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.320
Yeah, so that guy's dead.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.320
Those three other guys, they were like trapped under the thing.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320
They're not trapped, but they're just cowering in fear.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.320
Are they armored or are they kind of innocent?

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.320
They're not wearing much of anything.

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.320
Like that whip guy.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.320
Throw on your weapons.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320
I'm saying to them, throw on your weapons.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.320
They have no weapons.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:42.320
I give them some weapons.

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.320
You give them some throwing knives?

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.320
Yeah, I give them some throwing knives.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.320
Throw them down.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.320
They do that.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:55.320
I go pick up my throwing knives and I go, watch it.

01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:59.320
How does that feel to be given weapons and then made to surrender them?

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.320
Not very well.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.320
Say it again.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320
Not very well.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320
Say it louder.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320
I'm psychologically breaking you.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.320
One of them breaks psychologically.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.320
I drink his soul.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.320
You gain three hit points.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.320
Uh-oh.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.320
I just went down an Elrond Hubbard road.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.320
You're just a metaphor for drug abuse or something.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.320
I just found out a new way to...

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320
We don't know what they want, right?

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.320
No.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.320
No, you don't.

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.320
It's diplomacy.

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.320
Okay.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.320
Sorry.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.320
So what do you want to say?

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:44.320
I want to say sorry about everything, I think.

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.320
What's going on?

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.320
What are you doing under there?

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.320
I don't know how to drive the ship.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.320
Oh, shit, is the ship crashing?

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.320
You hear a voice come from the overhead.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.320
Autopilot disengaged.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.320
Uh-oh.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.320
The steering wheel of the ship spins wildly to the right and countless alarms flash disorienting you.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.320
I run...

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.320
Sorry, I'm a ranger.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.320
No.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.320
Okay.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.320
Rangers have pilot skills?

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.320
I run to the steering wheel and grab it.

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.320
You grab it.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:24.320
It's very difficult to hold on to the terrible bulk of the wheel, but you manage to ride its course.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.320
Hey, this thing's hard to hold.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.320
You're stronger than me.

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.320
Okay, would I do better holding the wheel, Spencer?

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.320
I go and assist and try my luck at holding the wheel and steadying the ship.

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:41.320
After it's already been steadied by Sharpie, you find it very, very easy to hold it on a steady course.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.320
However, you don't know where the ship's headed.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.320
Where does it maps in the other room?

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320
That's true.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.320
You left them there, I think.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.320
Okay, I run back to the other room.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.320
It's safe going, right?

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.320
We killed everybody on board, right?

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.320
You're holding the wheel.

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.320
Hey, hot chat, go get those maps, I'll drive.

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.320
Mulraine, go get the maps.

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.320
Are you going to jerk off again?

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.320
Every time she leaves the room, you start masturbating.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:10.320
I'm going to use hypnotism to get some information out of these guys.

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320
Okay.

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.320
All right, so I'll go get the maps.

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.320
I'm sorry.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.320
No, it's okay.

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:23.320
I bound away and my hair flows like a river of kisses.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.320
And this scent comes from my hair that's like lilacs and heaven.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.320
And I turn back and I giggle, and then I walk into the other room.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.320
Yep.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.320
The sirens are still going off.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.320
I look on the panel for anything that might indicate, can I use my intelligence,

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:47.320
my extreme Dan Harmon type intelligence to determine if I could tell on this panel

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.320
if there's anything that will shut these alarms off?

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.320
There's nothing that will shut them off.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.320
It seemed to be indicating some sort of pressure regulation warnings.

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.320
Oh, is the hatch still open?

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.320
Maybe.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.320
Which hatch?

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320
The one I entered through from the bottom.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.320
That one's not open.

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.320
What about the hatches where the cannons were?

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.320
Those were sealed.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.320
All right, fuck that thing.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.320
If I want to get information out of people as a sidebar,

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.320
is it better to use charm person or hypnotism?

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.320
I'd use charm person.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.320
Okay, I cast charm person on one person?

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320
The guy who's soul you broke.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320
That happens.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.320
Okay, is he my buddy now?

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.320
He's feared of you, but yeah, yeah.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.320
What's your name, buddy?

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320
Good Clint.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.320
Oh, Clint, you having a good time pilot in the ship?

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320
I'm in fear.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320
Yeah?

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.320
Me too, buddy, we're all afraid.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.320
Everyone's afraid of things they don't know,

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320
but you know what always helps me when I'm afraid?

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.320
I figure out everything I can about what I do know.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320
So I go like, where was the ship going?

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.320
I was going to the north to regroup.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.320
Okay.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:01.320
All right.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.320
Them.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.320
You know what doesn't help fear?

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320
What?

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.320
Thatness.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.320
You know what always cuts through it?

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.320
Specificity.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:16.320
Like coordinates, like names.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.320
We don't have the education to understand such coordinate systems.

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.320
Do you have the education to understand that I will fuck your world up?

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.320
I thought we were friends?

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320
Yeah.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.320
A good friend will fuck you up.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.320
He's broken again.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.320
Sharpie, ask him if he knows how to get the pressure systems back to normal.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320
How do you get the pressure systems going, Clint?

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320
He's balling on the floor.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.320
Clint!

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.320
Clint!

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.320
Look at me.

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.320
I step in and play, I step in and play good cop.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.320
I said, listen, sorry about my friend, man.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320
I want a piece of that asshole.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.320
Sharpie, don't get a cup of decaf and just take it easy.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.320
I'll be back and then you're fucking dead, Clint.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320
Clint, I'm sorry about my partner.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.320
His wife just was killed by a cabinet.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.320
An animated cabinet.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.320
Yeah, an animated...

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.320
Stupid presidents.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.320
Why do they appoint those people?

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.320
They're murderous.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.320
Clint, look, man, I don't want, I don't want...

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320
You've been nothing but doing us favors.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.320
Do you know how to stop this, how to repressurize the ship?

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.320
You need to find one of those little black creatures.

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.320
They know how this thing works.

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.320
Don't be racist, Clint.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.320
Okay, weird story.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.320
I'm sorry, they're called imps.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.320
Ips?

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.320
Imps.

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.320
Imps?

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.320
IMP.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.320
I do know how to spell various creatures' names.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320
Okay.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320
What deck, now?

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320
How do I get to these knowledgeable imps?

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
They might be in the engine room.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320
Alright, I run off to the engine room.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320
You head down the ladder into the engine room.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.320
Can I see anything out of the...

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.320
Is there a windshield?

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320
Yeah, there is a windshield.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320
Do I see the other ships?

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.320
Is there like a fleet of ships?

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.320
There's actually not.

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320
You can't see any ships around you.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.320
You find that slightly odd, to be honest.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.320
Yeah, we've deviated.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.320
Yeah.

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.320
I should mention that quark stepped away from the wheel.

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.320
We deviated from the wheel?

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.320
What?

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320
The quark stepped away from the wheel.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.320
Oh, grab the wheel.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.320
Shit, I grab it.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.320
I grab it.

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.320
You don't hear him because he's in the engine room at this point.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.320
I climb back up the ladder and yell,

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.320
Sorry, my bad.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.320
Grab the wheel, Sharpie.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320
Alright, alright, that happens.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320
I come running back into the room.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320
Yeah.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320
How does your hair look?

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.320
Oh, you did something new, isn't it?

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320
Bangs?

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.320
Bangs or rainbows?

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.320
You tell me.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.320
Yes, my hair is flowing and my breasts...

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.320
Like, they slow motion almost.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:44.320
I go back into the engine room.

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.320
Sharpie.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.320
Yes.

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.320
Hear the maps.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.320
Thank you.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320
You're welcome.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.320
There's a musical sting indicating that, you know,

01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:03.320
I too know what it is to be wet.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:13.320
Well, I came into the room with my hair down to here.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:18.320
We don't have time for this.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.320
Here, hear the maps.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.320
And as a ranger, I know that we need to go north.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.320
Also, I overheard you.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320
Should go north.

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.320
I just got to keep this wheel straight.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.320
Sharpie, you got some squid glue goo on your shirt.

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.320
Oh, get that off.

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320
Thank you.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.320
You're such a mess.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.320
Listen, make sure those three guys don't move, you know,

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320
secure them somehow.

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.320
Okay.

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:49.320
I fire two arrows.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.320
Jesus Christ.

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.320
We might need these guys.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.320
We might need...

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.320
These are not foes right now.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.320
No, no, no.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.320
I shoot it out there.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.320
Is there any part of your body that's not painful

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.320
to get shot with an arrow?

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.320
I shoot it at their hair.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.320
Oh, okay.

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.320
Their ear lobes?

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.320
Yeah.

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.320
Oh, through their...

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.320
They all have earrings.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.320
Shoot through there.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.320
Well, one of them hits the guy in the eye.

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.320
Terrific.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.320
Might have needed him.

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320
Might have needed him.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.320
The other hits you on the foot.

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.320
Still alive.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320
Okay.

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320
You take...

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320
Ha!

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320
Adventure!

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320
One damage.

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320
Jesus.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.320
I'm sorry.

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.320
I've been very distracted lately.

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320
Just keep an eye on them.

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.320
Well, I'll take one away, apparently.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.320
Meanwhile, in the engine room...

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.320
I was just going to do that.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.320
Yeah, good.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.320
Yeah.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.320
I examine the surroundings in the engine room.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.320
Woosh.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.320
The engine room slides open.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.320
You see eight identical machine-like machines.

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.320
They have some vaguely machine-like qualities.

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.320
Pistons firing and tubes going to and fro.

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:58.320
You see several fluids pumped through the various devices.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320
You can see one off in the corner.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.320
It's venting a strange green gas.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.320
And you can see two black creatures crawling across it.

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.320
Hitting it with metal tools.

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.320
Blah, blah, blah.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.320
Blah.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320
All right, guys.

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320
What's going on in here?

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.320
They hiss at you in a language you don't understand.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320
All right.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.320
Well, did somebody feed you after midnight?

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.320
Or get you wet?

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.320
A cheddar runder.

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.320
What do you say, a cheddar runder?

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.320
Yeah, I cast magic callback.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320
Do I need to...

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.320
I approach them to examine the machinery.

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.320
There's a large crack in one of the casings.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.320
That's why it's venting gas.

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.320
They're not sure what this stuff is.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.320
Are they trying to fix it or destroy it?

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.320
They do appear to be trying to fix it.

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.320
Blah, blah, blah.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.320
So I should leave them to their task, probably, right?

01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.320
Maybe.

01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.320
Maybe they won't fix it.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320
I don't know.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.320
Anybody out there got any ideas?

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320
Whip one at a wall.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.320
Whip one at a wall?

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.320
I take one of them and whip them at a wall.

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.320
I pick them up with my strength and throw one at the wall

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.320
to send a message to the other one to get on the fucking stick

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.320
and stop the gas leak.

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:29.320
Blah, blah, blah.

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.320
He falls to the ground and is unconscious.

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:35.320
And I look at the other guy and I'm like,

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.320
Mo, Mo?

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.320
The other guy's not paying attention.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320
He's just going back to trying to work on this thing.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.320
Okay.

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.320
I go in a system.

01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.320
Okay.

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.320
I mean, he seems like he's doing his job, right?

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320
He asked for some tears.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.320
Look.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.320
He looks at you expectantly and hisses something at you.

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320
Blah, blah, blah.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320
Do I have any ability to understand him?

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.320
I speak that language in your head.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.320
You know, I run back upstairs, grab the wheel at the bridge,

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.320
relieve Sharpie, he goes back down into the engine room.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.320
You tag out.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320
Goldberg style.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.320
Yeah.

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.320
Go.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.320
All right.

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:15.320
I go to the room.

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.320
I carefully follow Jeff's directions.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.320
I say, go left until you get, keep going.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.320
If you go to the bathroom, you've got too far.

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.320
Pass the unconscious lamp laying below the wall.

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.320
All right.

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.320
The other imp is, is hissing about how this was a two-person job.

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320
In the office.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.320
It's not a two-person job.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.320
Bad about a few people.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.320
Well, now it's a one-person job.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.320
How do we do it?

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.320
What can I do?

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320
From a wizard.

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.320
What about a dog that just can't even?

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.320
Well, you speak the language, right?

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.320
Yeah, yeah, you speak the language.

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.320
So, what do they say?

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.320
The wheels translate, though.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.320
It's like, I need sovereign glue.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.320
Well, this is hardly the time.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.320
This is exactly the time.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320
Oh, okay.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.320
Sorry, I was doing a dumb joke.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.320
Is the sovereign glue that bit glopo-glowing jello

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.320
that was in the other room with the face bubbling up to it?

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.320
You don't know that it's not?

01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.320
What does sovereign glue look like?

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.320
It comes in a yellow bottle.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.320
It's usually well-labeled.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.320
It should be in the locker room.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.320
Oh, the locker room.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.320
Didn't we get everything out of the locker room?

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.320
You got all the treasure.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.320
Go to the locker room.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.320
You go to the locker room.

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.320
I find that yellow glue.

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.320
You do.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.320
You find it.

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.320
Yay!

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.320
That's applause bigger than warranted.

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.320
You found glue?

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.320
Look at it.

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.320
They're like, finish it!

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.320
The babysitter's getting extra.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.320
All right.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320
I take the yellow glue back to the engine room.

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.320
That happens.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.320
You give them the yellow glue and he sets to work.

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.320
He says, it should be about five minutes.

01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.320
I think I got this.

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.320
Five minutes?

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.320
Yeah.

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.320
Thanks, Sam.

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320
You know what?

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.320
I can see you retiring one day with a happy in family,

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:13.320
but I guess that's not how impage works.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.320
No, it's not.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.320
All right.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.320
Good day.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.320
I go back up to the bridge.

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:27.320
As you go back up to the bridge, you can't help but flash back.

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:32.320
You flash back to your mother's tails.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.320
Son, don't forget the Infinifish who will eat you up at night.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.320
He'll fly past the moon in your window and eat you with a bite.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.320
Oh, that terrible Infinifish, he'll give you such a fright.

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.320
That's the last thing you think of before you hear an earth-shattering impact on the

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320
whole.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320
Everything goes black.

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.320
Cliffhanger.

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.320
Cliffhanger?

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320
Cliffhanger.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320
Cliffhanger!

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320
Cliffhanger!

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:02.320
Dungeons and Dragons!

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320
It's hip.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.320
It's cool.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.320
It's the coolest thing in the world.

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.320
It's my final revenge on the cool population.

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.320
I have made Dungeons and Dragons cool.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.320
One more time for Erin McGathy.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:21.320
It's Spencer Crittenden.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:28.320
And a fun fuck you to my gym teachers throughout the years.

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:32.320
Turns out this is a fine way to pass the time.

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.320
Have yet to earn money doing the pull-up.

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.320
Having a pretty good time playing Dungeons and Dragons, Mr. Rainer.

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.320
All right, well, let's...

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.320
I think we can bring this train into the station.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320
Of course, of course.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.320
What have we learned tonight?

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.320
We're going to get out of here before it's...

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.320
Fallville.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.320
Fallville.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320
But it's spelled F-O-L-L.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.320
Yeah.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.320
Hey.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.320
Why is it S-O-M-M?

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320
Anybody know?

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320
Somebody's name?

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320
They made it up.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320
That's what I was saying.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320
They made it up at a town meeting.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320
No one knows why.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.320
It's just because this Wahlberg guy was a fucking...

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.320
Sheep fucker.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.320
She was a sheep fucker.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.320
How many fuckers do you get through up here?

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.320
Do you do them all?

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320
You finish mine, by the way.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.320
I can't tell, because I kept marrying them.

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320
That's the danger.

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.320
If we had a fifth up here, then we could monitor it.

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.320
We're the first Matt.

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320
We paid him enough.

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.320
No, no, no.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.320
Matt didn't do anything wrong.

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.320
Matt didn't.

01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.320
There's just a bunch of empty glasses, and I'm happy.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320
I could measure it in happiness.

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320
I'm very happy.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.320
I've had a good time in Somerville.

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.320
Anybody that...

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.320
Aaron told me that you guys set a record that we didn't know was setable for a pre-show

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.320
sale of merchandise.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.320
I guess you guys bought the most shit before the show.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320
But can they go for the total?

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.320
That's not why we're here.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.320
I'm taking a loss on the tour.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:00.320
I'm doing this to indulge my own 40-year-old fantasies.

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.320
We're not a profiteering people.

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:08.320
We're just coming through town, but we do have t-shirts and maps and photos and whatever

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.320
the hell.

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320
I don't know, glow worms, whatever the fuck.

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.320
At the I Love Spencer pin where the heart is a 20-sided die, which is awesome.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.320
And if you buy that stuff, I'm happy to sign it now.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:25.320
I can't turn anybody down, so I'll be here all night until the last thing is signed.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.320
Do you think it's possible to do audience passing with tables in here?

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.320
Is that really reckless?

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.320
I don't know, man.

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.320
That would be the ultimate fuck you to Brooklyn.

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:39.320
Yeah, if we could somehow manage.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:49.320
Just gonna make sure my wallet and my phone.

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.320
Find your center first, man.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.320
Thank you, Summerville.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.320
Find out what...this is about what Summerville means to us.

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.320
Where are we in our tour?

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:05.320
There are four seasons in the year, but the most special one is right here.

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:12.320
In Summerville, it's where I wanted to kill up on the stage.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.320
And I did alright, and I think we all had a halfway decent night.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:22.320
And I don't know what you paid, but I think we're gonna be alright.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.320
In Summerville, I fucked your mama.

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.320
She was on the pill.

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:36.320
She didn't get pregnant, so I will not have a child with her.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320
But if I did, I'd raise it like Raymond Burr.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:46.320
I'd teach him to be Perry Mason, and he'd solve cases on TV with hastens justice.

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:53.320
He'd cross-examine people and get to the bottom of shit in Harmontown.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:50:01.320
Harmontown, sing it.

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:05.320
We're making it up.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320
I don't know.

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320
We're making it up.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.320
I fucked your mama.

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.320
I fucked your mama.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.320
I fucked your mama.

01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.320
Hold on, I'll get it together, don't worry about it.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.320
I fucked your mama tonight.

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.320
To your mama's house, I rang the doorbell and said hello.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:33.320
She said, come inside of my house and have some ambrosia salad with Jello.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.320
I laid down on the table, it got so nasty.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.320
She poured it over me, I didn't care.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:45.320
I fucked your mama so hard that she's the color of her hair.

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:50.320
Went out in Harmontown, Harmontown.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:57.320
I fucked your mama in Harmontown, where he is yellow and poop is brown.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.320
I fucked your mama so hard in Harmontown.

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:03.320
All right, get the biggest people to look forward.

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:05.320
Get the biggest.

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.320
We can do it.

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.320
We're doing it.

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:12.320
Harmontown.

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.320
I fucked your mama tonight.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:21.320
I fucked your mama in Somerville and I'm lifting even higher than Brooklyn still.

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:25.320
I'm touching the ceiling in Johnny D's in Somerville.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.320
That's a new record.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.320
We're in Harmontown.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.320
Thank you so much Johnny D's for coming tonight.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:40.320
I want to thank Kara, Kara, the Goldberg brothers.

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:43.320
Emma, Marissa and Mitzi for coming up here.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.320
A special thanks to Mitzi, really.

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.320
Special thanks for securing our children's future.

01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:54.320
One more time for Spencer.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.320
Aaron, thank you Aaron.

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.320
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:22.320
Let's hear one more time for the mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:41.320
Go to the bar and get fucked up.
