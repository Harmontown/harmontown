00:00.000 --> 00:29.480
I know, I know, I'm not all dressed up like Jeff, but ladies and gentlemen, I am the

00:29.480 --> 00:42.480
alternate, Jeff, just for tonight, and this week's Harmontown is now in session!

00:42.480 --> 00:58.300
You begin!

00:58.300 --> 01:09.360
Spencer!

01:09.360 --> 01:20.360
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown himself, his honor, Dan Harmon!

01:20.360 --> 01:34.360
Hello, thank you very much. Thank you. Very kind of you. It's not really kind, it's dur-re-gur.

01:34.360 --> 01:41.360
It's dur-re-gur to apply when people come out. What does that mean? I think those are evil dwarves, right?

01:41.360 --> 01:52.360
Dur-re-gur? By default, a mandatory or rather a perfunctory part of the process. Hardly perfunctory.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.360
Just like evil dwarves. Having you out would not be perfunctory.

01:55.360 --> 02:04.360
It's a show with me in it. It is perfunctural to bring me out. It's perfunctural for them to applaud.

02:04.360 --> 02:13.360
Everything's fake. Everything that you ever thought was real is gone. That's what you came here for tonight, right?

02:13.360 --> 02:29.360
I saw the line outside. I got the divorce bump. This isn't my first time at the rodeo. I remember last time you guys were hanging from the rafters, I'd just been fired.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.360
Now, come on, we're always sold out and you guys are always very supportive and you always love me.

02:34.360 --> 02:39.360
Yes, there's the divorce thing. I don't know if I mentioned this, Curtis.

02:39.360 --> 02:45.360
You didn't. I'd heard that. I did mention it to everybody at a show yesterday.

02:45.360 --> 02:59.360
Now it's out. It's good. As you can probably tell, if you follow us on Twitter, it's amicable and mutual.

02:59.360 --> 03:10.360
It really is a simple failure of two people to live the American dream of monogamy or commitment, rather. We didn't fail monogamy.

03:10.360 --> 03:24.360
I'm not like a shake from Dubai or something. We were living together and we were best friends and we were eating pizza and watching movies.

03:24.360 --> 03:33.360
Then we were kind of like, we could almost do this without being married and all that kind of stuff. How many marriages have you had?

03:33.360 --> 03:49.360
It's interesting you say that because my first marriage ended in divorce in much the same way and we decided ultimately that rather than work on saving the marriage, we would work on saving the friendship.

03:49.360 --> 04:03.360
Today, that woman, my first wife, is in business with my second wife and current wife and she is also the godmother of my daughter.

04:03.360 --> 04:08.360
So it can happen when it's done lovingly.

04:08.360 --> 04:16.360
That is either a beautiful story or the revelation that Curtis is a strange David Koresh figure.

04:16.360 --> 04:30.360
And her cousin, her 13 year old cousin, is the mother of my next child and we all go to the same gun shows.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.360
It's like that Sherlock Holmes troupe of ladies that you're hanging out with.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
Oh, you've seen that.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.360
See, I know there's crazy shit going on.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.360
No, you mentioned that.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.360
And I never asked enough questions about that.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.360
The Baker Street babes.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.360
I don't even know what questions to ask.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.360
It's better not to.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.360
Let's let it be a mystery.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.360
Let's let Curtis just have his mysterious life.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
We have an exciting show.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.360
I have all kinds of shit going on.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.360
I don't want to spoil all of it in advance.

04:56.360 --> 05:02.360
It just runs down anything that I would talk about without bringing people out.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.360
Let's see.

05:03.360 --> 05:09.360
I don't have anything in here except for notes about one of our guest's movies, which was interesting.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.360
We'll talk to him about in a second.

05:10.360 --> 05:15.360
But yeah, there's the divorce thing.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
I don't know if I.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.360
Well, you brought up an interesting point when you said like saving the friendship.

05:19.360 --> 05:29.360
I thought what was interesting was, you know, it was Aaron made the very smart like practical decision to after we both like took a lot of space.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.360
And I wouldn't even call and I didn't thinking about it.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.360
I was just taking time because the therapist recommended.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.360
She's like, well, just don't make this decision hastily.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.360
Don't don't do anything.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.360
You know, just like you got nothing but time now you guys get married.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
You dumbasses.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.360
She talked us into it.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.360
The the but but it was like, yeah, so just take time.

05:49.360 --> 05:58.360
And I didn't even know and I walked into a couple's therapy session, you know, that we had scheduled and and Aaron started it by having having made a decision.

05:58.360 --> 06:09.360
And it was it was it was very, very brave and thoughtful, but then everything like spiraled into crazy, like shouting and yelling and accusing each other of all of these crimes, you know.

06:09.360 --> 06:18.360
And I think the reason that happens is because it's fucking embarrassing and hurtful to admit that that love didn't work somehow.

06:18.360 --> 06:30.360
And I think you feel weird about it. You feel bad. You feel like you spilled something. And then you and then the easy way to make it less like that is to get mad at this other person.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.360
Like, oh, we must be breaking up because they're an exceptional piece of shit.

06:33.360 --> 06:42.360
And so just yelling and yelling and for 20 minutes while the therapist sat there and like, OK, you guys can do this for the other 364 days of the year.

06:42.360 --> 06:52.360
Like, do you want to and then it was kind of this calm sort of settle in and the final epiphany for both of us was, well, wait a minute, if we really are breaking up, if that's really what we're doing,

06:52.360 --> 07:02.360
then we can immediately just start being nice to each other because we're both good people that are really nice to strangers all the time and we've only really been mean to each other.

07:02.360 --> 07:10.360
And so we how long did that did that take the process to get to that point three years.

07:10.360 --> 07:21.360
No, oh, say, you mean to cool down 20 minutes, 30 minutes of like just kind of like tattling, you know, well, you did this, you did that, and you're like this, and you're like that.

07:21.360 --> 07:37.360
And this is why this is happening. It's your fault. No, it's your fault. Like, if you like, what's the implication there, if you hadn't done something, we'd be, you know, because that's not a good, that's not a good idea to like be married to somebody that's based on like, oh, if you had done this thing,

07:37.360 --> 07:53.360
it's like, if you had done this butterfly effect thing, it's like much better to think as you walk away from somebody that it's not because of some Mr. Destiny bad movie flower you could have brought or or thing you couldn't have said,

07:53.360 --> 08:01.360
didn't say much better to just think that actually, shit, we dodged a bullet before we involved children. Exactly.

08:01.360 --> 08:14.360
So now I'm really judgmental of everyone that has kids. Yeah, it's weird. I mean, it's interesting. And by the way, I'm very, very, very proud of her. I'll probably start crying if I talk about that.

08:14.360 --> 08:36.360
But, but I mean, I, like, especially I feel like, like, you know, if the relationship was toxic, it was definitely toxic because of me and that toxicity came with a dynamic that was uneven, and the uneven dynamic came with a comfort level that was probably difficult for her to, you know,

08:36.360 --> 08:54.360
is very, very, very brave and admirable for her to actually be the one to put the dog down, you know, instead of waiting. And, and, and like, that's, I think, I think I feel like the moral of the story is like, or the irony of it is that we got married and we,

08:54.360 --> 09:07.360
we were imperfect people that got married, maybe for imperfect reasons. And because it wasn't working for that reason, then we went to couples therapy and said, like, Well, how do we make this work? And she said, Well, first of all, you're both nuts. And like, I'll start seeing both of you separately, which,

09:07.360 --> 09:20.360
of course, that's one way to triple your money as a therapist. But I do also think that that she was right. And because because she started seeing Aaron separately and seeing me separately and seeing us both as a couple.

09:20.360 --> 09:33.360
And we were learning about how couples are supposed to work and how all this stuff works. And I think that I think maybe the unspoken thing the whole time, you know, was that we were both learning well, given that this is how this works and given that given that I,

09:33.360 --> 09:48.360
I'm capable of being a normal person alone, like maybe we didn't we didn't really look at it until it was like right in front of our face and then it all happened very quickly. But I think that's the nice thing about it is that you don't,

09:48.360 --> 10:05.360
you don't enter a, you don't enter a relationship for flawed reasons, and then leave it because you're more flawed, you leave it because you get better, you leave it because you improved, you grew and learned stuff. And she's great.

10:05.360 --> 10:22.360
I'm friends with 99% of all of my exes, but I'll certainly continue to be like really good friends with her because she's one of the funniest people I've ever met and and and and and and and and.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.360
and blibbity-blop. Give me my podcast award now.

10:25.360 --> 10:39.360
It's weird. It's weird. The round of applause is weird. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm

10:39.360 --> 10:42.600
saying it sounds weird. It's all weird. If I was watching from an alien planet, I'd be

10:42.600 --> 10:46.520
like, that's weird. It's weird what you're doing. Why did you play that recording of

10:46.520 --> 10:51.560
you crying when your cat died? There's a guy that tweeted at me that he couldn't believe.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.320
It was like, why did you do that? I'm like, why did you do that? I'm so mad at that guy

10:55.320 --> 10:59.680
still. I was like, what did you think I was trying to do? Impress people? I played a recording

10:59.680 --> 11:05.320
of me crying. It sounds horrible and fake and dumb. It was like, no, no, no. It's just

11:05.320 --> 11:08.560
you kind of weird that you did that. I was wondering why you did it. I did it because

11:08.560 --> 11:09.560
you're mama.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.560
It is. Is Faith dead?

11:13.560 --> 11:17.560
No, she's fine. Oh, Faith is great, by the way. That's why you really came.

11:17.560 --> 11:25.560
You just said she died. All right. What else did you do? I know there is a, I don't think,

11:25.560 --> 11:30.160
I think I'm going to cheap this up my sleeve because it seems like a good thing to have

11:30.160 --> 11:36.360
up your sleeve, but I, an authentic MC challenged me to a rap battle on Twitter.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.360
Really?

11:37.360 --> 11:40.360
Are you here, MC Clarity? Okay.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.360
Oh, damn.

11:42.360 --> 11:53.560
Yeah. And I'm not being racist when I say he's an authentic MC. Yes, he's black. I looked

11:53.560 --> 12:00.000
at his Instagram, not at his face. I looked and he's got, there's flyers, like you're,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.360
you're a, is it safe to call you a professional MC?

12:03.360 --> 12:08.360
Have you ever gotten like some of the door?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.360
I've gotten the door.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.360
Professional? No, no, no. Like, I mean, I mean, taking like, like, like, do they do,

12:13.360 --> 12:16.360
like open MC nights? Like, like,

12:16.360 --> 12:19.360
All of you professionals, does everyone think they're a professional?

12:19.360 --> 12:26.360
It's just like, have you ever received a dollar for MCing in any indirect way?

12:26.360 --> 12:28.360
Okay. He's trying to dodge the issue.

12:28.360 --> 12:37.360
Tonight I'm going to take down a professional, a legit, a legit MC.

12:37.360 --> 12:52.360
Yeah. Yeah. And, yeah. And with, and with him, I'm going to take down racial stereotypes.

12:52.360 --> 12:57.360
You're welcome. You're welcome white people. You're welcome black people. You're welcome

12:57.360 --> 13:03.360
hip hop. You're welcome Harmontown. You're welcome. You're welcome.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.360
We appreciate it.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.360
You're welcome. All right. Well, let's, let's move on that because we got a cavalcade of,

13:09.360 --> 13:14.360
of, of, of odd wonders tonight. Like, it's very starting. Well, by the way, Curtis Armstrong,

13:14.360 --> 13:18.360
our guest comptroller. So good to have you back.

13:18.360 --> 13:22.360
And honor as usual.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.360
Okay. So there was this thing. It was called, it was, it was called records.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.360
Like before most of you kind of started listening to stuff.

13:30.360 --> 13:34.360
There was like, there were these chunks of vinyl that I don't even know how they made them,

13:34.360 --> 13:38.360
but because they were kind of going out when I was like younger.

13:38.360 --> 13:44.360
And there was this, there's this guy that made this documentary about the rise and fall of the

13:44.360 --> 13:51.360
biggest vinyl retailer turn that ended up becoming also the biggest CD retailer.

13:51.360 --> 13:56.360
Tower Records is a fixture of Los Angeles started in Sacramento, quickly moved to San Francisco.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.360
It just exploded. It was, it was, it's so ubiquitous.

13:59.360 --> 14:04.360
Like until I watched this documentary that he made, I wasn't even realizing that it was a story

14:04.360 --> 14:08.360
that you could follow that had a rise and a fall, but indeed it did because they just went out of

14:08.360 --> 14:12.360
business and, and marking the end of an, of an era.

14:12.360 --> 14:18.360
This guy is very talented documentary director. He, he's also an actor every once in a while.

14:18.360 --> 14:23.360
Why don't we talk to him about, about one or both? Please welcome Colin Hanks.

14:23.360 --> 14:38.360
Colin Hanks.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.360
Hello.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
Hi Dan.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.360
How many, how many, how many divorces are you on?

14:44.360 --> 14:47.360
I'm on four.

14:47.360 --> 14:52.360
We're including all the different family members, but so, because it affects everybody.

14:52.360 --> 14:59.360
So there's my parents divorce and then my wife's parents divorce and then a couple of uncles,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.360
maybe cousin.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.360
Did you ever get the, it's not your fault divorce talk?

15:04.360 --> 15:09.360
Always. That's part of the contract of having a divorce. I think it's, it's legally binding.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.360
Yeah. You have to tell the kids it's not your fault, which is the, a child's earliest encounter

15:13.360 --> 15:15.360
with the concept of protesting too much.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
Yes.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.360
So are you going to have like the conversation with the cat or dog?

15:19.360 --> 15:21.360
We already told Spencer it's his fault.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.360
Yeah.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.360
But I get full custody.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.360
Of both of us.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.360
Yeah.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.360
The, but I remember very distinctly writing with my dad and our station wagon and, and,

15:33.360 --> 15:35.360
and like, it was, it was really delayed.

15:35.360 --> 15:40.360
And I say this with, with, with a lot of love for my dad, like, like, I think he's long since

15:40.360 --> 15:43.360
stopped like listening because I'm always like, I'm always like casting shit about,

15:43.360 --> 15:45.360
you know, backward at my parents.

15:45.360 --> 15:52.360
But, but I just remember like, I remember like, I was, I was like looking at a comic book

15:52.360 --> 15:56.360
and I remember my dad trying to like awkwardly launch into the, it's not your fault talk

15:56.360 --> 15:58.360
because my, my parents were getting separated.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.360
They ended up staying together.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.360
But it was just also alarm everybody.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.360
Most awkward thing in the world.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.360
What an interview, Dan. Good job.

16:07.360 --> 16:13.360
Well, I would say this, the, the, it's not your fault talk always sort of segue it like,

16:13.360 --> 16:20.360
no matter how it goes, it's so uncomfortable for the parents that it always segues into

16:20.360 --> 16:23.360
to Christmas conversation.

16:23.360 --> 16:32.360
And I remember being super jealous because when I was a kid, I was in like my neighborhood,

16:32.360 --> 16:35.360
I was the only divorced.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.360
I was the only child of divorce.

16:37.360 --> 16:42.360
All my other friends, their parents were married until they all went off to college.

16:42.360 --> 16:47.360
And then all the parents divorced, which is super fucked up.

16:47.360 --> 16:52.360
But I remember being super jealous at all their, all their, all my friends,

16:52.360 --> 16:53.360
parents were still married.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.360
And I remember even going so like deep into it.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.360
That's like, man, all right, yeah, two Christmases, whatever.

16:59.360 --> 17:04.360
But if I was Jewish, I would have gotten 16 Hanukkahs.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.360
That would have been fucking crap.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.360
Wow.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.360
Yeah.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.360
That's about the extent of my math humor.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.360
Yeah.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.360
But I just keep going because every Jewish kid I've ever talked to,

17:15.360 --> 17:19.360
the first thing they lead with is like, don't, that's not eight Christmases.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.360
It's like, it's like eight shitty half stockings.

17:23.360 --> 17:26.360
It's like, it's like a go-bot if you're lucky.

17:26.360 --> 17:33.360
It's like, it's like eight, it's eight presents from the aunt that clearly does not know you is what it is.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.360
Yeah.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.360
It's like, like vampire teeth.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.360
It's great.

17:37.360 --> 17:43.360
I guess, I guess our people are chosen.

17:43.360 --> 17:48.360
I don't know if this is the day we're supposed to prove that, but I feel great.

17:48.360 --> 17:55.360
I'm off to school where the last three months have been dedicated to our Lord and Savior.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.360
In the form of just fucking lavish, like blinking lights.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.360
It's like, Christ was born.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.360
Everyone, here's $20.

18:03.360 --> 18:06.360
Here's a candy cane for breakfast.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.360
I'm doing 80 stand-up.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.360
I'm doing John Stewart's act.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.360
All of the stereotypes are being broken tonight.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.360
All of them.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.360
All right.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.360
So you made this documentary.

18:17.360 --> 18:23.360
It's called, it's called, what, now it is, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.360
I want to say this too shall pass because it's the Buddhist thing, but it's not that.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.360
No, it's all things must pass.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.360
All things must pass.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.360
Yes.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.360
And there's significance to that that I won't spoil.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.360
Although I will say this documentary, this will sound like a lack of endorsement,

18:35.360 --> 18:37.360
but really it's the remarkable thing about this documentary.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.360
There are no twists in this story.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.360
No, you know how all the stores close.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
Yeah.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
Literally all the, all the, all the things that.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
And you know why?

18:45.360 --> 18:46.360
I mean, they could guess why.

18:46.360 --> 18:52.360
And, and, okay, this is a place that, that started right when, you know, I mean, they,

18:52.360 --> 18:55.360
they, they started selling records and then 1963 happens.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.360
The Beach Boys become a thing.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.360
The Beatles become a thing.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.360
The, the single culture goes to an album culture and this place explodes.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.360
Yeah.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.360
But, but yeah, I know that wasn't a question.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
No.

19:06.360 --> 19:11.360
The, and they also can guess that then guess, guess what, guess why it all ends, but it's,

19:11.360 --> 19:15.360
that doesn't make it at all an interesting to like trace every step of this.

19:15.360 --> 19:21.360
Well, no, I mean, and that is actually sort of the first, that was the thing that interested

19:21.360 --> 19:28.360
me to, to start making it is I found out that this guy Russ Solomon who founded Tower Records,

19:28.360 --> 19:35.360
he started selling used 78s from his father's drug store in 1939, 41.

19:35.360 --> 19:42.360
It's the, the, he's a little bit hazy with those dates, but that's how he started selling

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
records.

19:43.360 --> 19:49.360
And then by the time that Tower Records closed its doors, he had 192 stores around the world.

19:49.360 --> 19:55.360
And so that little like factoid got me super supremely interested in just the overall arc

19:55.360 --> 20:04.360
and I got lost in the most mundane minutiae of Tower Records and all of the little fascinating

20:04.360 --> 20:08.360
things from a historical perspective that I, that I find to be really interesting.

20:08.360 --> 20:14.360
The fact that, you know, he opens up the first Tower, the true Tower Records in 1960.

20:14.360 --> 20:19.360
He spends eight years kind of perfecting it, opening three stores in Sacramento and then

20:19.360 --> 20:26.360
on basically he goes into San Francisco to go sleep with some woman who works at his

20:26.360 --> 20:27.360
barbershop.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.360
Oh yeah, that story is so interesting.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.360
The story is incredible.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.360
It's incredible.

20:31.360 --> 20:35.360
And he totally glides over in the documentary, the fact that he's married with a kid.

20:35.360 --> 20:42.360
He doesn't mention that like at all, even though we have footage of him with his son

20:42.360 --> 20:47.360
talking about how his wife was the bookkeeper at the pharmacy.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.360
But anyway.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
I thought that was such a charming story.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.360
It is a charming story though.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.360
It is a charming story.

20:53.360 --> 20:58.360
He goes to San Francisco, has this great night with this lady and then wakes up super hung

20:58.360 --> 21:04.360
over and finds this location in San Francisco and decides he wants to open up a Tower Records.

21:04.360 --> 21:11.360
He opens up in March of 68 right before San Francisco is invaded by hundreds of thousands

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
of dirty hippies from all over the world.

21:13.360 --> 21:19.360
And that ends up being the summer love and it becomes the most popular store in all of San Francisco.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.360
Right.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.360
And so I found all of these little things like that supremely fascinating.

21:24.360 --> 21:30.360
And I think a lot of people who kind of know some of the history of that can like go into

21:30.360 --> 21:35.360
it thinking, oh, it's just going to be a documentary of dates and places in historical context and

21:35.360 --> 21:36.360
all that stuff.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.360
And oh, we miss vinyl.

21:38.360 --> 21:46.360
But really what the story is is about Russ and this group of, you know, people that worked

21:46.360 --> 21:52.360
at Tower that ended up working at this place for 30 plus years and really became like a

21:52.360 --> 21:54.360
family as cheesy as that may sound.

21:54.360 --> 22:01.360
They became a family and worked together and had a fucking blast going around the world

22:01.360 --> 22:03.360
working in the music business.

22:03.360 --> 22:09.360
And they get married, they get divorced, they have children, they have so much fun.

22:09.360 --> 22:13.360
And then at the end of it, they all have to fire each other.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.360
Yeah.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.360
That's crazy.

22:15.360 --> 22:19.360
It reminded me of like a documentary about Ireland.

22:19.360 --> 22:24.360
It was like that whole horrible like the Michael Collins era because it turns into...

22:24.360 --> 22:27.360
They had to do more than fire each other.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.360
Yeah.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.360
But I mean, it ends up becoming this other journey that I don't think many people think

22:31.360 --> 22:32.360
of.

22:32.360 --> 22:33.360
You know, we were talking about this earlier.

22:33.360 --> 22:39.360
You know, I think for a large group of people relatively our age, I'm looking...

22:39.360 --> 22:41.360
Yeah, I think we're all cool.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.360
I think for people relatively our age, you know, if they were even just a sort of like

22:46.360 --> 22:50.360
casual music fan, they would just think of Tower as the place that was everywhere and

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
sold overpriced CDs.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.360
Right.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.360
Yeah.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.360
You mentioned that backstage because that is part of the story is that all of a sudden

22:57.360 --> 23:03.360
Best Buy Target, everybody starts being able to sell CDs for $10 a CD, which is how much

23:03.360 --> 23:06.360
it costs to buy them and put them out on the shelf.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.360
And they're just like, we don't give a shit.

23:08.360 --> 23:12.360
If you buy your Britney Spears here, you'll buy more milk.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.360
And then the Tower Records across the street is like, we have to sell these for $20 or

23:16.360 --> 23:18.360
we're going to go out of business.

23:18.360 --> 23:24.360
And it's hard to even for me to wrap my head around and I'm sure therefore for these little

23:24.360 --> 23:27.360
little, little profligate fucks.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.360
I was going to say whippersnappers, but that works too.

23:31.360 --> 23:35.360
Is that before the internet, which I can barely remember now.

23:35.360 --> 23:39.360
And it was like, imagine you mentioned the hate Ashbury movement.

23:39.360 --> 23:44.360
So imagine like there's no internet, the newspaper is filled with lies.

23:44.360 --> 23:49.360
There is no, you know, short of smoke signals or like, you know, just hanging out in a drum

23:49.360 --> 23:50.360
circle or something.

23:50.360 --> 23:55.360
There's, there's not really a kind of, there's not really a hotbed of like kind of counter

23:55.360 --> 24:01.360
cultural or even just straight cultural like, like, like check-in points and to have these

24:01.360 --> 24:03.360
giant, these giant record stores keep going up.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.360
And that's why they ended up being 192 of them is because everywhere that they were, they

24:07.360 --> 24:09.360
were never in, they were never in our Wisconsin.

24:09.360 --> 24:14.360
They would never, they never, they made it to, they had like 35 of them in Japan before

24:14.360 --> 24:18.360
they had one in New York, but they never, and some, it almost has to do, it almost seems

24:18.360 --> 24:23.360
to have to do with that kind of cosmopolitan need at that time, because the same technology

24:23.360 --> 24:30.360
that ended up killing records in general would also supplant the need for, I don't know,

24:30.360 --> 24:34.360
the equivalent of barn raising among, among people who want to care about something other

24:34.360 --> 24:36.360
than what Nixon is telling them or something.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.360
No, totally.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.360
I mean, like, it was really, I found to be super best.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.360
I resent that sound.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.360
I just, you know, I think that.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.360
Guys, Nixon was a bad dude.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
I think we've established that.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
It's almost famous for it.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
It's almost famous for it.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.360
When you come in, we've got serious issues.

24:50.360 --> 24:57.360
No, like, the thing that I want to, I mean, there are a lot of things that I love about

24:57.360 --> 25:05.360
the overall story with Tower, but the thing that I found to be most insightful and also

25:05.360 --> 25:11.360
really inspiring was the fact that, you know, sure, it ended when there were 192 stores,

25:11.360 --> 25:14.360
and there are a lot of reasons why Tower ended.

25:14.360 --> 25:20.360
It's not just the, you know, Aaron Sorkin's simple answer of like, oh, Napster killed it.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.360
You know what I mean?

25:21.360 --> 25:22.360
It's not that at all.

25:22.360 --> 25:27.360
And we spend a large portion of the film actually really discussing what it was that actually

25:27.360 --> 25:28.360
killed Tower.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.360
Which I found fascinating not to interrupt you, but that is.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.360
Yeah, I mean, well, because that's the thing that I find really interesting because I always

25:34.360 --> 25:38.360
just assumed like everyone else like, oh, the internet came and it just changed everything.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.360
And no one could control it at all.

25:40.360 --> 25:45.360
However, as we all know, Apple, which made computers and phones, decided to become the

25:45.360 --> 25:46.360
music industry.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.360
Yeah.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.360
They made that decision and Tower at the time had a website and it's revealed at one point

25:50.360 --> 25:51.360
at that exact moment.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.360
Yeah.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.360
Their website was on AOL.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.360
Yeah.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.360
And it was like this little like Rinky Dink website.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.360
And it was just like, they could only be so progressive for so long.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.360
Exactly.

26:00.360 --> 26:04.360
You know, you can go, you can go from LPs to CDs, but you can't then also be have, you

26:04.360 --> 26:06.360
can't keep juggling those chainsaws.

26:06.360 --> 26:10.360
So, and there's so much new technology that ends up sort of coming up.

26:10.360 --> 26:16.360
And Tower was one of these places where they really prided themselves on trying.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.360
It was not a company that was run from the top down.

26:19.360 --> 26:24.360
It wasn't some, it wasn't Russ Solomon saying, here is how you do this stuff.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.360
Go make me rich.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.360
It was, here's the keys to the store.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.360
Stock what you want.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.360
Stock what you think people are going to like.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.360
Hide the coke when the cops come by.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.360
Yeah, decorate it however you want.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.360
Just don't show up drunk or high.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.360
And if you do, then go home and don't fuck me over.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.360
And that was how the company ran.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.360
And it worked for 30 years.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.360
Yeah.

26:47.360 --> 26:52.360
And it was, yeah, it's like a sort of model of the, the, the, the souls in that movie

26:52.360 --> 26:56.360
who more than one of them does that awesome documentary thing, which is what I go to

26:56.360 --> 27:00.360
documentaries for where they, they, they're talking about something that seems innocuous

27:00.360 --> 27:04.360
and then their throat catches because they've been there.

27:04.360 --> 27:10.360
Those souls are, they, they, they're couching it as a cautionary tale.

27:10.360 --> 27:14.360
Oh, we put ourselves out of business by not seeing MP3 coming or something like that.

27:14.360 --> 27:20.360
The, but the real story is that it was a, it was an actual successful demonstration

27:20.360 --> 27:22.360
of really non-corporate.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.360
Yeah.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.360
Anarchic.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.360
Yeah.

27:25.360 --> 27:30.360
A small business turned to take into a global level.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.360
Yeah.

27:31.360 --> 27:35.360
With God knows how many employees, including their newsletter and all this stuff.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.360
It was like they never, they had one accountant practically the entire time.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.360
Yeah.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.360
And they didn't need to, there is no, there's no necessary need to all of a sudden like

27:43.360 --> 27:48.360
take your stock public and start being beholden to a bunch of things and, and mutual funds

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
and get company booby-doo.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.360
It was like, it was like, it was just a bunch of people that couldn't get jobs anywhere else.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.360
And they liked selling records.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.360
And, and they kept growing and growing and growing that way.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
And they just kept, they just kept going.

28:00.360 --> 28:05.360
And they would go to, they would just constantly always be in that right place at the right

28:05.360 --> 28:06.360
time.

28:06.360 --> 28:12.360
And as much as they would have the big stores in the, you know, like Los Angeles, San Francisco,

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
eventually New York.

28:13.360 --> 28:17.360
And then you'd get into the Chicago's, the New Orleans and stuff like that.

28:17.360 --> 28:24.360
They would also have small stores in Stockton and sort of those off the beat sort of, you

28:24.360 --> 28:29.360
know, off the beaten path type places where not a lot was going on culturally or, you

28:29.360 --> 28:34.360
know, the places where, you know, the bigger bands would not stop to play.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.360
Do you know what I mean?

28:35.360 --> 28:42.360
And so they had, they really had a mentality, which was we want to be that place wherever

28:42.360 --> 28:45.360
we are, where it doesn't matter what you look like.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.360
It doesn't matter what you're into.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.360
You can come in, you can hang out, and it doesn't even matter if you have money.

28:51.360 --> 28:57.360
We will not bother you unless you want to be bothered, unless you piss us off.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.360
And you can hang out for as long as you want.

29:00.360 --> 29:04.360
And if you don't leave with, you know, a record, that's fine.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.360
You know, maybe you'll come back and then the next time you'll buy something.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.360
And then maybe when you buy something, maybe you'll be open to hearing some of our suggestions

29:11.360 --> 29:13.360
and then you'll leave with, you know, 14 different records.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.360
Yeah, one thing I thought was interesting about that, by the way, was that I never

29:17.360 --> 29:26.360
knew was the album culture plus the CD culture became, you can't be experimental

29:26.360 --> 29:28.360
about your music consuming anymore.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.360
Yeah.

29:29.360 --> 29:34.360
When you could just pay $3 for a piece of, you know, black plastic that was like,

29:34.360 --> 29:38.360
it was like you could, you were more incentivized to kind of leave there with a big box full

29:38.360 --> 29:39.360
of stuff.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.360
Totally.

29:40.360 --> 29:44.360
Because when you go to the library, it might have been like shit you might never listen

29:44.360 --> 29:48.360
to, but then you do listen to it and you're like, now I'm into Aretha Franklin or something.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.360
And then that turns into holy shit.

29:50.360 --> 29:54.360
I only have so much allowance and Britney Spears doesn't have any singles out on CD.

29:54.360 --> 29:58.360
Well, and that ended up being the most fascinating nugget.

29:58.360 --> 30:03.360
When I asked Russ, I said, if you had to like blame everything on something else besides

30:03.360 --> 30:08.360
what, what you did, I said, what would be, you know, what would it be?

30:08.360 --> 30:11.360
Napster, would it be, you know, poor management?

30:11.360 --> 30:13.360
Like, what, what would it be?

30:13.360 --> 30:19.360
And he actually said the biggest, the, the, in his opinion, the biggest mistake was they

30:19.360 --> 30:20.360
stopped selling singles.

30:20.360 --> 30:24.360
Now, if you think about this, and I don't want to get too boring here, but, you know,

30:24.360 --> 30:27.360
do you, anyone here remember buying cassette singles?

30:27.360 --> 30:28.360
Yes.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.360
Yes.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.360
Okay.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.360
Right.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
That's how you started your addiction to buying music.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.360
Whether you know it or not, that's how it started.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.360
Just that small little hit first and then next thing you know, you're going into that

30:39.360 --> 30:45.360
store and you're buying maybe more singles or maybe you're buying the full albums that

30:45.360 --> 30:49.360
you know, eventually at some point it's the full cassette, full CDs, whatever.

30:49.360 --> 30:54.360
Once they stopped selling singles, they lost an entire generation of kids.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.360
And I know this because I'm that age.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
I was that age.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.360
I remember when they stopped selling CDs.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.360
But you weren't choosing between going to Tower Records and downloading an MP3.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.360
No, but here's the thing.

31:04.360 --> 31:10.360
I remember when they stopped selling singles, but at that point I was like, I love music

31:10.360 --> 31:11.360
so much.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.360
I'll buy CDs.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.360
I'll still do it.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
You just couldn't buy as many.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.360
I just couldn't buy as many, but I'll still do it.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.360
And you had to be very careful about your choices.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.360
Exactly.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.360
So you're going to flatten out.

31:20.360 --> 31:25.360
But you're going to lose an entire generation of kids even going into a store.

31:25.360 --> 31:30.360
And once you do that, you lose an entire generation of future customers.

31:30.360 --> 31:35.360
That generation of kids all were in college when Napster was released.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
Yeah.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.360
They had no loyalty to anything.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.360
They had no loyalty anyways.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.360
And I think they're being too hard on themselves.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.360
Honestly, I don't think if they had sold singles, I don't think they could have competed with

31:43.360 --> 31:44.360
Napster.

31:44.360 --> 31:50.360
But it's easier to compete, you know, a small single that costs, I don't know, maybe a

31:50.360 --> 31:54.360
buck, two bucks, that's easier to compete with than completely free.

31:54.360 --> 31:57.360
Logically, technically, it's there.

31:57.360 --> 32:04.360
I also think that, obviously, without the actual, like, I cannot put on pants, they would

32:04.360 --> 32:09.360
have had to have a Netflix visionary idea in addition to already having a visionary

32:09.360 --> 32:10.360
idea of being Tower Records.

32:10.360 --> 32:15.360
I feel like it's a beautiful bell curve, this beautiful trajectory of like, you know, all

32:15.360 --> 32:16.360
things have to come to an end.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.360
I mean, like, you don't want this thing to become Disney or anything.

32:19.360 --> 32:24.360
It's this beautiful bell curve that lasts an entire generation and traces the evolution

32:24.360 --> 32:25.360
of music.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.360
And it is a bummer.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.360
And in the end, the sad, it's like, well, this is how it ends.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.360
It never ends really great.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.360
It's not like a sort of like green, like euthanasia chamber.

32:36.360 --> 32:42.360
It's like the jaws of capitalism and the loans being defaulted and the people being brought

32:42.360 --> 32:44.360
in and having to fire each other and all that stuff.

32:44.360 --> 32:51.360
But let's bring things to a positive note because, oh, but there is one more reason to

32:51.360 --> 32:54.360
watch this movie if you get a chance to see it.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.360
It's out on Friday.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.360
I should mention.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.360
Yeah.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.360
Because I'm realizing we're talking about a movie that we've seen.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.360
None of you have seen this.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.360
Right.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.360
Oh, yeah.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.360
It's coming out.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.360
So you can't see it on Friday.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.360
No.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.360
This podcast is big business.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.360
You'll be playing at the Arclight in L.A. in the Villagey Cinema.

33:08.360 --> 33:09.360
There's a guy in the movie.

33:09.360 --> 33:13.360
You have to watch it alone for the most amazing mustache I've ever seen.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.360
Yes.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.360
Mark Vidditsich.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.360
Mark Vidditsich, yeah.

33:17.360 --> 33:21.360
In normal time, because they're all like old and talking about the memories of it, he's

33:21.360 --> 33:25.360
got a regular Sam Elliott, nothing regular about a Sam Elliott mustache, but he's like,

33:25.360 --> 33:26.360
it's special.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.360
Okay, it's big.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.360
It's a brush, whatever.

33:28.360 --> 33:33.360
But then you see him in photographs and it's like, I've never seen a mustache like this.

33:33.360 --> 33:43.480
It looks to me, if you just told somebody, yeah, somebody took a duct tape with strip

33:43.480 --> 33:47.360
of hair and put it right over his mouth like a hostage.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.360
Yeah.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.360
That's what his mustache looks like.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.860
It just doesn't look, it looks like something happened, like something flew across a room

33:53.860 --> 33:54.860
and splattered.

33:54.860 --> 33:59.440
I'm so glad that you've picked up on Vidditsich's mustache because we've taken this movie out

33:59.440 --> 34:03.480
to a bunch of different film festivals and we always get, you know, you get super nervous

34:03.480 --> 34:06.360
like, it's funny.

34:06.360 --> 34:12.080
I've sat through horrible, shitty things that I've acted in and been totally fine.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.080
Like no problem.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.920
I don't care how like it plays, it's just sort of like, ah, whatever.

34:15.920 --> 34:21.800
But when it's your movie that you've like fucking like put everything into all of a sudden,

34:21.800 --> 34:27.480
every noise that you hear while the movie is screening is of the utmost importance.

34:27.480 --> 34:32.560
And we have these like little moments in the film where I can tell if an audience is with

34:32.560 --> 34:35.200
us or if they're just not.

34:35.200 --> 34:40.800
And luckily that mustache is the fucking, like that's the dividing line.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.320
It really looks like, you know what it looks exactly like to me?

34:43.320 --> 34:49.440
This mustache in the photographs, being from the Midwest, like the Euro restaurants there

34:49.440 --> 34:55.320
are, I miss them because it's like, they had the rotisserie and you just carve off the

34:55.320 --> 34:59.080
big greasy strips of jagged lamb meat.

34:59.080 --> 35:07.040
Just giant long ruler length strips of serrated edge lamb meat and just lamb and a pita and

35:07.040 --> 35:12.920
like, if I don't ask for anything else, just do that and I'm just angry at myself.

35:12.920 --> 35:13.920
Just that.

35:13.920 --> 35:18.240
It looks like a piece of Euro meat, like was on a ceiling fan after a party and he came

35:18.240 --> 35:23.120
in and was like, hey guys, I have a good idea about a record industry, and I just went and

35:23.120 --> 35:26.440
just like went over his lips though, like centered on his lips.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.440
That's the weird thing about his mustache is it looks like he's like a weird part of

35:29.440 --> 35:33.000
a weird freedom of speech like demonstration.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.840
But what's, but you got to understand that we specifically cut it this way because we

35:37.840 --> 35:43.280
have this old photo of him and you see this old photo and it's basically you just hear

35:43.280 --> 35:48.000
his voice saying like, oh, well, I, you know, I basically described me the first time he

35:48.000 --> 35:51.960
walked into Tower Records and got a job and we see have this old black and white photo

35:51.960 --> 35:57.080
and everyone starts chuckling at the mustache like everywhere.

35:57.080 --> 36:03.560
Like I've heard people go like, oh wow, it's an audible thing, like not just a gas but

36:03.560 --> 36:10.480
like words as well, like, oh Jesus, not as detailed as lamb off of a fucking Euro placed

36:10.480 --> 36:14.480
on a pedo with hummus and the whole thing, but close to it.

36:14.480 --> 36:21.600
And then the next shot is him today, and he still has the fucking mustache and then people

36:21.600 --> 36:22.600
lose their shit.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.600
They go, he still has it.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.600
Oh my God.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.840
Well, he kind of refined it though, because back then it was like, oh, someone ran over

36:28.840 --> 36:36.080
a centipede in like, I don't know why it ended up on your mouth, like why on the center

36:36.080 --> 36:37.080
of your lips?

36:37.080 --> 36:42.000
Like he clearly like, he clearly sensed those days had children or wives that said like,

36:42.000 --> 36:52.080
you got to clear out an area, it's a way I recognize people is two dots and a slit.

36:52.080 --> 36:58.440
Steven Spielberg definition, like they just hit the gray alien triangulation, two dots

36:58.440 --> 37:00.920
and a slit or it's not a person.

37:00.920 --> 37:04.440
And you got two dots and a fucking like just Euro.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.440
Yeah.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
Anyways, all right.

37:06.440 --> 37:12.320
So you'll see, you'll see, and when you go, please promise me when you see that photo,

37:12.320 --> 37:17.000
go, oh, when you see the black and white photo, and then when you see that live, if someone

37:17.000 --> 37:22.880
could just go, oh shit, just for my own personal, I would love it if someone did that.

37:22.880 --> 37:27.880
Truly worth the price of admission, honestly, to see the mustache, like you'll love it.

37:27.880 --> 37:32.280
See, I'm going to bring out, I'd like you to stay up here because we haven't talked

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
about Fargo.

37:33.280 --> 37:45.160
I know you also, you have this diversion of, now that we've fed your PR furnace, I haven't

37:45.160 --> 37:48.000
seen Fargo, but I'd love to hear about it.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.800
But before we do, I'd like you to meet my neighbors.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
So plump.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.600
I'm going to sit over here, right?

37:56.600 --> 38:01.040
No, no, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

38:01.040 --> 38:02.040
show style.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
Okay, cool.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.040
That's great.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.040
Thank you, Colin.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.040
That's very classy of you.

38:06.040 --> 38:12.040
All right, there you go.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.040
By the way, no relation.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
None.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.040
No.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.040
Okay.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.040
Shit.

38:18.040 --> 38:23.920
I thought I'd get a bigger laugh, I guess.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.600
Sometimes your voice, it's like, wow.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
No, I don't.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.200
We're talking about Michael Keaton, right?

38:29.200 --> 38:30.200
Yeah, yeah.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.200
All right, cool.

38:31.200 --> 38:41.360
The, now I feel bad of his, I'm sorry, it was like, he said it.

38:41.360 --> 38:47.160
My next two guests, if you're a hardcore Armenian, you know-

38:47.160 --> 38:48.680
Is that what they're called now, Armenians?

38:48.680 --> 38:53.120
Yeah, well, because it's LA-based, so we want to respect the Armenian culture here.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
Yeah, of course.

38:54.120 --> 39:04.960
And, you know, you've met my neighbors before, I called Beth, the tumor lady, I had a conversation

39:04.960 --> 39:09.320
with her and found out she had survived a golf ball size tumor and that she was fine

39:09.320 --> 39:16.040
now and I'm endlessly fascinated with this shit because I'm morbidly terrified and she

39:16.040 --> 39:19.840
and her husband came up and her husband didn't say a word even though he's got interesting

39:19.840 --> 39:20.840
things about him.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.600
But tonight is not the night for them to have interesting things.

39:23.600 --> 39:33.440
It is a night for me to plumb the depths of their, to me, completely baffling obsession

39:33.440 --> 39:40.000
with four trees in their backyard.

39:40.000 --> 39:47.520
So we're just going to talk about it, we're neighbors, they've been texting me, Beth has

39:47.520 --> 39:55.960
been texting me for a long time about her trees and she's going to come out and we're

39:55.960 --> 40:00.600
going to talk about her fucking trees.

40:00.600 --> 40:14.360
Please welcome Beth Bootson and Dan Bootson.

40:14.360 --> 40:21.080
All right, so one day, one day, Dan, we will have on the show just to talk about the really

40:21.080 --> 40:28.080
interesting thing of like, you know, there's no LA heritage, there's no such thing except

40:28.080 --> 40:34.360
Dan's dad was this guy named Gypsy Boots who you can look up on Wikipedia, he was like

40:34.360 --> 40:40.880
the founding father of the health craze, like the idea of health food, the idea of like

40:40.880 --> 40:49.320
yoga and all this stuff, like being hip, being like married to the people that we think

40:49.320 --> 40:50.320
are cool.

40:50.320 --> 40:54.720
There was this guy Gypsy Boots running around and that's Dan's dad who now lives next door

40:54.720 --> 40:58.160
to me, which I think is like, you know, those stories don't happen in New York, you don't

40:58.160 --> 41:03.840
live next to the guy that, you know, you probably live next to a fisherman or a plumber.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.400
It's New York, they do stuff there.

41:06.400 --> 41:12.280
Here in LA, you might, you live next to like, who knows, it's like, oh, my dad was a famous

41:12.280 --> 41:13.280
hippie.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.280
All right, I didn't sell that very well.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.840
Guys, they fish and plum in New York, they don't do that here.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.840
Continue.

41:20.840 --> 41:26.560
All right, so Beth, all right, so it's been, it's been a long time, we've been exchanging

41:26.560 --> 41:28.720
text about your trees.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.600
All right, so where do you want to start?

41:32.600 --> 41:36.560
Because among the things, I would say, I was suggesting that we just read our texts.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.280
Yes, so let's just start from the beginning.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.240
Do you want to just start by doing the dialogue or the texts?

41:42.240 --> 41:43.240
Maybe so.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.240
Okay, that's good.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.320
It's like the love letters play?

41:46.320 --> 41:48.920
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like love letters.

41:48.920 --> 41:53.920
The, I guess there's a little bit of preamble where we just say like, well...

41:53.920 --> 41:57.280
Well, let me just tell you this.

41:57.280 --> 42:07.920
In our house, outside in the back, we have a little courtyard and we have the most beautiful,

42:07.920 --> 42:16.480
or we had the most beautiful seven, it looks like seven-story, 100-year-old eucalyptus

42:16.480 --> 42:17.480
trees.

42:17.480 --> 42:26.280
And these things provided a wall of privacy from our neighbor and they had a beautiful

42:26.280 --> 42:35.760
canopy where we hung Moroccan lanterns from and we would have great barbecues out there,

42:35.760 --> 42:38.800
which you came to our house for a wine.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.800
Yeah.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.800
Once.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.800
Did you have lamb?

42:41.800 --> 42:43.360
And then I came on my show and said, I met this tumor lady.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.360
No lamb.

42:44.360 --> 42:45.360
No lamb.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.280
But I swear to God, this is more about me.

42:47.280 --> 42:51.760
This is about me, not about you.

42:51.760 --> 42:55.000
I never noticed or cared about the trees.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
That's true.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Apparently they existed.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Apparently they're gone.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Yeah.

42:59.000 --> 43:06.320
So that's my context of this, like, well, first of all, I mean, so if it starts with,

43:06.320 --> 43:11.880
you're calling me and I was a little, like, I was at Beth Boots and I'm like, oh, it's

43:11.880 --> 43:14.040
my neighbor and I'm not picking up the phone.

43:14.040 --> 43:15.280
And he was always in the middle of something.

43:15.280 --> 43:20.320
Then voicemails and saying, like, Dan, you were inexplicably kind of cryptic about it.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.840
Like, Dan, I have to talk to you about something.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.840
I have something important to tell you.

43:22.840 --> 43:23.840
Yeah.

43:23.840 --> 43:28.360
I was like, I don't know why you'd bury that lead, but you're going to tell, and then you're

43:28.360 --> 43:30.720
sending me texts and saying, like, did you get my voicemail?

43:30.720 --> 43:31.720
I got to talk to you about something.

43:31.720 --> 43:36.400
And I keep, I'm in the middle of, you know, as it turns out, a divorce, but it's like,

43:36.400 --> 43:42.400
and I got a studio, I'm trying to keep above water and I'm like, ah, it's neighbors, okay.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.160
But I always am thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, oh, shit, like, there must

43:45.160 --> 43:50.760
be something like, maybe my sewage is coming up into their sink or something, could it be?

43:50.760 --> 43:54.920
And so I'm walking and then I see Dan, he's walking his dogs and your dogs, yes.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.560
So I was walking and I had to, of course, introduce myself again every time we meet.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.560
I had face blindness.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
Fine.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.560
I have to.

44:01.560 --> 44:04.080
We walked him out with earphones.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.080
Earphones.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.080
Did you walk anybody?

44:06.080 --> 44:08.560
I was going on my chiropractor and I was listening to my podcast.

44:08.560 --> 44:13.040
And I said, I said, Dan, you know, my, my wife's been trying to reach you and said, yes,

44:13.040 --> 44:14.040
I know.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.040
Oh my God.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.040
Oh God, what happened?

44:16.040 --> 44:17.040
What happened?

44:17.040 --> 44:18.040
Did the tumor come back?

44:18.040 --> 44:19.040
What happened?

44:19.040 --> 44:20.040
And I said, ah, right, is it a tumor?

44:20.040 --> 44:22.880
Well, really, it's going to be, it's very upsetting.

44:22.880 --> 44:28.640
I said, it's the eucalyptus trees are rotten and they're going to have to be removed.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.320
And the first thing Dan said was, are they on my property?

44:31.320 --> 44:38.320
I mean, could, yeah, had I been a little quicker, I, of course, would have said, why

44:38.320 --> 44:39.320
yes.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.320
They are.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.320
You could have tricked me into paying for the operation, $25,000.

44:42.320 --> 44:46.800
Because I know, yeah, I was like, well, so, so then, well, then I said, well, no, no,

44:46.800 --> 44:50.480
they're ours, but they're, it's really sad and they're going to have to take them all

44:50.480 --> 44:51.480
out and dance.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.980
Well, they're just trees.

44:52.980 --> 44:56.960
But that's, that's, I want, I don't want you to gloss over what I consider the moral

44:56.960 --> 44:58.440
of this story.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.240
They're just trees.

45:00.240 --> 45:05.680
To me, to me, that's, to me, I want, I just want that to always be in the background.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.960
There's beautiful trees, beautiful trees.

45:08.960 --> 45:09.960
They're just, they're just trees.

45:09.960 --> 45:15.680
And I, so I keep being, so, so, so, just, just, just all those voicemails and then the conversation

45:15.680 --> 45:18.840
with Dan, and I'm like, oh fuck, Jesus Christ, it was actually a little file in the back

45:18.840 --> 45:22.080
of my head, not that I did anything about it, but I was like, oh God, there's a crisis.

45:22.080 --> 45:23.240
I'm being, I'm being a bad neighbor.

45:23.240 --> 45:27.080
And I'm like, fucking trees, what, okay.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.880
I was actually charmed because it seemed like your concerns that you were going to wake

45:29.880 --> 45:31.800
me up with like chainsaws and things.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.680
So, so, and I'm like, oh God, tell her not to, no, no, I don't care, I don't.

45:34.680 --> 45:43.040
And by the way, I sent this, this letter out to all the neighbors on that app, next door,

45:43.040 --> 45:49.600
app, because I didn't want anybody being furious with me when all these old 100 year old trees

45:49.600 --> 45:54.760
are, oh, oh, oh, oh, you gotta eat the, eat them like, I didn't want people being furious

45:54.760 --> 45:59.640
with me cutting these 100 year old trees down, four of them.

45:59.640 --> 46:04.800
And they were the, like, if you drive down the block, you just, you could see them from

46:04.800 --> 46:05.800
far, far away.

46:05.800 --> 46:12.120
I want to say, I want to say, Dan, everyone, everyone else, everyone else is upset, all

46:12.120 --> 46:13.120
right.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.120
So, okay.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.040
Well, you know, their medals are all in the mail.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.480
You were the exception to the rule.

46:18.480 --> 46:19.480
This is, this is what it is.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.480
I know it's about me.

46:20.480 --> 46:23.200
I'm like, I just don't, I feel like I'm living in a twilight zone because I'm like, I don't

46:23.200 --> 46:24.920
understand what's happening.

46:24.920 --> 46:29.480
So, so, so September 21st, 442 p.m.

46:29.480 --> 46:33.520
Now do you want to, it occurs to me, do you want to read your part or should I read your

46:33.520 --> 46:34.520
part?

46:34.520 --> 46:35.520
Whatever you want to read.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.520
Whatever you want to read.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.520
Oh, you read your part.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.520
Yeah.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.520
You read my part.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.520
Yeah, I'll read your part.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.520
And you read my part.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.520
Okay.

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
Okay.

46:43.520 --> 46:44.520
Okay.

46:44.520 --> 46:58.120
It is with, and you just said, like you said this to everybody, but I don't know, I think

46:58.120 --> 47:02.480
I'm just getting this as a, oh by the way, oh God, there's another, there's another

47:02.480 --> 47:06.240
important point that I don't know to bring up now or later, that Erin McGathy is on

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
all of these.

47:07.240 --> 47:10.720
It's just, this is a message to me and my wife who, who were struggling to keep our

47:10.720 --> 47:11.720
marriage together.

47:11.720 --> 47:16.720
And Beth, Aaron is, Aaron is, is she included in it?

47:16.720 --> 47:17.720
Yes.

47:17.720 --> 47:18.720
Yes.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.720
I thought they were still married.

47:19.720 --> 47:20.720
No, no.

47:20.720 --> 47:21.720
Well, yes, you can.

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
There's only one line at the end.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.720
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron nails it at the end.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.720
Can I read that part, please?

47:26.720 --> 47:27.720
Yes.

47:27.720 --> 47:28.720
Or hand it over.

47:28.720 --> 47:29.720
Yeah.

47:29.720 --> 47:30.720
Oh, I'm so glad.

47:30.720 --> 47:31.720
Oh, I know.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.720
I'll hand it over.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.440
But I do want you guys to be prepared for the fact that when I say at the end, I mean

47:34.440 --> 47:40.680
like at the end of roots, the miniseries, like the whole point is that this is to me

47:40.680 --> 47:45.680
and here's the thing is I knew Aaron would be, I knew Aaron would be interested in this.

47:45.680 --> 47:46.680
You were so wrong.

47:46.680 --> 47:49.680
I knew you might not, but I knew Aaron would.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.680
Okay.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.680
So I absolutely had to send it to her.

47:52.680 --> 47:53.680
I wish she was here right now.

47:53.680 --> 47:54.680
I thought you guys were still married.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.680
Oh, she's still here right now.

47:56.680 --> 48:00.680
I will channel her and his one line at the very end.

48:00.680 --> 48:01.680
Very good.

48:01.680 --> 48:02.680
We're going to need you.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
All right.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.680
So here we go.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.680
Here's the, I mean.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.680
Beth.

48:06.680 --> 48:15.000
It is with much sadness that I write this, but our four 100 year old Eucalyptus trees

48:15.000 --> 48:16.520
will have to be removed.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.960
This is after so many voice messages and conversations about it.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.680
It was like, this is news to nobody.

48:22.680 --> 48:26.560
It never was.

48:26.560 --> 48:33.680
It's been confirmed by a well respected arborist.

48:33.680 --> 48:39.680
That although the trees look healthy and are, believe me, but I end up being the bad guy.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.680
So it's okay to laugh because she's beautiful.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.680
She's caring about trees.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.680
Like I ended up being the villain or I wouldn't be taking you through this.

48:46.680 --> 48:50.680
It's been confirmed by a well respected arborist that although the trees look healthy and

48:50.680 --> 48:54.680
are thriving on the outside, that they are full of decay in the trunk and roots and are

48:54.680 --> 48:59.680
not expected to withstand a winter of rain and winds, the tree trimmers will begin their

48:59.680 --> 49:02.680
tree cutting at seven a.m. on Tuesday.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.680
New paragraph.

49:03.680 --> 49:11.680
Trees are located at the end of the cul-de-sac on address withheld for stalker purposes,

49:11.680 --> 49:13.680
but everybody knows where I live.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.680
Your neighbors, the Bootsons.

49:15.680 --> 49:22.680
And then Dan Harmon wrote back and he goes, sad to hear about these majestic trees, but

49:22.680 --> 49:27.680
I do feel you and your family will enjoy a fresh, unobstructed view of my trademark nude

49:27.680 --> 49:34.680
sunbathing.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.680
Something to talk about to all the other neighbors.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.680
If I can get a picture, think of all the money I can make.

49:41.680 --> 49:46.680
Make sure you are in a good area and expose all so I can make a lot of money.

49:46.680 --> 49:49.680
And then the weird thing is you left an emoticon.

49:49.680 --> 49:54.680
The emoticon is a yellow face going.

49:54.680 --> 49:59.680
But it's like, wait, that should be my emoticon.

49:59.680 --> 50:05.680
So, okay, so then it's a day later, I think, September 24th, maybe three days later.

50:05.680 --> 50:10.680
A photo of our strong, healthy-looking trees that our arborist said would never survive

50:10.680 --> 50:11.680
El Niño.

50:11.680 --> 50:15.680
And there's this thing that's like, she keeps sending these pictures.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.680
It's the same picture.

50:17.680 --> 50:20.680
Well, Dan is going to show, we actually brought.

50:20.680 --> 50:25.680
Yeah, well, right.

50:25.680 --> 50:29.680
It was completely soft inside.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.680
Okay, so I am in the minority.

50:32.680 --> 50:36.680
And on the outside, it was so green and thriving.

50:36.680 --> 50:38.680
I mean, just, it was so lush.

50:38.680 --> 50:40.680
Who's life didn't we save?

50:40.680 --> 50:42.680
It's a hollow tree.

50:42.680 --> 50:45.680
That would come down on your house.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.680
And my house.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.680
But she keeps sending.

50:50.680 --> 50:51.680
It smells.

50:51.680 --> 50:55.680
You can live, this has always been my favorite flavored tree.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.680
Can you see the scroll of the pictures?

50:58.680 --> 51:01.680
Because she just keeps sending the same picture.

51:01.680 --> 51:02.680
You know why?

51:02.680 --> 51:05.680
I did that because I wasn't trying to make a point.

51:05.680 --> 51:08.680
I did that because I was in a place where the message wouldn't go through.

51:08.680 --> 51:10.680
So I was like, what's up?

51:10.680 --> 51:11.680
So I kept sending it.

51:11.680 --> 51:15.680
And then after that picture, like nine times, there's a picture of a human hand

51:15.680 --> 51:17.680
and I guess what is a tree trunk.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.680
And then there's like a close-up of just looks like Afghanistan.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.680
I don't know what that is.

51:22.680 --> 51:25.680
And then there's just pictures of trees, normal healthy looking trees,

51:25.680 --> 51:26.680
which I don't know.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.680
I was like, wait, are we past that part of the story?

51:28.680 --> 51:31.680
There's like all total, there's 7,000 pictures.

51:31.680 --> 51:34.680
And they keep coming in over and over again.

51:34.680 --> 51:36.680
So then after all of that,

51:36.680 --> 51:40.680
so then you say those photos did not go in the right order.

51:40.680 --> 51:44.680
Plus it wouldn't send the photo of the stump with the lovely hole in it.

51:44.680 --> 51:45.680
Yes it did.

51:45.680 --> 51:47.680
Nine hundred times.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.680
So I kept trying to send it.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.680
That's why you have a hundred of the same photos.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.680
So you knew.

51:54.680 --> 51:57.680
That's also what happens when your battery is at 2%.

51:57.680 --> 51:59.680
I don't know.

51:59.680 --> 52:02.680
You should see the view we have from our window now.

52:02.680 --> 52:04.680
It makes me want to cry.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.680
Oh, here's a line from Aaron.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.680
Oh.

52:09.680 --> 52:15.680
That was nice.

52:15.680 --> 52:28.680
I know you're doing that because you want it to be over,

52:28.680 --> 52:30.680
but I actually was mistaken.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.680
Aaron's big line comes later.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.680
Oh no.

52:35.680 --> 52:40.680
No, it's becoming Othello.

52:40.680 --> 52:45.680
So then Beth in response to Aaron's awe says,

52:45.680 --> 52:48.680
is that the best you can do?

52:48.680 --> 52:50.680
I thought I was talking to you.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.680
Oh, that's right.

52:52.680 --> 52:55.680
In her phone she can't tell when Aaron's talking when I'm talking.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.680
Also she's kidding.

52:57.680 --> 53:00.680
But how about an apology?

53:00.680 --> 53:03.680
And then Aaron says,

53:03.680 --> 53:06.680
oh, sorry.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.680
I thought I was talking to you the whole time.

53:08.680 --> 53:13.680
Then Beth sends an emoticon of a yellow person drying their eyes

53:13.680 --> 53:15.680
with a handkerchief.

53:15.680 --> 53:23.680
Then sends the same fucking circle.

53:23.680 --> 53:27.680
Is your battery at 4% now?

53:27.680 --> 53:30.680
So then, and then it says,

53:30.680 --> 53:35.680
hey, good news, we can wave to each other whenever we see each other now,

53:35.680 --> 53:37.680
which will be every five minutes.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.680
We'll look up to your window and you look down at ours.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.680
Exciting. The rainbow.

53:42.680 --> 53:47.680
Completely becoming conscious of the fact that I haven't responded to you in a while.

53:47.680 --> 53:50.680
Having learned to make animated GIFs,

53:50.680 --> 53:56.680
I send my standard GIF of me lowering my glasses to my nose

53:56.680 --> 53:58.680
and I just put the meme caption.

53:58.680 --> 54:03.680
And I call an unhealthy eucalyptus tree.

54:03.680 --> 54:05.680
Because I don't know what to do anymore.

54:05.680 --> 54:09.680
I don't know what to do.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.680
And then Beth says, more drawn curtains now.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.680
And then LOL.

54:14.680 --> 54:20.680
And then later says, still laughing out loud.

54:20.680 --> 54:23.680
Then you send a photo.

54:23.680 --> 54:25.680
There's something written on a board.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.680
More photos.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.680
There's a photo of the guys who were cutting down the tree.

54:29.680 --> 54:32.680
Another of the same photo of the arm in the stump.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.680
Then there's a new photo of a tree stump

54:35.680 --> 54:37.680
and this one has a pencil jammed into it.

54:37.680 --> 54:40.680
And ask to show how soft the core is.

54:40.680 --> 54:42.680
You have to post all of this.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.680
You have to post all of this.

54:44.680 --> 54:46.680
They were all like that.

54:46.680 --> 54:48.680
Then again, same photo as far as I'm concerned.

54:48.680 --> 54:54.680
So then you said, I want you to notice the photo with the pencil in it.

54:54.680 --> 54:58.680
That's all soft center that can be pushed in with just a finger.

54:58.680 --> 55:01.680
All of the trees, although hard on the top,

55:01.680 --> 55:04.680
have been rotten in the lower trunk.

55:04.680 --> 55:07.680
Does that other eucalyptus tree belong to you?

55:07.680 --> 55:08.680
He's got one on his property.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.680
He's got one on his property.

55:11.680 --> 55:14.680
I'm sure it's fine, but some of the neighbors are starting to inquire

55:14.680 --> 55:18.680
about the other eucalyptus trees.

55:18.680 --> 55:21.680
I can give you the number to our arborist.

55:21.680 --> 55:25.680
She might very well give your tree an A plus.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.680
But I don't think that's what you're thinking.

55:28.680 --> 55:32.680
We had mushrooms growing on the bottom of one of our trees.

55:32.680 --> 55:35.680
We also had holes in our tree that she could put a stick into

55:35.680 --> 55:38.680
to see how deeply that stick would go in.

55:38.680 --> 55:41.680
That indicated decay inside.

55:41.680 --> 55:45.680
If nothing else, it might give you peace of mind.

55:45.680 --> 55:50.680
It'll give all the neighbors peace of mind too.

55:50.680 --> 55:54.680
And then Dan Harmon wrote back,

55:54.680 --> 55:56.680
I don't want to high road you,

55:56.680 --> 56:00.680
but my peace of mind is a lot fucking harder to come by than that, Bootson.

56:00.680 --> 56:10.680
By the way, going through a divorce like this whole time,

56:10.680 --> 56:13.680
like so angry and drunk the whole time.

56:13.680 --> 56:17.680
We never sober when I'm texting you.

56:17.680 --> 56:22.680
And Beth goes, okay, what can I do to help?

56:22.680 --> 56:27.680
I have a feeling that you will never have peace of mind.

56:27.680 --> 56:29.680
I think you're doing fine.

56:29.680 --> 56:32.680
I guess part of what gives me struggle is the quest for independence

56:32.680 --> 56:35.680
in a world defined by loneliness.

56:35.680 --> 56:39.680
In a lot of ways, I guess I'm like a giant eucalyptus tree

56:39.680 --> 56:44.680
rotting from the inside.

56:44.680 --> 56:53.680
They love it, they love it.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.680
Aw!

56:55.680 --> 56:58.680
You identify.

56:58.680 --> 57:05.680
Is that why you wanted to hold on to your eucalyptus tree?

57:05.680 --> 57:07.680
Well, I don't.

57:07.680 --> 57:11.680
Besides, that tree didn't get hit with a belt by its parents.

57:11.680 --> 57:16.680
And it never was able to do anything other than what it's doing.

57:16.680 --> 57:24.680
Yes, but it did get hit with some huge storms in its past.

57:24.680 --> 57:32.680
As humans, we are told, unlike trees, that we are in charge of what becomes of us,

57:32.680 --> 57:34.680
their storms are our fault.

57:34.680 --> 57:39.680
That tree got to sit there for 100 years while people got on and off the bus in LA,

57:39.680 --> 57:43.680
expecting things and having things expected of them.

57:43.680 --> 58:01.680
In a weird waybath, that tree can totally suck my human dick.

58:01.680 --> 58:11.680
I'm so glad I don't have my neighbor's cell phone number.

58:11.680 --> 58:18.680
Besides, I got hit with a belt by my dad, but I remember all the great stuff he did for me too.

58:18.680 --> 58:26.680
He did his best and he could be quite loving.

58:26.680 --> 58:44.680
I think it got more than it deserved, and I hope it burns in fucking tree health.

58:44.680 --> 58:52.680
Are you okay?

58:52.680 --> 58:55.680
Are you?

58:55.680 --> 58:59.680
I'm doing well.

58:59.680 --> 59:04.680
That's what you say, but what if I push a pencil through you?

59:04.680 --> 59:07.680
How soft will you turn out to be?

59:07.680 --> 59:09.680
That's the part they didn't apply.

59:09.680 --> 59:17.680
I was like, oh my god, I've become a fucking maniac.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.680
I know what this is about.

59:19.680 --> 59:23.680
You're pissed because you don't have your privacy anymore.

59:23.680 --> 59:28.680
Do you think that I made up this whole decaying tree thing just to stalk you?

59:28.680 --> 59:38.680
I can see right through you, especially now that all the trees have gone.

59:38.680 --> 59:45.680
Days later, I think days later, October 1st, from now on I'm going to yell up to your window and say, hi, Dan!

59:45.680 --> 59:49.680
It's my way of saying, it's a beautiful day, don't you think?

59:49.680 --> 59:56.680
Three days later, hi, Dan. My Dan and I were thinking of dropping by your podcast today to talk about the eucalyptus trees.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:02.680
What do you think?

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.680
We can skip to...

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.680
You don't want to go through all the booking information?

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680
Whatever you want.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680
No, no, it's fine.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680
Yeah, you're right.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680
You're right.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.680
There's a lot of schedule.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.680
We've got to work on a schedule.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.680
So how does Wednesday work for you?

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.680
Wednesday's no good.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.680
Yesterday, 8.41 a.m.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.680
Hi, Dan. Are we still on tomorrow for your podcast?

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.680
Are you eucalyptus trees?

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.680
Beth.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.680
She signed it!

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.680
In case I'm like, who's this?

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.680
The woman I threatened to push a pencil through.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.680
And then Dan writes, yes, but we don't need to include Aaron in this conversation anymore.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680
We're divorcing.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.680
I'm going to connect you to my assistant, Steve Levy, who books the show and makes sure the guests have all the right information.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.680
Okay, and then...

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.680
His e-mail is blah, blah, blah. Can I give him yours?

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.680
Of course, mine is blah, blah, blah.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.680
I thought you two were just living together.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.680
I'm so sorry to hear about the divorce.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.680
That's always a difficult thing to go through.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.680
That's me, yeah.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680
That's you reading me, yeah, yeah.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.680
You perceived right. We were just living together.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.680
That's why it didn't make sense to stay married.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.680
I'll give your e-mail to Steve and have him contact you tomorrow.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.680
We'll only have...

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.680
Wait, hold on, hold on.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.680
Is this next part Aaron's?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.680
Yeah, and then Aaron comes in for the closer here.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680
Why?

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.680
Thank you, Beth. Truth be told, our marriage was fine until the eucalyptus trees came down.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.680
Hold on, wait.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.680
Wait.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.680
Fucking wait.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:05.680
Thank you, Beth. Truth be told, our marriage was fine until the eucalyptus trees came down because it turns out I was just in it for the shade.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.680
Erin McGathy, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.680
So you...

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.680
Okay, so in the green room, just to put a ribbon on this.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.680
The audience is on your side.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.680
They're reacting to the size of the tree or I don't know the amount of decay.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.680
I still don't understand.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.680
I never noticed them.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.680
I live in a world of just dirty underwear and sadness.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680
But you know what I think?

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:47.680
I actually think that now that wall of eucalyptus trees is down and you've lost your privacy and you're looking down into our yard.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:56.680
You don't have that wall of privacy anymore and there's big stumps of ugliness there now.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.680
Yeah, neighbors shouldn't be separated.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.680
I had eucalyptus trees around my heart.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.680
But you might have never bought your house if there was no privacy there.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.680
I don't know about that, honestly.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.680
I looked in the backyard and I was like, oh, so green, there's a grill.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.680
And the eucalyptus trees were there.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680
I think if I...

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Yeah, maybe.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680
Because if I...

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680
Yeah, okay.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.680
We'll talk about that later.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.680
Well anyway...

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.680
I feel like if I had realized how many steps there were, I wouldn't have bought the house.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.680
So obviously I don't notice things that normal people notice.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.680
Like the UPS guy's like, what the fuck, man?

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680
Right, right.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680
And I'm like, oh shit, okay.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:39.680
Well, I want to tell you that I sent out those same photos to all the neighborhood and people

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:46.680
at first were like us, very, very upset that these beautiful trees had to be cut down.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.680
But then afterwards when they saw how much decay there was, they were shocked and then

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.680
they were asking about...

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680
My tree.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680
Yeah.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.680
These trees are 100 years old.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:05.120
Right before we were going to cut the trees down, we've had the same tree trimmer for

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.680
many, many years now and I wouldn't have had...

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.680
I wouldn't have had anybody else trim them because he knows the trees.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.680
And go ahead.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.680
You know, and it's not that I'm a tree lover.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.680
Shit is real, yo.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.680
When you are a homeowner, this shit is important.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680
Right.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.680
So don't fucking judge.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.680
Or I will come in and I will hit you in the head with this fucking microphone.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.680
Well, and here's the thing.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.680
It's not that I'm a tree lover or tree hugger.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.680
It's just that these were...

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.680
When I looked out my bedroom window, these trees were right there and our house is small

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.680
and these trees were a focal point.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.680
So, and we've lived in that house for 20 years.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.680
Now we're the small house in the shadow of Dan Harmon's palatial...

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:59.680
And these trees were probably about seven stories high and they were 100 years old

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.680
and now we look up at this...

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.680
I will...

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.680
I will build a statue to your trees.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.680
And it will spray cranberry juice for the neighborhood's children.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.680
Well, I just want to say that.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.680
So you told me in the green room...

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680
Oh, what were you going to say?

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680
Yes.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.680
Right before we cut the trees down.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.680
Oh, boy.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.680
Okay, here we go.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.680
Yeah.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.680
I was...

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.680
This was a very upsetting thing to me.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:36.680
But right before we cut the trees down, I actually had a service or gave homage to these trees.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.680
And...

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:44.680
And you said, can I please read the poem I read at the service?

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:55.680
And you're currently, for our listeners, you are as broken up as one of these Tower Records people.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.680
And it's me talking about my divorce.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.680
You're crying genuine tears.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.680
Beth loves these trees.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.680
And I'm a horrible, heartless maniac that cannot fucking...

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.680
I cannot see in these colors.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.680
I do want to say that you identified with the trees.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.680
Unwittingly.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.680
Keep that in mind when I read this poem.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680
Yes.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.680
Tonight's theme is about loss and, yes, uprooting and...

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680
Okay.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:28.680
My trees, blue gum eucalyptus, four of them, so tall, so majestic.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.680
I've always been proud that those trees were mine, fighting through the harsh environment,

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.680
standing tall and proud for over a hundred years.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.680
Those trees belong to me.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:45.680
They provided shelter when the sun was beating down and when the winds would show no mercy.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.680
Yet, it was after the storm that they were at their most fragrant.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:55.680
It was like walking into a spa, especially after a big rain.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:01.680
The life that existed in them, raccoons, possums, skunks.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.680
The chatter of the squirrels that mocked my dog.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.680
Why, even the hawks made their home there.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.680
A nest built on the strong branches of my eucalyptus trees.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.680
A nest holding three large babies and the parents.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.680
And I got to see my hawks grow.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.680
And I got to see my hawks fly.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.680
And I got to see my hawks soar.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.680
The cold winters, the hot summers, the powerful winds, nothing can break those trees.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.680
And to think that those trees belong to me.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:44.680
And to think that those trees, my trees, will now be gone.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:52.680
But, with every end comes a new beginning.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.680
With great love, Beth and Timor.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:09.680
Someone just called out, give her your tree.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:16.680
If that is possible, biologically or legally, it is your tree.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.680
I don't know where it is on my property.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.680
Is it the thing with the green stuff?

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.680
There's a million trees back there.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.680
That was beautiful, Beth.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.680
And I probably don't have to acknowledge this,

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:34.680
but rather want people to understand that I acknowledge how amazing you are

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:42.680
in your capacity to throw yourself against a horrible jagged, cold black wall.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:52.680
And just respond at face value when I'm clearly just in an alcoholic spiral of self-loathing

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.680
with like, are you alright?

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.680
I will say she showed me the text and we went,

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.680
Are you drinking?

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:08.680
Yeah, I was not in a good place, but I will say I was a very funny place.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.680
Well, I didn't know that you guys were getting divorced.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.680
Well, no, I wouldn't play that card.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.680
I knew she was in Ireland and I thought you were missing her.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.680
I was, I was, I was, my cat started dying and then I punched a wall and then, yeah.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.680
And then it's just, boy, had no idea the spiral that would happen.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.680
But the tumor's okay.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.680
They're just keeping a close eye on it, but yeah.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.680
How often do you have to go back in, by the way?

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680
Every four months.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680
Oh, wow.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.680
And they thought they saw something growing there for a while,

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.680
but now they're saying it's not growing and everything looks good.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680
Cool.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680
Good.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.680
Well, the Bootsons, everybody.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.680
Oh, yeah.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:01.680
The heroes of, of a, of a Las Feliz fiefdom dominated by the shadow of a,

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.680
of a tree-hating overlord.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.680
Now, thanks guys.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.680
We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll have you back soon.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.680
I know you're just a marshmallow inside.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:16.680
You could, you could push a pencil through me anytime, Beth.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680
Thank you, sir.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680
See you soon.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.680
All right.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:28.680
So Colin, what's Fargo about?

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.680
Is it about the city or?

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:36.680
It's about eucalyptus trees and death and, uh, no, uh, Fargo.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.680
Um, do you need any more vodka, by the way?

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.680
I'm coming back to this microphone.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.680
Oh yeah.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.680
Yeah, you should do that.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680
The camera likes that better.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
All right.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.680
There we go.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680
Uh, yeah.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.680
So Fargo, uh, the first season, uh, which was the season you,

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.680
you know, the second season starts on Monday.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.680
And you all know I'm not in it, right?

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.680
That don't be upset about it.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680
It's going to be okay.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.680
Don't worry.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.680
You're going to get through it.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.680
No, the second season is actually really great.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680
I've seen the first episode.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.680
It's fantastic and all the people that they have in it are great.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680
It's cool.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.680
So it's like, it's like, um, I don't know.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.680
It's like if you wanted to do like the Marvel universe thing with the

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.680
Colin brothers, that's what it is.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.680
I can't think of a, of a, of a worse idea on paper.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680
On paper.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680
I know.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680
On paper.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680
I was like, I can't.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.680
I mean, you know, it's really like that could have been some fuckin

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.680
horrible fan fiction dude.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.680
It really could have been, but no holly for whatever reason.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.680
That dude is on like another level.

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.680
You know, if Paul McCartney said there are seven levels,

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.680
he's on like the eighth or maybe the seventh.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.680
Um, and he wrote that first season of Fargo, which was really great.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.680
That was sort of had a brief connection to the movie,

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680
but yet existed in its own right.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.400
this next season was alluded to multiple times

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.120
in the first season.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.960
And so Lou Solverson, who owned the cafe,

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.400
who Karateen played in the first season,

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.520
he is now played by Patrick Wilson,

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.520
and it shows his whole experience as a sheriff

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.760
in a completely different town.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.160
And it's supposedly badass.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.800
I've seen the first episode, it's great,

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.240
and I cannot wait for the second episode.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.360
And I've been waiting fucking months

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.360
for the second episode.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.560
I'm so upset that I have to wait for this one.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.680
We have Noah on the show, he was a pilot brother.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.280
When I was doing the pilot for community,

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.120
he was doing a pilot for,

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.440
I can't remember the name of it now,

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440
it was like some like,

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.360
It was on ABC, like Generation?

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.360
It was called like The Unknowables,

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.800
or yeah, Generation, or something.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.480
Something like that, yeah.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.200
Other people or something.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200
Other people's exes.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.240
Yeah, and I got together with him for a round of drinks,

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.400
and as we talked about, he's kind of hard to read,

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.360
but I don't know if having him on the show

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.280
will make me secure about myself,

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.280
but I think-

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.200
No, but you guys' verbal knowledge,

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.320
you guys will be able to communicate in a way,

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.120
I don't know if anyone else will understand it,

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.320
but the two of you will be able to respond.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.120
Don't oversell it, I don't know,

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.960
he could just be like a eucalyptus tree, it's just-

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.920
Dead on the inside?

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.840
And by that, I mean fascinating, as it turns out.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.840
Aren't all artists dead on the inside,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.280
and yet fascinating?

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.560
I love when they brought the circular stump

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.000
that they had been sending me pictures of,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.680
and everyone went, whoa!

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.800
And I was like, okay, I'm the monster.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.000
You really should post-

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.240
I have just been looking at-

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.000
You really should post like screen grabs

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.360
of that conversation though,

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.760
because when she came out and she instantly went to her phone

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.440
and just started scrolling through this,

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.960
I had no idea what they were gonna do,

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.240
and I just here start scrolling through

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.080
a very long text conversation,

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.600
and I said, well this is gonna be very interesting,

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.840
because she's clearly not at all interested

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.920
in what's happening right now,

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.280
and is very interested in this text conversation.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.960
That was brilliant, that was great.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.800
Turned out great, yeah.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.440
It had a beginning, a middle, and an end,

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.680
that's a fucking story.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.520
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.320
Holy fucking shit.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.080
You, everything you do is a fucking story.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.480
Colin Hanks, I will take that as a good thing.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.320
It is.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.000
It is.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:29.840
I don't know what it is.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:30.680
It is.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.520
I meant it as the utmost compliment.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.840
Rap battle!

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.680
Woo!

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.520
Woo!

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.000
Excuse me, I hope you'll stick around,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.200
because I'd like to play Shadowrun with you,

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.520
but I got some business to attempt to.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.360
Do I need to get all the other ones out?

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.400
Someone's coming to town talking shit.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.400
An MC, MC Clarity, are you still, are you still down?

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.120
All right, come on up, MC Clarity, everybody.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.120
Take the good mic.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:58.960
How you doing?

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.800
All right.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.920
So, maybe we'll get to know you

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.800
so that the battle can be higher stakes,

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.920
because, so like, are you from LA?

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.400
I'm actually like born in Connecticut,

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.840
but I was pretty much raised in the Inland Empire,

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.840
Fontana Rancho, so.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.680
Yeah, there you go.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.920
Woo!

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.280
Hello, other Caucasians.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.680
Are the black guy, how you doing?

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.720
That's Auntie, though.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.440
His dad's like a heart surgeon from Barbados.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.040
He's a professor at Virginia Tech, right?

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.840
Yay, I did it.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.920
My dad's a General Manager at a Denny's.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.520
Come on, we're to the Riverside.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.080
No, he's the best damn General Manager in the world,

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.280
like his entire, like, like restaurant.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.920
My dad's my hero, shout out to John Joseph Barge, so.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.360
We're both from the streets, there's no arguing there.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.480
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.080
The main streets of the suburbs.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.760
Are you young enough to ask how old you are?

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.040
You seem kind of younger, maybe I shouldn't ask that.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.960
If you say, yeah, well, how old are you?

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.800
Do you want to guess?

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.600
I don't know, black toe cracks, so I would just say,

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.920
I don't know, you're a kid, I don't know.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.960
You seem like a kid, 20 something, 23, 25?

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.120
28, 28 years old.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:15.960
Oh!

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.840
That's very young to me.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.840
When did you, you're like, so can we call you an amateur MC?

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.920
I guess, I mean, I can just say, I'm just an artist,

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.480
you know, like I'm just trying to just live off of my art.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.680
What is that lifestyle?

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.520
How does that work?

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.360
It's frustrating.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.200
Because I just stand up when I was a kid.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.120
It's not delivery, it's the struggle for sure.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.000
Like, it's just, I'm very hungry all the time,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.320
I'm frustrated, I can look at anything,

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.920
thank you, other guy right there,

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.920
your eviction notice too, for sure, yeah, I know, right?

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.560
That guy's going like this, right?

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.240
Just so you know, I mean, he's playing it off,

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.240
but the guy's like, oh no, no, he'll well off.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.720
But this is frustrating, I'm always hungry

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.440
and stuff like that, I never have any gas.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.120
I always try to find a story in something,

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.440
so if I see just like a kid crying about their ice cream,

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.400
I need to find a social political turmoil

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.520
about how America is just some one kid

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.880
crying about their ice cream.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.440
I'm actually writing a song about foot fetishes.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.960
So are you thinking in rhymes when you look at that kid?

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.800
Yeah, sometimes.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800
So you're like, cone, alone.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.240
Yeah, exactly, you know, why?

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.840
America got boned, 900 number phone.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.240
Yeah, pretty much.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.480
Okay, but I won't keep bragging.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.240
The, but I'm curious, that's very interesting.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.280
Because I've talked to like,

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.200
I had dinner with Ben Folds once, humble brag,

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.360
and I, and what I find interesting about musicians

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.000
is that they, like I have like dialogue

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.440
in my head all the time, like it's,

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.360
I imagine myself, I don't want to flatter myself

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.640
or offend anybody who has a legitimate mental illness,

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.000
but I, when you hear about like voices in your head,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.120
I always think like, there's got to be like

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.040
one drop of chemical difference in the brain

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.040
between like a writer who's good at dialogue

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.560
and like somebody who's setting themselves on fire

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.240
because they can't stop like the voices in their head.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.360
Because I just like, I'm just used to it.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.200
It's just like, I just always hear talking,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.680
talking, talking, talking, talking.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.760
And when people are talking to me,

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.640
I see their words in front of my face, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.960
I talked to Ben Folds and I'm like,

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.320
what the fuck are musicians?

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.280
How does that work?

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.600
And he said like, he can't, he has the same thing,

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.520
but it's melodies, which is so weird to me.

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.840
Cause to me, melodies are a thing you make up.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.280
Like you go down to the ditch and you just like,

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.760
oh, I need a melody.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.720
But that's how other people feel about writing.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.560
And he feels that way.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.560
He's like, I can't stop thinking of this melody.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.680
I can't get it out of my head,

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.080
which I've heard from like Paul McCartney

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.440
and stuff like that in interviews.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.760
You're saying that for...

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.600
In interviews, he said.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.520
Interviews.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.400
He said in interviews, you were so quick on the humble brag.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.240
Thank you, Paul.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.240
So quick on the trigger.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.000
In interviews.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.920
With the Macca.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.760
With the Pow Macca.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.200
As he's called in Brazil.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.480
Colin Hanks is like, exhausted.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.120
I mean, he's been promoting his documentary

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.760
probably all week and he has to come here

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.480
and like defend me from people.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.200
He was very quick on the humble brag, yell.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.200
I really thank you for doing that.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.280
But no, the thing that you're talking about,

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.440
the thing you're talking about,

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.480
there's a very big difference between crazy and insane.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.400
You can deal with a crazy artist

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.560
because they're constantly focused on whatever it is

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560
that their brain needs to focus on,

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.360
whether it's words or melody, whatever.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.360
They're crazy because they hear melodies all the time.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.360
Whereas insane is just a fucking insane person.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.720
Well, you're always connecting things.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.680
But here's the thing, when I listen to like Eminem lyrics,

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.160
I'm like, this guy must have been born in a generation

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.960
where it's like, oh, because of hip hop culture

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.440
that came before him and because of maybe something

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.080
in his brain, like he's thinking phonetically

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.120
because he rhymes shit that I'm like,

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.080
that didn't rhyme until you made it rhyme.

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.360
Do you, do you think in rhymes?

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.280
Do you hear rhymes in your head or?

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.520
I definitely do.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.680
I mean, how I usually kind of start like the process is,

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.000
every song I do is a story.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.480
So the first thing I do is I just think about

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.160
what the story is gonna be about.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.720
So I always have to make sure I have a beginning

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.800
and middle and the end.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.880
And I always have to write out.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.200
I always have to write out the story.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.040
That's a callback.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.800
Thank you.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.120
You wanna tell story, you're saying,

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.680
so taking us back to the kid with the ice cream cone,

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.080
you're saying when you look at the kid with the ice cream

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.560
cone, you're like, I wanna do, I wanna rap about that.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.640
Yeah, pretty much like if I see a kid like,

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.080
if he drops an ice cream, the first thing I think about was,

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.560
this kid must have had, like my story was,

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.960
he had a shitty day, no one wanted to like pick him

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.760
for kickball, his graham crackers were too soggy

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.840
and all this other shit.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.400
And all he really fucking wanted was

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.920
is that chocolate chip icing from Thrifty.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.600
He was so excited to go out to the store.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.400
And then he tripped on somebody's like, fuck, you know what I'm

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.720
saying, my saving grace, and now I'm

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.160
gonna destroy my teddy bear because I

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.280
don't know what else to do.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.120
That's pretty much how I'm gonna put my story,

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.920
because I feel like there's like a twisted bittersweet thing

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.640
and anyone's moral of the story of the day,

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.200
like you can have the greatest day possible,

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.640
but I feel like something about your day is a bittersweet.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.160
So I always try to make sure I end every note of my song

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.800
in a bittersweet, lyrical, funny way.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.520
So.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.880
Like bittersweet would be an example would be like,

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.480
so he doesn't get any more ice cream, but like,

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.640
but he's going to lose weight.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.800
Yeah, pretty much, yeah, like the moral of the story is he's

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.720
not going to be diabetic, you know what I'm saying?

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.600
So I mean.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.240
Yeah, I guess it's diabetes will come a year later, later,

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.560
later, later.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.840
And that's like the, and then it goes into some weird sketch

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.440
you with you and your friends in a car.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.480
Yeah, it's like smoking a lot of marijuana, looking at the kid

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.560
who was like, oh, shit, your ice cream.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.120
As we all have ice cream, we're like, aha, we have money,

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.120
we're adults, we have jobs, we just buy something else.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.160
I can never figure out how I feel about those comedy sketches

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.600
that rappers do on their albums.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.040
Like I'm like, on one hand, I don't want you to stop,

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.760
but on the other hand, you really need to take a workshop.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.200
Or this is this is insane.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.320
It all kind of depends.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.120
It's one of those things to where it's just like everyone

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.320
wants to be something that like was like when you have like

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.520
movie stars who want to be singers like Jennifer Lopez,

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.120
Selena, she was like, fuck, I have a great voice.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.640
And she was like, I'm going to go ahead and be a singer when

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.600
you have like actors or if you have like rappers or singers

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.440
who are like, you know what, I'm going to go into acting.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.040
You can go when you're like, you know what,

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.240
really not that great of an actor,

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.400
but I'm going to still keep on doing it.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.600
So it's kind of like the same thing with the skits, you know.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.000
I don't have very funny skits.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.800
I actually have a very, very corny skit with my girlfriend

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.280
in it, where this is about like going on a shopping spree

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.800
at a swap meet.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.160
And it's so corny.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.960
We're still proud of it till this day and stuff.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.840
We feel like we're like comedic geniuses.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.680
When people look at it, they're like, so this is a swap meet

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.480
skit. And I'm like, yeah, it's funny.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.120
It's her birthday.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.320
It's a $60 shopping spree.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.240
She wanted a person with $5 over.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:04.880
Go for it.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.360
And that same reaction you guys have right now,

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.400
that's the exact same feeling I get from my mother, my dad,

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:11.800
all my friends.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.640
You never know when you're going to hit the gold mine that

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.440
is a decaying eucalyptus tree.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.280
Yeah, exactly.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.200
Like you don't know what the people are

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.000
going to consider an important story.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.440
All right, so when you battle mothers,

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440
do you do it sitting?

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:31.680
Do you do, I got two beats from our man, Zach, in the booth.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.240
There's a slower one and a faster one.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.280
Do you want to sit?

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.400
Do you want to be congenial?

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.800
Do we need to move the seats out and do it in the center?

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.400
Do you want to face each other?

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.240
Have you battled ever before, really?

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:46.760
Yeah.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.600
How does that work?

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.200
That was the thing I was trying to ask you when I said

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:49.800
about the lifestyle.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.080
Like, how does that work?

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.680
When I was 17, I started, I was like,

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.560
I'm going to be a comedian.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.200
So there was this whole thing going that was open mics.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.880
It was like this weird, whoo, it was this whole culture.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.160
But I was like, I have no, if I was supposed

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.640
to write a movie about, what the hell does that look like?

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.360
What do you do?

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.120
You go to a place?

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.280
Do you put your name in a hat?

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.000
And then they bring you up?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.720
I mean, you can do open mics or something like that.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.920
I know I just started writing.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.120
I just started showing people.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.960
And I just tried talking to the right people.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.400
And I just started doing open mics or different gigs.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.440
So I have a promoter that's saying, hey,

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.840
I'm doing something in Santa Ana.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.760
Two songs set.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:29.760
Just go in and do it.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760
And then you just hope for the best.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.280
But these venues that are doing it publicly,

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.240
these are like showcases and stuff.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.560
Are people like, is it like a honky tonk

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.480
where they're like boo you and throw beer bottles?

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.120
It depends.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.440
I mean, I actually had an experience like that two weeks ago.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.640
I was actually off Sunset Boulevard two weeks ago.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.440
I was actually a couple of blocks away from here.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.400
And I mean, I'm a very geeky rapper.

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.120
And so when I go in there, I'm just real confident.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.400
Because I'm lyrically awesome.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.840
But the whole, I mean, I have to go in there like fuck this shit.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.560
I'm like hip hop Carlton.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:06.080
But I'm really good at rapping.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.560
My Tom Jones nigga, please.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.120
But anyway, but I go in there.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.280
I'm all super confident.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.400
It is a whole bunch of gangsters.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.960
I go in, I start rapping my stuff.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.440
I'm trying to talk to the crowd.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.400
And all these gangsters are just fucking quiet all day.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.680
Because they're like, what's a go bot?

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.920
Yeah, exactly, right?

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.160
And they're like, who's Aquaman?

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.680
Because I mentioned Aquaman in one of my songs, right?

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.360
I got to talk about Batman and Robin actually

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.920
getting married and stuff like that.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.200
And so they just weren't feeling that shit at all.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.080
And so I was like, I don't know if they're going to boo me

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.840
or shoot me in the face.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.520
And so it really sucks, Bobby.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.000
This is one of those things where you have to keep going.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.520
If you believe in a dream, you just

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.280
got to keep going and just do whatever it takes.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.320
Well, I'm sorry to destroy your dream tonight.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.640
Oh, wow.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.200
We got to stand up now.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.040
But you know what?

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.440
We got to stand up now.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:54.940
Yeah.

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.920
Oh, shit.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.040
All right.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.080
Well, should we start with the slow one?

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:01.560
Let's see if.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.480
You want me to start with the slow one?

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.540
Yeah.

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.040
OK.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.040
This is the slow one.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:05.540
Go for it.

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.040
Go for it.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.520
This is what you're going to teach me.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.640
So yo, yo, is this a slow one?

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.360
That's very fast by my account.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.440
They're saying one second.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440
OK, get ready to die.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.160
They need a second before they drop the beat.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.640
Hey, guys, straight up, real hip hop.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.520
I've been told you have to say that before you do one of those things.

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.040
I'm clearing my head, by the way.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.160
I know, I know, I'm sure you've, I'm sure you're coming in with a big sack full of pre-written

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:35.660
rhymes.

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.480
No, not at all.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.400
Like, I'm pretty much just a winger.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.360
I am promising you, the only thing I'm thinking about is don't rhyme mouth with south.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.640
We're ready to go?

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.240
Here we go.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.040
Real hip hop.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.960
Clear in the head, yo.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:27:03.480
Yo, it's about that time, about time for hip hop, about quarter to that time.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.920
Now it's getting to be the time.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:17.680
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:23.860
the east west ceiling and floor.

01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:26.320
I fucked your mama and she asked for more, just starting with that.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.800
It's like a warm-up.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.100
Okay, just give me a second.

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.200
Get ready to die.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.680
All right, here we go, yo.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:45.760
Big workshops, big workshops, big workshops, kitchen, living room, sink.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.520
So she started to stink and said take a towel take a shower go away

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.280
She went home and came back the next day. I said

01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:03.040
Why are you here again? She said I've never been fucked so hard since 1910 because you know your mama is a hundred and three

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.800
And that's not old enough for me because I like a wrinkle pussy

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.800
So I like your mom, but right about now

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:17.360
I'm gonna get a pom-pom and give it to your mama so she can cheer lead to the team that is my dick

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.480
Which are my balls

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.480
I

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.920
You said you fucked my mom, I'm not complaining all that means is I'm officially Caucasian

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:55.400
I'm not complaining. Why are you talking so much shit for my Christmas?

01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.600
I want a ps4. You my new daddy. Yes, and I want to do catty. You have a arm and chair

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.840
I need that the custody the alimony is gonna go ahead and fuck you up pretty bad

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.280
But that's okay. Don't be sad. All I want to do is say you're a real rat. Oh my friend said

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:15.720
I love you Rick and Morty. Yes, I'm lightly sparring that you think I'm really serious with this shit real sorry

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.440
And victory is already expected. I don't know what I'm trying to say

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.440
My head is just

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400
I had too much body of my system

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240
Hey

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.880
I really like the fact that you had this kind of one on the table. You're not offering to nobody

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.520
Yes, can I have a shot though? Please this poor be a cup. Maybe all the way though

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:51.560
I'm gonna chug it down. I'm real fucked up. I'm real drunk crazy love because my girl is right in the front

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:56.440
I see her right there. She has a big dairy air not like this guy right here

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.880
You can't even stare you can't even see it. It's too flat like the rhymes that he just said

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.720
I can't even think about receding on this battle. Yes, I'm gonna have you reeling. I'm too sick like HIV

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.960
I just go so wrong and you fuck my mom. Good job. Get an STD. Yes

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.000
Yeah, mom, don't be bad at me. Hopefully I'll say you with Thanksgiving

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Don't put the poison in my drink or my stuff thing on my chicken my birthday. I can say it's coming

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.440
Don't be bad at me. I'm just trying to be famous. Thanks for promoting. Thanks for everyone for listening

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:29.800
I'm pretty sure we can go ahead and do a second round. I don't know about the go down like my testicles when I'm growing up

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:35.160
In middle school. I'm so cool. I feel must stop right here. I keep on rambling business STD. I'm sorry

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.160
All right

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:45.440
All right round two, all right, we're warmed up. We're warmed up. I need more cattle one. Hold on

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.880
All right

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:54.920
I'm not gonna say I understood everything. That's okay. Me neither me neither. Oh, I don't understand it

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.120
Hi, I have to make a conscious decision

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.520
Do that style where you just rhyme for a while

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.120
But you rhyme the time with it you rhyme the words instead of the on the beat

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.560
You don't rhyme with the feet. You like you do you just rhyme. It's just kind of sporadically

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.160
As soon as you hear a word you just start rhyming it

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:16.080
I'm like, I don't think I don't think I'm always like to go without a beat. It's actually pretty funny

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.080
Kind of make

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:53.240
I'll give your dad a job because he's a jerk and then I lick his ass and I'll suck his dick because your dad's looking a little sick

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.760
I think he might have leukemia. I'll give him some treatment

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.080
She said

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.840
She's like me

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:11.800
I'm like, that's not English. She's like, fuck me again

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.440
So I fucked your mama again, and then I left the house about a quarter to ten

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:21.080
I got the mail went to work and then I came back and I caught your uncle in her crack

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:28.240
I said, Uncle Bob, what are you doing? He said, I'm just looking for postage glue and I'm gonna put a stamp on an envelope

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:34.480
I said, yeah, let's go hunt some antelopes. So we went to Africa on a safari. I put your mama so hard

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:39.480
She looked like Starry and she was taking ecstasy at the time. So we had to just go

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.720
Poisonous vipers in the bush. I fucked your mama and her big-ass tush

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.360
I fell inside and I looked around and I said, holy shit, it's a new hip-hop sound

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:04.360
The beats are bouncing off of her ass walls. I think that's about all I got to do is just say

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.840
Ha ha ha, and then your mama's ass does all the

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.240
So I wore a bitter coat and I came outside and there was a moat

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:17.080
It was, you know what you milk that she forgot to drink because your mama diet stinks

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:24.080
She just lays on her bed and fucking shit that people put in front of her

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080
Snakes

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.080
Wait, keep it going like

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.080
He was talking about my mom that's not my feeling

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.080
After this time, he's gonna be really, really, he's in this house and he's really fucking lonely

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.080
Like I said before, good luck when you had a journey

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.080
Yes, and I do want full abs, so see if you really need abs

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.080
If we do those, you should look the streets

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.080
Yes, I even heard the taxes

01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:02.080
Man, you were really fucked up, no wonder everyone wants to leave you every time you speak this

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.080
I know I'm real fucked up, it's a battle

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.080
I don't give a shit, I'm real evil with this shit

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.080
My producer is now saying, shout out with this shit, I eat, keep harding it

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.080
Here we go again, we're going round and round

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.080
The clock's like the clock's ticking, tick and tick, talking

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.080
Yes, quit talking about how you giving my mom the fucking stocking

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.080
There's a big requirement, one of the last times he's seen the tip

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.080
Every time you look down, it's all toes

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.080
No mo, you just a hoe

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.080
And it's pipping up in here, West Hollywood, you a wee hoe

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.080
Whoa-ho, slow down, no mo

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.080
Stop with that shit, I'm your man

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.080
But you ain't going hard, your Billy, Billy is too big

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.080
I can't see nothing that you say it

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.080
Every time you see it, you always be spraying mediocrity

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080
The form of walking forward and deceiving

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.080
You just shake it like you got epilepsy

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.080
I'm dropping knowledge, ha ha ha

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.080
I'm dropping knowledge like Michael J. Fox

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.080
You get it, he got marguses

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.080
I'm real fucked up, go to my Soundcock to my makescape

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.080
Ha ha, it's a random shout out

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.080
Yo, I love him in revenge of the nerds

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.080
I love when you freaking picture nose all the time

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.080
Could you eat it in that one scene?

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.080
Would you really fuck your nose out?

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.080
Would you really pick it out?

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.080
How many ass did you get?

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.080
After a scene when you saw a girl, you were like

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.080
Hey, I'm that geek, yo, give me some vagina

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.080
Ha ha ha, B-U-S-S-Y

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.080
Never? Are you serious?

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.080
Did they see you, they said fucking nerd

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.080
Fuck that shit, you're awesome, that's absurd

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.080
Shout out, he's a real legend

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.080
Shout out to everyone here, you fucking listening

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.080
Just get the fucking clapping, go ahead

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:33.080
Sell some blood, pour it, put his hip hop in

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.080
It's a real fucking battle, holy shit

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.080
I feel like Kanye West when I don't have a baby

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.080
Goddamn, or a, or a Kandarsian with a big bad booty

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.080
Or a dad who just went kind of silly

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.080
Went opposite, now she's a fucking mommy

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.080
Or a girl, or a man for night, I don't give a fuck

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.080
Anyway, I'm out of here, just go ahead

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080
Just stop it right here, I'm going to quit

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.080
Thank you for the drink, do I have to pay anything?

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.080
How about it's it, how about go ahead and practice?

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080
Go ahead, just keep on writing all day

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.080
But it's just go for wedding, you're a fucking light con too

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.080
And I think it's really cool that you gave me this opportunity

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.080
To go ahead and say everything that I want to say

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.080
Oh, MC Clarity!

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.080
The winner, I think

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.080
Oh, you got it

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.080
Yeah, we'll give it to you this time

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.080
Thank you, sir

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080
That's that second round I heard

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.080
I could almost keep up with everything

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.080
And it was badass, that was nice

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.080
I'll be analyzing that shit for a little while

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080
Oh, wow

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.080
And then it got really meta and uncomfortable

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.080
When he was rapping about my twitching

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.080
My uncomfortable twitching

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.080
And it was like, okay, this solves that theory

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.080
Of when are these people who freestyle all the time

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.080
How much stuff do they have up their sleeve?

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.080
No, I was twitching and then he started rapping about the twitching

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.080
Yeah, see, if you give him something

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.080
He's going to work with it, because he's an artist

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.080
And that's what artists do

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.080
I thought I was the only one with flow

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.080
No

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.080
A twitchy flow?

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.080
A twitchy flow?

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.080
Colin, you don't have any wrap up your sleeve

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.080
No, I don't

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.080
You've never even wanted to try it, did you?

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.080
No, I'm not a rapper

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.080
I'm not the rapper

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080
That's the other one

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.080
MC Hanks?

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.080
I was in a...

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.080
I played bass in a band in college

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.080
That fancied itself as a live hip-hop group

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.080
There's a horrible thing to fancy themselves

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.080
And we called ourselves the underlords

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.080
Such a horrible name for a band

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:43.080
So bad that the guy who was recording our demo

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.080
Labeled us the overlords

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.080
And he said, over, under, it doesn't matter

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.080
It does not matter

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.080
So you were a band first and then said, let's try rapping

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.080
That was the Beastie Boys, right?

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.080
No, I just played bass, I was just the quiet bass player

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.080
You're like, leave me out of this

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.080
I'm just off to the side playing a bass

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.080
And on that little demo that we made

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.080
The one thing that you cannot hear is the bass

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.080
Yeah

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.080
So this isn't something you kept?

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080
No, I still have it

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.080
Oh, you do still have it?

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.080
Oh, I still have it, it's really bad

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.080
No, you can't listen to any of it

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.080
Okay

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.080
I want to make sure I'm just going to check my Microsoft One Note

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.080
I got to go to the bathroom real quick

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.080
Spencer's got to make a little poopers

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.080
Oh, there is one thing

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.080
It's been sitting here the entire time

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.080
Watching all of this

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.080
He's a professional

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.080
I think we're about to get to his part of the show

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.080
And he goes, I got to go to the bathroom

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.080
Doesn't even wait to announce

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.080
I got to go

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.080
And just leaves

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.080
There's no permission

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.080
It's really gone to his head

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.080
He's doing it for free

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.080
But he got to executive produce

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.080
I would hope he's shitting for free

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.080
If you were charging him, that would be really bad

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.080
I mean the game mastering

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.080
There's one thing, we'll talk until he gets back

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.080
Dave Grohl is in your documentary

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:17.080
As a person who was just one of many people

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.080
That we recognized these days

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.080
Who grew...

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.080
He's in documentaries

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.080
He's in a lot of documentaries

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.080
He made all of his in the time it took to make one

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.080
The appeal of Tower Records was the snobbery

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080
Not to put too fine a point on it

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.080
I've always been fascinated with that idea

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:39.080
I think I enact a lot of snobbery

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080
Without realizing I'm doing it

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.080
But I've never been patient for it at all

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.080
What is that?

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.080
The idea that they like to go to record stores

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.080
And be given a hard time or did back then

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.080
With Grohl, there's a very specific reason

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.080
Why I put Grohl in the documentary

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.080
Because everyone was like, when we released the trailer

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.080
There were some people that were like, oh great

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.080
David Grohl is in another documentary about music

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.080
Like that, Per the Rules

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.080
He has to be in every documentary about music

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.080
Is this clips of him saying

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.080
You have to understand that at the time

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.080
Nobody had heard anything like this

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.080
And it's just, it could be about anything

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.080
It's like clip art

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.080
It could be anything

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.080
But very specifically, he actually worked at Tower Records

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080
Before he was in Nirvana

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.080
He worked at a Tower Records in Washington DC

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.080
So I specifically went after him

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:33.080
Because I knew that he worked there

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.080
And he talked a lot about the fact that

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.080
A lot of the people that worked at music stores

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.080
At record stores have a tendency

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.080
To be pretty snobbish

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.080
I had to tell you

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080
I can't wait to see this

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.080
Because the tower that was here on Sunset Boulevard

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.080
When I moved here in 83

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.080
Which I think was the year it opened

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.080
It opened on Sunset

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.080
No, it opened in the 70s

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.080
But it opened for you in 1983

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.080
That's right, it was in...

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.080
In New York was in 1981

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.080
Anyway, but the reason that I can't wait to see it

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.080
Is because I never encountered that

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.080
I never encountered snobbery

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.080
And I lived in that Tower Record

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.080
For years

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.080
I was there constantly

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.080
And one of the things that I thought was so sorry

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.080
About the whole thing going south

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.080
Was that there was a social environment there

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.080
Which everyone has lost

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.080
As a result of going to MP3s

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.080
Yeah, no, I always sort of say

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.080
That there are two things that are missing now

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.080
That these stores have a tendency to not really exist

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.080
And I'm saying this knowing full well

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.080
That we're in the back of a comic store

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080
Where this happens every day

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.080
But there are two things that happen

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.080
A is there's the social interaction

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.080
Between people at the stores

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.080
Who are going through bins

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.080
And seeing what the other person is doing

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.080
And maybe there's a connection there that can be made

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.080
Or there's at least some sort of connection

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.080
Being made between the person that is taking the money

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.080
And the person that is giving the money

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.080
The only difference now is that

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.080
I don't remember what I was doing when I downloaded some song

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.080
There's no special moment of like

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.080
Oh man, I'm about to download this

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.080
That is going to change my life

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.080
Or like man, I remember where I was when I downloaded this

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.080
But I remember where I was when I bought an album

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.080
That meant a great deal to me

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.080
And that is something that is somewhat special

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080
At least to me

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.080
It's notable to notice the lack of that

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.080
But it's also like, let's be honest

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.080
I mean, you could say

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.080
You could say the same thing about making bread or something

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.080
Like people used to have to

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.080
Well, we need a loaf of bread

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.080
So I guess I know what I'm doing Wednesday

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:49.080
And then once bread started to be made by other people

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.080
It's like, we lost Wednesday

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.080
When bread started to get streamlined

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.080
We lost our Wednesdays

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.080
And it's true, but it's not necessarily good or bad

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.080
Again, I do feel like in that documentary

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.080
I often feel this way about documentaries

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.080
But people that contributed so much to popular culture

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.080
They beat up on themselves so much

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.080
In the third acts, like they're like

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.080
Oh, but we could have never known

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.080
It was going to be the end of everything

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:21.080
Did you see the Paul Williams documentary?

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.080
That guy is so hard on himself

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.080
For being one of the most amazing people

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.080
For all of everything in the 70s

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.080
And being one of the most inspiring, interesting people

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.080
It's like this diminutive guy that just experimented

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.080
Kind of like Beth Bootson with the idea of

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.080
Like I'm here mocking her

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.080
And she's like, I'm going to be bulletproof, I don't care

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.080
I'm so at peace with myself

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.080
All I care about is whether you're okay

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.080
And so this tiny little guy

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.080
Who was a brilliant songwriter

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.080
And wrote all of these hits

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.080
All of a sudden he becomes this amazing celebrity

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.080
And it wasn't because there weren't

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.080
Taller, more handsome people available

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.080
It was because people loved him

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.080
Because he was so unflappable and so sincere

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.080
And yeah, it was the 70s

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.080
So he did a bunch of coke and drank

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:12.080
And the documentary kind of

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.080
Follows him looking back on those days

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.080
And at the end of it I felt like I had to tweet him

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.080
And go like, you're too hard on yourself

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.080
Man, that's like, so what?

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.080
You rubbed your nose during the Dick Cavett show

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.080
Like what the fuck?

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.080
You were great

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.080
And he wrote back like, yeah

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.080
But I have to find peace and grace and all this stuff

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.080
And it's just like, no, be drunk again with me

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.080
No, no, no, I don't know what it is

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.080
It's like, you don't want to fuck with that shit

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.080
But I feel like people are too hard on themselves

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080
In these documentaries where it's like

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.080
Yeah, we did this thing and then

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.080
Like what was Tower Records supposed to do?

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:47.080
The important thing that I, the most important thing

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.080
That I kept trying to remind myself was the fact that

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.080
I was being interested to tell these people's stories

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.080
And so when I see things

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.080
And when I see documentaries

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.080
And people are being too hard on themselves

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.080
I go, no, they should be hard on themselves

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.080
Because it was their lives

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.080
This is what they did, for better or for worse

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.080
This is what they did

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.080
And a lot of times, especially

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.080
When you get into these scenarios where documentaries

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.080
Are talking about, you know, people

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.080
That dedicated their lives to something

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.080
They will spend the rest of their lives wondering

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.080
What they could have done differently

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.080
And we gave

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.080
People that worked at Tower a chance to be able to

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.080
Talk about that and to sort of

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.080
Maybe, just maybe

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.080
Give them an opportunity to sort of get them

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.080
You know, get that off their chest

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.080
And you captured really powerful moments

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.080
What's your relationship between acting and

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.080
I mean, now you, what does it take

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.080
To direct a documentary and how does that compare to

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.080
Because you can just show up to a place

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.080
And have your own trailer and have people put makeup

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.080
On your face and go have fun

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.080
Yeah, that shit's really nice, I'm not going to lie

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.080
That's really nice when people are like

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.080
It's really funny and like where makeup

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.080
And pretend to be someone else, that's a nice

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.080
Day job to have and I really

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.080
Enjoy doing it and I got a new show now

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.080
It's called Hanks a Lot

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.080
It's called Hanks a Lot

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.080
Super great

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.080
No, but I, like

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.080
That is really fun but

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.080
Hanks for nothing

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.080
Hanks for the memories

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.080
Boy, there's a lot of, they all involve the word

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.080
Thanks, don't they?

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.080
No, but like

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.080
With the documentary thing it was really

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.080
Something that I started doing because

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.080
I wasn't working because

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.080
I couldn't find any acting work

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.080
And I'm not a writer, I don't pretend

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.080
To be a writer, a lot of actors

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.080
Do

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.080
Ouch

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.080
Oh wait

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:36.080
But um, no

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.080
Basically it was a chance for me to do something

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.080
Else creative and I

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.080
Needed some sort of outlet and so this

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.080
Doc proved to be it and since I started

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.080
Making it, I've done a couple of other ones

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:48.080
And I'm not

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.080
Pretending to be a documentary filmmaker

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.080
This is just one story that I really wanted to tell

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.080
And I was lucky enough to

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.080
Well you just swell at it, yeah

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.080
It's really

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.080
We'll see it on Friday and then

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.080
And then we can talk for

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.080
The next three hours about

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.080
Certain, like, like, like the

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.080
What it is, like, that a lot

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.080
Very few

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.080
He finished his shit, we can play a game

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.080
And I want to talk about this one

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.080
Aspect of your life that you share

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.080
With a very, very, very tiny minority

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.080
Of people, which is a

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.080
Legacy

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.080
And how you deal

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.080
With, like, that

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.080
Concept of working, of

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.080
Establishing

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.080
We're talking about your uncle Michael Keaton

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.080
Yeah

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.080
But it's a totally different podcast

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:38.080
We can

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.080
Talk about that or not talk about that

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.080
Because you're a lovely, wonderful person

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.080
That I really like hanging out with

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.080
I appreciate that

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.080
And you're going to play Shadow Run with us now

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.080
And Curtis, you get to reprise your role

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.080
As Dr. Friend

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.080
It is time for Shadow Run

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:56.080
And we've had

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.080
I'm going to not

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.080
Be bashful about

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.080
Soliciting the aid

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.080
Of someone

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.080
That presents as female

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.080
Or as feeling female tonight

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.080
Gay can count

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.080
Since you said it, that charmingly

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.080
Who said that?

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.080
Okay, well, it's

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.080
Let's bring up the Does Gay Count guy

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.080
You're going to get one of those

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.080
Because

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.080
Does Gay Count

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.080
Yeah

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.080
I'm not sure

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.080
Let's figure it out

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.080
Alright, I'm Dan Harmon

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.080
We'll use that for me

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.080
You should be Dr. Friend

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.080
And then

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.080
So, Hordegaard

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.080
Why don't you be Hordegaard

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.080
You're like a psychic

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.080
Of a foreign guy

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.080
Okay, I'm a psychic foreign dude

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.080
Yeah, Damorage usually plays him

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.080
I don't know really how to explain him

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.080
Okay

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.080
Jeff, of course

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.080
Oh, well

01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:00.080
It's a real tragedy

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.080
Jeff isn't here

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.080
We'll be fine

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.080
Yeah, we'll just say

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.080
That Jeff got lost for a second

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.080
Jeff got lost

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.080
That's what he does

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.080
How come I can never figure out

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.080
Exactly how many people we need

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.080
I don't know

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.080
There's plenty of right answers

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.080
So, at what point do I reveal

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.080
That I have no idea what this is

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.080
Or how to do this

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.080
Do I just wait until the end?

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.080
Most of us have been waiting to reveal that for

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.080
A long time

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.080
Alright guys, shadow run

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:36.080
Wait, does gay count guy, what's your name?

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.080
What's your name?

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.080
Elliot

01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.080
You're more than gay, you're foreign

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:44.080
Should he play

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.080
The foreign

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.080
Yes, he should

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:50.080
We need to switch characters

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.080
Where are you from, Elliot?

01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.080
I'm so sorry, I'm not a woman

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.080
No, that's so charmingly British of you

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.080
Gay is enough, man

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.080
Combined with British?

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.080
That's like, the women are

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.080
Very happy right now

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.080
Cool

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.080
Positively

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.080
You grant of him

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.080
He's all flustered because there's ladies

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.080
In the front row

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.080
I'm in love with Elliot, this is great

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.080
Thank God for my divorce

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.080
I can explore these avenues now

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.080
I didn't know

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.080
Gay Harry Potter is going to

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:30.080
Come

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.080
Take me to your Quidditch game

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:40.080
It's all hack and it's dumb

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:42.080
Just trying to get laughs

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.080
Like a desperate, sad, hungry hippo

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.080
Grabbing at marbles

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:50.080
Someone laughing at something

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:54.080
Alright, so do you think

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:56.080
We could grab one more person

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.080
To play Jeff's character

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.080
I mean, it's

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.080
Spencer doesn't care

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.080
Anybody in the front row

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.080
Want to come up and just really quickly

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.080
Alright, young lady

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.080
There we go

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.080
Alright

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:18.080
You're playing Jeff's characters

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.080
Eve Liberty, I don't know what

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.080
We never remember

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:24.080
And I don't remember what happened last time

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.080
I was about to find out

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.080
Do I have to keep score?

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.080
Yeah, right now we're at

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:32.080
2, 4, 7,

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.080
18

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.080
He's being passive aggressive

01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.080
That's not passive aggressive

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.080
I would like him to come back

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:42.080
Hey

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.080
Yeah, me too

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.080
You behave yourself

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.080
It's alright, let's go

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.080
Shadowrun

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.080
That's how old games start

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.080
You yell Shadowrun

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:56.080
This one was written by

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:58.080
Robert Horn

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:00.080
He's the guy whose parents

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.080
Run a crown nanker

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.080
That place that we went to

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:06.080
Yeah, anyway

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.080
Robert Horn

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.080
After the Shadowrunners spent

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.080
What felt like an unreasonable amount of time

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:14.080
On an impromptu quest

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.080
Given to them by Hank, the gang finally opened

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.080
The musical lock with their newly

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:20.080
Achieved, harmonious melodies

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.080
They discovered a vast amount of

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.080
MP3s, which after

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.080
The unsuccessful use of their abilities

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.080
Were sloppily transported

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.080
To the back of a stolen van

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.080
At this time, Hakai alerted the gang

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:34.080
To his unfortunate mistake

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.080
That a live stream of the murder they

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:38.080
Had committed on a future sex offender

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:40.080
Had been found by local police

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.080
Giving them 30 seconds to escape

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:44.080
Will the seemingly

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.080
Unprovoked murder of the

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.080
Storage clerk go and answer

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.080
Will his new MP3-access

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.080
Spark a revolution

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.080
Or just draw a bigger crowd

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.080
Will the Eagle ever return

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.080
With the Johnson's location

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.080
That's a callback

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:02.080
Find out this week on Shadowrunners

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.080
I'm so lost right now

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.080
So fuck it

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.080
You made the documentary about tower records

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:20.080
To play the game about MP3s

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.080
And shit

01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.080
Jesus, that was an aggressive clap

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.080
Really approved that thought

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:34.080
I agree with him

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:36.080
You just piled in this van

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.080
Full of MP3s

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.080
You're pulling out of the driver place

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.080
And cops

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.080
Cops are coming

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.080
You're hearing them

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.080
Fucking pigs

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.080
Yeah, you're driving

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.080
And you're not even the best driver

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.080
Hey, I'm driving

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.080
I'm not even the best driver

01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.080
Hey, the cops are coming

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.080
Quick, drive better

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.080
Away from the cops

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.080
Please return your tray tables

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.080
All that stuff you say

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:14.080
What a cool van

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.080
Where are we going?

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:18.080
Well, first we got to lose our tail

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.080
Okay, turn left up here

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080
I love this game

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.080
Infinite possibilities, guys

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.080
Turn left up here

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080
You

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:42.080
You turn left down the street

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.080
You're going down an alleyway

01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.080
It's really narrow

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.080
But down at the other side of the alleyway

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.080
It's just a whole other street

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.080
That seems to be free of cops

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.080
Good idea

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.080
Promove, dude, good job

01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.080
It's not my first rodeo

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:04.080
It's my first rodeo

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.080
But let's

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.080
Hey, how are you doing back there?

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:10.080
You other two?

01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.080
I'm having a smashing time, thank you

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.080
I'm feeling really insecure

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.080
Of my Americanness

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.080
As you should

01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.080
It's alright

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.080
None of us are good at channel running

01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.080
You'll get used to it

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.080
I keep driving

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.080
If I feel like I've lost the cops

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.080
I'll go back to the last stand

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:42.080
What's it called?

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.080
You do that

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080
You go out to the other street

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.080
In this street there's no cops

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.080
You seem to have lost them for the moment

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.080
Oh, both, I've got a map

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.080
Can that help?

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.080
You find where you are

01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:06.080
There we are

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.080
I'm just gonna let you go

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.080
Where are we?

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:14.080
Where are we?

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.080
You're in the Barrens

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.080
You're about 15 minutes away

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.080
From Hank's last stand

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.080
Which I don't think is marked on that map

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.080
In Seattle

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.080
Seattle 272

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.080
Hey, let's go to Tacoma

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:34.080
Send every British tourist

01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.080
Ever

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.080
As soon as they get to the airport

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.080
Seattle Tacoma

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.080
Seattle Tacoma

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:48.080
Let's go to Tacoma

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080
Stay out of downtown

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.080
Everywhere

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.080
That's good

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.080
Can we go to Tacoma?

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.080
Tacoma's license plate frame

01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.080
They're not in the state

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.080
They don't have a license plate frame

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.080
I was gonna say

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.080
Dependent on Europeans misunderstanding

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.080
Since 1905

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:10.080
You could definitely head to Tacoma

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.080
No, no, no, come on

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.080
Don't be ridiculous

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.080
Come on, we're gonna go back to where we got the job

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.080
Okay, yeah, let's go there

01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.080
Where's the...

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:22.080
Where is it? Where's the last stand?

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.080
It's not marked on that map

01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.080
Mark it

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.080
Relax

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.080
I know 2072 Seattle

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.080
Like the back of my cybernetic hand

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.080
Come out to the coast

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.080
Have a few laughs

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.080
You screech to a halt

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:50.080
Are we at the last stand?

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.080
No

01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.080
I didn't mean to screech to a halt

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.080
I'm just turning

01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.080
Okay

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.080
Are you telling us we have to tell you

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.080
Where we go?

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080
No, tell me you want to go to the bar

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.080
I said

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.080
I don't think so

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.080
Those at home can rewind

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.080
But I will say again

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.080
I'd like to go to Hank's last stand

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.080
You arrive at Hank's last stand

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.080
You arrive at Hank's last stand

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.080
Hey, any landing you can walk away from, right?

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.080
I don't know if you notice Colin, but my character's based on Bruce Willis

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:36.080
I know a bartender

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.080
You totally tell from your lack of hair

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:42.080
So is there someone in Hank's last stand we need to see?

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.080
Hank

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:46.080
My bartender doesn't help

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.080
Alright, well where the fuck's Hank?

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.080
Hey guys, how's it going?

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:52.080
Hey Hank

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.080
Very well, thank you

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:04.080
Looks like you have some hot vehicular merchandise there

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:06.080
We're coming in hot Hank

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:10.080
Let me let me let you pull into my back garage

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.080
For safe keeping

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.080
This isn't a euphemism for something else

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:16.080
But it sounds like a plan

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.080
Alright, no it's not this time

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.080
Oh, not this time

01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.080
Alright

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.080
You pull into his garage and he's like

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:26.080
What do you guys got for me, a van?

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:30.080
You tell him Bruce

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:34.080
We got the MP3s

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:36.080
The MP3s, that's right

01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.080
We got some MP3s

01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:40.080
Based on that improvisational

01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:42.080
Mission that started with Paul Scheer

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:44.080
Rift some shit

01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:46.080
It's finally over

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:54.080
We yes-handed it for six goddamn weeks

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:58.080
And I'm not saying he kept us from doing anything remarkable

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.080
But it's finally over

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.080
There went a heaven of riffs

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.080
Comedic riffs

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.080
So yeah, we'd like to

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.080
We'd like to offload

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.080
Those, right?

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:12.080
Because they're not just MP3s

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:16.080
They're bootleg MP3s

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.080
That means that we did it illegally

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.080
Which makes it worth more

02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.080
This is going to be worth a lot to me

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.080
You know, we're going to have

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.080
Asses and seats and benches

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.080
And on stools

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080
All the places you need asses

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.080
But you know, there's a small matter of price

02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:42.080
Let's talk terms

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:46.080
Eve Libertine, you usually do the talking

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.080
Am I the, okay

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.080
Don't worry about any of that shit

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.080
I don't know what any of it means

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.080
Just off the top of your head

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.080
I'm severely allergic to seafood

02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.080
Addicted to seafood

02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.080
If that is relevant in any way, shape or form

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.080
You feel seafood withdrawals

02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:08.080
Yeah, so maybe I'm not the finance person this time around

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.080
Yeah, just negotiate

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.080
You're the negotiator

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080
What's the sticker price?

02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.080
Eight

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:18.080
Let's start with that

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.080
I think it's eight

02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.080
The sticker price on all these is six

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.080
Six

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.080
Well, I heard eight and so I'm saying eight

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:32.080
Yeah

02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.080
He drive a hard bargain, but

02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.080
Eight and how worth is his shit right there

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.080
Sorry, we talked over each other

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.080
My bad

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.080
That's not, it happens with me

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:50.080
All right, good job, Eve

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:51.080
Good job

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.080
What I'm good for

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:55.080
All right

02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:57.080
Well, what do you know

02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:59.080
This ragtag group of shadow runners

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.080
Finally did a real shadow run

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.080
We saw it through

02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.080
Why don't we head back into the bar

02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.080
I don't mean to tell you your business

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.080
I'm not the leader or anything

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:14.080
We can go back to the purpose, right?

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.080
Yeah, all right

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.080
Let's get to know each other

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.080
Sit around, have a drink

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.080
All right

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.080
Yeah

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:25.080
Let's do that

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:28.080
No, I don't want this to end

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:31.080
I don't care if you guys have work in the morning

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:41.080
So, you guys still enjoying shadow running?

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:51.080
Yeah, when we do it

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:59.080
Can we just talk to you some more about anything?

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.080
Like what?

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.080
Oh shit, look at this stump

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:12.080
Oh, there's a stump

02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.080
All I want to do is hear you say

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:18.080
It's a tree herder, it's a shepherd of the forest

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:23.080
It's racist among us

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:24.080
All right, that's fine

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.080
We'll end on that note of social equality

02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:38.080
Elliot, I didn't even get your name

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.080
Coco, all right, Elliot and Coco

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080
Very heroic participation

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.080
Colin Hanks, everybody

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:48.080
MC Clarity

02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:51.080
And his flow

02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.080
An easily handed defeat that I will revisit upon him tenfold

02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:57.080
In a future episode

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.080
Zach, the audio maniac

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.080
Justin, our producer in the back

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:05.080
Chris Peruf

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:12.080
Our guest comptroller, Curtis Armstrong

02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.080
My wonderful life partner and best friend Erin McGathy

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:19.080
That will be back soon to suss through all this with us

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.080
I thank your spirit for being awesome in that

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.080
Text message conversation with our neighbors, the Bootsons

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.080
The Bootsons

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:31.080
Spencer Kretnan

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:36.080
We'll see you next Sunday, I believe

02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:43.080
Stay podcasty

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080
Did you get any of that?

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:50.080
It's a good show

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:54.080
Feral Audio
