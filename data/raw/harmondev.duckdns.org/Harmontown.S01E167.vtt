{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.480\nI know, I know, I'm not all dressed up like Jeff, but ladies and gentlemen, I am the\n\n00:29.480 --> 00:42.480\nalternate, Jeff, just for tonight, and this week's Harmontown is now in session!\n\n00:42.480 --> 00:58.300\nYou begin!\n\n00:58.300 --> 01:09.360\nSpencer!\n\n01:09.360 --> 01:20.360\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown himself, his honor, Dan Harmon!\n\n01:20.360 --> 01:34.360\nHello, thank you very much. Thank you. Very kind of you. It's not really kind, it's dur-re-gur.\n\n01:34.360 --> 01:41.360\nIt's dur-re-gur to apply when people come out. What does that mean? I think those are evil dwarves, right?\n\n01:41.360 --> 01:52.360\nDur-re-gur? By default, a mandatory or rather a perfunctory part of the process. Hardly perfunctory.\n\n01:52.360 --> 01:55.360\nJust like evil dwarves. Having you out would not be perfunctory.\n\n01:55.360 --> 02:04.360\nIt's a show with me in it. It is perfunctural to bring me out. It's perfunctural for them to applaud.\n\n02:04.360 --> 02:13.360\nEverything's fake. Everything that you ever thought was real is gone. That's what you came here for tonight, right?\n\n02:13.360 --> 02:29.360\nI saw the line outside. I got the divorce bump. This isn't my first time at the rodeo. I remember last time you guys were hanging from the rafters, I'd just been fired.\n\n02:29.360 --> 02:34.360\nNow, come on, we're always sold out and you guys are always very supportive and you always love me.\n\n02:34.360 --> 02:39.360\nYes, there's the divorce thing. I don't know if I mentioned this, Curtis.\n\n02:39.360 --> 02:45.360\nYou didn't. I'd heard that. I did mention it to everybody at a show yesterday.\n\n02:45.360 --> 02:59.360\nNow it's out. It's good. As you can probably tell, if you follow us on Twitter, it's amicable and mutual.\n\n02:59.360 --> 03:10.360\nIt really is a simple failure of two people to live the American dream of monogamy or commitment, rather. We didn't fail monogamy.\n\n03:10.360 --> 03:24.360\nI'm not like a shake from Dubai or something. We were living together and we were best friends and we were eating pizza and watching movies.\n\n03:24.360 --> 03:33.360\nThen we were kind of like, we could almost do this without being married and all that kind of stuff. How many marriages have you had?\n\n03:33.360 --> 03:49.360\nIt's interesting you say that because my first marriage ended in divorce in much the same way and we decided ultimately that rather than work on saving the marriage, we would work on saving the friendship.\n\n03:49.360 --> 04:03.360\nToday, that woman, my first wife, is in business with my second wife and current wife and she is also the godmother of my daughter.\n\n04:03.360 --> 04:08.360\nSo it can happen when it's done lovingly.\n\n04:08.360 --> 04:16.360\nThat is either a beautiful story or the revelation that Curtis is a strange David Koresh figure.\n\n04:16.360 --> 04:30.360\nAnd her cousin, her 13 year old cousin, is the mother of my next child and we all go to the same gun shows.\n\n04:30.360 --> 04:34.360\nIt's like that Sherlock Holmes troupe of ladies that you're hanging out with.\n\n04:34.360 --> 04:35.360\nOh, you've seen that.\n\n04:35.360 --> 04:37.360\nSee, I know there's crazy shit going on.\n\n04:37.360 --> 04:39.360\nNo, you mentioned that.\n\n04:39.360 --> 04:41.360\nAnd I never asked enough questions about that.\n\n04:41.360 --> 04:43.360\nThe Baker Street babes.\n\n04:43.360 --> 04:45.360\nI don't even know what questions to ask.\n\n04:45.360 --> 04:46.360\nIt's better not to.\n\n04:46.360 --> 04:47.360\nLet's let it be a mystery.\n\n04:47.360 --> 04:51.360\nLet's let Curtis just have his mysterious life.\n\n04:51.360 --> 04:52.360\nWe have an exciting show.\n\n04:52.360 --> 04:54.360\nI have all kinds of shit going on.\n\n04:54.360 --> 04:56.360\nI don't want to spoil all of it in advance.\n\n04:56.360 --> 05:02.360\nIt just runs down anything that I would talk about without bringing people out.\n\n05:02.360 --> 05:03.360\nLet's see.\n\n05:03.360 --> 05:09.360\nI don't have anything in here except for notes about one of our guest's movies, which was interesting.\n\n05:09.360 --> 05:10.360\nWe'll talk to him about in a second.\n\n05:10.360 --> 05:15.360\nBut yeah, there's the divorce thing.\n\n05:15.360 --> 05:16.360\nI don't know if I.\n\n05:16.360 --> 05:19.360\nWell, you brought up an interesting point when you said like saving the friendship.\n\n05:19.360 --> 05:29.360\nI thought what was interesting was, you know, it was Aaron made the very smart like practical decision to after we both like took a lot of space.\n\n05:29.360 --> 05:32.360\nAnd I wouldn't even call and I didn't thinking about it.\n\n05:32.360 --> 05:35.360\nI was just taking time because the therapist recommended.\n\n05:35.360 --> 05:38.360\nShe's like, well, just don't make this decision hastily.\n\n05:38.360 --> 05:40.360\nDon't don't do anything.\n\n05:40.360 --> 05:43.360\nYou know, just like you got nothing but time now you guys get married.\n\n05:43.360 --> 05:44.360\nYou dumbasses.\n\n05:44.360 --> 05:46.360\nShe talked us into it.\n\n05:46.360 --> 05:49.360\nThe the but but it was like, yeah, so just take time.\n\n05:49.360 --> 05:58.360\nAnd I didn't even know and I walked into a couple's therapy session, you know, that we had scheduled and and Aaron started it by having having made a decision.\n\n05:58.360 --> 06:09.360\nAnd it was it was it was very, very brave and thoughtful, but then everything like spiraled into crazy, like shouting and yelling and accusing each other of all of these crimes, you know.\n\n06:09.360 --> 06:18.360\nAnd I think the reason that happens is because it's fucking embarrassing and hurtful to admit that that love didn't work somehow.\n\n06:18.360 --> 06:30.360\nAnd I think you feel weird about it. You feel bad. You feel like you spilled something. And then you and then the easy way to make it less like that is to get mad at this other person.\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:33.360\nLike, oh, we must be breaking up because they're an exceptional piece of shit.\n\n06:33.360 --> 06:42.360\nAnd so just yelling and yelling and for 20 minutes while the therapist sat there and like, OK, you guys can do this for the other 364 days of the year.\n\n06:42.360 --> 06:52.360\nLike, do you want to and then it was kind of this calm sort of settle in and the final epiphany for both of us was, well, wait a minute, if we really are breaking up, if that's really what we're doing,\n\n06:52.360 --> 07:02.360\nthen we can immediately just start being nice to each other because we're both good people that are really nice to strangers all the time and we've only really been mean to each other.\n\n07:02.360 --> 07:10.360\nAnd so we how long did that did that take the process to get to that point three years.\n\n07:10.360 --> 07:21.360\nNo, oh, say, you mean to cool down 20 minutes, 30 minutes of like just kind of like tattling, you know, well, you did this, you did that, and you're like this, and you're like that.\n\n07:21.360 --> 07:37.360\nAnd this is why this is happening. It's your fault. No, it's your fault. Like, if you like, what's the implication there, if you hadn't done something, we'd be, you know, because that's not a good, that's not a good idea to like be married to somebody that's based on like, oh, if you had done this thing,\n\n07:37.360 --> 07:53.360\nit's like, if you had done this butterfly effect thing, it's like much better to think as you walk away from somebody that it's not because of some Mr. Destiny bad movie flower you could have brought or or thing you couldn't have said,\n\n07:53.360 --> 08:01.360\ndidn't say much better to just think that actually, shit, we dodged a bullet before we involved children. Exactly.\n\n08:01.360 --> 08:14.360\nSo now I'm really judgmental of everyone that has kids. Yeah, it's weird. I mean, it's interesting. And by the way, I'm very, very, very proud of her. I'll probably start crying if I talk about that.\n\n08:14.360 --> 08:36.360\nBut, but I mean, I, like, especially I feel like, like, you know, if the relationship was toxic, it was definitely toxic because of me and that toxicity came with a dynamic that was uneven, and the uneven dynamic came with a comfort level that was probably difficult for her to, you know,\n\n08:36.360 --> 08:54.360\nis very, very, very brave and admirable for her to actually be the one to put the dog down, you know, instead of waiting. And, and, and like, that's, I think, I think I feel like the moral of the story is like, or the irony of it is that we got married and we,\n\n08:54.360 --> 09:07.360\nwe were imperfect people that got married, maybe for imperfect reasons. And because it wasn't working for that reason, then we went to couples therapy and said, like, Well, how do we make this work? And she said, Well, first of all, you're both nuts. And like, I'll start seeing both of you separately, which,\n\n09:07.360 --> 09:20.360\nof course, that's one way to triple your money as a therapist. But I do also think that that she was right. And because because she started seeing Aaron separately and seeing me separately and seeing us both as a couple.\n\n09:20.360 --> 09:33.360\nAnd we were learning about how couples are supposed to work and how all this stuff works. And I think that I think maybe the unspoken thing the whole time, you know, was that we were both learning well, given that this is how this works and given that given that I,\n\n09:33.360 --> 09:48.360\nI'm capable of being a normal person alone, like maybe we didn't we didn't really look at it until it was like right in front of our face and then it all happened very quickly. But I think that's the nice thing about it is that you don't,\n\n09:48.360 --> 10:05.360\nyou don't enter a, you don't enter a relationship for flawed reasons, and then leave it because you're more flawed, you leave it because you get better, you leave it because you improved, you grew and learned stuff. And she's great.\n\n10:05.360 --> 10:22.360\nI'm friends with 99% of all of my exes, but I'll certainly continue to be like really good friends with her because she's one of the funniest people I've ever met and and and and and and and and.\n\n10:22.360 --> 10:25.360\nand blibbity-blop. Give me my podcast award now.\n\n10:25.360 --> 10:39.360\nIt's weird. It's weird. The round of applause is weird. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm\n\n10:39.360 --> 10:42.600\nsaying it sounds weird. It's all weird. If I was watching from an alien planet, I'd be\n\n10:42.600 --> 10:46.520\nlike, that's weird. It's weird what you're doing. Why did you play that recording of\n\n10:46.520 --> 10:51.560\nyou crying when your cat died? There's a guy that tweeted at me that he couldn't believe.\n\n10:51.560 --> 10:55.320\nIt was like, why did you do that? I'm like, why did you do that? I'm so mad at that guy\n\n10:55.320 --> 10:59.680\nstill. I was like, what did you think I was trying to do? Impress people? I played a recording\n\n10:59.680 --> 11:05.320\nof me crying. It sounds horrible and fake and dumb. It was like, no, no, no. It's just\n\n11:05.320 --> 11:08.560\nyou kind of weird that you did that. I was wondering why you did it. I did it because\n\n11:08.560 --> 11:09.560\nyou're mama.\n\n11:09.560 --> 11:13.560\nIt is. Is Faith dead?\n\n11:13.560 --> 11:17.560\nNo, she's fine. Oh, Faith is great, by the way. That's why you really came.\n\n11:17.560 --> 11:25.560\nYou just said she died. All right. What else did you do? I know there is a, I don't think,\n\n11:25.560 --> 11:30.160\nI think I'm going to cheap this up my sleeve because it seems like a good thing to have\n\n11:30.160 --> 11:36.360\nup your sleeve, but I, an authentic MC challenged me to a rap battle on Twitter.\n\n11:36.360 --> 11:37.360\nReally?\n\n11:37.360 --> 11:40.360\nAre you here, MC Clarity? Okay.\n\n11:40.360 --> 11:42.360\nOh, damn.\n\n11:42.360 --> 11:53.560\nYeah. And I'm not being racist when I say he's an authentic MC. Yes, he's black. I looked\n\n11:53.560 --> 12:00.000\nat his Instagram, not at his face. I looked and he's got, there's flyers, like you're,\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.360\nyou're a, is it safe to call you a professional MC?\n\n12:03.360 --> 12:08.360\nHave you ever gotten like some of the door?\n\n12:08.360 --> 12:10.360\nI've gotten the door.\n\n12:10.360 --> 12:13.360\nProfessional? No, no, no. Like, I mean, I mean, taking like, like, like, do they do,\n\n12:13.360 --> 12:16.360\nlike open MC nights? Like, like,\n\n12:16.360 --> 12:19.360\nAll of you professionals, does everyone think they're a professional?\n\n12:19.360 --> 12:26.360\nIt's just like, have you ever received a dollar for MCing in any indirect way?\n\n12:26.360 --> 12:28.360\nOkay. He's trying to dodge the issue.\n\n12:28.360 --> 12:37.360\nTonight I'm going to take down a professional, a legit, a legit MC.\n\n12:37.360 --> 12:52.360\nYeah. Yeah. And, yeah. And with, and with him, I'm going to take down racial stereotypes.\n\n12:52.360 --> 12:57.360\nYou're welcome. You're welcome white people. You're welcome black people. You're welcome\n\n12:57.360 --> 13:03.360\nhip hop. You're welcome Harmontown. You're welcome. You're welcome.\n\n13:03.360 --> 13:05.360\nWe appreciate it.\n\n13:05.360 --> 13:09.360\nYou're welcome. All right. Well, let's, let's move on that because we got a cavalcade of,\n\n13:09.360 --> 13:14.360\nof, of, of odd wonders tonight. Like, it's very starting. Well, by the way, Curtis Armstrong,\n\n13:14.360 --> 13:18.360\nour guest comptroller. So good to have you back.\n\n13:18.360 --> 13:22.360\nAnd honor as usual.\n\n13:22.360 --> 13:26.360\nOkay. So there was this thing. It was called, it was, it was called records.\n\n13:26.360 --> 13:30.360\nLike before most of you kind of started listening to stuff.\n\n13:30.360 --> 13:34.360\nThere was like, there were these chunks of vinyl that I don't even know how they made them,\n\n13:34.360 --> 13:38.360\nbut because they were kind of going out when I was like younger.\n\n13:38.360 --> 13:44.360\nAnd there was this, there's this guy that made this documentary about the rise and fall of the\n\n13:44.360 --> 13:51.360\nbiggest vinyl retailer turn that ended up becoming also the biggest CD retailer.\n\n13:51.360 --> 13:56.360\nTower Records is a fixture of Los Angeles started in Sacramento, quickly moved to San Francisco.\n\n13:56.360 --> 13:59.360\nIt just exploded. It was, it was, it's so ubiquitous.\n\n13:59.360 --> 14:04.360\nLike until I watched this documentary that he made, I wasn't even realizing that it was a story\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:08.360\nthat you could follow that had a rise and a fall, but indeed it did because they just went out of\n\n14:08.360 --> 14:12.360\nbusiness and, and marking the end of an, of an era.\n\n14:12.360 --> 14:18.360\nThis guy is very talented documentary director. He, he's also an actor every once in a while.\n\n14:18.360 --> 14:23.360\nWhy don't we talk to him about, about one or both? Please welcome Colin Hanks.\n\n14:23.360 --> 14:38.360\nColin Hanks.\n\n14:38.360 --> 14:41.360\nHello.\n\n14:41.360 --> 14:42.360\nHi Dan.\n\n14:42.360 --> 14:44.360\nHow many, how many, how many divorces are you on?\n\n14:44.360 --> 14:47.360\nI'm on four.\n\n14:47.360 --> 14:52.360\nWe're including all the different family members, but so, because it affects everybody.\n\n14:52.360 --> 14:59.360\nSo there's my parents divorce and then my wife's parents divorce and then a couple of uncles,\n\n14:59.360 --> 15:01.360\nmaybe cousin.\n\n15:01.360 --> 15:04.360\nDid you ever get the, it's not your fault divorce talk?\n\n15:04.360 --> 15:09.360\nAlways. That's part of the contract of having a divorce. I think it's, it's legally binding.\n\n15:09.360 --> 15:13.360\nYeah. You have to tell the kids it's not your fault, which is the, a child's earliest encounter\n\n15:13.360 --> 15:15.360\nwith the concept of protesting too much.\n\n15:15.360 --> 15:16.360\nYes.\n\n15:16.360 --> 15:19.360\nSo are you going to have like the conversation with the cat or dog?\n\n15:19.360 --> 15:21.360\nWe already told Spencer it's his fault.\n\n15:21.360 --> 15:22.360\nYeah.\n\n15:22.360 --> 15:25.360\nBut I get full custody.\n\n15:25.360 --> 15:27.360\nOf both of us.\n\n15:27.360 --> 15:28.360\nYeah.\n\n15:28.360 --> 15:33.360\nThe, but I remember very distinctly writing with my dad and our station wagon and, and,\n\n15:33.360 --> 15:35.360\nand like, it was, it was really delayed.\n\n15:35.360 --> 15:40.360\nAnd I say this with, with, with a lot of love for my dad, like, like, I think he's long since\n\n15:40.360 --> 15:43.360\nstopped like listening because I'm always like, I'm always like casting shit about,\n\n15:43.360 --> 15:45.360\nyou know, backward at my parents.\n\n15:45.360 --> 15:52.360\nBut, but I just remember like, I remember like, I was, I was like looking at a comic book\n\n15:52.360 --> 15:56.360\nand I remember my dad trying to like awkwardly launch into the, it's not your fault talk\n\n15:56.360 --> 15:58.360\nbecause my, my parents were getting separated.\n\n15:58.360 --> 16:00.360\nThey ended up staying together.\n\n16:00.360 --> 16:03.360\nBut it was just also alarm everybody.\n\n16:03.360 --> 16:05.360\nMost awkward thing in the world.\n\n16:05.360 --> 16:07.360\nWhat an interview, Dan. Good job.\n\n16:07.360 --> 16:13.360\nWell, I would say this, the, the, it's not your fault talk always sort of segue it like,\n\n16:13.360 --> 16:20.360\nno matter how it goes, it's so uncomfortable for the parents that it always segues into\n\n16:20.360 --> 16:23.360\nto Christmas conversation.\n\n16:23.360 --> 16:32.360\nAnd I remember being super jealous because when I was a kid, I was in like my neighborhood,\n\n16:32.360 --> 16:35.360\nI was the only divorced.\n\n16:35.360 --> 16:37.360\nI was the only child of divorce.\n\n16:37.360 --> 16:42.360\nAll my other friends, their parents were married until they all went off to college.\n\n16:42.360 --> 16:47.360\nAnd then all the parents divorced, which is super fucked up.\n\n16:47.360 --> 16:52.360\nBut I remember being super jealous at all their, all their, all my friends,\n\n16:52.360 --> 16:53.360\nparents were still married.\n\n16:53.360 --> 16:56.360\nAnd I remember even going so like deep into it.\n\n16:56.360 --> 16:59.360\nThat's like, man, all right, yeah, two Christmases, whatever.\n\n16:59.360 --> 17:04.360\nBut if I was Jewish, I would have gotten 16 Hanukkahs.\n\n17:04.360 --> 17:06.360\nThat would have been fucking crap.\n\n17:06.360 --> 17:07.360\nWow.\n\n17:07.360 --> 17:08.360\nYeah.\n\n17:08.360 --> 17:10.360\nThat's about the extent of my math humor.\n\n17:10.360 --> 17:12.360\nYeah.\n\n17:12.360 --> 17:15.360\nBut I just keep going because every Jewish kid I've ever talked to,\n\n17:15.360 --> 17:19.360\nthe first thing they lead with is like, don't, that's not eight Christmases.\n\n17:19.360 --> 17:23.360\nIt's like, it's like eight shitty half stockings.\n\n17:23.360 --> 17:26.360\nIt's like, it's like a go-bot if you're lucky.\n\n17:26.360 --> 17:33.360\nIt's like, it's like eight, it's eight presents from the aunt that clearly does not know you is what it is.\n\n17:33.360 --> 17:34.360\nYeah.\n\n17:34.360 --> 17:36.360\nIt's like, like vampire teeth.\n\n17:36.360 --> 17:37.360\nIt's great.\n\n17:37.360 --> 17:43.360\nI guess, I guess our people are chosen.\n\n17:43.360 --> 17:48.360\nI don't know if this is the day we're supposed to prove that, but I feel great.\n\n17:48.360 --> 17:55.360\nI'm off to school where the last three months have been dedicated to our Lord and Savior.\n\n17:55.360 --> 17:59.360\nIn the form of just fucking lavish, like blinking lights.\n\n17:59.360 --> 18:02.360\nIt's like, Christ was born.\n\n18:02.360 --> 18:03.360\nEveryone, here's $20.\n\n18:03.360 --> 18:06.360\nHere's a candy cane for breakfast.\n\n18:06.360 --> 18:09.360\nI'm doing 80 stand-up.\n\n18:09.360 --> 18:11.360\nI'm doing John Stewart's act.\n\n18:11.360 --> 18:13.360\nAll of the stereotypes are being broken tonight.\n\n18:13.360 --> 18:15.360\nAll of them.\n\n18:15.360 --> 18:16.360\nAll right.\n\n18:16.360 --> 18:17.360\nSo you made this documentary.\n\n18:17.360 --> 18:23.360\nIt's called, it's called, what, now it is, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.\n\n18:23.360 --> 18:26.360\nI want to say this too shall pass because it's the Buddhist thing, but it's not that.\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:27.360\nNo, it's all things must pass.\n\n18:27.360 --> 18:28.360\nAll things must pass.\n\n18:28.360 --> 18:29.360\nYes.\n\n18:29.360 --> 18:31.360\nAnd there's significance to that that I won't spoil.\n\n18:31.360 --> 18:35.360\nAlthough I will say this documentary, this will sound like a lack of endorsement,\n\n18:35.360 --> 18:37.360\nbut really it's the remarkable thing about this documentary.\n\n18:37.360 --> 18:40.360\nThere are no twists in this story.\n\n18:40.360 --> 18:42.360\nNo, you know how all the stores close.\n\n18:42.360 --> 18:43.360\nYeah.\n\n18:43.360 --> 18:44.360\nLiterally all the, all the, all the things that.\n\n18:44.360 --> 18:45.360\nAnd you know why?\n\n18:45.360 --> 18:46.360\nI mean, they could guess why.\n\n18:46.360 --> 18:52.360\nAnd, and, okay, this is a place that, that started right when, you know, I mean, they,\n\n18:52.360 --> 18:55.360\nthey, they started selling records and then 1963 happens.\n\n18:55.360 --> 18:56.360\nThe Beach Boys become a thing.\n\n18:56.360 --> 18:57.360\nThe Beatles become a thing.\n\n18:57.360 --> 19:01.360\nThe, the single culture goes to an album culture and this place explodes.\n\n19:01.360 --> 19:02.360\nYeah.\n\n19:02.360 --> 19:05.360\nBut, but yeah, I know that wasn't a question.\n\n19:05.360 --> 19:06.360\nNo.\n\n19:06.360 --> 19:11.360\nThe, and they also can guess that then guess, guess what, guess why it all ends, but it's,\n\n19:11.360 --> 19:15.360\nthat doesn't make it at all an interesting to like trace every step of this.\n\n19:15.360 --> 19:21.360\nWell, no, I mean, and that is actually sort of the first, that was the thing that interested\n\n19:21.360 --> 19:28.360\nme to, to start making it is I found out that this guy Russ Solomon who founded Tower Records,\n\n19:28.360 --> 19:35.360\nhe started selling used 78s from his father's drug store in 1939, 41.\n\n19:35.360 --> 19:42.360\nIt's the, the, he's a little bit hazy with those dates, but that's how he started selling\n\n19:42.360 --> 19:43.360\nrecords.\n\n19:43.360 --> 19:49.360\nAnd then by the time that Tower Records closed its doors, he had 192 stores around the world.\n\n19:49.360 --> 19:55.360\nAnd so that little like factoid got me super supremely interested in just the overall arc\n\n19:55.360 --> 20:04.360\nand I got lost in the most mundane minutiae of Tower Records and all of the little fascinating\n\n20:04.360 --> 20:08.360\nthings from a historical perspective that I, that I find to be really interesting.\n\n20:08.360 --> 20:14.360\nThe fact that, you know, he opens up the first Tower, the true Tower Records in 1960.\n\n20:14.360 --> 20:19.360\nHe spends eight years kind of perfecting it, opening three stores in Sacramento and then\n\n20:19.360 --> 20:26.360\non basically he goes into San Francisco to go sleep with some woman who works at his\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:27.360\nbarbershop.\n\n20:27.360 --> 20:29.360\nOh yeah, that story is so interesting.\n\n20:29.360 --> 20:30.360\nThe story is incredible.\n\n20:30.360 --> 20:31.360\nIt's incredible.\n\n20:31.360 --> 20:35.360\nAnd he totally glides over in the documentary, the fact that he's married with a kid.\n\n20:35.360 --> 20:42.360\nHe doesn't mention that like at all, even though we have footage of him with his son\n\n20:42.360 --> 20:47.360\ntalking about how his wife was the bookkeeper at the pharmacy.\n\n20:47.360 --> 20:48.360\nBut anyway.\n\n20:48.360 --> 20:50.360\nI thought that was such a charming story.\n\n20:50.360 --> 20:51.360\nIt is a charming story though.\n\n20:51.360 --> 20:53.360\nIt is a charming story.\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:58.360\nHe goes to San Francisco, has this great night with this lady and then wakes up super hung\n\n20:58.360 --> 21:04.360\nover and finds this location in San Francisco and decides he wants to open up a Tower Records.\n\n21:04.360 --> 21:11.360\nHe opens up in March of 68 right before San Francisco is invaded by hundreds of thousands\n\n21:11.360 --> 21:13.360\nof dirty hippies from all over the world.\n\n21:13.360 --> 21:19.360\nAnd that ends up being the summer love and it becomes the most popular store in all of San Francisco.\n\n21:19.360 --> 21:20.360\nRight.\n\n21:20.360 --> 21:24.360\nAnd so I found all of these little things like that supremely fascinating.\n\n21:24.360 --> 21:30.360\nAnd I think a lot of people who kind of know some of the history of that can like go into\n\n21:30.360 --> 21:35.360\nit thinking, oh, it's just going to be a documentary of dates and places in historical context and\n\n21:35.360 --> 21:36.360\nall that stuff.\n\n21:36.360 --> 21:38.360\nAnd oh, we miss vinyl.\n\n21:38.360 --> 21:46.360\nBut really what the story is is about Russ and this group of, you know, people that worked\n\n21:46.360 --> 21:52.360\nat Tower that ended up working at this place for 30 plus years and really became like a\n\n21:52.360 --> 21:54.360\nfamily as cheesy as that may sound.\n\n21:54.360 --> 22:01.360\nThey became a family and worked together and had a fucking blast going around the world\n\n22:01.360 --> 22:03.360\nworking in the music business.\n\n22:03.360 --> 22:09.360\nAnd they get married, they get divorced, they have children, they have so much fun.\n\n22:09.360 --> 22:13.360\nAnd then at the end of it, they all have to fire each other.\n\n22:13.360 --> 22:14.360\nYeah.\n\n22:14.360 --> 22:15.360\nThat's crazy.\n\n22:15.360 --> 22:19.360\nIt reminded me of like a documentary about Ireland.\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:24.360\nIt was like that whole horrible like the Michael Collins era because it turns into...\n\n22:24.360 --> 22:27.360\nThey had to do more than fire each other.\n\n22:27.360 --> 22:28.360\nYeah.\n\n22:28.360 --> 22:31.360\nBut I mean, it ends up becoming this other journey that I don't think many people think\n\n22:31.360 --> 22:32.360\nof.\n\n22:32.360 --> 22:33.360\nYou know, we were talking about this earlier.\n\n22:33.360 --> 22:39.360\nYou know, I think for a large group of people relatively our age, I'm looking...\n\n22:39.360 --> 22:41.360\nYeah, I think we're all cool.\n\n22:41.360 --> 22:46.360\nI think for people relatively our age, you know, if they were even just a sort of like\n\n22:46.360 --> 22:50.360\ncasual music fan, they would just think of Tower as the place that was everywhere and\n\n22:50.360 --> 22:52.360\nsold overpriced CDs.\n\n22:52.360 --> 22:53.360\nRight.\n\n22:53.360 --> 22:54.360\nYeah.\n\n22:54.360 --> 22:57.360\nYou mentioned that backstage because that is part of the story is that all of a sudden\n\n22:57.360 --> 23:03.360\nBest Buy Target, everybody starts being able to sell CDs for $10 a CD, which is how much\n\n23:03.360 --> 23:06.360\nit costs to buy them and put them out on the shelf.\n\n23:06.360 --> 23:08.360\nAnd they're just like, we don't give a shit.\n\n23:08.360 --> 23:12.360\nIf you buy your Britney Spears here, you'll buy more milk.\n\n23:12.360 --> 23:16.360\nAnd then the Tower Records across the street is like, we have to sell these for $20 or\n\n23:16.360 --> 23:18.360\nwe're going to go out of business.\n\n23:18.360 --> 23:24.360\nAnd it's hard to even for me to wrap my head around and I'm sure therefore for these little\n\n23:24.360 --> 23:27.360\nlittle, little profligate fucks.\n\n23:27.360 --> 23:31.360\nI was going to say whippersnappers, but that works too.\n\n23:31.360 --> 23:35.360\nIs that before the internet, which I can barely remember now.\n\n23:35.360 --> 23:39.360\nAnd it was like, imagine you mentioned the hate Ashbury movement.\n\n23:39.360 --> 23:44.360\nSo imagine like there's no internet, the newspaper is filled with lies.\n\n23:44.360 --> 23:49.360\nThere is no, you know, short of smoke signals or like, you know, just hanging out in a drum\n\n23:49.360 --> 23:50.360\ncircle or something.\n\n23:50.360 --> 23:55.360\nThere's, there's not really a kind of, there's not really a hotbed of like kind of counter\n\n23:55.360 --> 24:01.360\ncultural or even just straight cultural like, like, like check-in points and to have these\n\n24:01.360 --> 24:03.360\ngiant, these giant record stores keep going up.\n\n24:03.360 --> 24:07.360\nAnd that's why they ended up being 192 of them is because everywhere that they were, they\n\n24:07.360 --> 24:09.360\nwere never in, they were never in our Wisconsin.\n\n24:09.360 --> 24:14.360\nThey would never, they never, they made it to, they had like 35 of them in Japan before\n\n24:14.360 --> 24:18.360\nthey had one in New York, but they never, and some, it almost has to do, it almost seems\n\n24:18.360 --> 24:23.360\nto have to do with that kind of cosmopolitan need at that time, because the same technology\n\n24:23.360 --> 24:30.360\nthat ended up killing records in general would also supplant the need for, I don't know,\n\n24:30.360 --> 24:34.360\nthe equivalent of barn raising among, among people who want to care about something other\n\n24:34.360 --> 24:36.360\nthan what Nixon is telling them or something.\n\n24:36.360 --> 24:37.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n24:37.360 --> 24:38.360\nNo, totally.\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:40.360\nI mean, like, it was really, I found to be super best.\n\n24:40.360 --> 24:41.360\nI resent that sound.\n\n24:41.360 --> 24:43.360\nI just, you know, I think that.\n\n24:43.360 --> 24:44.360\nGuys, Nixon was a bad dude.\n\n24:44.360 --> 24:45.360\nI think we've established that.\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:46.360\nIt's almost famous for it.\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:48.360\nIt's almost famous for it.\n\n24:48.360 --> 24:50.360\nWhen you come in, we've got serious issues.\n\n24:50.360 --> 24:57.360\nNo, like, the thing that I want to, I mean, there are a lot of things that I love about\n\n24:57.360 --> 25:05.360\nthe overall story with Tower, but the thing that I found to be most insightful and also\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:11.360\nreally inspiring was the fact that, you know, sure, it ended when there were 192 stores,\n\n25:11.360 --> 25:14.360\nand there are a lot of reasons why Tower ended.\n\n25:14.360 --> 25:20.360\nIt's not just the, you know, Aaron Sorkin's simple answer of like, oh, Napster killed it.\n\n25:20.360 --> 25:21.360\nYou know what I mean?\n\n25:21.360 --> 25:22.360\nIt's not that at all.\n\n25:22.360 --> 25:27.360\nAnd we spend a large portion of the film actually really discussing what it was that actually\n\n25:27.360 --> 25:28.360\nkilled Tower.\n\n25:28.360 --> 25:30.360\nWhich I found fascinating not to interrupt you, but that is.\n\n25:30.360 --> 25:34.360\nYeah, I mean, well, because that's the thing that I find really interesting because I always\n\n25:34.360 --> 25:38.360\njust assumed like everyone else like, oh, the internet came and it just changed everything.\n\n25:38.360 --> 25:40.360\nAnd no one could control it at all.\n\n25:40.360 --> 25:45.360\nHowever, as we all know, Apple, which made computers and phones, decided to become the\n\n25:45.360 --> 25:46.360\nmusic industry.\n\n25:46.360 --> 25:47.360\nYeah.\n\n25:47.360 --> 25:50.360\nThey made that decision and Tower at the time had a website and it's revealed at one point\n\n25:50.360 --> 25:51.360\nat that exact moment.\n\n25:51.360 --> 25:52.360\nYeah.\n\n25:52.360 --> 25:53.360\nTheir website was on AOL.\n\n25:53.360 --> 25:54.360\nYeah.\n\n25:54.360 --> 25:56.360\nAnd it was like this little like Rinky Dink website.\n\n25:56.360 --> 25:59.360\nAnd it was just like, they could only be so progressive for so long.\n\n25:59.360 --> 26:00.360\nExactly.\n\n26:00.360 --> 26:04.360\nYou know, you can go, you can go from LPs to CDs, but you can't then also be have, you\n\n26:04.360 --> 26:06.360\ncan't keep juggling those chainsaws.\n\n26:06.360 --> 26:10.360\nSo, and there's so much new technology that ends up sort of coming up.\n\n26:10.360 --> 26:16.360\nAnd Tower was one of these places where they really prided themselves on trying.\n\n26:16.360 --> 26:19.360\nIt was not a company that was run from the top down.\n\n26:19.360 --> 26:24.360\nIt wasn't some, it wasn't Russ Solomon saying, here is how you do this stuff.\n\n26:24.360 --> 26:26.360\nGo make me rich.\n\n26:26.360 --> 26:28.360\nIt was, here's the keys to the store.\n\n26:28.360 --> 26:30.360\nStock what you want.\n\n26:30.360 --> 26:32.360\nStock what you think people are going to like.\n\n26:32.360 --> 26:34.360\nHide the coke when the cops come by.\n\n26:34.360 --> 26:36.360\nYeah, decorate it however you want.\n\n26:36.360 --> 26:39.360\nJust don't show up drunk or high.\n\n26:39.360 --> 26:43.360\nAnd if you do, then go home and don't fuck me over.\n\n26:43.360 --> 26:45.360\nAnd that was how the company ran.\n\n26:45.360 --> 26:46.360\nAnd it worked for 30 years.\n\n26:46.360 --> 26:47.360\nYeah.\n\n26:47.360 --> 26:52.360\nAnd it was, yeah, it's like a sort of model of the, the, the, the souls in that movie\n\n26:52.360 --> 26:56.360\nwho more than one of them does that awesome documentary thing, which is what I go to\n\n26:56.360 --> 27:00.360\ndocumentaries for where they, they, they're talking about something that seems innocuous\n\n27:00.360 --> 27:04.360\nand then their throat catches because they've been there.\n\n27:04.360 --> 27:10.360\nThose souls are, they, they, they're couching it as a cautionary tale.\n\n27:10.360 --> 27:14.360\nOh, we put ourselves out of business by not seeing MP3 coming or something like that.\n\n27:14.360 --> 27:20.360\nThe, but the real story is that it was a, it was an actual successful demonstration\n\n27:20.360 --> 27:22.360\nof really non-corporate.\n\n27:22.360 --> 27:23.360\nYeah.\n\n27:23.360 --> 27:24.360\nAnarchic.\n\n27:24.360 --> 27:25.360\nYeah.\n\n27:25.360 --> 27:30.360\nA small business turned to take into a global level.\n\n27:30.360 --> 27:31.360\nYeah.\n\n27:31.360 --> 27:35.360\nWith God knows how many employees, including their newsletter and all this stuff.\n\n27:35.360 --> 27:38.360\nIt was like they never, they had one accountant practically the entire time.\n\n27:38.360 --> 27:39.360\nYeah.\n\n27:39.360 --> 27:43.360\nAnd they didn't need to, there is no, there's no necessary need to all of a sudden like\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:48.360\ntake your stock public and start being beholden to a bunch of things and, and mutual funds\n\n27:48.360 --> 27:49.360\nand get company booby-doo.\n\n27:49.360 --> 27:53.360\nIt was like, it was like, it was just a bunch of people that couldn't get jobs anywhere else.\n\n27:53.360 --> 27:55.360\nAnd they liked selling records.\n\n27:55.360 --> 27:58.360\nAnd, and they kept growing and growing and growing that way.\n\n27:58.360 --> 28:00.360\nAnd they just kept, they just kept going.\n\n28:00.360 --> 28:05.360\nAnd they would go to, they would just constantly always be in that right place at the right\n\n28:05.360 --> 28:06.360\ntime.\n\n28:06.360 --> 28:12.360\nAnd as much as they would have the big stores in the, you know, like Los Angeles, San Francisco,\n\n28:12.360 --> 28:13.360\neventually New York.\n\n28:13.360 --> 28:17.360\nAnd then you'd get into the Chicago's, the New Orleans and stuff like that.\n\n28:17.360 --> 28:24.360\nThey would also have small stores in Stockton and sort of those off the beat sort of, you\n\n28:24.360 --> 28:29.360\nknow, off the beaten path type places where not a lot was going on culturally or, you\n\n28:29.360 --> 28:34.360\nknow, the places where, you know, the bigger bands would not stop to play.\n\n28:34.360 --> 28:35.360\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n28:35.360 --> 28:42.360\nAnd so they had, they really had a mentality, which was we want to be that place wherever\n\n28:42.360 --> 28:45.360\nwe are, where it doesn't matter what you look like.\n\n28:45.360 --> 28:47.360\nIt doesn't matter what you're into.\n\n28:47.360 --> 28:51.360\nYou can come in, you can hang out, and it doesn't even matter if you have money.\n\n28:51.360 --> 28:57.360\nWe will not bother you unless you want to be bothered, unless you piss us off.\n\n28:57.360 --> 29:00.360\nAnd you can hang out for as long as you want.\n\n29:00.360 --> 29:04.360\nAnd if you don't leave with, you know, a record, that's fine.\n\n29:04.360 --> 29:07.360\nYou know, maybe you'll come back and then the next time you'll buy something.\n\n29:07.360 --> 29:11.360\nAnd then maybe when you buy something, maybe you'll be open to hearing some of our suggestions\n\n29:11.360 --> 29:13.360\nand then you'll leave with, you know, 14 different records.\n\n29:13.360 --> 29:17.360\nYeah, one thing I thought was interesting about that, by the way, was that I never\n\n29:17.360 --> 29:26.360\nknew was the album culture plus the CD culture became, you can't be experimental\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:28.360\nabout your music consuming anymore.\n\n29:28.360 --> 29:29.360\nYeah.\n\n29:29.360 --> 29:34.360\nWhen you could just pay $3 for a piece of, you know, black plastic that was like,\n\n29:34.360 --> 29:38.360\nit was like you could, you were more incentivized to kind of leave there with a big box full\n\n29:38.360 --> 29:39.360\nof stuff.\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:40.360\nTotally.\n\n29:40.360 --> 29:44.360\nBecause when you go to the library, it might have been like shit you might never listen\n\n29:44.360 --> 29:48.360\nto, but then you do listen to it and you're like, now I'm into Aretha Franklin or something.\n\n29:48.360 --> 29:50.360\nAnd then that turns into holy shit.\n\n29:50.360 --> 29:54.360\nI only have so much allowance and Britney Spears doesn't have any singles out on CD.\n\n29:54.360 --> 29:58.360\nWell, and that ended up being the most fascinating nugget.\n\n29:58.360 --> 30:03.360\nWhen I asked Russ, I said, if you had to like blame everything on something else besides\n\n30:03.360 --> 30:08.360\nwhat, what you did, I said, what would be, you know, what would it be?\n\n30:08.360 --> 30:11.360\nNapster, would it be, you know, poor management?\n\n30:11.360 --> 30:13.360\nLike, what, what would it be?\n\n30:13.360 --> 30:19.360\nAnd he actually said the biggest, the, the, in his opinion, the biggest mistake was they\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:20.360\nstopped selling singles.\n\n30:20.360 --> 30:24.360\nNow, if you think about this, and I don't want to get too boring here, but, you know,\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:27.360\ndo you, anyone here remember buying cassette singles?\n\n30:27.360 --> 30:28.360\nYes.\n\n30:28.360 --> 30:29.360\nYes.\n\n30:29.360 --> 30:30.360\nOkay.\n\n30:30.360 --> 30:31.360\nRight.\n\n30:31.360 --> 30:32.360\nThat's how you started your addiction to buying music.\n\n30:32.360 --> 30:35.360\nWhether you know it or not, that's how it started.\n\n30:35.360 --> 30:39.360\nJust that small little hit first and then next thing you know, you're going into that\n\n30:39.360 --> 30:45.360\nstore and you're buying maybe more singles or maybe you're buying the full albums that\n\n30:45.360 --> 30:49.360\nyou know, eventually at some point it's the full cassette, full CDs, whatever.\n\n30:49.360 --> 30:54.360\nOnce they stopped selling singles, they lost an entire generation of kids.\n\n30:54.360 --> 30:56.360\nAnd I know this because I'm that age.\n\n30:56.360 --> 30:57.360\nI was that age.\n\n30:57.360 --> 30:59.360\nI remember when they stopped selling CDs.\n\n30:59.360 --> 31:02.360\nBut you weren't choosing between going to Tower Records and downloading an MP3.\n\n31:02.360 --> 31:04.360\nNo, but here's the thing.\n\n31:04.360 --> 31:10.360\nI remember when they stopped selling singles, but at that point I was like, I love music\n\n31:10.360 --> 31:11.360\nso much.\n\n31:11.360 --> 31:12.360\nI'll buy CDs.\n\n31:12.360 --> 31:13.360\nI'll still do it.\n\n31:13.360 --> 31:14.360\nYou just couldn't buy as many.\n\n31:14.360 --> 31:16.360\nI just couldn't buy as many, but I'll still do it.\n\n31:16.360 --> 31:18.360\nAnd you had to be very careful about your choices.\n\n31:18.360 --> 31:19.360\nExactly.\n\n31:19.360 --> 31:20.360\nSo you're going to flatten out.\n\n31:20.360 --> 31:25.360\nBut you're going to lose an entire generation of kids even going into a store.\n\n31:25.360 --> 31:30.360\nAnd once you do that, you lose an entire generation of future customers.\n\n31:30.360 --> 31:35.360\nThat generation of kids all were in college when Napster was released.\n\n31:35.360 --> 31:36.360\nYeah.\n\n31:36.360 --> 31:37.360\nThey had no loyalty to anything.\n\n31:37.360 --> 31:38.360\nThey had no loyalty anyways.\n\n31:38.360 --> 31:40.360\nAnd I think they're being too hard on themselves.\n\n31:40.360 --> 31:43.360\nHonestly, I don't think if they had sold singles, I don't think they could have competed with\n\n31:43.360 --> 31:44.360\nNapster.\n\n31:44.360 --> 31:50.360\nBut it's easier to compete, you know, a small single that costs, I don't know, maybe a\n\n31:50.360 --> 31:54.360\nbuck, two bucks, that's easier to compete with than completely free.\n\n31:54.360 --> 31:57.360\nLogically, technically, it's there.\n\n31:57.360 --> 32:04.360\nI also think that, obviously, without the actual, like, I cannot put on pants, they would\n\n32:04.360 --> 32:09.360\nhave had to have a Netflix visionary idea in addition to already having a visionary\n\n32:09.360 --> 32:10.360\nidea of being Tower Records.\n\n32:10.360 --> 32:15.360\nI feel like it's a beautiful bell curve, this beautiful trajectory of like, you know, all\n\n32:15.360 --> 32:16.360\nthings have to come to an end.\n\n32:16.360 --> 32:19.360\nI mean, like, you don't want this thing to become Disney or anything.\n\n32:19.360 --> 32:24.360\nIt's this beautiful bell curve that lasts an entire generation and traces the evolution\n\n32:24.360 --> 32:25.360\nof music.\n\n32:25.360 --> 32:27.360\nAnd it is a bummer.\n\n32:27.360 --> 32:30.360\nAnd in the end, the sad, it's like, well, this is how it ends.\n\n32:30.360 --> 32:33.360\nIt never ends really great.\n\n32:33.360 --> 32:36.360\nIt's not like a sort of like green, like euthanasia chamber.\n\n32:36.360 --> 32:42.360\nIt's like the jaws of capitalism and the loans being defaulted and the people being brought\n\n32:42.360 --> 32:44.360\nin and having to fire each other and all that stuff.\n\n32:44.360 --> 32:51.360\nBut let's bring things to a positive note because, oh, but there is one more reason to\n\n32:51.360 --> 32:54.360\nwatch this movie if you get a chance to see it.\n\n32:54.360 --> 32:55.360\nIt's out on Friday.\n\n32:55.360 --> 32:56.360\nI should mention.\n\n32:56.360 --> 32:57.360\nYeah.\n\n32:57.360 --> 33:00.360\nBecause I'm realizing we're talking about a movie that we've seen.\n\n33:00.360 --> 33:01.360\nNone of you have seen this.\n\n33:01.360 --> 33:02.360\nRight.\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:03.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:04.360\nIt's coming out.\n\n33:04.360 --> 33:05.360\nSo you can't see it on Friday.\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:06.360\nNo.\n\n33:06.360 --> 33:07.360\nThis podcast is big business.\n\n33:07.360 --> 33:08.360\nYou'll be playing at the Arclight in L.A. in the Villagey Cinema.\n\n33:08.360 --> 33:09.360\nThere's a guy in the movie.\n\n33:09.360 --> 33:13.360\nYou have to watch it alone for the most amazing mustache I've ever seen.\n\n33:13.360 --> 33:14.360\nYes.\n\n33:14.360 --> 33:15.360\nMark Vidditsich.\n\n33:15.360 --> 33:17.360\nMark Vidditsich, yeah.\n\n33:17.360 --> 33:21.360\nIn normal time, because they're all like old and talking about the memories of it, he's\n\n33:21.360 --> 33:25.360\ngot a regular Sam Elliott, nothing regular about a Sam Elliott mustache, but he's like,\n\n33:25.360 --> 33:26.360\nit's special.\n\n33:26.360 --> 33:27.360\nOkay, it's big.\n\n33:27.360 --> 33:28.360\nIt's a brush, whatever.\n\n33:28.360 --> 33:33.360\nBut then you see him in photographs and it's like, I've never seen a mustache like this.\n\n33:33.360 --> 33:43.480\nIt looks to me, if you just told somebody, yeah, somebody took a duct tape with strip\n\n33:43.480 --> 33:47.360\nof hair and put it right over his mouth like a hostage.\n\n33:47.360 --> 33:48.360\nYeah.\n\n33:48.360 --> 33:49.360\nThat's what his mustache looks like.\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:53.860\nIt just doesn't look, it looks like something happened, like something flew across a room\n\n33:53.860 --> 33:54.860\nand splattered.\n\n33:54.860 --> 33:59.440\nI'm so glad that you've picked up on Vidditsich's mustache because we've taken this movie out\n\n33:59.440 --> 34:03.480\nto a bunch of different film festivals and we always get, you know, you get super nervous\n\n34:03.480 --> 34:06.360\nlike, it's funny.\n\n34:06.360 --> 34:12.080\nI've sat through horrible, shitty things that I've acted in and been totally fine.\n\n34:12.080 --> 34:13.080\nLike no problem.\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:15.920\nI don't care how like it plays, it's just sort of like, ah, whatever.\n\n34:15.920 --> 34:21.800\nBut when it's your movie that you've like fucking like put everything into all of a sudden,\n\n34:21.800 --> 34:27.480\nevery noise that you hear while the movie is screening is of the utmost importance.\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:32.560\nAnd we have these like little moments in the film where I can tell if an audience is with\n\n34:32.560 --> 34:35.200\nus or if they're just not.\n\n34:35.200 --> 34:40.800\nAnd luckily that mustache is the fucking, like that's the dividing line.\n\n34:40.800 --> 34:43.320\nIt really looks like, you know what it looks exactly like to me?\n\n34:43.320 --> 34:49.440\nThis mustache in the photographs, being from the Midwest, like the Euro restaurants there\n\n34:49.440 --> 34:55.320\nare, I miss them because it's like, they had the rotisserie and you just carve off the\n\n34:55.320 --> 34:59.080\nbig greasy strips of jagged lamb meat.\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:07.040\nJust giant long ruler length strips of serrated edge lamb meat and just lamb and a pita and\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:12.920\nlike, if I don't ask for anything else, just do that and I'm just angry at myself.\n\n35:12.920 --> 35:13.920\nJust that.\n\n35:13.920 --> 35:18.240\nIt looks like a piece of Euro meat, like was on a ceiling fan after a party and he came\n\n35:18.240 --> 35:23.120\nin and was like, hey guys, I have a good idea about a record industry, and I just went and\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:26.440\njust like went over his lips though, like centered on his lips.\n\n35:26.440 --> 35:29.440\nThat's the weird thing about his mustache is it looks like he's like a weird part of\n\n35:29.440 --> 35:33.000\na weird freedom of speech like demonstration.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:37.840\nBut what's, but you got to understand that we specifically cut it this way because we\n\n35:37.840 --> 35:43.280\nhave this old photo of him and you see this old photo and it's basically you just hear\n\n35:43.280 --> 35:48.000\nhis voice saying like, oh, well, I, you know, I basically described me the first time he\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:51.960\nwalked into Tower Records and got a job and we see have this old black and white photo\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:57.080\nand everyone starts chuckling at the mustache like everywhere.\n\n35:57.080 --> 36:03.560\nLike I've heard people go like, oh wow, it's an audible thing, like not just a gas but\n\n36:03.560 --> 36:10.480\nlike words as well, like, oh Jesus, not as detailed as lamb off of a fucking Euro placed\n\n36:10.480 --> 36:14.480\non a pedo with hummus and the whole thing, but close to it.\n\n36:14.480 --> 36:21.600\nAnd then the next shot is him today, and he still has the fucking mustache and then people\n\n36:21.600 --> 36:22.600\nlose their shit.\n\n36:22.600 --> 36:24.600\nThey go, he still has it.\n\n36:24.600 --> 36:25.600\nOh my God.\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:28.840\nWell, he kind of refined it though, because back then it was like, oh, someone ran over\n\n36:28.840 --> 36:36.080\na centipede in like, I don't know why it ended up on your mouth, like why on the center\n\n36:36.080 --> 36:37.080\nof your lips?\n\n36:37.080 --> 36:42.000\nLike he clearly like, he clearly sensed those days had children or wives that said like,\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:52.080\nyou got to clear out an area, it's a way I recognize people is two dots and a slit.\n\n36:52.080 --> 36:58.440\nSteven Spielberg definition, like they just hit the gray alien triangulation, two dots\n\n36:58.440 --> 37:00.920\nand a slit or it's not a person.\n\n37:00.920 --> 37:04.440\nAnd you got two dots and a fucking like just Euro.\n\n37:04.440 --> 37:05.440\nYeah.\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:06.440\nAnyways, all right.\n\n37:06.440 --> 37:12.320\nSo you'll see, you'll see, and when you go, please promise me when you see that photo,\n\n37:12.320 --> 37:17.000\ngo, oh, when you see the black and white photo, and then when you see that live, if someone\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:22.880\ncould just go, oh shit, just for my own personal, I would love it if someone did that.\n\n37:22.880 --> 37:27.880\nTruly worth the price of admission, honestly, to see the mustache, like you'll love it.\n\n37:27.880 --> 37:32.280\nSee, I'm going to bring out, I'd like you to stay up here because we haven't talked\n\n37:32.280 --> 37:33.280\nabout Fargo.\n\n37:33.280 --> 37:45.160\nI know you also, you have this diversion of, now that we've fed your PR furnace, I haven't\n\n37:45.160 --> 37:48.000\nseen Fargo, but I'd love to hear about it.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:52.800\nBut before we do, I'd like you to meet my neighbors.\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:53.800\nSo plump.\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:56.600\nI'm going to sit over here, right?\n\n37:56.600 --> 38:01.040\nNo, no, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n38:01.040 --> 38:02.040\nshow style.\n\n38:02.040 --> 38:03.040\nOkay, cool.\n\n38:03.040 --> 38:04.040\nThat's great.\n\n38:04.040 --> 38:05.040\nThank you, Colin.\n\n38:05.040 --> 38:06.040\nThat's very classy of you.\n\n38:06.040 --> 38:12.040\nAll right, there you go.\n\n38:12.040 --> 38:14.040\nBy the way, no relation.\n\n38:14.040 --> 38:15.040\nNone.\n\n38:15.040 --> 38:16.040\nNo.\n\n38:16.040 --> 38:17.040\nOkay.\n\n38:17.040 --> 38:18.040\nShit.\n\n38:18.040 --> 38:23.920\nI thought I'd get a bigger laugh, I guess.\n\n38:23.920 --> 38:25.600\nSometimes your voice, it's like, wow.\n\n38:25.600 --> 38:26.600\nNo, I don't.\n\n38:26.600 --> 38:29.200\nWe're talking about Michael Keaton, right?\n\n38:29.200 --> 38:30.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n38:30.200 --> 38:31.200\nAll right, cool.\n\n38:31.200 --> 38:41.360\nThe, now I feel bad of his, I'm sorry, it was like, he said it.\n\n38:41.360 --> 38:47.160\nMy next two guests, if you're a hardcore Armenian, you know-\n\n38:47.160 --> 38:48.680\nIs that what they're called now, Armenians?\n\n38:48.680 --> 38:53.120\nYeah, well, because it's LA-based, so we want to respect the Armenian culture here.\n\n38:53.120 --> 38:54.120\nYeah, of course.\n\n38:54.120 --> 39:04.960\nAnd, you know, you've met my neighbors before, I called Beth, the tumor lady, I had a conversation\n\n39:04.960 --> 39:09.320\nwith her and found out she had survived a golf ball size tumor and that she was fine\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:16.040\nnow and I'm endlessly fascinated with this shit because I'm morbidly terrified and she\n\n39:16.040 --> 39:19.840\nand her husband came up and her husband didn't say a word even though he's got interesting\n\n39:19.840 --> 39:20.840\nthings about him.\n\n39:20.840 --> 39:23.600\nBut tonight is not the night for them to have interesting things.\n\n39:23.600 --> 39:33.440\nIt is a night for me to plumb the depths of their, to me, completely baffling obsession\n\n39:33.440 --> 39:40.000\nwith four trees in their backyard.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:47.520\nSo we're just going to talk about it, we're neighbors, they've been texting me, Beth has\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:55.960\nbeen texting me for a long time about her trees and she's going to come out and we're\n\n39:55.960 --> 40:00.600\ngoing to talk about her fucking trees.\n\n40:00.600 --> 40:14.360\nPlease welcome Beth Bootson and Dan Bootson.\n\n40:14.360 --> 40:21.080\nAll right, so one day, one day, Dan, we will have on the show just to talk about the really\n\n40:21.080 --> 40:28.080\ninteresting thing of like, you know, there's no LA heritage, there's no such thing except\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:34.360\nDan's dad was this guy named Gypsy Boots who you can look up on Wikipedia, he was like\n\n40:34.360 --> 40:40.880\nthe founding father of the health craze, like the idea of health food, the idea of like\n\n40:40.880 --> 40:49.320\nyoga and all this stuff, like being hip, being like married to the people that we think\n\n40:49.320 --> 40:50.320\nare cool.\n\n40:50.320 --> 40:54.720\nThere was this guy Gypsy Boots running around and that's Dan's dad who now lives next door\n\n40:54.720 --> 40:58.160\nto me, which I think is like, you know, those stories don't happen in New York, you don't\n\n40:58.160 --> 41:03.840\nlive next to the guy that, you know, you probably live next to a fisherman or a plumber.\n\n41:03.840 --> 41:06.400\nIt's New York, they do stuff there.\n\n41:06.400 --> 41:12.280\nHere in LA, you might, you live next to like, who knows, it's like, oh, my dad was a famous\n\n41:12.280 --> 41:13.280\nhippie.\n\n41:13.280 --> 41:15.280\nAll right, I didn't sell that very well.\n\n41:15.280 --> 41:19.840\nGuys, they fish and plum in New York, they don't do that here.\n\n41:19.840 --> 41:20.840\nContinue.\n\n41:20.840 --> 41:26.560\nAll right, so Beth, all right, so it's been, it's been a long time, we've been exchanging\n\n41:26.560 --> 41:28.720\ntext about your trees.\n\n41:28.720 --> 41:32.600\nAll right, so where do you want to start?\n\n41:32.600 --> 41:36.560\nBecause among the things, I would say, I was suggesting that we just read our texts.\n\n41:36.560 --> 41:39.280\nYes, so let's just start from the beginning.\n\n41:39.280 --> 41:42.240\nDo you want to just start by doing the dialogue or the texts?\n\n41:42.240 --> 41:43.240\nMaybe so.\n\n41:43.240 --> 41:44.240\nOkay, that's good.\n\n41:44.240 --> 41:46.320\nIt's like the love letters play?\n\n41:46.320 --> 41:48.920\nWell, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like love letters.\n\n41:48.920 --> 41:53.920\nThe, I guess there's a little bit of preamble where we just say like, well...\n\n41:53.920 --> 41:57.280\nWell, let me just tell you this.\n\n41:57.280 --> 42:07.920\nIn our house, outside in the back, we have a little courtyard and we have the most beautiful,\n\n42:07.920 --> 42:16.480\nor we had the most beautiful seven, it looks like seven-story, 100-year-old eucalyptus\n\n42:16.480 --> 42:17.480\ntrees.\n\n42:17.480 --> 42:26.280\nAnd these things provided a wall of privacy from our neighbor and they had a beautiful\n\n42:26.280 --> 42:35.760\ncanopy where we hung Moroccan lanterns from and we would have great barbecues out there,\n\n42:35.760 --> 42:38.800\nwhich you came to our house for a wine.\n\n42:38.800 --> 42:39.800\nYeah.\n\n42:39.800 --> 42:40.800\nOnce.\n\n42:40.800 --> 42:41.800\nDid you have lamb?\n\n42:41.800 --> 42:43.360\nAnd then I came on my show and said, I met this tumor lady.\n\n42:43.360 --> 42:44.360\nNo lamb.\n\n42:44.360 --> 42:45.360\nNo lamb.\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:47.280\nBut I swear to God, this is more about me.\n\n42:47.280 --> 42:51.760\nThis is about me, not about you.\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:55.000\nI never noticed or cared about the trees.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:56.000\nThat's true.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:57.000\nApparently they existed.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:58.000\nApparently they're gone.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nYeah.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:06.320\nSo that's my context of this, like, well, first of all, I mean, so if it starts with,\n\n43:06.320 --> 43:11.880\nyou're calling me and I was a little, like, I was at Beth Boots and I'm like, oh, it's\n\n43:11.880 --> 43:14.040\nmy neighbor and I'm not picking up the phone.\n\n43:14.040 --> 43:15.280\nAnd he was always in the middle of something.\n\n43:15.280 --> 43:20.320\nThen voicemails and saying, like, Dan, you were inexplicably kind of cryptic about it.\n\n43:20.320 --> 43:21.840\nLike, Dan, I have to talk to you about something.\n\n43:21.840 --> 43:22.840\nI have something important to tell you.\n\n43:22.840 --> 43:23.840\nYeah.\n\n43:23.840 --> 43:28.360\nI was like, I don't know why you'd bury that lead, but you're going to tell, and then you're\n\n43:28.360 --> 43:30.720\nsending me texts and saying, like, did you get my voicemail?\n\n43:30.720 --> 43:31.720\nI got to talk to you about something.\n\n43:31.720 --> 43:36.400\nAnd I keep, I'm in the middle of, you know, as it turns out, a divorce, but it's like,\n\n43:36.400 --> 43:42.400\nand I got a studio, I'm trying to keep above water and I'm like, ah, it's neighbors, okay.\n\n43:42.400 --> 43:45.160\nBut I always am thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, oh, shit, like, there must\n\n43:45.160 --> 43:50.760\nbe something like, maybe my sewage is coming up into their sink or something, could it be?\n\n43:50.760 --> 43:54.920\nAnd so I'm walking and then I see Dan, he's walking his dogs and your dogs, yes.\n\n43:54.920 --> 43:58.560\nSo I was walking and I had to, of course, introduce myself again every time we meet.\n\n43:58.560 --> 43:59.560\nI had face blindness.\n\n43:59.560 --> 44:00.560\nFine.\n\n44:00.560 --> 44:01.560\nI have to.\n\n44:01.560 --> 44:04.080\nWe walked him out with earphones.\n\n44:04.080 --> 44:05.080\nEarphones.\n\n44:05.080 --> 44:06.080\nDid you walk anybody?\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:08.560\nI was going on my chiropractor and I was listening to my podcast.\n\n44:08.560 --> 44:13.040\nAnd I said, I said, Dan, you know, my, my wife's been trying to reach you and said, yes,\n\n44:13.040 --> 44:14.040\nI know.\n\n44:14.040 --> 44:15.040\nOh my God.\n\n44:15.040 --> 44:16.040\nOh God, what happened?\n\n44:16.040 --> 44:17.040\nWhat happened?\n\n44:17.040 --> 44:18.040\nDid the tumor come back?\n\n44:18.040 --> 44:19.040\nWhat happened?\n\n44:19.040 --> 44:20.040\nAnd I said, ah, right, is it a tumor?\n\n44:20.040 --> 44:22.880\nWell, really, it's going to be, it's very upsetting.\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:28.640\nI said, it's the eucalyptus trees are rotten and they're going to have to be removed.\n\n44:28.640 --> 44:31.320\nAnd the first thing Dan said was, are they on my property?\n\n44:31.320 --> 44:38.320\nI mean, could, yeah, had I been a little quicker, I, of course, would have said, why\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:39.320\nyes.\n\n44:39.320 --> 44:40.320\nThey are.\n\n44:40.320 --> 44:42.320\nYou could have tricked me into paying for the operation, $25,000.\n\n44:42.320 --> 44:46.800\nBecause I know, yeah, I was like, well, so, so then, well, then I said, well, no, no,\n\n44:46.800 --> 44:50.480\nthey're ours, but they're, it's really sad and they're going to have to take them all\n\n44:50.480 --> 44:51.480\nout and dance.\n\n44:51.480 --> 44:52.980\nWell, they're just trees.\n\n44:52.980 --> 44:56.960\nBut that's, that's, I want, I don't want you to gloss over what I consider the moral\n\n44:56.960 --> 44:58.440\nof this story.\n\n44:58.440 --> 45:00.240\nThey're just trees.\n\n45:00.240 --> 45:05.680\nTo me, to me, that's, to me, I want, I just want that to always be in the background.\n\n45:05.680 --> 45:08.960\nThere's beautiful trees, beautiful trees.\n\n45:08.960 --> 45:09.960\nThey're just, they're just trees.\n\n45:09.960 --> 45:15.680\nAnd I, so I keep being, so, so, so, just, just, just all those voicemails and then the conversation\n\n45:15.680 --> 45:18.840\nwith Dan, and I'm like, oh fuck, Jesus Christ, it was actually a little file in the back\n\n45:18.840 --> 45:22.080\nof my head, not that I did anything about it, but I was like, oh God, there's a crisis.\n\n45:22.080 --> 45:23.240\nI'm being, I'm being a bad neighbor.\n\n45:23.240 --> 45:27.080\nAnd I'm like, fucking trees, what, okay.\n\n45:27.080 --> 45:29.880\nI was actually charmed because it seemed like your concerns that you were going to wake\n\n45:29.880 --> 45:31.800\nme up with like chainsaws and things.\n\n45:31.800 --> 45:34.680\nSo, so, and I'm like, oh God, tell her not to, no, no, I don't care, I don't.\n\n45:34.680 --> 45:43.040\nAnd by the way, I sent this, this letter out to all the neighbors on that app, next door,\n\n45:43.040 --> 45:49.600\napp, because I didn't want anybody being furious with me when all these old 100 year old trees\n\n45:49.600 --> 45:54.760\nare, oh, oh, oh, oh, you gotta eat the, eat them like, I didn't want people being furious\n\n45:54.760 --> 45:59.640\nwith me cutting these 100 year old trees down, four of them.\n\n45:59.640 --> 46:04.800\nAnd they were the, like, if you drive down the block, you just, you could see them from\n\n46:04.800 --> 46:05.800\nfar, far away.\n\n46:05.800 --> 46:12.120\nI want to say, I want to say, Dan, everyone, everyone else, everyone else is upset, all\n\n46:12.120 --> 46:13.120\nright.\n\n46:13.120 --> 46:14.120\nSo, okay.\n\n46:14.120 --> 46:16.040\nWell, you know, their medals are all in the mail.\n\n46:16.040 --> 46:18.480\nYou were the exception to the rule.\n\n46:18.480 --> 46:19.480\nThis is, this is what it is.\n\n46:19.480 --> 46:20.480\nI know it's about me.\n\n46:20.480 --> 46:23.200\nI'm like, I just don't, I feel like I'm living in a twilight zone because I'm like, I don't\n\n46:23.200 --> 46:24.920\nunderstand what's happening.\n\n46:24.920 --> 46:29.480\nSo, so, so September 21st, 442 p.m.\n\n46:29.480 --> 46:33.520\nNow do you want to, it occurs to me, do you want to read your part or should I read your\n\n46:33.520 --> 46:34.520\npart?\n\n46:34.520 --> 46:35.520\nWhatever you want to read.\n\n46:35.520 --> 46:36.520\nWhatever you want to read.\n\n46:36.520 --> 46:37.520\nOh, you read your part.\n\n46:37.520 --> 46:38.520\nYeah.\n\n46:38.520 --> 46:39.520\nYou read my part.\n\n46:39.520 --> 46:40.520\nYeah, I'll read your part.\n\n46:40.520 --> 46:41.520\nAnd you read my part.\n\n46:41.520 --> 46:42.520\nOkay.\n\n46:42.520 --> 46:43.520\nOkay.\n\n46:43.520 --> 46:44.520\nOkay.\n\n46:44.520 --> 46:58.120\nIt is with, and you just said, like you said this to everybody, but I don't know, I think\n\n46:58.120 --> 47:02.480\nI'm just getting this as a, oh by the way, oh God, there's another, there's another\n\n47:02.480 --> 47:06.240\nimportant point that I don't know to bring up now or later, that Erin McGathy is on\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:07.240\nall of these.\n\n47:07.240 --> 47:10.720\nIt's just, this is a message to me and my wife who, who were struggling to keep our\n\n47:10.720 --> 47:11.720\nmarriage together.\n\n47:11.720 --> 47:16.720\nAnd Beth, Aaron is, Aaron is, is she included in it?\n\n47:16.720 --> 47:17.720\nYes.\n\n47:17.720 --> 47:18.720\nYes.\n\n47:18.720 --> 47:19.720\nI thought they were still married.\n\n47:19.720 --> 47:20.720\nNo, no.\n\n47:20.720 --> 47:21.720\nWell, yes, you can.\n\n47:21.720 --> 47:22.720\nThere's only one line at the end.\n\n47:22.720 --> 47:24.720\nAaron, Aaron, Aaron nails it at the end.\n\n47:24.720 --> 47:26.720\nCan I read that part, please?\n\n47:26.720 --> 47:27.720\nYes.\n\n47:27.720 --> 47:28.720\nOr hand it over.\n\n47:28.720 --> 47:29.720\nYeah.\n\n47:29.720 --> 47:30.720\nOh, I'm so glad.\n\n47:30.720 --> 47:31.720\nOh, I know.\n\n47:31.720 --> 47:32.720\nI'll hand it over.\n\n47:32.720 --> 47:34.440\nBut I do want you guys to be prepared for the fact that when I say at the end, I mean\n\n47:34.440 --> 47:40.680\nlike at the end of roots, the miniseries, like the whole point is that this is to me\n\n47:40.680 --> 47:45.680\nand here's the thing is I knew Aaron would be, I knew Aaron would be interested in this.\n\n47:45.680 --> 47:46.680\nYou were so wrong.\n\n47:46.680 --> 47:49.680\nI knew you might not, but I knew Aaron would.\n\n47:49.680 --> 47:50.680\nOkay.\n\n47:50.680 --> 47:52.680\nSo I absolutely had to send it to her.\n\n47:52.680 --> 47:53.680\nI wish she was here right now.\n\n47:53.680 --> 47:54.680\nI thought you guys were still married.\n\n47:54.680 --> 47:56.680\nOh, she's still here right now.\n\n47:56.680 --> 48:00.680\nI will channel her and his one line at the very end.\n\n48:00.680 --> 48:01.680\nVery good.\n\n48:01.680 --> 48:02.680\nWe're going to need you.\n\n48:02.680 --> 48:03.680\nAll right.\n\n48:03.680 --> 48:04.680\nSo here we go.\n\n48:04.680 --> 48:05.680\nHere's the, I mean.\n\n48:05.680 --> 48:06.680\nBeth.\n\n48:06.680 --> 48:15.000\nIt is with much sadness that I write this, but our four 100 year old Eucalyptus trees\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:16.520\nwill have to be removed.\n\n48:16.520 --> 48:19.960\nThis is after so many voice messages and conversations about it.\n\n48:19.960 --> 48:22.680\nIt was like, this is news to nobody.\n\n48:22.680 --> 48:26.560\nIt never was.\n\n48:26.560 --> 48:33.680\nIt's been confirmed by a well respected arborist.\n\n48:33.680 --> 48:39.680\nThat although the trees look healthy and are, believe me, but I end up being the bad guy.\n\n48:39.680 --> 48:42.680\nSo it's okay to laugh because she's beautiful.\n\n48:42.680 --> 48:43.680\nShe's caring about trees.\n\n48:43.680 --> 48:46.680\nLike I ended up being the villain or I wouldn't be taking you through this.\n\n48:46.680 --> 48:50.680\nIt's been confirmed by a well respected arborist that although the trees look healthy and\n\n48:50.680 --> 48:54.680\nare thriving on the outside, that they are full of decay in the trunk and roots and are\n\n48:54.680 --> 48:59.680\nnot expected to withstand a winter of rain and winds, the tree trimmers will begin their\n\n48:59.680 --> 49:02.680\ntree cutting at seven a.m. on Tuesday.\n\n49:02.680 --> 49:03.680\nNew paragraph.\n\n49:03.680 --> 49:11.680\nTrees are located at the end of the cul-de-sac on address withheld for stalker purposes,\n\n49:11.680 --> 49:13.680\nbut everybody knows where I live.\n\n49:13.680 --> 49:15.680\nYour neighbors, the Bootsons.\n\n49:15.680 --> 49:22.680\nAnd then Dan Harmon wrote back and he goes, sad to hear about these majestic trees, but\n\n49:22.680 --> 49:27.680\nI do feel you and your family will enjoy a fresh, unobstructed view of my trademark nude\n\n49:27.680 --> 49:34.680\nsunbathing.\n\n49:34.680 --> 49:37.680\nSomething to talk about to all the other neighbors.\n\n49:37.680 --> 49:41.680\nIf I can get a picture, think of all the money I can make.\n\n49:41.680 --> 49:46.680\nMake sure you are in a good area and expose all so I can make a lot of money.\n\n49:46.680 --> 49:49.680\nAnd then the weird thing is you left an emoticon.\n\n49:49.680 --> 49:54.680\nThe emoticon is a yellow face going.\n\n49:54.680 --> 49:59.680\nBut it's like, wait, that should be my emoticon.\n\n49:59.680 --> 50:05.680\nSo, okay, so then it's a day later, I think, September 24th, maybe three days later.\n\n50:05.680 --> 50:10.680\nA photo of our strong, healthy-looking trees that our arborist said would never survive\n\n50:10.680 --> 50:11.680\nEl Niño.\n\n50:11.680 --> 50:15.680\nAnd there's this thing that's like, she keeps sending these pictures.\n\n50:15.680 --> 50:17.680\nIt's the same picture.\n\n50:17.680 --> 50:20.680\nWell, Dan is going to show, we actually brought.\n\n50:20.680 --> 50:25.680\nYeah, well, right.\n\n50:25.680 --> 50:29.680\nIt was completely soft inside.\n\n50:29.680 --> 50:32.680\nOkay, so I am in the minority.\n\n50:32.680 --> 50:36.680\nAnd on the outside, it was so green and thriving.\n\n50:36.680 --> 50:38.680\nI mean, just, it was so lush.\n\n50:38.680 --> 50:40.680\nWho's life didn't we save?\n\n50:40.680 --> 50:42.680\nIt's a hollow tree.\n\n50:42.680 --> 50:45.680\nThat would come down on your house.\n\n50:45.680 --> 50:47.680\nAnd my house.\n\n50:47.680 --> 50:50.680\nBut she keeps sending.\n\n50:50.680 --> 50:51.680\nIt smells.\n\n50:51.680 --> 50:55.680\nYou can live, this has always been my favorite flavored tree.\n\n50:55.680 --> 50:58.680\nCan you see the scroll of the pictures?\n\n50:58.680 --> 51:01.680\nBecause she just keeps sending the same picture.\n\n51:01.680 --> 51:02.680\nYou know why?\n\n51:02.680 --> 51:05.680\nI did that because I wasn't trying to make a point.\n\n51:05.680 --> 51:08.680\nI did that because I was in a place where the message wouldn't go through.\n\n51:08.680 --> 51:10.680\nSo I was like, what's up?\n\n51:10.680 --> 51:11.680\nSo I kept sending it.\n\n51:11.680 --> 51:15.680\nAnd then after that picture, like nine times, there's a picture of a human hand\n\n51:15.680 --> 51:17.680\nand I guess what is a tree trunk.\n\n51:17.680 --> 51:20.680\nAnd then there's like a close-up of just looks like Afghanistan.\n\n51:20.680 --> 51:22.680\nI don't know what that is.\n\n51:22.680 --> 51:25.680\nAnd then there's just pictures of trees, normal healthy looking trees,\n\n51:25.680 --> 51:26.680\nwhich I don't know.\n\n51:26.680 --> 51:28.680\nI was like, wait, are we past that part of the story?\n\n51:28.680 --> 51:31.680\nThere's like all total, there's 7,000 pictures.\n\n51:31.680 --> 51:34.680\nAnd they keep coming in over and over again.\n\n51:34.680 --> 51:36.680\nSo then after all of that,\n\n51:36.680 --> 51:40.680\nso then you say those photos did not go in the right order.\n\n51:40.680 --> 51:44.680\nPlus it wouldn't send the photo of the stump with the lovely hole in it.\n\n51:44.680 --> 51:45.680\nYes it did.\n\n51:45.680 --> 51:47.680\nNine hundred times.\n\n51:47.680 --> 51:49.680\nSo I kept trying to send it.\n\n51:49.680 --> 51:52.680\nThat's why you have a hundred of the same photos.\n\n51:52.680 --> 51:54.680\nSo you knew.\n\n51:54.680 --> 51:57.680\nThat's also what happens when your battery is at 2%.\n\n51:57.680 --> 51:59.680\nI don't know.\n\n51:59.680 --> 52:02.680\nYou should see the view we have from our window now.\n\n52:02.680 --> 52:04.680\nIt makes me want to cry.\n\n52:04.680 --> 52:07.680\nOh, here's a line from Aaron.\n\n52:07.680 --> 52:09.680\nOh.\n\n52:09.680 --> 52:15.680\nThat was nice.\n\n52:15.680 --> 52:28.680\nI know you're doing that because you want it to be over,\n\n52:28.680 --> 52:30.680\nbut I actually was mistaken.\n\n52:30.680 --> 52:32.680\nAaron's big line comes later.\n\n52:32.680 --> 52:35.680\nOh no.\n\n52:35.680 --> 52:40.680\nNo, it's becoming Othello.\n\n52:40.680 --> 52:45.680\nSo then Beth in response to Aaron's awe says,\n\n52:45.680 --> 52:48.680\nis that the best you can do?\n\n52:48.680 --> 52:50.680\nI thought I was talking to you.\n\n52:50.680 --> 52:52.680\nOh, that's right.\n\n52:52.680 --> 52:55.680\nIn her phone she can't tell when Aaron's talking when I'm talking.\n\n52:55.680 --> 52:57.680\nAlso she's kidding.\n\n52:57.680 --> 53:00.680\nBut how about an apology?\n\n53:00.680 --> 53:03.680\nAnd then Aaron says,\n\n53:03.680 --> 53:06.680\noh, sorry.\n\n53:06.680 --> 53:08.680\nI thought I was talking to you the whole time.\n\n53:08.680 --> 53:13.680\nThen Beth sends an emoticon of a yellow person drying their eyes\n\n53:13.680 --> 53:15.680\nwith a handkerchief.\n\n53:15.680 --> 53:23.680\nThen sends the same fucking circle.\n\n53:23.680 --> 53:27.680\nIs your battery at 4% now?\n\n53:27.680 --> 53:30.680\nSo then, and then it says,\n\n53:30.680 --> 53:35.680\nhey, good news, we can wave to each other whenever we see each other now,\n\n53:35.680 --> 53:37.680\nwhich will be every five minutes.\n\n53:37.680 --> 53:40.680\nWe'll look up to your window and you look down at ours.\n\n53:40.680 --> 53:42.680\nExciting. The rainbow.\n\n53:42.680 --> 53:47.680\nCompletely becoming conscious of the fact that I haven't responded to you in a while.\n\n53:47.680 --> 53:50.680\nHaving learned to make animated GIFs,\n\n53:50.680 --> 53:56.680\nI send my standard GIF of me lowering my glasses to my nose\n\n53:56.680 --> 53:58.680\nand I just put the meme caption.\n\n53:58.680 --> 54:03.680\nAnd I call an unhealthy eucalyptus tree.\n\n54:03.680 --> 54:05.680\nBecause I don't know what to do anymore.\n\n54:05.680 --> 54:09.680\nI don't know what to do.\n\n54:09.680 --> 54:12.680\nAnd then Beth says, more drawn curtains now.\n\n54:12.680 --> 54:14.680\nAnd then LOL.\n\n54:14.680 --> 54:20.680\nAnd then later says, still laughing out loud.\n\n54:20.680 --> 54:23.680\nThen you send a photo.\n\n54:23.680 --> 54:25.680\nThere's something written on a board.\n\n54:25.680 --> 54:26.680\nMore photos.\n\n54:26.680 --> 54:29.680\nThere's a photo of the guys who were cutting down the tree.\n\n54:29.680 --> 54:32.680\nAnother of the same photo of the arm in the stump.\n\n54:32.680 --> 54:35.680\nThen there's a new photo of a tree stump\n\n54:35.680 --> 54:37.680\nand this one has a pencil jammed into it.\n\n54:37.680 --> 54:40.680\nAnd ask to show how soft the core is.\n\n54:40.680 --> 54:42.680\nYou have to post all of this.\n\n54:42.680 --> 54:44.680\nYou have to post all of this.\n\n54:44.680 --> 54:46.680\nThey were all like that.\n\n54:46.680 --> 54:48.680\nThen again, same photo as far as I'm concerned.\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:54.680\nSo then you said, I want you to notice the photo with the pencil in it.\n\n54:54.680 --> 54:58.680\nThat's all soft center that can be pushed in with just a finger.\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:01.680\nAll of the trees, although hard on the top,\n\n55:01.680 --> 55:04.680\nhave been rotten in the lower trunk.\n\n55:04.680 --> 55:07.680\nDoes that other eucalyptus tree belong to you?\n\n55:07.680 --> 55:08.680\nHe's got one on his property.\n\n55:08.680 --> 55:11.680\nHe's got one on his property.\n\n55:11.680 --> 55:14.680\nI'm sure it's fine, but some of the neighbors are starting to inquire\n\n55:14.680 --> 55:18.680\nabout the other eucalyptus trees.\n\n55:18.680 --> 55:21.680\nI can give you the number to our arborist.\n\n55:21.680 --> 55:25.680\nShe might very well give your tree an A plus.\n\n55:25.680 --> 55:28.680\nBut I don't think that's what you're thinking.\n\n55:28.680 --> 55:32.680\nWe had mushrooms growing on the bottom of one of our trees.\n\n55:32.680 --> 55:35.680\nWe also had holes in our tree that she could put a stick into\n\n55:35.680 --> 55:38.680\nto see how deeply that stick would go in.\n\n55:38.680 --> 55:41.680\nThat indicated decay inside.\n\n55:41.680 --> 55:45.680\nIf nothing else, it might give you peace of mind.\n\n55:45.680 --> 55:50.680\nIt'll give all the neighbors peace of mind too.\n\n55:50.680 --> 55:54.680\nAnd then Dan Harmon wrote back,\n\n55:54.680 --> 55:56.680\nI don't want to high road you,\n\n55:56.680 --> 56:00.680\nbut my peace of mind is a lot fucking harder to come by than that, Bootson.\n\n56:00.680 --> 56:10.680\nBy the way, going through a divorce like this whole time,\n\n56:10.680 --> 56:13.680\nlike so angry and drunk the whole time.\n\n56:13.680 --> 56:17.680\nWe never sober when I'm texting you.\n\n56:17.680 --> 56:22.680\nAnd Beth goes, okay, what can I do to help?\n\n56:22.680 --> 56:27.680\nI have a feeling that you will never have peace of mind.\n\n56:27.680 --> 56:29.680\nI think you're doing fine.\n\n56:29.680 --> 56:32.680\nI guess part of what gives me struggle is the quest for independence\n\n56:32.680 --> 56:35.680\nin a world defined by loneliness.\n\n56:35.680 --> 56:39.680\nIn a lot of ways, I guess I'm like a giant eucalyptus tree\n\n56:39.680 --> 56:44.680\nrotting from the inside.\n\n56:44.680 --> 56:53.680\nThey love it, they love it.\n\n56:53.680 --> 56:55.680\nAw!\n\n56:55.680 --> 56:58.680\nYou identify.\n\n56:58.680 --> 57:05.680\nIs that why you wanted to hold on to your eucalyptus tree?\n\n57:05.680 --> 57:07.680\nWell, I don't.\n\n57:07.680 --> 57:11.680\nBesides, that tree didn't get hit with a belt by its parents.\n\n57:11.680 --> 57:16.680\nAnd it never was able to do anything other than what it's doing.\n\n57:16.680 --> 57:24.680\nYes, but it did get hit with some huge storms in its past.\n\n57:24.680 --> 57:32.680\nAs humans, we are told, unlike trees, that we are in charge of what becomes of us,\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:34.680\ntheir storms are our fault.\n\n57:34.680 --> 57:39.680\nThat tree got to sit there for 100 years while people got on and off the bus in LA,\n\n57:39.680 --> 57:43.680\nexpecting things and having things expected of them.\n\n57:43.680 --> 58:01.680\nIn a weird waybath, that tree can totally suck my human dick.\n\n58:01.680 --> 58:11.680\nI'm so glad I don't have my neighbor's cell phone number.\n\n58:11.680 --> 58:18.680\nBesides, I got hit with a belt by my dad, but I remember all the great stuff he did for me too.\n\n58:18.680 --> 58:26.680\nHe did his best and he could be quite loving.\n\n58:26.680 --> 58:44.680\nI think it got more than it deserved, and I hope it burns in fucking tree health.\n\n58:44.680 --> 58:52.680\nAre you okay?\n\n58:52.680 --> 58:55.680\nAre you?\n\n58:55.680 --> 58:59.680\nI'm doing well.\n\n58:59.680 --> 59:04.680\nThat's what you say, but what if I push a pencil through you?\n\n59:04.680 --> 59:07.680\nHow soft will you turn out to be?\n\n59:07.680 --> 59:09.680\nThat's the part they didn't apply.\n\n59:09.680 --> 59:17.680\nI was like, oh my god, I've become a fucking maniac.\n\n59:17.680 --> 59:19.680\nI know what this is about.\n\n59:19.680 --> 59:23.680\nYou're pissed because you don't have your privacy anymore.\n\n59:23.680 --> 59:28.680\nDo you think that I made up this whole decaying tree thing just to stalk you?\n\n59:28.680 --> 59:38.680\nI can see right through you, especially now that all the trees have gone.\n\n59:38.680 --> 59:45.680\nDays later, I think days later, October 1st, from now on I'm going to yell up to your window and say, hi, Dan!\n\n59:45.680 --> 59:49.680\nIt's my way of saying, it's a beautiful day, don't you think?\n\n59:49.680 --> 59:56.680\nThree days later, hi, Dan. My Dan and I were thinking of dropping by your podcast today to talk about the eucalyptus trees.\n\n59:56.680 --> 01:00:02.680\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.680\nWe can skip to...\n\n01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.680\nYou don't want to go through all the booking information?\n\n01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680\nWhatever you want.\n\n01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.680\nNo, no, it's fine.\n\n01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680\nYou're right.\n\n01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.680\nThere's a lot of schedule.\n\n01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.680\nWe've got to work on a schedule.\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.680\nSo how does Wednesday work for you?\n\n01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.680\nWednesday's no good.\n\n01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.680\nYesterday, 8.41 a.m.\n\n01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.680\nHi, Dan. Are we still on tomorrow for your podcast?\n\n01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.680\nAre you eucalyptus trees?\n\n01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.680\nBeth.\n\n01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.680\nShe signed it!\n\n01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.680\nIn case I'm like, who's this?\n\n01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.680\nThe woman I threatened to push a pencil through.\n\n01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.680\nAnd then Dan writes, yes, but we don't need to include Aaron in this conversation anymore.\n\n01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680\nWe're divorcing.\n\n01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.680\nI'm going to connect you to my assistant, Steve Levy, who books the show and makes sure the guests have all the right information.\n\n01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.680\nOkay, and then...\n\n01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.680\nHis e-mail is blah, blah, blah. Can I give him yours?\n\n01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.680\nOf course, mine is blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.680\nI thought you two were just living together.\n\n01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.680\nI'm so sorry to hear about the divorce.\n\n01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.680\nThat's always a difficult thing to go through.\n\n01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.680\nThat's me, yeah.\n\n01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680\nThat's you reading me, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.680\nYou perceived right. We were just living together.\n\n01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.680\nThat's why it didn't make sense to stay married.\n\n01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.680\nI'll give your e-mail to Steve and have him contact you tomorrow.\n\n01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.680\nWe'll only have...\n\n01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.680\nWait, hold on, hold on.\n\n01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.680\nIs this next part Aaron's?\n\n01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.680\nYeah, and then Aaron comes in for the closer here.\n\n01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680\nWhy?\n\n01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.680\nThank you, Beth. Truth be told, our marriage was fine until the eucalyptus trees came down.\n\n01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.680\nHold on, wait.\n\n01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.680\nWait.\n\n01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.680\nFucking wait.\n\n01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:05.680\nThank you, Beth. Truth be told, our marriage was fine until the eucalyptus trees came down because it turns out I was just in it for the shade.\n\n01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.680\nErin McGathy, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.680\nSo you...\n\n01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.680\nOkay, so in the green room, just to put a ribbon on this.\n\n01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.680\nThe audience is on your side.\n\n01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.680\nThey're reacting to the size of the tree or I don't know the amount of decay.\n\n01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.680\nI still don't understand.\n\n01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.680\nI never noticed them.\n\n01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.680\nI live in a world of just dirty underwear and sadness.\n\n01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680\nBut you know what I think?\n\n01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:47.680\nI actually think that now that wall of eucalyptus trees is down and you've lost your privacy and you're looking down into our yard.\n\n01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:56.680\nYou don't have that wall of privacy anymore and there's big stumps of ugliness there now.\n\n01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.680\nYeah, neighbors shouldn't be separated.\n\n01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.680\nI had eucalyptus trees around my heart.\n\n01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.680\nBut you might have never bought your house if there was no privacy there.\n\n01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.680\nI don't know about that, honestly.\n\n01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.680\nI looked in the backyard and I was like, oh, so green, there's a grill.\n\n01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.680\nAnd the eucalyptus trees were there.\n\n01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680\nI think if I...\n\n01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680\nYeah, maybe.\n\n01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680\nBecause if I...\n\n01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.680\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\n01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.680\nWell anyway...\n\n01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.680\nI feel like if I had realized how many steps there were, I wouldn't have bought the house.\n\n01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.680\nSo obviously I don't notice things that normal people notice.\n\n01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.680\nLike the UPS guy's like, what the fuck, man?\n\n01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680\nRight, right.\n\n01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680\nAnd I'm like, oh shit, okay.\n\n01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:39.680\nWell, I want to tell you that I sent out those same photos to all the neighborhood and people\n\n01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:46.680\nat first were like us, very, very upset that these beautiful trees had to be cut down.\n\n01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.680\nBut then afterwards when they saw how much decay there was, they were shocked and then\n\n01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.680\nthey were asking about...\n\n01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680\nMy tree.\n\n01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680\nYeah.\n\n01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.680\nThese trees are 100 years old.\n\n01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:05.120\nRight before we were going to cut the trees down, we've had the same tree trimmer for\n\n01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.680\nmany, many years now and I wouldn't have had...\n\n01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.680\nI wouldn't have had anybody else trim them because he knows the trees.\n\n01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.680\nAnd go ahead.\n\n01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.680\nYou know, and it's not that I'm a tree lover.\n\n01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.680\nShit is real, yo.\n\n01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.680\nWhen you are a homeowner, this shit is important.\n\n01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680\nRight.\n\n01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.680\nSo don't fucking judge.\n\n01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.680\nOr I will come in and I will hit you in the head with this fucking microphone.\n\n01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.680\nWell, and here's the thing.\n\n01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.680\nIt's not that I'm a tree lover or tree hugger.\n\n01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.680\nIt's just that these were...\n\n01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.680\nWhen I looked out my bedroom window, these trees were right there and our house is small\n\n01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.680\nand these trees were a focal point.\n\n01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.680\nSo, and we've lived in that house for 20 years.\n\n01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.680\nNow we're the small house in the shadow of Dan Harmon's palatial...\n\n01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:59.680\nAnd these trees were probably about seven stories high and they were 100 years old\n\n01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.680\nand now we look up at this...\n\n01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.680\nI will...\n\n01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.680\nI will build a statue to your trees.\n\n01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.680\nAnd it will spray cranberry juice for the neighborhood's children.\n\n01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.680\nWell, I just want to say that.\n\n01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.680\nSo you told me in the green room...\n\n01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680\nOh, what were you going to say?\n\n01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680\nYes.\n\n01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.680\nRight before we cut the trees down.\n\n01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.680\nOh, boy.\n\n01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.680\nOkay, here we go.\n\n01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.680\nYeah.\n\n01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.680\nI was...\n\n01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.680\nThis was a very upsetting thing to me.\n\n01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:36.680\nBut right before we cut the trees down, I actually had a service or gave homage to these trees.\n\n01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.680\nAnd...\n\n01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:44.680\nAnd you said, can I please read the poem I read at the service?\n\n01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:55.680\nAnd you're currently, for our listeners, you are as broken up as one of these Tower Records people.\n\n01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.680\nAnd it's me talking about my divorce.\n\n01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.680\nYou're crying genuine tears.\n\n01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.680\nBeth loves these trees.\n\n01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.680\nAnd I'm a horrible, heartless maniac that cannot fucking...\n\n01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.680\nI cannot see in these colors.\n\n01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.680\nI do want to say that you identified with the trees.\n\n01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.680\nUnwittingly.\n\n01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.680\nKeep that in mind when I read this poem.\n\n01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680\nYes.\n\n01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.680\nTonight's theme is about loss and, yes, uprooting and...\n\n01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680\nOkay.\n\n01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:28.680\nMy trees, blue gum eucalyptus, four of them, so tall, so majestic.\n\n01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.680\nI've always been proud that those trees were mine, fighting through the harsh environment,\n\n01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.680\nstanding tall and proud for over a hundred years.\n\n01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.680\nThose trees belong to me.\n\n01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:45.680\nThey provided shelter when the sun was beating down and when the winds would show no mercy.\n\n01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.680\nYet, it was after the storm that they were at their most fragrant.\n\n01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:55.680\nIt was like walking into a spa, especially after a big rain.\n\n01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:01.680\nThe life that existed in them, raccoons, possums, skunks.\n\n01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.680\nThe chatter of the squirrels that mocked my dog.\n\n01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.680\nWhy, even the hawks made their home there.\n\n01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.680\nA nest built on the strong branches of my eucalyptus trees.\n\n01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.680\nA nest holding three large babies and the parents.\n\n01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.680\nAnd I got to see my hawks grow.\n\n01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.680\nAnd I got to see my hawks fly.\n\n01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.680\nAnd I got to see my hawks soar.\n\n01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.680\nThe cold winters, the hot summers, the powerful winds, nothing can break those trees.\n\n01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.680\nAnd to think that those trees belong to me.\n\n01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:44.680\nAnd to think that those trees, my trees, will now be gone.\n\n01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:52.680\nBut, with every end comes a new beginning.\n\n01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.680\nWith great love, Beth and Timor.\n\n01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:09.680\nSomeone just called out, give her your tree.\n\n01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:16.680\nIf that is possible, biologically or legally, it is your tree.\n\n01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.680\nI don't know where it is on my property.\n\n01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.680\nIs it the thing with the green stuff?\n\n01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.680\nThere's a million trees back there.\n\n01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.680\nThat was beautiful, Beth.\n\n01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.680\nAnd I probably don't have to acknowledge this,\n\n01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:34.680\nbut rather want people to understand that I acknowledge how amazing you are\n\n01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:42.680\nin your capacity to throw yourself against a horrible jagged, cold black wall.\n\n01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:52.680\nAnd just respond at face value when I'm clearly just in an alcoholic spiral of self-loathing\n\n01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.680\nwith like, are you alright?\n\n01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.680\nI will say she showed me the text and we went,\n\n01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.680\nAre you drinking?\n\n01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:08.680\nYeah, I was not in a good place, but I will say I was a very funny place.\n\n01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.680\nWell, I didn't know that you guys were getting divorced.\n\n01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.680\nWell, no, I wouldn't play that card.\n\n01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.680\nI knew she was in Ireland and I thought you were missing her.\n\n01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.680\nI was, I was, I was, my cat started dying and then I punched a wall and then, yeah.\n\n01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.680\nAnd then it's just, boy, had no idea the spiral that would happen.\n\n01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.680\nBut the tumor's okay.\n\n01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.680\nThey're just keeping a close eye on it, but yeah.\n\n01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.680\nHow often do you have to go back in, by the way?\n\n01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680\nEvery four months.\n\n01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680\nOh, wow.\n\n01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.680\nAnd they thought they saw something growing there for a while,\n\n01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.680\nbut now they're saying it's not growing and everything looks good.\n\n01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680\nCool.\n\n01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680\nGood.\n\n01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.680\nWell, the Bootsons, everybody.\n\n01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.680\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:01.680\nThe heroes of, of a, of a Las Feliz fiefdom dominated by the shadow of a,\n\n01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.680\nof a tree-hating overlord.\n\n01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.680\nNow, thanks guys.\n\n01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.680\nWe'll, we'll, we'll, we'll have you back soon.\n\n01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.680\nI know you're just a marshmallow inside.\n\n01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:16.680\nYou could, you could push a pencil through me anytime, Beth.\n\n01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680\nThank you, sir.\n\n01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680\nSee you soon.\n\n01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.680\nAll right.\n\n01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:28.680\nSo Colin, what's Fargo about?\n\n01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.680\nIs it about the city or?\n\n01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:36.680\nIt's about eucalyptus trees and death and, uh, no, uh, Fargo.\n\n01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.680\nUm, do you need any more vodka, by the way?\n\n01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.680\nI'm coming back to this microphone.\n\n01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.680\nOh yeah.\n\n01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.680\nYeah, you should do that.\n\n01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680\nThe camera likes that better.\n\n01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680\nAll right.\n\n01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.680\nThere we go.\n\n01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.680\nSo Fargo, uh, the first season, uh, which was the season you,\n\n01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.680\nyou know, the second season starts on Monday.\n\n01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.680\nAnd you all know I'm not in it, right?\n\n01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.680\nThat don't be upset about it.\n\n01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680\nIt's going to be okay.\n\n01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.680\nDon't worry.\n\n01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.680\nYou're going to get through it.\n\n01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.680\nNo, the second season is actually really great.\n\n01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680\nI've seen the first episode.\n\n01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.680\nIt's fantastic and all the people that they have in it are great.\n\n01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680\nIt's cool.\n\n01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.680\nSo it's like, it's like, um, I don't know.\n\n01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.680\nIt's like if you wanted to do like the Marvel universe thing with the\n\n01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.680\nColin brothers, that's what it is.\n\n01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.680\nI can't think of a, of a, of a worse idea on paper.\n\n01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680\nOn paper.\n\n01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680\nI know.\n\n01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680\nOn paper.\n\n01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680\nI was like, I can't.\n\n01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.680\nI mean, you know, it's really like that could have been some fuckin\n\n01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.680\nhorrible fan fiction dude.\n\n01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.680\nIt really could have been, but no holly for whatever reason.\n\n01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.680\nThat dude is on like another level.\n\n01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.680\nYou know, if Paul McCartney said there are seven levels,\n\n01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.680\nhe's on like the eighth or maybe the seventh.\n\n01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.680\nUm, and he wrote that first season of Fargo, which was really great.\n\n01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.680\nThat was sort of had a brief connection to the movie,\n\n01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680\nbut yet existed in its own right.\n\n01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.400\nthis next season was alluded to multiple times\n\n01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.120\nin the first season.\n\n01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.960\nAnd so Lou Solverson, who owned the cafe,\n\n01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.400\nwho Karateen played in the first season,\n\n01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.520\nhe is now played by Patrick Wilson,\n\n01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.520\nand it shows his whole experience as a sheriff\n\n01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.760\nin a completely different town.\n\n01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.160\nAnd it's supposedly badass.\n\n01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.800\nI've seen the first episode, it's great,\n\n01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.240\nand I cannot wait for the second episode.\n\n01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.360\nAnd I've been waiting fucking months\n\n01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.360\nfor the second episode.\n\n01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.560\nI'm so upset that I have to wait for this one.\n\n01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.680\nWe have Noah on the show, he was a pilot brother.\n\n01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.280\nWhen I was doing the pilot for community,\n\n01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.120\nhe was doing a pilot for,\n\n01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.440\nI can't remember the name of it now,\n\n01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440\nit was like some like,\n\n01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.360\nIt was on ABC, like Generation?\n\n01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.360\nIt was called like The Unknowables,\n\n01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.800\nor yeah, Generation, or something.\n\n01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.480\nSomething like that, yeah.\n\n01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.200\nOther people or something.\n\n01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200\nOther people's exes.\n\n01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.240\nYeah, and I got together with him for a round of drinks,\n\n01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.400\nand as we talked about, he's kind of hard to read,\n\n01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.360\nbut I don't know if having him on the show\n\n01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.280\nwill make me secure about myself,\n\n01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.280\nbut I think-\n\n01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.200\nNo, but you guys' verbal knowledge,\n\n01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.320\nyou guys will be able to communicate in a way,\n\n01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.120\nI don't know if anyone else will understand it,\n\n01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.320\nbut the two of you will be able to respond.\n\n01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.120\nDon't oversell it, I don't know,\n\n01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.960\nhe could just be like a eucalyptus tree,

artists dead on the inside,\n\n01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.280\nand yet fascinating?\n\n01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.560\nI love when they brought the circular stump\n\n01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.000\nthat they had been sending me pictures of,\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.680\nand everyone went, whoa!\n\n01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.800\nAnd I was like, okay, I'm the monster.\n\n01:13:40.800 -->

through this,\n\n01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.960\nI had no idea what they were gonna do,\n\n01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.240\nand I just here start scrolling through\n\n01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.080\na very long text conversation,\n\n01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.600\nand I said, well this is gonna be very interesting,\n\n01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.840\nbecause she's clearly not at all interested\n\n01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.920\nin what's happening right now,\n\n01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.280\nand is very interested in this text conversation.\n\n01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.960\nThat

Manager at a Denny's.\n\n01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.520\nCome on, we're to the Riverside.\n\n01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.080\nNo, he's the best damn General Manager in the world,\n\n01:15:44.080 -->

streets, there's no arguing there.\n\n01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.480\nYeah, pretty much, yeah.\n\n01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.080\nThe main streets of the suburbs.\n\n01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.760\nAre you young enough to ask how old you are?\n\n01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.040\nYou seem kind of younger, maybe I shouldn't ask that.\n\n01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.960\nIf you say, yeah, well, how old are you?\n\n01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.800\nDo you want to guess?\n\n01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.600\nI don't know, black toe cracks, so I would just say,\n\n01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.920\nI don't know, you're a kid, I don't know.\n\n01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.960\nYou seem like a kid, 20 something, 23, 25?\n\n01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.120\n28, 28 years old.\n\n01:16:15.120 -->

is that lifestyle?\n\n01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.520\nHow does that work?\n\n01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.360\nIt's frustrating.\n\n01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.200\nBecause I just stand up when I was a kid.\n\n01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.120\nIt's not delivery, it's the struggle for sure.\n\n01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.000\nLike, it's just, I'm very hungry all the time,\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.320\nI'm frustrated, I can look at anything,\n\n01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.920\nthank you, other guy right there,\n\n01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.920\nyour eviction notice too, for sure, yeah, I know, right?\n\n01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.560\nThat guy's going like this, right?\n\n01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.240\nJust so you know, I mean, he's playing it off,\n\n01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.240\nbut the guy's like, oh no, no, he'll well off.\n\n01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.720\nBut this is frustrating, I'm always hungry\n\n01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.440\nand stuff like that, I never have any gas.\n\n01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.120\nI always try to find a story in something,\n\n01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.440\nso if I see just like a kid crying about their ice cream,\n\n01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.400\nI need to find a social political turmoil\n\n01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.520\nabout how America is just some one kid\n\n01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.880\ncrying about their ice cream.\n\n01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.440\nI'm actually writing a song about foot fetishes.\n\n01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.960\nSo are you thinking in rhymes when you look at that kid?\n\n01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.800\nYeah, sometimes.\n\n01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.800\nSo you're like, cone, alone.\n\n01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.240\nYeah, exactly, you know, why?\n\n01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.840\nAmerica got boned, 900 number phone.\n\n01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.240\nYeah, pretty much.\n\n01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.480\nOkay, but I won't keep bragging.\n\n01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.240\nThe, but I'm curious, that's very interesting.\n\n01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.280\nBecause I've talked to like,\n\n01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.200\nI had dinner with Ben Folds once, humble brag,\n\n01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.360\nand I, and what I find interesting about musicians\n\n01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.000\nis that they, like I have like dialogue\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.440\nin my head all the time, like it's,\n\n01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.360\nI imagine myself, I don't want to flatter myself\n\n01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.640\nor offend anybody who has a legitimate mental illness,\n\n01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.000\nbut I, when you hear about like voices in your head,\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.120\nI always think like, there's got to be like\n\n01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.040\none drop of chemical difference in the brain\n\n01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.040\nbetween like a writer who's good at dialogue\n\n01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.560\nand like somebody who's setting themselves on fire\n\n01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.240\nbecause they can't stop like the voices in their head.\n\n01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.360\nBecause I just like, I'm just used to it.\n\n01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.200\nIt's just like, I just always hear talking,\n\n01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.680\ntalking, talking, talking, talking.\n\n01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.760\nAnd when people are talking to me,\n\n01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.640\nI see their words in front of my face, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.960\nI talked to Ben Folds and I'm like,\n\n01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.320\nwhat the fuck are musicians?\n\n01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.280\nHow does that work?\n\n01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.600\nAnd he said like, he can't, he has the same thing,\n\n01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.520\nbut it's melodies, which is so weird to me.\n\n01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.840\nCause to me, melodies are a thing you make up.\n\n01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.280\nLike you go down to the ditch and you just like,\n\n01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.760\noh, I need a melody.\n\n01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.720\nBut that's how other people feel about writing.\n\n01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.560\nAnd he feels that way.\n\n01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.560\nHe's like, I can't stop thinking of this melody.\n\n01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.680\nI can't get it out of my head,\n\n01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.080\nwhich I've heard from like Paul McCartney\n\n01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.440\nand stuff like that in interviews.\n\n01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.760\nYou're saying that for...\n\n01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.600\nIn interviews, he said.\n\n01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.520\nInterviews.\n\n01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.400\nHe said in interviews, you were so quick on the humble brag.\n\n01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.240\nThank you, Paul.\n\n01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.240\nSo quick on the trigger.\n\n01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.000\nIn interviews.\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.920\nWith the Macca.\n\n01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.760\nWith the Pow Macca.\n\n01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.200\nAs he's called in Brazil.\n\n01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.480\nColin Hanks is like, exhausted.\n\n01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.120\nI mean, he's been promoting his documentary\n\n01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.760\nprobably all week and he has to come here\n\n01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.480\nand like defend me from people.\n\n01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.200\nHe was very quick on the humble brag, yell.\n\n01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.200\nI really thank you for doing that.\n\n01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.280\nBut no, the thing that you're talking about,\n\n01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.440\nthe thing you're talking about,\n\n01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.480\nthere's a very big difference between crazy and insane.\n\n01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.400\nYou can deal with a crazy artist\n\n01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.560\nbecause they're constantly focused on whatever it is\n\n01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560\nthat their brain needs to focus on,\n\n01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.360\nwhether it's words or melody, whatever.\n\n01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.360\nThey're crazy because they hear melodies all the time.\n\n01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.360\nWhereas insane is just a fucking insane person.\n\n01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.720\nWell, you're always connecting things.\n\n01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.680\nBut here's the thing, when I listen to like Eminem lyrics,\n\n01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.160\nI'm like, this guy must have been born in a generation\n\n01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.960\nwhere it's like, oh, because of hip hop culture\n\n01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.440\nthat came before him and because of maybe something\n\n01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.080\nin his brain, like he's thinking phonetically\n\n01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.120\nbecause he rhymes shit that I'm like,\n\n01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.080\nthat didn't rhyme until you made it rhyme.\n\n01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.360\nDo you, do you think in rhymes?\n\n01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.280\nDo you hear rhymes in your head or?\n\n01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.520\nI definitely do.\n\n01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.680\nI mean, how I usually kind of start like the process is,\n\n01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.000\nevery song I do is a story.\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.480\nSo the first thing I do is I just think about\n\n01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.160\nwhat the story is gonna be about.\n\n01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.720\nSo I always have to make sure I have a beginning\n\n01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.800\nand middle and the end.\n\n01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.880\nAnd I always have to write out.\n\n01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.200\nI always have to write out the story.\n\n01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.040\nThat's a callback.\n\n01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.800\nThank you.\n\n01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.120\nYou wanna tell story, you're saying,\n\n01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.680\nso taking us back to the kid with the ice cream cone,\n\n01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.080\nyou're saying when you look at the kid with the ice cream\n\n01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.560\ncone, you're like, I wanna do, I wanna rap about that.\n\n01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.640\nYeah, pretty much like if I see a kid like,\n\n01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.080\nif he drops an ice cream, the first thing I think about was,\n\n01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.560\nthis kid must have had, like my story was,\n\n01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.960\nhe had a shitty day, no one wanted to like pick him\n\n01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.760\nfor kickball, his graham crackers were too soggy\n\n01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.840\nand all this other shit.\n\n01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.400\nAnd all he really fucking wanted was\n\n01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.920\nis that chocolate chip icing from Thrifty.\n\n01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.600\nHe was so excited to go out to the store.\n\n01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.400\nAnd then he tripped on somebody's like, fuck, you know what I'm\n\n01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.720\nsaying, my saving grace, and now I'm\n\n01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.160\ngonna destroy my teddy bear because I\n\n01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.280\ndon't know what else to do.\n\n01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.120\nThat's pretty much how I'm gonna put my story,\n\n01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.920\nbecause I feel like there's like a twisted bittersweet thing\n\n01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.640\nand anyone's moral of the story of the day,\n\n01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.200\nlike you can have the greatest day possible,\n\n01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.640\nbut I feel like something about your day is a bittersweet.\n\n01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.160\nSo I always try to make sure I end every note of my song\n\n01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.800\nin a bittersweet, lyrical, funny way.\n\n01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.520\nSo.\n\n01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.880\nLike bittersweet would be an example would be like,\n\n01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.480\nso he doesn't get any more ice cream, but like,\n\n01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.640\nbut he's going to lose weight.\n\n01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.800\nYeah, pretty much, yeah, like the moral of the story is he's\n\n01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.720\nnot going to be diabetic, you know what I'm saying?\n\n01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.600\nSo I mean.\n\n01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.240\nYeah, I guess it's diabetes will come a year later, later,\n\n01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.560\nlater, later.\n\n01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.840\nAnd that's like the, and then it goes into some weird sketch\n\n01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.440\nyou with you and your friends in a car.\n\n01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.480\nYeah, it's like smoking a lot of marijuana, looking at the kid\n\n01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.560\nwho was like, oh, shit, your ice cream.\n\n01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.120\nAs we all have ice cream, we're like, aha, we have money,\n\n01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.120\nwe're adults, we have jobs, we just buy something else.\n\n01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.160\nI can never figure out how I feel about those comedy sketches\n\n01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.600\nthat rappers do on their albums.\n\n01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.040\nLike I'm like, on one hand, I don't want you to stop,\n\n01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.760\nbut on the other hand, you really need to take a workshop.\n\n01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.200\nOr this is this is insane.\n\n01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.320\nIt all kind of depends.\n\n01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.120\nIt's one of those things to where it's just like everyone\n\n01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.320\nwants to be something that like was like when you have like\n\n01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.520\nmovie stars who want to be singers like Jennifer Lopez,\n\n01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.120\nSelena, she was like, fuck, I have a great voice.\n\n01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.640\nAnd she was like, I'm going to go ahead and be a singer when\n\n01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.600\nyou have like actors or if you have like rappers or singers\n\n01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.440\nwho are like, you know what, I'm going to go into acting.\n\n01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.040\nYou can go when you're like, you know what,\n\n01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.240\nreally not that great of an actor,\n\n01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.400\nbut I'm going to still keep on doing it.\n\n01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.600\nSo it's kind of like the same thing with the skits, you know.\n\n01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.000\nI don't have very funny skits.\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.800\nI actually have a very, very corny skit with my girlfriend\n\n01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.280\nin it, where this is about like going on a shopping spree\n\n01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.800\nat a swap meet.\n\n01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.160\nAnd it's so corny.\n\n01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.960\nWe're still proud of it till this day and stuff.\n\n01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.840\nWe feel like we're like comedic geniuses.\n\n01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.680\nWhen people look at it, they're like, so this is a swap meet\n\n01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.480\nskit. And I'm like, yeah, it's funny.\n\n01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.120\nIt's her birthday.\n\n01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.320\nIt's a $60 shopping spree.\n\n01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.240\nShe wanted a person with $5 over.\n\n01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:04.880\nGo for it.\n\n01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.360\nAnd that same reaction you guys have right now,\n\n01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.400\nthat's the exact same feeling I get from my mother, my dad,\n\n01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:11.800\nall my friends.\n\n01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.640\nYou never know when you're going to hit the gold mine that\n\n01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.440\nis a decaying eucalyptus tree.\n\n01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.280\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.200\nLike you don't know what the people are\n\n01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.000\ngoing to consider an important story.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.440\nAll right, so when you battle mothers,\n\n01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440\ndo you do it sitting?\n\n01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:31.680\nDo you do, I got two beats from our man, Zach, in the booth.\n\n01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.240\nThere's a slower one and a faster one.\n\n01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.280\nDo you want to sit?\n\n01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.400\nDo you want to be congenial?\n\n01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.800\nDo we need to move the seats out and do it in the center?\n\n01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.400\nDo you want to face each other?\n\n01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.240\nHave you battled ever before, really?\n\n01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:46.760\nYeah.\n\n01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.600\nHow does that work?\n\n01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.200\nThat was the thing I was trying to ask you when I said\n\n01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:49.800\nabout the lifestyle.\n\n01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.080\nLike, how does that work?\n\n01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.680\nWhen I was 17, I started, I was like,\n\n01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.560\nI'm going to be a comedian.\n\n01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.200\nSo there was this whole thing going that was open mics.\n\n01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.880\nIt was like this weird, whoo, it was this whole culture.\n\n01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.160\nBut I was like, I have no, if I was supposed\n\n01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.640\nto write a movie about, what the hell does that look like?\n\n01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.360\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.120\nYou go to a place?\n\n01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.280\nDo you put your name in a hat?\n\n01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.000\nAnd then they bring you up?\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.720\nI mean, you can do open mics or something like that.\n\n01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.920\nI know I just started writing.\n\n01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.120\nI just started showing people.\n\n01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.960\nAnd I just tried talking to the right people.\n\n01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.400\nAnd I just started doing open mics or different gigs.\n\n01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.440\nSo I have a promoter that's saying, hey,\n\n01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.840\nI'm doing something in Santa Ana.\n\n01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.760\nTwo songs set.\n\n01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:29.760\nJust go in and do it.\n\n01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760\nAnd then you just hope for the best.\n\n01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.280\nBut these venues that are doing it publicly,\n\n01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.240\nthese are like showcases and stuff.\n\n01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.560\nAre people like, is it like a honky tonk\n\n01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.480\nwhere they're like boo you and throw beer bottles?\n\n01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.120\nIt depends.\n\n01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.440\nI mean, I actually had an experience like that two weeks ago.\n\n01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.640\nI was actually off Sunset Boulevard two weeks ago.\n\n01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.440\nI was actually a couple of blocks away from here.\n\n01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.400\nAnd I mean, I'm a very geeky rapper.\n\n01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.120\nAnd so when I go in there, I'm just real confident.\n\n01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.400\nBecause I'm lyrically awesome.\n\n01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.840\nBut the whole, I mean, I have to go in there like fuck this shit.\n\n01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.560\nI'm like hip hop Carlton.\n\n01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:06.080\nBut I'm really good at rapping.\n\n01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.560\nMy Tom Jones nigga, please.\n\n01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.120\nBut anyway, but I go in there.\n\n01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.280\nI'm all super confident.\n\n01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.400\nIt is a whole bunch of gangsters.\n\n01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.960\nI go in, I start rapping my stuff.\n\n01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.440\nI'm trying to talk to the crowd.\n\n01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.400\nAnd all these gangsters are just fucking quiet all day.\n\n01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.680\nBecause they're like, what's a go bot?\n\n01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.920\nYeah, exactly, right?\n\n01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.160\nAnd they're like, who's Aquaman?\n\n01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.680\nBecause I mentioned Aquaman in one of my songs, right?\n\n01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.360\nI got to talk about Batman and Robin actually\n\n01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.920\ngetting married and stuff like that.\n\n01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.200\nAnd so they just weren't feeling that shit at all.\n\n01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.080\nAnd so I was like, I don't know if they're going to boo me\n\n01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.840\nor shoot me in the face.\n\n01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.520\nAnd so it really sucks, Bobby.\n\n01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.000\nThis is one of those things where you have to keep going.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.520\nIf you believe in a dream, you just\n\n01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.280\ngot to keep going and just do whatever it takes.\n\n01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.320\nWell, I'm sorry to destroy your dream tonight.\n\n01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.640\nOh, wow.\n\n01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.200\nWe got to stand up now.\n\n01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.040\nBut you know what?\n\n01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.440\nWe got to stand up now.\n\n01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:54.940\nYeah.\n\n01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.920\nOh, shit.\n\n01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.040\nAll right.\n\n01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.080\nWell, should we start with the slow one?\n\n01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:01.560\nLet's see if.\n\n01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.480\nYou want me to start with the slow one?\n\n01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.540\nYeah.\n\n01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.040\nOK.\n\n01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.040\nThis is the slow one.\n\n01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:05.540\nGo for it.\n\n01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.040\nGo for it.\n\n01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.520\nThis is what you're going to teach me.\n\n01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.640\nSo yo, yo, is this a slow one?\n\n01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:16.360\nThat's very fast by my account.\n\n01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.440\nThey're saying one second.\n\n01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440\nOK, get ready to die.\n\n01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.160\nThey need a second before they drop the beat.\n\n01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.640\nHey, guys, straight up, real hip hop.\n\n01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.520\nI've been told you have to say that before you do one of those things.\n\n01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.040\nI'm clearing my head, by the way.\n\n01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.160\nI know, I know, I'm sure you've, I'm sure you're coming in with a big sack full of pre-written\n\n01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:35.660\nrhymes.\n\n01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.480\nNo, not at all.\n\n01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.400\nLike, I'm pretty much just a winger.\n\n01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.360\nI am promising you, the only thing I'm thinking about is don't rhyme mouth with south.\n\n01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.640\nWe're ready to go?\n\n01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.240\nHere we go.\n\n01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.040\nReal hip hop.\n\n01:26:51.040 -->

Oh, I don't understand it\n\n01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.120\nHi, I have to make a conscious decision\n\n01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.520\nDo that style where you just rhyme for a while\n\n01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.120\nBut you rhyme the time with it you rhyme the words instead of the on the beat\n\n01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.560\nYou don't rhyme with the feet. You like you do you just rhyme. It's just kind of sporadically\n\n01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.160\nAs soon as you hear a word you just start rhyming it\n\n01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:16.080\nI'm like, I don't think I don't think I'm always like to go without a beat. It's actually pretty funny\n\n01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.080\nKind of make\n\n01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:53.240\nI'll give your dad a job because he's a jerk and then I lick his ass and I'll suck his dick because your dad's looking a little sick\n\n01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.760\nI think he might have leukemia. I'll give him some treatment\n\n01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.080\nShe said\n\n01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.840\nShe's like me\n\n01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:11.800\nI'm like, that's not English. She's like, fuck me again\n\n01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.440\nSo I fucked your mama again, and then I left the house about a quarter to ten\n\n01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:21.080\nI got the mail went to work and then I came back and I caught your uncle in her crack\n\n01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:28.240\nI said, Uncle Bob, what are you doing? He said, I'm just looking for postage glue and I'm gonna put a stamp on an envelope\n\n01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:34.480\nI said, yeah, let's go hunt some antelopes. So we went to Africa on a safari. I put your mama so hard\n\n01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:39.480\nShe looked like Starry and she was taking ecstasy at the time. So we had to just go\n\n01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.720\nPoisonous vipers in the bush. I fucked your mama and her big-ass tush\n\n01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.360\nI fell inside and I looked around and I said, holy shit, it's a new hip-hop sound\n\n01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:04.360\nThe beats are bouncing off of her ass walls. I think that's about all I got to do is just say\n\n01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.840\nHa ha ha, and then your mama's ass does all the\n\n01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.240\nSo I wore a bitter coat and I came outside and there was a moat\n\n01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:17.080\nIt was, you know what you milk that she forgot to drink because your mama diet stinks\n\n01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:24.080\nShe just lays on her bed and fucking shit that people put in front of her\n\n01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080\nSnakes\n\n01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.080\nWait, keep it going like\n\n01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.080\nHe was talking about my mom that's not my feeling\n\n01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.080\nAfter this time, he's gonna be really, really, he's in this house and he's really fucking lonely\n\n01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.080\nLike I said before, good luck when you had a journey\n\n01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.080\nYes, and I do want full abs, so see if you really need abs\n\n01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.080\nIf we do those, you should look the streets\n\n01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.080\nYes, I even heard the taxes\n\n01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:02.080\nMan, you were really fucked up, no wonder everyone wants to leave you every time you speak this\n\n01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.080\nI know I'm real fucked up, it's a battle\n\n01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.080\nI don't give a shit, I'm real evil with this shit\n\n01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.080\nMy producer is now saying, shout out with this shit, I eat, keep harding it\n\n01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.080\nHere we go again, we're going round and round\n\n01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.080\nThe clock's like the clock's ticking, tick and tick, talking\n\n01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.080\nYes, quit talking about how you giving my mom the fucking stocking\n\n01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.080\nThere's a big requirement, one of the last times he's seen the tip\n\n01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.080\nEvery time you look down, it's all toes\n\n01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.080\nNo mo, you just a hoe\n\n01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.080\nAnd it's pipping up in here, West Hollywood, you a wee hoe\n\n01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.080\nWhoa-ho, slow down, no mo\n\n01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.080\nStop with that shit, I'm your man\n\n01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.080\nBut you ain't going hard, your Billy, Billy is too big\n\n01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.080\nI can't see nothing that you say it\n\n01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.080\nEvery time you see it, you always be spraying mediocrity\n\n01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080\nThe form of walking forward and deceiving\n\n01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.080\nYou just shake it like you got epilepsy\n\n01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.080\nI'm dropping knowledge, ha ha ha\n\n01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.080\nI'm dropping knowledge like Michael J.

01:36:10.080\nTo go ahead and say everything that I want to say\n\n01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.080\nOh, MC Clarity!\n\n01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.080\nThe winner, I think\n\n01:36:15.080 -->

second round I heard\n\n01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.080\nI could almost keep up with everything\n\n01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.080\nAnd it was badass, that was nice\n\n01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.080\nI'll be analyzing that shit for a little while\n\n01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080\nOh, wow\n\n01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.080\nAnd then it got really meta and uncomfortable\n\n01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.080\nWhen he was rapping about my twitching\n\n01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.080\nMy uncomfortable twitching\n\n01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.080\nAnd it was like, okay, this solves that theory\n\n01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.080\nOf when are these people who freestyle all the time\n\n01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.080\nHow much stuff do they have up their sleeve?\n\n01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.080\nNo, I was twitching and then he started rapping about the twitching\n\n01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.080\nYeah, see, if you give him something\n\n01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.080\nHe's going to work with it, because he's an artist\n\n01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.080\nAnd that's what artists do\n\n01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.080\nI thought I was the only one with flow\n\n01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.080\nNo\n\n01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.080\nA twitchy flow?\n\n01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.080\nA twitchy flow?\n\n01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.080\nColin, you don't have any wrap up your sleeve\n\n01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.080\nNo, I don't\n\n01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.080\nYou've never even wanted to try it, did you?\n\n01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.080\nNo, I'm not a rapper\n\n01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.080\nI'm not the rapper\n\n01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080\nThat's the other one\n\n01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.080\nMC Hanks?\n\n01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.080\nI was in a...\n\n01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.080\nI played bass in a band in college\n\n01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.080\nThat fancied itself as a live hip-hop group\n\n01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.080\nThere's a horrible thing to fancy themselves\n\n01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.080\nAnd we called ourselves the underlords\n\n01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.080\nSuch a horrible name for a band\n\n01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:43.080\nSo bad that the guy who was recording our demo\n\n01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.080\nLabeled us the overlords\n\n01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.080\nAnd he said, over, under, it doesn't matter\n\n01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.080\nIt does not matter\n\n01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.080\nSo you were a band first and then said, let's try rapping\n\n01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.080\nThat was the Beastie Boys, right?\n\n01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.080\nNo, I just played bass, I was just the quiet bass player\n\n01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.080\nYou're like, leave me out of this\n\n01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.080\nI'm just off to the side playing a bass\n\n01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.080\nAnd on that little demo that we made\n\n01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.080\nThe one thing that you cannot hear is the bass\n\n01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.080\nYeah\n\n01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.080\nSo this isn't something you kept?\n\n01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080\nNo, I still have it\n\n01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.080\nOh, you do still have it?\n\n01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.080\nOh, I still have it, it's really bad\n\n01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.080\nNo, you can't listen to any of it\n\n01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.080\nOkay\n\n01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.080\nI want to make sure I'm just going to check my Microsoft One Note\n\n01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.080\nI got to go to the bathroom real quick\n\n01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.080\nSpencer's got to make a little poopers\n\n01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.080\nOh, there is one thing\n\n01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.080\nIt's been sitting here the entire time\n\n01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.080\nWatching all of this\n\n01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.080\nHe's a professional\n\n01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.080\nI think we're about to get to his part of the show\n\n01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.080\nAnd he goes, I got to go to the bathroom\n\n01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.080\nDoesn't even wait to announce\n\n01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.080\nI got to go\n\n01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.080\nAnd just leaves\n\n01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.080\nThere's no permission\n\n01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.080\nIt's really gone to his head\n\n01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.080\nHe's doing it for free\n\n01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.080\nBut he got to executive produce\n\n01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.080\nI would hope he's shitting for free\n\n01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.080\nIf you were charging him, that would be really bad\n\n01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.080\nI mean the game mastering\n\n01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.080\nThere's one thing, we'll talk until he gets back\n\n01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.080\nDave Grohl is in your documentary\n\n01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:17.080\nAs a person who was just one of many people\n\n01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.080\nThat we recognized these days\n\n01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.080\nWho grew...\n\n01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.080\nHe's in documentaries\n\n01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.080\nHe's in a lot of documentaries\n\n01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.080\nHe made all of his in the time it took to make one\n\n01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.080\nThe appeal of Tower Records was the snobbery\n\n01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.080\nNot to put too fine a point on it\n\n01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.080\nI've always been fascinated with that idea\n\n01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:39.080\nI think I enact a lot of snobbery\n\n01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080\nWithout realizing I'm doing it\n\n01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.080\nBut I've never been patient for it at all\n\n01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.080\nWhat is that?\n\n01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.080\nThe idea that they like to go to record stores\n\n01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.080\nAnd be given a hard time or did back then\n\n01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.080\nWith Grohl, there's a very specific reason\n\n01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.080\nWhy I put Grohl in the documentary\n\n01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.080\nBecause everyone was like, when we released the trailer\n\n01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.080\nThere were some people that were like, oh great\n\n01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.080\nDavid Grohl is in another documentary about music\n\n01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.080\nLike that, Per the Rules\n\n01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.080\nHe has to be in every documentary about music\n\n01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.080\nIs this clips of him saying\n\n01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.080\nYou have to understand that at the time\n\n01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.080\nNobody had heard anything like this\n\n01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.080\nAnd it's just, it could be about anything\n\n01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.080\nIt's like clip art\n\n01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.080\nIt could be anything\n\n01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.080\nBut very specifically, he actually worked at Tower Records\n\n01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080\nBefore he was in Nirvana\n\n01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.080\nHe worked at a Tower Records in Washington DC\n\n01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.080\nSo I specifically went after him\n\n01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:33.080\nBecause I knew that he worked there\n\n01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.080\nAnd he talked a lot about the fact that\n\n01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.080\nA lot of the people that worked at music stores\n\n01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.080\nAt record stores have a tendency\n\n01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.080\nTo be pretty snobbish\n\n01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.080\nI had to tell you\n\n01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080\nI can't wait to see this\n\n01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.080\nBecause the tower that was here on Sunset Boulevard\n\n01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.080\nWhen I moved here in 83\n\n01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.080\nWhich I think was the year it opened\n\n01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.080\nIt opened on Sunset\n\n01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.080\nNo, it opened in the 70s\n\n01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.080\nBut it opened for you in 1983\n\n01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.080\nThat's right, it was in...\n\n01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.080\nIn New York was in 1981\n\n01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.080\nAnyway, but the reason that I can't wait to see it\n\n01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.080\nIs because I never encountered that\n\n01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.080\nI never encountered snobbery\n\n01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.080\nAnd I lived in that Tower Record\n\n01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.080\nFor years\n\n01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.080\nI was there constantly\n\n01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.080\nAnd one of the things that I thought was so sorry\n\n01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.080\nAbout the whole thing going south\n\n01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.080\nWas that there was a social environment there\n\n01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.080\nWhich everyone has lost\n\n01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.080\nAs a result of going to MP3s\n\n01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.080\nYeah, no, I always sort of say\n\n01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.080\nThat there are two things that are missing now\n\n01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.080\nThat these stores have a tendency to not really exist\n\n01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.080\nAnd I'm saying this knowing full well\n\n01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.080\nThat we're in the back of a comic store\n\n01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080\nWhere this happens every day\n\n01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.080\nBut there are two things that happen\n\n01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.080\nA is there's the social interaction\n\n01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.080\nBetween people at the stores\n\n01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.080\nWho are going through bins\n\n01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.080\nAnd seeing what the other person is doing\n\n01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.080\nAnd maybe there's a connection there that can be made\n\n01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.080\nOr there's at least some sort of connection\n\n01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.080\nBeing made between the person that is taking the money\n\n01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.080\nAnd the person that is giving the money\n\n01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.080\nThe only difference now is that\n\n01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.080\nI don't remember what I was doing when I downloaded some song\n\n01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.080\nThere's no special moment of like\n\n01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.080\nOh man, I'm about to download this\n\n01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.080\nThat is going to change my life\n\n01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.080\nOr like man, I remember where I was when I downloaded this\n\n01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.080\nBut I remember where I was when I bought an album\n\n01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.080\nThat meant a great deal to me\n\n01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.080\nAnd that is something that is somewhat special\n\n01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.080\nAt least to me\n\n01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.080\nIt's notable to notice the lack of that\n\n01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.080\nBut it's also like, let's be honest\n\n01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:36.080\nI mean, you could say\n\n01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.080\nYou could say the same thing about making bread or something\n\n01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.080\nLike people used to have to\n\n01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.080\nWell, we need a loaf of bread\n\n01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.080\nSo I guess I know what I'm doing Wednesday\n\n01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:49.080\nAnd then once bread started to be made by other people\n\n01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.080\nIt's like, we lost Wednesday\n\n01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.080\nWhen bread started to get streamlined\n\n01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.080\nWe lost our Wednesdays\n\n01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.080\nAnd it's true, but it's not necessarily good or bad\n\n01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.080\nAgain, I do feel like in that documentary\n\n01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.080\nI often feel this way about documentaries\n\n01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.080\nBut people that contributed so much to popular culture\n\n01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.080\nThey beat up on themselves so much\n\n01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.080\nIn the third acts, like they're like\n\n01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.080\nOh, but we could have never known\n\n01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.080\nIt was going to be the end of everything\n\n01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:21.080\nDid you see the Paul Williams documentary?\n\n01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.080\nThat guy is so hard on himself\n\n01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.080\nFor being one of the most amazing people\n\n01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.080\nFor all of everything in the 70s\n\n01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.080\nAnd being one of the most inspiring, interesting people\n\n01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.080\nIt's like this diminutive guy that just experimented\n\n01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.080\nKind of like Beth Bootson with the idea of\n\n01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.080\nLike I'm here mocking her\n\n01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.080\nAnd she's like, I'm going to be bulletproof, I don't care\n\n01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.080\nI'm so at peace with myself\n\n01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.080\nAll I care about is whether you're okay\n\n01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.080\nAnd so this tiny little guy\n\n01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.080\nWho was a brilliant songwriter\n\n01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.080\nAnd wrote all of these hits\n\n01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.080\nAll of a sudden he becomes this amazing celebrity\n\n01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.080\nAnd it wasn't because there weren't\n\n01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.080\nTaller, more handsome people available\n\n01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.080\nIt was because people loved him\n\n01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.080\nBecause he was so unflappable and so sincere\n\n01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.080\nAnd yeah, it was the 70s\n\n01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.080\nSo he did a bunch of coke and drank\n\n01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:12.080\nAnd the documentary kind of\n\n01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.080\nFollows him looking back on those days\n\n01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.080\nAnd at the end of it I felt like I had to tweet him\n\n01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.080\nAnd go like, you're too hard on yourself\n\n01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.080\nMan, that's like, so what?\n\n01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.080\nYou rubbed your nose during the Dick Cavett show\n\n01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.080\nLike what the fuck?\n\n01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.080\nYou were great\n\n01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.080\nAnd he wrote back like, yeah\n\n01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.080\nBut I have to find peace and grace and all this stuff\n\n01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.080\nAnd it's just like, no, be drunk again with me\n\n01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:34.080\nNo, no, no, I don't know what it is\n\n01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.080\nIt's like, you don't want to fuck with that shit\n\n01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.080\nBut I feel like people are too hard on themselves\n\n01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080\nIn these documentaries where it's like\n\n01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.080\nYeah, we did this thing and then\n\n01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.080\nLike what was Tower Records supposed to do?\n\n01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:47.080\nThe important thing that I, the most important thing\n\n01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.080\nThat I kept trying to remind myself was the fact that\n\n01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.080\nI was being interested to tell these people's stories\n\n01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.080\nAnd so when I see things\n\n01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.080\nAnd when I see documentaries\n\n01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.080\nAnd people are being too hard on themselves\n\n01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.080\nI go, no, they should be hard on themselves\n\n01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.080\nBecause it was their lives\n\n01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.080\nThis is what they did, for better or for worse\n\n01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.080\nThis is what they did\n\n01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.080\nAnd a lot of times, especially\n\n01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.080\nWhen you get into these scenarios where documentaries\n\n01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.080\nAre talking about, you know, people\n\n01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.080\nThat dedicated their lives to something\n\n01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.080\nThey will spend the rest of their lives wondering\n\n01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.080\nWhat they could have done differently\n\n01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.080\nAnd we gave\n\n01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.080\nPeople that worked at Tower a chance to be able to\n\n01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.080\nTalk about that and to sort of\n\n01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.080\nMaybe, just maybe\n\n01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:28.080\nGive them an opportunity to sort of get them\n\n01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.080\nYou know, get that off their chest\n\n01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.080\nAnd you captured really powerful moments\n\n01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.080\nWhat's your relationship between acting and\n\n01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.080\nI mean, now you, what does it take\n\n01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.080\nTo direct a documentary and how does that compare to\n\n01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.080\nBecause you can just show up to a place\n\n01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.080\nAnd have your own trailer and have people put makeup\n\n01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.080\nOn your face and go have fun\n\n01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.080\nYeah, that

01:46:16.080\nNo, but like\n\n01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.080\nWith the documentary thing it was really\n\n01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.080\nSomething that I started doing because\n\n01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.080\nI wasn't working because\n\n01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.080\nI couldn't find any acting work\n\n01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.080\nAnd I'm not a writer, I don't pretend\n\n01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.080\nTo be a writer, a lot of actors\n\n01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.080\nDo\n\n01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.080\nOuch\n\n01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.080\nOh wait\n\n01:46:34.080 -->

01:46:42.080\nNeeded some sort of outlet and so this\n\n01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.080\nDoc proved to be it and since I started\n\n01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.080\nMaking it, I've done a couple of other ones\n\n01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:48.080\nAnd I'm not\n\n01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.080\nPretending to be a documentary filmmaker\n\n01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.080\nThis is just one story that I really wanted to tell\n\n01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.080\nAnd I was lucky enough to\n\n01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.080\nWell you just swell at it, yeah\n\n01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.080\nIt's

seemingly\n\n01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.080\nUnprovoked murder of the\n\n01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.080\nStorage clerk go and answer\n\n01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.080\nWill his new MP3-access\n\n01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.080\nSpark a revolution\n\n01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.080\nOr just draw a bigger crowd\n\n01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.080\nWill the Eagle ever return\n\n01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.080\nWith the Johnson's location\n\n01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.080\nThat's a callback\n\n01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:02.080\nFind out this week on Shadowrunners\n\n01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.080\nI'm so lost right now\n\n01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.080\nSo fuck it\n\n01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.080\nYou made the documentary about tower records\n\n01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:20.080\nTo play the game about MP3s\n\n01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.080\nAnd shit\n\n01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.080\nJesus, that was an aggressive clap\n\n01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.080\nReally approved that thought\n\n01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:34.080\nI agree with him\n\n01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:36.080\nYou just piled in this van\n\n01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.080\nFull of MP3s\n\n01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.080\nYou're pulling out of the driver place\n\n01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.080\nAnd cops\n\n01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.080\nCops are coming\n\n01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.080\nYou're hearing them\n\n01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.080\nFucking pigs\n\n01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.080\nYeah, you're driving\n\n01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.080\nAnd you're not even the best driver\n\n01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.080\nHey, I'm driving\n\n01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.080\nI'm not even the best driver\n\n01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.080\nHey, the cops are coming\n\n01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.080\nQuick, drive better\n\n01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.080\nAway from the cops\n\n01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.080\nPlease return your tray tables\n\n01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.080\nAll that stuff you say\n\n01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:14.080\nWhat a cool van\n\n01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.080\nWhere are we going?\n\n01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:18.080\nWell, first we got to lose our tail\n\n01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.080\nOkay, turn left up here\n\n01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080\nI love this game\n\n01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.080\nInfinite possibilities, guys\n\n01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.080\nTurn left up here\n\n01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080\nYou\n\n01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:42.080\nYou turn left down the street\n\n01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.080\nYou're going down an alleyway\n\n01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.080\nIt's really narrow\n\n01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.080\nBut down at the other side of the alleyway\n\n01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.080\nIt's just a whole other street\n\n01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.080\nThat seems to be free of cops\n\n01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.080\nGood idea\n\n01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.080\nPromove, dude, good job\n\n01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.080\nIt's not my first rodeo\n\n01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:04.080\nIt's my first rodeo\n\n01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.080\nBut let's\n\n01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.080\nHey, how are you doing back there?\n\n01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:10.080\nYou other two?\n\n01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.080\nI'm having a smashing time, thank you\n\n01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.080\nI'm feeling really insecure\n\n01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.080\nOf my Americanness\n\n01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.080\nAs you should\n\n01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.080\nIt's alright\n\n01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.080\nNone of us are good at channel running\n\n01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.080\nYou'll get used to it\n\n01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.080\nI keep driving\n\n01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.080\nIf I feel like I've lost the cops\n\n01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.080\nI'll go back to the last stand\n\n01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:42.080\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.080\nYou do that\n\n01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080\nYou go out to the other street\n\n01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.080\nIn this street there's no cops\n\n01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.080\nYou seem to have lost them for the moment\n\n01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.080\nOh, both, I've got a map\n\n01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.080\nCan that help?\n\n01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.080\nYou find where you are\n\n01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:06.080\nThere we are\n\n01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.080\nI'm just gonna let you go\n\n01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.080\nWhere are we?\n\n01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:14.080\nWhere are we?\n\n01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.080\nYou're in the Barrens\n\n01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.080\nYou're about 15 minutes away\n\n01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.080\nFrom Hank's last stand\n\n01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.080\nWhich I don't think is marked on that map\n\n01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.080\nIn Seattle\n\n01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.080\nSeattle 272\n\n01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.080\nHey, let's go to Tacoma\n\n01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:34.080\nSend every British tourist\n\n01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:36.080\nEver\n\n01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.080\nAs soon as they get to the airport\n\n01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.080\nSeattle Tacoma\n\n01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.080\nSeattle Tacoma\n\n01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:48.080\nLet's go to Tacoma\n\n01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080\nStay out of downtown\n\n01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.080\nEverywhere\n\n01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.080\nThat's good\n\n01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.080\nCan we go to Tacoma?\n\n01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.080\nTacoma's license plate frame\n\n01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.080\nThey're not in the state\n\n01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.080\nThey don't have a license plate frame\n\n01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.080\nI was gonna say\n\n01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.080\nDependent on Europeans misunderstanding\n\n01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.080\nSince 1905\n\n01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:10.080\nYou could definitely head to Tacoma\n\n01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.080\nNo, no, no, come on\n\n01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.080\nDon't be ridiculous\n\n01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.080\nCome on, we're gonna go back to where we got the job\n\n01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.080\nOkay, yeah, let's go there\n\n01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.080\nWhere's the...\n\n01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:22.080\nWhere is it? Where's the last stand?\n\n01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.080\nIt's not marked on that map\n\n01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.080\nMark it\n\n01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.080\nRelax\n\n01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.080\nI know 2072 Seattle\n\n01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.080\nLike the back of my cybernetic hand\n\n01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.080\nCome out to the coast\n\n01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.080\nHave a few laughs\n\n01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.080\nYou screech to a halt\n\n01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:50.080\nAre we at the last stand?\n\n01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.080\nNo\n\n01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.080\nI didn't mean to screech to a halt\n\n01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.080\nI'm just turning\n\n01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.080\nOkay\n\n01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.080\nAre you telling us we have to tell you\n\n01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.080\nWhere we go?\n\n01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080\nNo, tell me you want to go to the bar\n\n01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.080\nI said\n\n01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.080\nI don't think so\n\n01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.080\nThose at home can rewind\n\n01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.080\nBut I will say again\n\n01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.080\nI'd like to go to Hank's last stand\n\n01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.080\nYou arrive at Hank's last stand\n\n01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:18.080\nYou arrive at Hank's last stand\n\n01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.080\nHey, any landing you can walk away from, right?\n\n01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.080\nI don't know if you notice Colin, but my character's based on Bruce Willis\n\n01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:36.080\nI know a bartender\n\n01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.080\nYou totally tell from your lack of hair\n\n01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:42.080\nSo is there someone in Hank's last stand we need to see?\n\n01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.080\nHank\n\n01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:46.080\nMy bartender doesn't help\n\n01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.080\nAlright, well where the fuck's Hank?\n\n01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.080\nHey guys, how's it going?\n\n01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:52.080\nHey Hank\n\n01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.080\nVery well, thank you\n\n01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:04.080\nLooks like you have some hot vehicular merchandise there\n\n01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:06.080\nWe're coming in hot Hank\n\n01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:10.080\nLet me let me let you pull into my back garage\n\n01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.080\nFor safe keeping\n\n01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.080\nThis isn't a euphemism for something else\n\n01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:16.080\nBut it sounds like a plan\n\n01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.080\nAlright, no it's not this time\n\n01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.080\nOh, not this time\n\n01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.080\nAlright\n\n01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.080\nYou pull into his garage and he's like\n\n01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:26.080\nWhat do you guys got for me, a van?\n\n01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:30.080\nYou tell him Bruce\n\n01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:34.080\nWe got the MP3s\n\n01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:36.080\nThe MP3s, that's right\n\n01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.080\nWe got some MP3s\n\n01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:40.080\nBased on that improvisational\n\n01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:42.080\nMission that started with Paul Scheer\n\n01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:44.080\nRift some shit\n\n01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:46.080\nIt's finally over\n\n01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:54.080\nWe yes-handed it for six goddamn weeks\n\n01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:58.080\nAnd I'm not saying he kept us from doing anything remarkable\n\n01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.080\nBut it's finally over\n\n02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.080\nThere went a heaven of riffs\n\n02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.080\nComedic riffs\n\n02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.080\nSo yeah, we'd like to\n\n02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.080\nWe'd like to offload\n\n02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.080\nThose, right?\n\n02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:12.080\nBecause they're not just MP3s\n\n02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:16.080\nThey're bootleg MP3s\n\n02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.080\nThat means that we did it illegally\n\n02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.080\nWhich makes it worth more\n\n02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.080\nThis is going to be worth a lot to me\n\n02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.080\nYou know, we're going to have\n\n02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.080\nAsses and seats and benches\n\n02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.080\nAnd on stools\n\n02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.080\nAll the places you need asses\n\n02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.080\nBut you know, there's a small matter of price\n\n02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:42.080\nLet's talk terms\n\n02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:46.080\nEve Libertine, you usually do the talking\n\n02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.080\nAm I the, okay\n\n02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.080\nDon't worry about any of that shit\n\n02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.080\nI don't know what any of it means\n\n02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.080\nJust off the top of your head\n\n02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.080\nI'm severely allergic to seafood\n\n02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.080\nAddicted to seafood\n\n02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.080\nIf that is relevant in any way, shape or form\n\n02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.080\nYou feel seafood withdrawals\n\n02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:08.080\nYeah, so maybe I'm not the finance person this time around\n\n02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.080\nYeah, just negotiate\n\n02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.080\nYou're the negotiator\n\n02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080\nWhat's the sticker price?\n\n02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.080\nEight\n\n02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:18.080\nLet's start with that\n\n02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.080\nI think it's eight\n\n02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.080\nThe sticker price on all these is six\n\n02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.080\nSix\n\n02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.080\nWell, I heard eight and so I'm saying eight\n\n02:01:26.080 -->
