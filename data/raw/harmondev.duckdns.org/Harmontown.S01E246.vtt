You know where he is?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nHe's whale hunting\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nHe's out hunting whales\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nFor sport\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nNot even for oil\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nHe's hunting whales for sport\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nDo you know where he gets his...\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nThe oil for his whale harpoon gun\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nWhich uses twice as much oil\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nAs a whale generates?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nZebra\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nHe uses zebra oil to hunt whales\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nFor sport\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:19.000\nDid you tell him about the puppy dress he made?\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nHe didn't even wear it\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nWith his ivory sewing machine?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nConflict ivory?\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nNot regular free range\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nThe elephant knows it's been raised\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nTo give ivory ivory\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nLike actual fucking like\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nThere's a Gaza strip of the ivory poachers\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nAnd I know this is challenging for you\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nBut there's two kinds of poachers\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd one is technically relatively other kind\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.000\nThe good kind of poacher\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd Spencer is not on their side\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nHe exploits them\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nThe poacher you'd feel sorry for\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nIf you were sealed in a room with only poachers\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nAnd had only known them\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nThat's the poacher that he exploits\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nAlright, well so be thankful\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nHe's not here is my point\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nIt's just little old me\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nWith his lack of a show\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nOh boy, let's go to Burbank\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nAnd pay, what is it $5 now?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nMan, I snuck in\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\n$75?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nOh, they're creeping it up\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nSo I thought $5 was like\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nLook, it'll be half price\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nLike half what they paid at Meltdown\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nAnd then we can be twice as bad\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nAnd you'll break even\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nHow much was that drink?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nOkay, we'll see\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nIt was an optional dollar\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nYeah, it cost you a dollar\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nThere was a jar that made you feel guilty\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nThe cost of being a human\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nIs a dollar\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:47.000\nThe drink was free\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nOtherwise we're under arrest\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nIt's the Marmot Town, speak easy\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nBut thank you, thank you\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nYou're welcome here, sir\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nYou're not mic'd, but you're welcome here\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nAlright, well, yeah, I've spent\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nSee, I've been doing this thing\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nI ran in last minute because\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nBut this is really valuable for me\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nI started making these little\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nGarage band songs and music videos\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nAnd putting them on Instagram\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nAnd it's been very therapeutic for me\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nBecause it's not something I'm supposed to be good at\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nI'm not a musician\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nNope\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nWrong, I am, it turns out\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nNo, no, no, I'm just making these goofy little songs\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nI'm using only the free software\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nAnd only using my phone\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:32.000\nAnd my little earbud microphone\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nAnd anything that exceeds that\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nBecause I want it to be a hobby, not a profession\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nSo I'm not supposed to be good at it\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nSo it was very relaxing to me\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nI was having a really good time\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nAnd it was churning out these amazing little hits\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nWe cannot wait\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nThese little loopable...\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nWe cannot wait\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nHe's quite a wordsmith\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nOh, shit\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nOkay, here we go\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nWorld premiere\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.000\nIt's still my other hobby\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nWhich is getting this show to the point\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nWhere I can just play shit\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nI'm falling behind in that hobby\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nI can't, it'll take ten minutes of dead air\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nBut yeah, if you follow me on Instagram\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nI just make these little ditties about taking poops\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nAnd being hungover and stuff\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nAnd so I was having a good time\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nIt would take about two hours to make the song\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nAnd then run around and shoot stuff\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nLike knee-pooping and stuff\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nAnd then I'd put it together in Loomah Fusion\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:29.000\nThe IOS is a premier non-linear editor\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nWe lost Brandon, we lost him\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nIt's not a good show\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nNo, you can go do it\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.000\nYou were gonna make a drink\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.000\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nNo, we're fine\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nWe're fine\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nOkay\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nWhat?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nHe was helping\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nOh, oh, you're picking the thing up\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nI want to hear the story\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nWell, don't pick up\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nBad optics\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nAll right, so the...\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:53.000\nI'm really relaxed, I'm happy\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nThen Cody gets sick\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nShe's got like a throat thing or something\n\n06:58.000 --> 06:59.000\nSome kind of throat thing\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nAnd it's like she's quarantined\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nSo we can't see each other\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nSo I'm like, I'm gonna make...\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.000\nThank you, Chris\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nHe got the phone to work\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nSteve Levy is plugging in the phone for you\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nOh, you plugged it, you plugged in my phone\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nOr you plugged in...\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nIt's my phone, you're on Instagram\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nOkay\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nYou're a public figure, that's how it works\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nOkay\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nAll right\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:22.000\nThat makes sense\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:29.000\nHe got the Spencer shit down\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nI've been watching a lot of Star Trek too\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nAnd it really makes me miss Spencer\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nBecause the relationship between Kirk and Spock\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nIs not to endow myself as Kirk\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nBut the dynamic between them\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nMakes me miss Spencer a lot\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nBut that show is straight up racist\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nBut before you could even be regular racist\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:52.000\nI get a millennial sense\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nIt was like, not only...\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nForget about...\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nWe'll talk about Nichelle Nichols in a second\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nAnd the treatment of her character\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nAnd all the women\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nBut forget about that\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nWe know that the 60s were an unenlightened time\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nAnd that we are now living in a camelot\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nOf progression\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nHistorians will look back on 2017\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nAnd say they really understood\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nThey really got it\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nThere's gonna be a hot dog on our dollar next week\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nWe might as well just do whatever we want\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nNo one's ever gonna see from history\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nWhich is what you were supposed to be doing\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nThrough the canopy of fucking Trump\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nYou might as well just do whatever you want down here\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nWomen, I don't like them\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nYou guys only heard that\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nThe aliens will never hear it\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nThey'll be watching him touch a ball with a wizard\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:49.000\nThey're like, these people were fascinated with this man\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:53.000\nWho was so strange and wonderful, I guess\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nBecause we don't know anything\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nOur DNA only has three letters\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd all of them are genius\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nAnd so we have no life\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:06.000\nWe sleep for a million years just to make bread\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nBecause it comes all the way around\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nThey're genetically washed out\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nWe conduct people and replenish our DNA with ape man\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nAnd cow anus\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nI love this recipe already\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nPart ape man, part cow anus\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nTry it, blimp flock\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nI'm feeling a little feisty\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nLike you could make a coffee table book\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nNo, don't be ridiculous\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nI am part of the me mards\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nThen keep trying and I'll be back with more cow anus\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nBut we already tried that\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nShut up\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nOh, Star Trek\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nYeah, well whatever, man\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nBut I'm saying that show didn't even know\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nThat non-white people belong on TV yet\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd it was still racist\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nBecause they made up a race called Vulcans\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd all they did was bust his balls the whole show\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nBecause he only had one thing about him\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nAnd he was just like, look, I have one gimmick\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nIt's kind of easy to understand\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nIt's sort of my religion\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI have a funny haircut, pointy ears\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nAnd it's associated with the fact that I only deal in logic\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nI don't deal in emotion\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nAnd then they're like, okay, got it\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nSo we understand that\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nSo at the end of every episode\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:20.000\nThey'd be like, of course, that was kind of feelings, wasn't it, Spock?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd he's like, it's like, why...\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nHe's just like, everything in his face is like\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nLike, why do you do this?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nWhy do you...\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nLike, when is this gonna get funny?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nI can't hear the fucking impish music\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nI can only yes and you logically\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nI know that's gonna make you even funnier\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nLike, what if I...\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nWhat if Spock was just like, you're right, come on, guys\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nLeave me alone!\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nAnd then they'd be like, ew\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nAnd then you'd hear that like flute, that comedic Star Trek flute\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nBut then they'd stop respecting him, right?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nBecause he'd stop saving their life all the time\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nAnd he wouldn't be able to throw them through walls\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nBut he... I don't know\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nThat's how we treated exchange students\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nDid you have exchange students in your high school?\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nLike, there was some kid from a...\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nThey'd go like, this is Andre\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nAnd he's from...\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nGermany\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nI mean, Germany is the easiest to pick on\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nLike, the German ones were the hardcore\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nBecause the jeans would be too short and too tight\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnd there'd be like one ball hanging out awkwardly\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nThere was a guy from Barcelona that came to our high school\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nI didn't want to say that because I don't want you to think I went to some rich people's high school\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd I don't know, it feels like exchange students\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nLike, they come from like warmer climates, maybe you're richer or something\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nLike, I went to a shitty high school\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nLike, I don't know why anyone from Barcelona would come to Milwaukee\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nBut God damn, they must have been so fucking bummed out\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nAnd then to be in our little 600-kid high school\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nAnd this brown deer with Scott said\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nAnd the kids were just like, so fascinated for the first two weeks\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nThey're like, hey, say this\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nSay, say, meh-ball\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nWhatever our thing, you know, whatever our shwiftie\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nI tried to change it from shwiftie last minute in the tip work\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nI tried to say, just say, goy already\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nYou know, like in your high school, you got your little things\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:10.000\nYou go like, Nordflork, and that means pussy\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nBut it also means like, the principal's fat or whatever\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nYou got your codes\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nAnd then so the kid, you say, Nordfe, say, hey, Andre, say Nordflork\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nAnd he's like, what does this mean, it's Nordflork\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nHe said, just now, that's already funny\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nWhat does this mean, it's Nordflork?\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nHe asked what Nordflork is\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nThat's not actually funny, it doesn't, when you grow up and start practicing comedy\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nYou find out that doesn't qualify as a joke\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nTo confuse someone and for them to seek clarification\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nIt's not funny, it wouldn't work if you saw it on SNL\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nThey wouldn't, you know, I'm not saying that's a gold standard\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nBut they wouldn't say this sketch is ready to go\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nYeah, third grade style, like fifth grade jokes\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nBut then they finally go Nordflork\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nAnd then, whoa, the roof comes off the school\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.000\nAnd Andre said, Nordflork, and then he says it again\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nLike, because either he's gonna play ball\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nHe's like, that was a real Nordflork\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nAnd then you're like, ugh\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nAnd then that's how we consume people, that's what we do\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nWe're just a big, that's what society is\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nWe're individually, we're wonderful people\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nWe're better than the drafts, that doesn't sound like a broken record\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nBut the chimpanzee is a beautiful beast\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nAnd we are basically chimps\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:24.000\nThe thing that we created by becoming the perfect chimp\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\nWhich is society, a byproduct\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nI would say a wasteful byproduct at this point\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nWe're all choking on it\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nSociety is like carbon monoxide from a car\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nLike it's exhaust, society has been created around us\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nOr let's say, excess society\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nSociety you probably wouldn't complain about\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nIf you were running through the apocalypto forest\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nAnd there were people behind you going like, you know\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nYou don't have a society, so we're gonna kill you\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nAnd then your society came the other direction\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nAnd through the jungle it'd be like, thank god for society\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nBut that's just gang shit in a jungle\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nThen you start like making things to grind your food\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nInstead of it and blah blah blah\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nAnd then you cut to, you know, the stuff that we're in right now\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nWhere you're like looking at Twitter and you're getting mad\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nBecause there's a guy with a shirt that says Buc-O-Fama\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd you're like, you can't swear?\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nYou don't know how to swear?\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nWhat are you, what are you, posh?\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nYou don't want to, you don't want to sully\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nYour fucking forebrain with a profanity?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nIt's a free country, say Buc-O-Fama\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nYou fucking hillbilly nerd\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nI wouldn't want to use the F word\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nBut let's just say that person's not human\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nWhere was I, I don't know how to say I\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nI'm, man, I'm stuck on that superior champ thing\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nOh, well yeah, well that was amazing\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nBut then we're done together, we're this biomass\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd what we do is, starting on the playground\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nWe see individuals and we start practicing coalescing\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nWe go like, oh, what kind of shoes do you have?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nI don't know, what kind of shoes do you have?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nSame shoes, same shoes, well that's good\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nYour shoes are two the same, well my shoes will be a little bit different\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nOkay, well that person's a different shoes\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nThey're a little cool, they're a little cool\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd you're forming this little blob\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nAnd then there's the kids, all of whom became my listeners\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nWho are in, or like further away from the blob\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nThere's never going to be any coalescence\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nIt's going to be, it's like way over here\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nSo the blob goes like, whoa!\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nScoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:21.000\nJust visiting, not coming over here\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nWhat's with your shoes\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nAnd you go like, I fail to see the logic\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nAnd why you're asking the shoes\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nEnergy!\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nAnd there was no exchange about shoes and all\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nYour soul was just sucked away\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nAnd the blob goes, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot goes away\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nOr the suckers go, oh come on guys\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nI'll try a little harder next time\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nAnd kind of follow the blob along\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nBut they'll never be a part of, and like\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nThose are the people like in Blade\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nThat have the tattoo on the back of their neck\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.000\nThe thralls, the glyph slaves, the familiars\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nThe renfords that will then run out into the night\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nOr the daytime for Dracula and go do whatever\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nRenf, renf, renf, what the hell was that guys?\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nRenfield, Renfield, that was close\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nOh shit, we have a guest, he's standing over there\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nOkay, what do you want?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nDid you schedule anything for me tomorrow?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nYeah\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nIt's Memorial Day\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nOkay, but I didn't know that when\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nYeah, you didn't remember\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nI was asked to schedule that day\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nWho asked you to schedule something?\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nSmalls\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nOkay, that's writing work\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nNo, not Leonard Smalls, who's Leonard Smalls?\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nI could work with Leonard Smalls if I wanted\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nWhoever that is\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nSo you want me to cancel?\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nNo, because we're way behind on that\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nWell, maybe, look\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nWe should do this right now you guys\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nYou have a fun dinner tomorrow night\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nWe should do this right now\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nYeah\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nBecause there's no, you know, there's not a guest over there\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nFred, I'll bring you up in a second\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI just got a few calendar items to serve\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nI want to clear my day tomorrow\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nRespect for one person's time on stage, it's mine\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nI'm a real wizard about it\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:16.000\nLet's welcome my good old friend Fred Stoller\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nI'm already all sweating so I don't want to hug you\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nI forgot the water, this is pressure\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nWell, they told me just have fun\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nYeah\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nSo I'm glad when they remind me to do that\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nBecause sometimes they don't\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nYeah\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nAnd you come up here and you cry\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nYou seem like a guy, I've known you a while\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd you're always a guy that knows how to just have fun\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nAnd go crazy\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:52.000\nSomething tells you like, don't try too hard\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nLike you know how to do that\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:57.000\nWell, you were talking about the pressure\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nBecause they didn't pay a lot\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nAnd when I used to headline and stand up\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nWhich is very brief\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nI used to feel sorry for the people waiting online to see me\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nHeadline and comedy\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nThat's not confidence\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nI mean, yeah\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:15.000\nYeah, you got to really think you're entitled and you're great\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nSo hopefully you could pull up the slack of this\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nI'm not getting into this\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nYeah, I'll be here, I'll be here all night\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nI always, I felt bad\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nBut when you were doing stand up, are you still doing stand up?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nDo you still actively?\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nNo, no, no\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nI did it a long time ago\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nAnd first of all, the confidence\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nWhen I saw the people lining up to see your show\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd I walked by them\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nAnd they had no idea who I was\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nAnd I'm the whole show\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nAnd he's whispering\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nI look familiar is what I got\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:52.000\nSometimes I get a, maybe he said a\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nBut if I'm lucky\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nPeople, they come up to me to go\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nWhere do I know you from?\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nRight\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nAnd I list my credits\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nAnd if it's a single mom\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nThen I do that kid's animation\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nRight\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nTrying to hit on them like a pedophile\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou know, hi, I'm Rusty from Handi Mani\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nIs your daddy not around?\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:18.000\nHey, I'm a monkey wrench at talks\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nJust ignoring the kid\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nAnd trying to talk to the mother\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nAre you a bachelor right now\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nAnd tell me, by the way, I don't know\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nIf I'm ever prying or anything\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nYou don't have to talk about stuff\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nI don't know why\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nYeah, I'm like Greg Proops\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nI only rift about pop culture\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nNothing personal\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nNo, I just...\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nDoes anyone know me?\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nNo, I...\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nI need something\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nI think that when people see your face\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nThis is the lucky kind of fame I would say\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nI would wager there's plenty of people\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nThat wouldn't maybe see your face\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nAnd go, oh, that's who that guy is\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nBut then when they say\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nWhere do I know you from?\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nIt doesn't matter what credit you choose\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nBecause as soon as you start talking\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nThey go, oh, Fred Stoller\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nNot into that\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nUsually they recognize me\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nAnd they go, I don't mean to bother you\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nAnd I'm so glad someone broke up the isolation\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nThat now I'm bothering them\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nRight, right\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nI go, hey, where are you going?\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nI've been to the grove before\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nAnd I'm following them\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:21.000\nAnd I'm so lonely\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nThe frustrating thing is\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nI did one sign, fell just a few raiments\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nAnd people think I'm rich\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nLike they point to the Hollywood Hills\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nHe must live up there\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:37.000\nSpecifically, show them the exact little apartment\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nThere's a new thing called celebrity net worth\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nHave you looked up yourself on this?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nNo, no\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nIt has, you know, with him\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nAnd it's, you know, probably, you know, 18 million\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nYou know, all that stuff\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nAnd I'm on it\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nAnd it's very wrong\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nIt's 1.5 million\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nAnd, you know, so I've had dates\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.000\nThat one woman goes, this can't be right\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:02.000\nYeah, you have to have more than that\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:05.000\nSo people now look up my credits\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nThey see a lot of stuff\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nThat would be nerve-wracking\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:14.000\nBecause somebody was in a Twitter spat with me\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nAnd there must, my income or something\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nMust have come up, whether I'm fancy or rich\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nOr because it must have been\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nSo then somebody posted as if, like, spiking a football\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nThis link\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nI was like, what is this going to be a link to?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nIs this how you get, like, Doxt or whatever you got?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nAnd I clicked on it\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nAnd it was this thing, like, yeah\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nLike, what are they, worth.org or something like that?\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nIt says, Dan Harmon, worth 5 million dollars\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nI was like, wow\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nMoney you don't know about\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nAnd then I went through it\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nI said, I guess maybe if I, like, sold everything\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nI guess worth is, like, yeah, it's not liquid\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nIt doesn't say how liquid are they\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nLike, maybe if I sold everything\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nAnd borrowed money, no\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nLike, what Rick and Morty will be worth\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nAnd syndication, they're putting all their money\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nOh, well, yeah, well, jeez\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nI mean, if you're allowed to start counting that\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nThen I'm Enron, right?\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nLike, I get to just go\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.000\nBecause if you get to start counting that\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nThen it's like, well, because I'll never see that money\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nHowever, I do have a stake in it\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nSo it's like, sometime when I'm 70 years old\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:18.000\nIn theory, a check for, like, hot topic Rick slippers\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nWill come in or something\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nAnd I'll be like\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nLike, it'll be at the right medical technology\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nOr they'll be able to just feed those checks into the machine\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nThat keeps my heart beating\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nTen more beats\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nAnd I'll be like, Mr. Harbin, you're doing great\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nYou're 70 years old\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:42.000\nMost of your average person lives to 35 today\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nCan you hear the gunshots outside?\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nCan you smell the sulfur?\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nI love how savvy...\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nMore money, more rick and money\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nMore rick and money\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\nHe calls it rick and money now\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nI love how savvy people are now\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nI mean, you are savvy because, you know,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nShow business from following him\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nBut it was at this thing, hey\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nYou get good results, you get checks\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nYou know, they hear what Larry David, hey\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nThey'll see a sign felt that was on\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nHey, checks are coming to you, how much?\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nYeah\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nThat's my impression of a moron\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nReally\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nBut answering your question, I used to just stand up\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd I fell into it during the 80s comedy boom\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nWhich no one...\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nYou were alive or...\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nThat's how a lot of their parents conceived them\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:31.000\nBoth of their parents had an open mind\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nDuring the 80s stand-up boom\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nAnd here they are\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nAnd I was very shy and depressed, believe it or not\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nAnd now people have different ways to make it\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nYou go on YouTube, you see this and that\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nBut I only knew, like, stand-up someone\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nI thought to make it as an actor\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nYour parents have to put you in the Brady Bunch\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nOnly children, and I was another reason to hate my parents\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nFor not putting Fred in a TV show\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nLike, you fuck\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nLike, they knew they were supposed to do that\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nSo then I went to...\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nI guess that makes sense if you're a kid\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nAnd you're thinking about the people on TV\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nYou're like, how else would they...\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nYeah, you don't know, like I said\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nNow there's every, you know, e-harm\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nYou know, these links, like this is how you make it\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nLike, I probably wouldn't have been a stand-up\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nIf I tried now, I don't know what I would have done\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nBut you're just savvy with everything\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nYou'd have been on an improv team\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nYeah, I would have been so good as you could see\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nYeah, I think that's because the internet hasn't changed\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nAnything about the industry in the important ways\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nLike the idea that...\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nI mean, that's a ridiculous generalization\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nThe internet has changed some things about the entertainment industry\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:44.000\nBut the biggest change is basically\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:47.000\nThe size of the waiting room for auditions\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:50.000\nLike, that's how I put it\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nLike, especially for actors\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nNothing's changed for actors\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nLike, oh, how do I get my start as an actor?\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nWell, you know, you want to say like\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nOh, just get on YouTube and put on a fresh face\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nAnd just like...\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nThey've been doing that for 15 years\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nAnd all it does is they might as well be doing that\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nI mean, they can make a million dollars doing that\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nAnd never get into Hollywood\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:12.000\nThen Google will say, sorry, fartsmart's been shut down now\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nNo more fartsmart, I grew up on it\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:18.000\nWell, yeah, it's like people think, Fred\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nIsn't there so many more opportunities now?\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.000\nWell, no, there's just more bullshit, you know\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:27.000\nWhen I came to Hollywood, there weren't so many things\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nBut they were like real things\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nLike a pot on Murphy Brown\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nOr like, amen or something\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nIt was like a big deal when I moved to LA\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nIn the mid-90s, late-90s, it was like\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:41.000\nA person would get a spot on a sitcom\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:46.000\nLike, they'd be like, the pizza guy that hits on Dharma\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:50.000\nBut it turns out to be Griggs, a clone\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nNo, not clone, why would clone?\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:53.000\nI can't even pitch a fucking idea\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nI can't get through one idea\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nI fucked it up at the end\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nHe says, clone, use the same actor, you dipshit\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nYou already own that guy\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nI've done so many delivery guys\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nYeah, so...\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nI've lost it, I've lost it\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nThere's so many more quote-unquote opportunities\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nBut it's so saturated\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nBut we would have parties\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nWe would have everybody\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nEverybody would show up at that person's apartment\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nYou'd have chips and nachos\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nChips and nachos\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nFucking, I'm gonna kill myself\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.000\nI'm gonna fucking kill myself on this stage\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nNext week\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nAnd I'm not saying that for clicks\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nAre you...\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nMaybe you'll kill and murder yourself\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nYou'd have cheese puffs and little doodles\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nBecause, hey, so-and-so, they're gonna be...\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nWhat, one time it was...\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nOn wings, like a guy going, come on through\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nSo the guy would come through and be your friend\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nAnd he'd go, someone ordered pizza\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nAnd he'd go, like, ah-ha\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nAnd then the commercial would start\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:44.000\nAnd you'd turn up the music\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nAnd you'd just be like, you know...\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:49.000\nWhen I would do guest spots, my friends would say\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nWhere were you on it?\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nMeeting at the beginning, the middle...\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nSo how much of that shit do I have to see?\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nIt's like a chore to them, you know?\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nBecause they're flicking back, what's that?\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nDon't ask him what's that\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nWhat's in there?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:06.000\nI know, there's a gimmick\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nWith the people yelling stuff out that I've encouraged somehow\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:12.000\nThat's alright, I'm not gonna be a pussy\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nYou don't have to be gentle for me\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:19.000\nUsually, if somebody starts yelling something out\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nBecause they're so concerned about something\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:24.000\nI find that about 75% of the time it becomes fruitful\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:27.000\nI'm like, what is this person, you've lost your mind\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nWe're talking about ninjas or dolphins or something\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nAnd then they'll keep talking and go\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nDo you want to just come up here so that you step\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nRouting the show and talking to the microphone\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nAnd then they come up and then, you know\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nSeveral of them become parts of the show\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nAnd so it's a fun, nice part of the show\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nIt's like a town meeting\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nBut then I have guests on\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nAnd then somebody goes like, hold the butter\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nAnd then I can see your nervous system go\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nThat means I'm failing\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nBecause it does, if you're at a stand-up club\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nLike, Kumail, you know Kumail Nanjiani?\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nYeah, of course\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:57.000\nHe's like the brightest, smartest, sharpest dude\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nBut he has a stand-up DNA\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nSo when people talk in the audience\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.000\nI can see his iron giant...\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nLike...\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nIt's just like, oh no, what?\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nWhat were you saying?\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:16.000\nOh, so you're saying you're a fucking idiot\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nOkay\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nAnd then he just continues\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:22.000\nAnd I'm like, okay\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nWell, when you trained in stand-up\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nLike I said, the comedy boom in the 80s\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nThen when I started getting some guest spots\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nWe think we're bombing\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nBecause I come in, Murphy Brown\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nHey, I'm the delivery guy\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nOh, I suck, you know what I mean?\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nBecause it's da-da-da, da-da-da\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nBut then you go into the writer's room\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nHaven't you worked in writer's rooms and stuff?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nNot too many\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:47.000\nThe only thing, I was on Seinfeld as a writer\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nAnd there was no writer's room\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nDid you know how Seinfeld worked?\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nNot really\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nThere's...\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nI was brought in in the 94-95 season\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nAgain, before you're born\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nAnd what happened was\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:02.000\nI knew Larry David from the New York stand-up days\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nAnd he would kind of taunt me\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nWhich...\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nSound like an Indian now\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:11.000\nYou're like a pathetic loser\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nYou're like a piece of shit\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nYou make everyone feel uncomfortable\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nBecause you're like a handicap guy walking around\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nAnd they want to look at you\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nYour head's down\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nWhen was it last time someone like you got laid?\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nAnd...\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nThat's really what he said to me\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:30.000\nI was at my friend's surprise birthday party\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nAnd this became a curved episode\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:33.000\nHe came late\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:36.000\nI want to scream surprise like a fucking idiot, you know?\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nAlright, I'm in here now\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nHey, not Shrodney\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:43.000\nHe's just Rob Schrab, but 9 octaves lower\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:46.000\nYeah, so he was...\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:49.000\nEveryone in 94 was writing a spec script\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nYou know, for Seinfeld\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nAnd he was like, you never wrote a spec script\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nAnd...\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nI'm an idiot\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nBecause again, people are savvy\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nI thought when you wrote on a sitcom\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nYou make the salary\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nI didn't know that sitcom writing became\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\n5 jobs ahead\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nLike, the idea is not to\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nHey, I'm going to write on Seinfeld\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.000\nAnd make whatever the 2000 a week would be\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nSorry, we're at home right now\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:19.000\nWhy was that funny? 2000 a week\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nAlright, I'm getting them a little bit\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nDan has to get a kettle bottle\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nAnd the ice is completely attached\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nI'm thinking, alright\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nYeah, don't steal focus\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nFred's telling a story\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nFred doesn't want to like...\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nAnd then I've lifted it\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nIt's like a fucking Marx Brothers bit\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nIt's everything you want\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nDan, what I mean is now people know about...\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nThere's nothing more primordial than this\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nThe ice to get broken off\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:47.000\nAnd what I mean is now people who...\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nI forgot why I was playing...\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nYou want the liquid out of the bottle\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nI don't mean to bash Harvard\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nBecause you know, it's cliche\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nAnd I'm sure you went there and the community writers\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nBut they know...\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nI went to dirt\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nAlright\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nDon't you know that's my issue? You don't\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nBecause we're both narcissists\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nSo you don't know, I have class issues\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nThat's why I couldn't function in writer's rooms\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nBecause everybody was from Stanford and Harvard and Yale\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nEvery time we got into a fight about coffee\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nI'd be like, you know...\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nEnough of your Ivy League bullshit!\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nWell, when I was temporarily on Seinfeld\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nWhich I'm plugging, I had a Kindle single\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nCalled my Seinfeld year\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nDid anyone hear this?\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nWell, it made him laugh in one person\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nAlright\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nWe will be handing out copies at the end of the show\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nWell, the actual thing is\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nI'm happy to see you, but only disappointed\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nBecause thinking I was going to plug\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:43.000\nI have a new one and I sent Jeff Davis\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nThe PDF of it to save $1.99\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nWhat it cost\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nThinking he'll be like, hey, it's great\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nWait, I want to make sure I understand this\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nYou sent Jeff Davis a PDF of my new book\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nOf your new book, okay\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nThinking, you know, go hey\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nI don't want him to spend $1.99\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nThese things called Kindle singles\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nThey're legit\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nI know at $1.99 people make fun of them\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nAnd yeah, dudes send it to me\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nAnd so, could you pretend it's really good\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nFor five minutes to kill and you're Jeff\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nThat book, it changed my life\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nI've read a lot of authors\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nAnd this book, your book, the book\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nAlright\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nWell, I'm positive that it's in any way\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nI talked to Lee Daniels about\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nMaking your book into\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nAt least a four part movie series\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nWhat about Leonard Smalls?\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nAnd Biggie Smalls\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nBiggie Smalls as well\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nBut when I was on Seinfeld\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nOne of the Harvard guys goes\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nTo my life, which was just fucked up\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nYou know, he goes\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nNothing bad ever happened to me\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nI have to make things up\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nAnd I wanted to punch him like\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nNow something bad happened\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nThese guys were never unemployed\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nA millisecond in their life\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nBut they learned how to do the Larry formula\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nOf just doing things\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nSo basically, there's no room\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nYou know what a writer's room is, right?\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nOkay\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nThey can put it together\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nJulie\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nSo basically\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nYou have to come up with a Jerry Kramer\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nOr Lane, and who's the fourth one?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nGeorge\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nGeorge, I by accident did\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\n50 milligrams of an edible the other night\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nI'm an idiot\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nYes, and it's still in me\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nSo you have to pitch\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nThere's no room\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nNo one's trying to come up with stories together\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nMy analogy, it's like a homicide division\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nWe're all trying to sell murders, but our own murders\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nAnd fuck you\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nI'm doing the O'Daniel's murder\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nWe shut our door, we don't help you\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nSo I'm walking around\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nAnd there's a guy I have a restraining order\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nFrom, I'm not making this up\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nFrom my book\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nMy Seinfeld Year, check it out\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nI talked about some people\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nAnd I got sued\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nAnd I have a restraining order against someone\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nI didn't mention his name, a writer\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nAnd I called him a pseudonym\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nAnd he would, he lately, when my book came out\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nHe would pound on my door\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nFuck you, you ruined my life\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nYou know, because\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nI haven't worked in ten years\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nBecause of your book that's been out three years\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nAnd\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nYou should read my book looking for someone to blame\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nYes, yes\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nSo, so he would like\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nBang on my door, leave notes\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nAnd he had this fixation, we would go and Dr. Drew\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nAnd, and he'd leave notes\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nWe're gonna tell the world what a piece of shit you are\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nAnd Dr. Drew, that was his manifesto\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nWait, I'm sorry, backup\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nBecause I don't understand that, you said\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nHe had, you were on\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nNo, no, no\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nHe thinks that I know Dr. Drew so well\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nOh\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nThat we were gonna go on his podcast\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nAnd I would confess\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nWhat a piece of shit liar I am\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nThat is some bullshit\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nHe was like, oh, I got this deal\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nYou should get us on some Dr. Drew so I can get some money\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nAnd it gets this episode\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nWe'll give residuals\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nAnd I ended to be my mentor\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nSo I was on my own and he goes, bro\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nIt's like, nah, I'm here, but, but I'll show you\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nThe ways, and I was, I made\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nMyself look like an asshole for listening\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nTo this guy, so I was the one who put\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nMyself down in the book that I'm such a schmuck\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI don't believe that you would put yourself down\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nIn your book, I feel like it must be\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nAnother one of these, I'm such a big shot\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nYes, and I don't get the narcissist\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nBut in a different way, I get it\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nOh, yeah, you know what I mean\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nYou know what I mean\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nI just felt about Howard Stern\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nAnd one way he goes, yeah, I'm cool\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nThen he puts himself down\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nDidn't you see that dichotomy in Howard Stern?\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, to me\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nI relate to that, but you're a\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nPurebred something, like I don't know\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nLike you're amazing, and that's why you're\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nI mean, I'm jealous of you, because you\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nYour voice, like\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nSo much of this guy's walking out\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nHe's getting that, he's just\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nTaking a poop piece of time\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nBut no, when you would get up\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nOn stage at the\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nWhen I was\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nI was living in Milwaukee, I hadn't moved to L.A. yet\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nAnd you were the\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nOne of the, like, 5, 6, 5\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nThere used to be a thing, like there was so many\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nComedy segments, so many of these\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nCable, Evening at the Improv\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nPulpervenza\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nMario Joiner, that you could make\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nA marginal living doing the same set\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nEvery, you know, on all these\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nThe A-list, we called it a list\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nBecause everyone was on it\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nBut you would come out, I mean\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nWe were coming out of an age where\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nSomeone would come up with a hammer on their head\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nAnd say, hey, I'm hammerhead, and people would laugh\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nAnd then that person would be kind of fucked for 10 years\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nBut you weren't one of those\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nBut the funny thing is that\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nYou were so on point, you were so true to\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nYour own voice, that I bet a lot of\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nPeople think you're doing a character\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nBecause you would come up on stage\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nAnd the audience would stop clapping\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nAnd then you would say something like\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nYeah, I'm kind of, I guess you're probably\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nThinking, I'm like\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nOh, hey, look at the cool guy\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nOr just, or like\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nThat's why I quit stand-up, because of stuff like that\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nAnd reactions\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nYeah, exactly, that's why I never, but you know\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nI'm a bit of a thrill seeker or whatever\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nYou had your bits about it\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nI drank milk that expired yesterday\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nAnd these all these jokes\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nBut when you would say, I'm a thrill seeker\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nThe audience would unanimously laugh\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nAnd that's the thing, that seems to be\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nPart of your voice is that you're like\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nLike, why is that funny?\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nWell, because\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nThey looked at you and you said\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nSomething that they were thinking, remember\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nLouis Anderson's bit when he would say\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nHe would open with fat jokes and then he\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nAfter he did like three minutes of fat jokes\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nHe'd take a pause and then he'd say\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nI always have to open with the fat jokes\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nBecause if I didn't, someone in the audience\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nWould be sitting there saying, do you think he knows?\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nAnd\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nAnd that is like\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nA thing of like, it's about essence\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nIt's like what Sam Christensen is\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nThis class that I took in\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nRight here in Burbank? You told me\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nAnd you said you'd guarantee I'd get laid\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nIf I took it and you were going to pay\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nDid you take it? No, because\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nYou didn't pay like you said you would\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nYou guaranteed I'd get laid\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nDidn't I say, well I'll pay for it\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nMaybe he was going to pay for the lay\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nYes\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nHe's looking up Sam Christensen\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nAnd yes, know who\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nYou know, the thing is\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nLike a lot of comedians were insecure\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nBut I never learned overcompensation\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nLike these scrappy guys\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nHey, I'm Greg Fitzsimmons\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nOr whoever, I'm scrappy, hey\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nShots fired\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nMad comic beats right now\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nI feel embarrassed\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nYeah, like saying hey\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nI'm great and all that stuff\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nSo like I said, I got into stand up\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nBecause it seemed to way, my idol was like\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nJimmy Walker\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nI never saw a guy like him skinny, black, funny looking\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nI go, hey, don't keep looking at me man\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nI know, if I don't\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nIf I don't, it's racist\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nYou know when you're on purpose\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nIt's not Dino Mike\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nBut\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nHe looked away on funny looking\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nBut I had to get it because he was\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nYou know, he's trying\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nIt's like, I\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nCan't pitch shows, a few times you do\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nYou ever try to engage like the third person\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nThe show you're not just talking about\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nA really important person, so in this show\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nAnd then, hi third person\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nWe're not ignoring, there'll be\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nThree different arc breaks\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nAnd you're the really important person\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nAnd I'm talking about\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nIs that fourth one\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nI went\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nTo a show where it was\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nRight when the stand up thing\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nGave way to storytelling, so now I was\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nAllowed on stage with you guys\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nAnd like a Beth Lapita's show\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nOr something like that in LA\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nAnd one thing I did was\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nBecause I'm such a master storyteller\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nThat just stuck out my head\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nWhat the fuck did that sound like\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nNow I'm in\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nI was waiting for my opening in this world\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nIt was because of a TV credit\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nI'll be frank, but then you're allowed\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nTo co-opt to these cabaret shows\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nAnd you have a drink and you say\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nMy dad hit me and they're like, that's great\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nHere's a drink\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nI did one of those\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nAnd it was like me, Marc Maron\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nAnd maybe like Scott Thompson\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nAnd it was like\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nWe almost outnumbered the audience\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nAnd it was like right on that bubble\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nWhere it's like they must have talked\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nAbout canceling the show, there's like six people\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nSitting there and then three\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nAnd then the other two performers\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nAnd I remember distinctly\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nIt was such a weird thing that Marc Maron\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nWhile he was on stage, he coped\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nWith the\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nWeird sensation of performing\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nTo only that many people\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nFor the first time that night\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nBut he just kept on\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nMaybe my laugh was louder or something\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nBut he basically kind of did his whole act to me\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nBut it really filled me with confidence\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nI think I killed with the six people\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nAfterwards, but\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nI probably went on before him\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nAnd so he was just like, you know what I mean\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nYou know what I mean\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nYeah, you need the feedback\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nWhen you're talking about comedians\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nHow they, you know, like\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nA man of the cool\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nMemes, the guy, you know, Silicon Valley\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nDinesh, but, um...\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nCamille. Oh yeah. Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nYes, well how, I did some guest spots\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nBob Saget had a show called Raising Dad\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nWhich sounds funny\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nAnd it was the two kids\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nGrew up, Harrison Briel\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nAnd Kat Jennings\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nSo Saget and Kenner\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nThey were just working\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nParamount had these tours going through\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nAnd they'd be doing a rehearsal\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nAnd hey, hey, and you know\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nYou have comedians and you're doing a scene\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nBut they'd work the other people for laughs\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nSo comedians have that mindset\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nBut what you just said about\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nStorytelling\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nI'm bringing back to the Seinfeld writing\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nSo this guy would always say\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nI'll tell you when to pitch laughs\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nBecause you have to approach his door\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nAnd knock and come in and pitch a Jerry Kramer\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nLaying a George story and you can't do anything\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nTill they're approved and I'd be approaching\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nHe goes, not a good time, bro\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nNot a good time and I was so insecure\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nEverything out on him\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nAnd he kind of ended up sabotaging me\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nAnd so sometimes\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nOne thing I learned from\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nWriting and so there was no room\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nYou're totally on your own\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nThe one lesson I learned from writers\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nAnd I'm sure you could attest to this\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nIs when you try things out\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nOn friends, people, smart people\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nOnly try it out on the guy that could say yes or no\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nYou know what I'm saying\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nBecause I tried out things on this day\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nHe said, no, no, no, I'm concerned\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nThat's not good. Then someone else ended up doing it\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nNot because they stole it\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nBut because they tried it out\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nOn Larry David and I asked these middlemen\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nWell, yeah\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nI want to interject because\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nAnd not because there's anything to defend\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nOr correct, but because\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nI find this fascinating\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nThat every show is different\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nAnd I'm surprised\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nTo hear that, but like\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nA lot of shows do have just the rooms\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nWhere the people sit pow wow\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nAnd then there's like one\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nCommunity worked like that\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nBecause that's how I understood it to work\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nOr rather maybe that's what Neil and Garrett\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nWho worked on Scrubs and were helping me\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nLike run my first show\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nThat's the way most like 97% work\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nSo you come into work and you sit\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nAnd then you've got a bunch of\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nIt's like a police station where it's like\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nYou got your\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nWhat's been going on since yesterday\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nSo how is it going in that room\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nIn that room and then people kind of go off\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nBack to there, so there's always like one person\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nWho's working on a draft or an outline\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nThere's like a couple people working\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nHopefully if you're really healthy\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nThat they're a joke room and they're punching stuff up\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nAnd then there's a story breaking room\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nNo, I had no idea what other episodes\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nWere in the pipeline\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nWhat was going on, you totally\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nSo you couldn't do anything\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nOne time I made a mistake\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nI tried out this idea\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nCramer does a one man show called\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nOne Time My Uncle Hit Me\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nLike those confessional things\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nSo I said that's good, that's good\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nSo I'm writing it up and then I bring Larry\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nAnd I'm like what the fuck is that\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nYou don't fucking put things on the board until I see it\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nBut Lapis said it was good\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nWhat the fuck you idiot\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nSo you can't\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nIs it possible\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nLarry David\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nThat there's something missing from your translation\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nOf him, like maybe he's smiling while he's saying something\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nWell\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nHe seems to be a joyful guy\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nI know he's grumpy\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nOne time this happened\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nLike a bad guy from Revenge of the Nerds\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nLike\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nHe just wanted to hurt you\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nOne time this happened to me\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nThe editing room was next to my room\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nSo you can't do anything until\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nThe stories are connected\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nSo I would like, one time I stood outside\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nThe room trying to pitch\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nI waited an hour and these two aggressive guys\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nFrom Harvard went right in\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nAnd then they pitched\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nAnd I was so exhausted from waiting\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nI went in my room and snapped for an hour\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nSo I would go play pinball\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nYou know walk around\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nAnd one time he passes\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nSo he wasn't the worst guy\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nBecause he said something nice for a moment\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nHe goes I see you\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nYou're not part of the clique\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nI see that\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nHe goes Jesus\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nThat's the nicest thing\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nWait till the story goes\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nHe goes you know when I was on Saturday Night Live\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nAlright I don't have to\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nIt's like doing the Norm MacDonald way\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nDon't get me started\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nYou can't do a story with that\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nYou got the three sneakers\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nYou fucker\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nI think you should keep doing your Larry David\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nAlright so he goes\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nWhen I was a writer at Saturday Night Live\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nMy office was right by the elevator\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nAnd all the writers would walk by for lunch\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nAnd not include me\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nI see you're not part of the clique\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nHe goes so you gotta get aggressive\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nYou gotta find me on the floor\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nYou look\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nAnd you throw things at me\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nJust throw things at me\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nAnd I went alright\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nSo they go hey Larry\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nI had this idea\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nThere was a guy in that season\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nMr. Pitt\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nI don't know if you remember who he was\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nAnd I said what if he gets into it\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nWith Jerry Stiller's character\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nHe goes that's a fucking stupid idea\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nAlright I did tell you to try things out\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nIt's fucking stupid Freddy\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nI did tell you\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nBut not that shit\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nWhy did he hire you?\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nThere's something missing from this story\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nI do think it\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nYou know Schrab and you know our friend\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nAbed\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nSo you're saying I'm like Abed\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nNo the dynamic\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nYou've seen Schrab abuse Abed\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nBut he doesn't hate him\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nMy theory is that he sees in me\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nWhat he doesn't like about himself\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nBecause when he was on Saturday Night Live\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nHe didn't like any of those\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nThe equivalent of Harvard writers\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nBut then when it's this thing\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nI started and stand up with him\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nAnd Gilbert Gottfried he goes\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nMe, you and Gilbert were the three biggest fucking losers\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nHe goes Freddy you're only chance of getting a woman\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nIs if you're blind\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nBecause you're doomed you're a Jew from Brooklyn\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nWe went to the same high school\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nI don't know you saw something\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nSo basically how I got the job\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nWas Steve Scroban and if you know who he is\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nAnd it doesn't help in the story\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nHe was the one who had the surprise birthday party\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nSo in 94-95\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nBefore they got this influx\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nOf the Ivy League guys\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nHe would like hire\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nStand ups from his New York days\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nAnd they would\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nAnd so it's almost like the beginning of Platoon\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nWhere\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nThey go you're going to like the Nam\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nBecause I had friends of mine\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nThat were just\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nThey would do the same thing\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nBut they had camaraderie\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nFour New York stand ups came in\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nAnd they were totally on their own\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nAnd you weren't sure if you were supposed to start up a story\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nSo he kind of got a kick at it\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nHe goes you know a lot of shitty things happen to you\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nMaybe you could use the shitty things from your life\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nFor the Seidfeld episodes\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nSo he goes\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nHow come you never wrote a spec script\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nHe goes write one nothing will happen\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nBut I will read it\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nAnd I wasn't gonna\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nCause that wasn't the route I wasn't smart\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nLike I said people now they know\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nWhat I mean they're five jobs ahead\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nIs I thought you know you make a salary\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nNow all the guys at lunch\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nWere executives from Castle Rock\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nOn their next three deals\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nYou know what I'm saying I wasn't savvy\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nI wasn't even savvy I could get laid as a writer\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nI was oh man\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nI didn't have time\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nThat makes me feel I feel bad\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nI don't want to feel bad for you\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nCause I don't want my pity to sprinkle on you\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nThrow a pity receptor\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nNo no I'll tell you it's all a happy ending\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nBecause no that was in my route\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nI know comics they watched\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nThe raw Petrie\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nDick Van Dyke and they wanted to be around a table\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nI just wanted to be a character actor\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nYou know what I mean\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nI didn't know about houses\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nAnd you write on sitcoms\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nYou're appealed to me like you know\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nYou see the run throughs\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nThey're like cows moving on to Jerry's apartment\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nAnd you see them on the Ratford lot\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nThey look like cows you know what I mean\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nThey just you know the writers\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nI was always jealous of those people too\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nI mean I don't want to interrupt your story\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nNo so basically what happened was\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nI wasn't going to write a spec script\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nBut in 1994 there would be people\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nDying to have Larry David\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nRead this Seinfeld spec script\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nYou know so I said\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nJust write one just in case\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nLike the next Dan Harmon goes\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nHey Fred do you have a spec script\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nI'd have one ready\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nOr that Dan Harmon\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nJust to have it ready\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nAnd again I'm an old man\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nGoing back then they didn't have the internet\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nAnd I had to really look\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nFor a Seinfeld script to see how it's done\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nAnd my friend helped me with the format\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nAnd in my spec script\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nI used a story based on\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nMany years ago\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nWhen you're old you keep saying\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nMy new book I wrote\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nEverything is back before the internet\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nBack before cell phones\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nAnd before\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nBefore there was the internet\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nRemember when there was\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nNow there's no such thing as a blind date\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nUnless your name is like Phyllis Smith\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nBecause oh there's what she looks like\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nWhat she makes\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nYou know you get pictures, Facebook\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nSo someone wanted to set me up with a woman\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nBut she was away from where\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nSummer and I was so excited\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nI wanted to have the visualization to be excited\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nI thought of a funny bit where\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nWhat if I hire a police\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nComposite artist\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nTo sketch what she looks like to go\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nAlright yeah looking forward to that\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nSo\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nThat was part of the spec script\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nAnd then I once\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nThis day I ended up using\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nAt Seinfeld I met a woman in London\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nAnd it was unbridled sex\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nThis was 1990\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\n1996\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nAnd I remember\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nNo 1990\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nI remember\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nI confessed to her\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nI haven't had sex in six months\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nI remember when that was so long\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nWow I wish it was that recent\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nYou know why we had so much sex in 1990\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nWe had no idea how to dress\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nRight\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nIt was 1989 New Year's Eve\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nWe were like what are we going to do about all this velcro\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nYeah\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nWe can't just start dressing like hippies\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nWe will by 93\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nSo I put in a storyline\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nWhere I flew her to LA\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nAnd it was almost like she\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nGave her a ticket to a woman\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nThat looked like her because you flew me here just for sex\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nAnd if I said what\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nInstead of pardon she'd scrunch\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nSo I liked the spec script\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nLet me show it to Jerry\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nSo he liked\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nThis stuff and I was brought on\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nAnd just as a quirky guy\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nAnd then I'm brought on\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nTo be on screen\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nNo no no as a staff writer\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nSo that's the\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nSo rewinding\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nFrom that before that\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nSpec triumph\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nWhat were you doing? You were at the office\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nYou were being abused by coworkers\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nBut you weren't getting paid\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nWait a minute I'm confused\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nYou may have been a slave\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nAnd it's illegal\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nYou're not getting paid\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nI thought you were\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nWhen you said you're five jobs behind\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nWhat I meant is that\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nThey're strategizing writers now\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nSpeculating\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nYou don't go\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nI just got a writing job on community\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nYou go\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nThen I'll be able to\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nPitch FX shows\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nYou meant being on\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nStaff on a sitcom\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nThat's hardly the end of any rainbow\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nBut they don't think\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nIt was called program consultant\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nI'm making 2200 a week\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nNo they think Seinfeld\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nThey'd be on lunch getting their next deals\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nThey're five jobs ahead\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nAnd the unspoken implication there\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nOr maybe I'll put words in your mouth\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nOr maybe why don't I just say my own\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nIs the reason that's really true\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nIs because you could get that far\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nYou could have a staff writer job on a sitcom\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nBut then both because of what happened to the industry\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nAnd technology\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nYou're competing with\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nAggressors\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nYou're competing with professional\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nI don't want to undercut\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nEveryone that can hurt me in the business\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nAnd everyone that\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nI wouldn't want to hurt because I like them\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nBecause they became my friends some of them\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nBut there's a DNA there\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nI always look at it like dog breeds\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nWhere it's like\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nBecause there's dogs that are good\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nHe's a great joke writer\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nBut he's so\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nI think a joke writer is that\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nHe drives that person and that person's so nuts\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nHe has to fax his jokes in from home\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nAnd that person's\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nNot that good a joke writer\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nBut they're so\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nLike vibrant in the room\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nThat their jokes seem funnier\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nLike 20%\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nAnd then these other people who are different breeds\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nLike they end up pushing that\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nJoke and because there's the\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nThere's the breed of\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nIt's a chemistry assignment\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nAnd I would never want to say it\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nBecause there's no such thing as a breed of dog\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nThat's a good dog or a bad dog\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nUnless pugs are evil\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nKidding\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nI know that pug owners\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nAre driven by their protectiveness\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nThat's why I made that joke\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nYou can't talk shit about pugs\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nThat's the point of that breed\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nIt wouldn't exist\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nBut for the\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nSurplus of protectiveness\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nIn the human breeders that bred it\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nIt can't breathe unless you Q-tip\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nIt's face every three weeks\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nIt is a dog that is falling\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nApart, it is a pile of dog\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nIt looks like you spilled a dog\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nTheir eyes pop out\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nThey do\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nAnd what could they ever do\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nA doxened, I'll tell you what\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nThey used to use them to clean cannons\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nI know every breed\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nThey all had a use\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nAnyways\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nThey were all quivers\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nThey would clean them with doxens\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nBut pugs\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nPugs are just there so that we can feel\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nAngry\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nAbout people making fun of our dogs\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nThe dogs cute for the first two years of its life\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nAnd they do not age well\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nOld pugs\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nAre ugly as fuck\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nAnd old pug owners know it\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nPugs were part of an\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nIll-advised program\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nTo breed rescue dogs\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nFor murder\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nThat's how we get a big laugh\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nI was like, this is impressive\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nI can't do stand-up\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nI would have wrote that down on a yellow pad\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nThis will kill\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nPugs are part of an ill-advised program\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nTo breed rescue dogs\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nLaugh, but no\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nBecause you're breeding them all\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nFucked up as like\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nSo you don't have to go to the humane center\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nTo find, you know, because it's like\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nOh, the dog has three legs and one eye\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nBut no, it's a pug\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nIt could be a thoroughbred pug\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nIt needs your help\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nYou made a face like\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nNo, stop\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nIt also elicits that feeling\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nBecause if you look at a pug, you go\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nThat's me\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nI'm not an underdog\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nThat's me in grade school\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nIt's the little girl dressed as a bee\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nIn the blind melon video\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nThat's what a pug is\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nBecause sometimes\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nDoxons, you want to be tempted, but you're not\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nNo, that's the kid that was into sports casting\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nAnd so all the basketball players thought he was cool\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nCan I kill the momentum\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nOf this bit that's killing?\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nNo, right?\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nNo, I just did\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nA writer's question, which I don't\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nI don't know if they care about this stuff\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nDo you think it's easier to fake\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nBeing a writer on a sitcom than\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nLike a show like Breaking Bad or Justified\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nLike a guy could just be aggressive\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nAnd loud and throw out jokes\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nHe could fake a million-dollar career\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nIn sitcoms, but can someone\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nFake that in the world of those drama?\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nI want to make sure I understand the question\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nBecause I do want to answer it\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nBut I don't understand the question\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nWell, it sounds like you were saying\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nOr maybe I'm saying that\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nYou could fake your way to a nice career\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nIn a sitcom at a table\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nFake it just by making jokes\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nAnd not really being as good a writer\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nBut there's more of a skill set\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nIs what I'm thinking, those one-hours\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nYou can't fake it, you can't be loud\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nThen Brian Cranston dies\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nHey, hey, they'll have\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nA stripper by him, ooh, yeah\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nI don't want to piss off my friends\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nThat work on drama shows\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nBut they're a less\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nFraternal bunch, so they probably\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nAren't as easily pissed off\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nAnd the few I've talked to about this\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nWill confess that\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nBecause when a comedy writer sits\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nIn a drama writer, only a matter\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nOf a couple drinks before the comedy writer says\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nAdmit it, it's easier, and they go, yes\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nYes, of course it's easier, there's no jokes\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nI knew it, I knew it\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nBut you cannot tell anyone I ever said that\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nSee, I'm in awe of that\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nLike, justified, because I think\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nRayland, like, whatever\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nBut I just want to make sure\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nBecause I didn't mean to imply\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nI didn't want to be too cynical\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nAnd say, just because there's all these\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nFeeds of writer\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nFirst of all, the idea that writers\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nCould work as a pack, which is again\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nHow my metaphor is awesome\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nIs an achievement of the species\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nBecause writers aren't supposed to be\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nSubject to the Henry Ford principle\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nThat should have been the death of\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nEntertainment, we should have been in\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nThe era that we're in now\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nIn terms of, like, our definitions\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nOf comedy and stuff, way back when\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nThe first studios were like, yeah, but\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nCan't you make it faster? I don't know\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nAnd writers\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nWere stuck in a room together\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nAnd just imagine that cave painting\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nOf writers being forced to do that\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nAnd they're the worst\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nThey're egotistical, they're defensive\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nThey're thin skin, they're thick skin\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nTo the wrong ways, they're, you know\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nThey're the monsters\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nAnd then\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nThey go, fuck it then, we'll have rules\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nFor that, and we'll\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nTo me, that's analogous with the human species\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nSo it's almost like a Seinfeld writer's room\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nOr it's more natural\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nIt sounds like\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nIt was weird\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nYou heard that, but\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nI think that's probably a successful show too\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nWhen the stakes get high\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nAnd then it's like you're coming in\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nThe army knows what it's doing too\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nSo if you come in as a new writer\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nIt's not like, hey, my name's Samantha, here's your bunk\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nIt's like, fuck you\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nDie or figure it out\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nThat's what a good pack does\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nBut I wanted to bring it\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nAround to the fact that, because there's so much\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nMy connection\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nTo you is the self-abuse\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nI mean, you can't stop\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nYou just\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nYou have a potato in one hand\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nAnd a potato peeler in the other\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nAnd before you ever come around to peeling the potato\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nYou'll be like, fuck it\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nYou will be fully peeled yourself\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nWhen people tell Fred you've been on every sitcom\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nIn the 90s, not news radio\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nNot Frasier\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nI gotta correct that\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nThat's the thing\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nI don't even know if it's possible for you\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nTo become a douchebag because of that\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nBecause you're going to be one of those over\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nYou said in the beginning\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nYou didn't overcompensate\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nWe know that breed\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nThat's a dangerous breed\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nThat's 85% of people who\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nThe world\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nComedically like guys who were nerds\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nAnd then they go, well, but I was funny\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nAnd then they got that stick that says they were funny\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nAnd then they start using it\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nLike if they didn't have that stick\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nSo it's a weird thing\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nBut it's like, well, if you're fucking a victim\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nAnd someone gives you the power\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nBecause if they like watching you be a victim\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nIt's hard\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nAnd your voice, you've always had\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nThat voice, you've always been\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nThat guy for real\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nAnd people have always been drawn to it\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nAnd some people are even drawn to abuse you\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nBecause, yes, Norm MacDonald, when I opened for him\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nAnd let's not go there\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nAnd I'm just kidding, no, they're booing me\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nThey're doing something they don't know\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nYou know, that didn't happen, Fred\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nNo\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nLike a guy like Dom Herrera\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nEven they want to fucking abuse you right now\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nLike a guy like Dom Herrera\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nNo one's going to bully him because I think\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nYeah, I see there's a morning\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nThere's a guy, I'll tell you later\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nBut I don't want to turn on this crowd\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nWhy don't you do that, Fred? It is sweating\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nNo, see, I grew up\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nThere was no such thing as nerds\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nThey were nebishes, sad sacks\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nOr, like, cool\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nAnd it's like, you know, now\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nThere's a lot of comedians now\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nThere's Shlubby\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nAnd, you know, this guy\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nGood guy, Matt Myra\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nYou know who he is? He's a great guy\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nBut if he was in the 80s, hey, I'm a Shlub\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nBut it's like, hey, yeah, you're not a loser\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nHey, you know, so it's this pop culture\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nYou know, I'm like being a nerd\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nIs referencing Matt Myra\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nBut, you know\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nSo I'm like, yeah\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nLike, when I did stand up\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nThere was no thought that I want to do it to be cool\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nFurthest thing\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nIt's embarrassing being cool\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nSo now it's sort of like\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nThe old nerds that were picked on\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nSomeone said, the nerds now are like the bullies\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nYou know\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nI remember back in the 90s, when this was starting\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nA Bobcat Goldthwait\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nI'm stealing his line, all these, like, Largo people\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nHe goes, they're all so cool\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nLike, cancel each other out\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nAnd, uh, so\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nYes, so nerd became\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nCool, and I resent that\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nWell, yeah\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nAnd you should, and then there's\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nLike, Andy Kindler, who is awesome\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nAt moving with that resentment\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nAnd maybe that's not your essence\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nLike, maybe, maybe, maybe\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nBut Kindler, I have a problem with\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nShots fired\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nI have a problem with him\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nI already went on Marc Maron\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nDid five minutes of why he bothers me\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nNow, he's a great guy, he's hysterical\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nHe would do these alternative\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nRooms, and it's like\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nAye, aye, aye, I'm nervous\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nIt's like an old Jewish guy\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nWhy is this alternative, you know\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nIt's like, there's a guy Bruce Smirnoff\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nWho's like a Jewish guy\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nAye, it's very guns and knives\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nAye, yes\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nSo Kindler, why Mrs. Herald\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nHas this alternative\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nGuy\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nThis rebel\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nWho is the biggest schmoozer\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nOh, no, he's a great guy\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nNo, I already teased him about this\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nBut you know what I'm saying\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nYou know what it is, my mother once said\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nI don't like pushy, nervy people\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nBecause I resent them, I wish I could\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nBe pushy and nervy\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nSo I resent Kindler because he could schmooze\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nHe's good at it\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nI wish I had their\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nAbilities sometimes, I mean\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nHow many times have you been cut off in traffic\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nAnd there's some small part of you\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nThat's like, god damn it\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nThat person's winning it life\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nI've never cut anyone off in traffic\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nWhich means that I have spent\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nSo much more of my life\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nIn fucking anxiety and thinking about other people\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nThan I needed to\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nBecause that person clearly never thinks about\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nFucking anything\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nAnd had that time for Pokemon or something\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nYes, yes\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nAnd I don't, it's never like\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nI'm\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nI just want to\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nI want to make sure\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nYou understand\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nAnd I think you do\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nI do, I don't\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nDon't feel bad for me, I'm happy\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nBecause I could never survive in a writer's room\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nBut let's forget about\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nThat's a feel right\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nForget about pity and bad\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nAnd feeling bad and all that stuff\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nI want you to know\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nLike how prudent it is\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nHow strategically\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nJustified\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nIt is for you to stay who you are\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nBecause it ends up paying\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nBig money\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nIt ends up paying more\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nWhether you have to\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nWell, it's just about what you can live with\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nAnd no, I consider\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nWhen I was younger\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nIt was more like comparing myself\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nWhy aren't I this\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nBut it's really so liberating when you get older\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nWhen you're out of the games of women\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nTrying to meet women\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nAnd trying to get pilot season\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nWhen it's sort of over, now I can do what I'd like to do\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nI'm too old a guy to be pitching\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nOn my own show\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nAnd it's so liberating\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nAs I told you when I saw you upstairs\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nI was dreading seeing you\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nBecause I haven't seen you in three years\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nAnd everyone that I haven't seen in three years\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nIs going to make me feel like I'm 90 years older\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nBecause we're all melting at a parabolic rate\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nSo I was like\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nI was telling my girlfriend about you\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nAnd like, oh, I'm going to see Fred\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nAnd she knew who you were by reputation\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nAnd stuff like that\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nWhat the fuck does that mean?\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nI have a reputation\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nWith a girl you talk to\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nWhat the fuck are you holding out on before?\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nBut no, I was talking\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nTo her about you and I\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nI was like, you know, he's Fred Stoller\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nAnd I was doing my impression of you\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nBecause you're fun to do an impression of\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nI'm sure that makes you very happy\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nEspecially when Tom Kenny gets extra money\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nOf voiceovers\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nAnd then I stopped a little\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nAnd I got really scared because I was like\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nOh, Fred's\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nFred, you could\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nDraw on a cave wall\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nEven if you hadn't gone to art school\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nInside and out\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nFred is so specific\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nAnd so archetypal\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nAnd now I'm going to see him\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nAnd there's going to be something\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nIs going to spoil that for me\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nIt looked like Christopher Lloyd\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nSomething that was equally beautiful\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nBut if I'd known you for 20 years\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nAs the other thing, I'd be like\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nTime can suck my god balls\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nWhatever\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nNo, it's still\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nI sound like Billy Crystal\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nDoing that Fernanda Lama's character\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nThe idea that you look good\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nAnd that's supposed to make you feel good\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nI'm saying, why would you\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nNot be pitching your\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nNo, I've tried\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nBut I'm the weird older guy\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nThat's the point\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nIt's point of view now\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nThe game is not to\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\n350 million people go\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nI had an idea for a web series\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nThey like the idea, let's do it\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nA web series to go\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nCan you get some YouTube stars\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nAny time I've tried\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nWho do you know that's more famous than you\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nWho are your friends\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nCan you bother Fred Willard again\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nNo, no more bothering Fred Willard\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nI always bother him\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nYou used to call me on the phone\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nAnd there were still landlines\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nAnd I was trying to write Monster House\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAnd I was doing a lot of cocaine\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nAnd I think it was because\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nI just found out how easy it was to buy an LA\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nAnd it was so hard in Milwaukee\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nAnd I was like, I don't even like Coke\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nBut now it's so cheap\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nAnd so I just had the CD case\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nThere were these things called CDs\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nYou turned them and listened to them\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nWith a laser needle\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nAnd it was covered with\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nCoke residue\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nAnd then I'd be trying to figure out\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nWhy a house would be a monster\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nYou'd be calling me because we had just made friends\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nAnd you were like\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nThe idea that I was the\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nParagon of confidence for you\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nWas, says a lot\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nBecause you're calling me for advice\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nI'm like, what is this matter for\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nYou're like, listen\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nWhat do you do when you park\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nIn a grocery store\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nDo you look for the park\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nBecause I've been driving\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nI went to the store\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nI just drove away\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nI couldn't handle the pressure anymore\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nYou couldn't handle the pressure\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nOf parking at a grocery store\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nAnd you called me\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nNo, you\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nIntimidated me because the last few times\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nI bumped into you were really like\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nAngry Dan\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nIntimidating\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nLarry David\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nNo, you were nice to me\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nBut there were these stupid nature\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nHalf moon walks\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nThe full moon\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nI just had a fucking get laid\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nAnd like\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nI was in a bad place\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nI was like, yeah\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nI'm fucking this bitch\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nI didn't say bitch\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nBut that helped a little bit\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nThat helped to laugh a little bit\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nYou were so brave\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nI would have said\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nI'm gonna have sex with this girl\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nThat was the mode I was in\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nI bumped into her since\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nAnd I was so jealous\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nShe was sweet\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nAnd you said\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nI'm just here to fucking get laid\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nI don't think you said fuck\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nBut you said to get laid\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nFuck all this, you know this nature\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nBut no, you're great\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nI was in a phase at that time\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nBut you were acting like the asshole\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nAnd you were getting laid\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nThere was a girl that told me\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nAnd this is not negging\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nThis isn't that red pill shit\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nI had come into my own\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nThe justification in my head was\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nFor about a year\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nI was a pig\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nBut not like\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nI don't think I was abusive\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI was a pig\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nOne woman said to me\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nWhich I will always remember\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nIt actually summed up exactly what I was doing\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nAnd she was a customer\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nThat was explaining\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nThis is why I stopped and bought this fucking soup\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nThat made me sick\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nI was like, oh that's what's on the label\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nI spent so much energy\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nTrying to catch guys\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nAnd their red flags\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nAnd you wave yours like a matador\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nAnd that's what it was\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nAnd it wasn't\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nI want the kids to know\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nI want these millennials to know\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nFirst of all, I said that was a year\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nAnd I almost killed myself\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nAnd I was miserable, I almost burnt my apartment down\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nIt was a bad time, I'm also not saying\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nDon't ever do that, do it\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nBut that is not\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nThe same as this, because these are weird fucking times\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nAnd that shit is kissing cousins\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nWith some ideologies that have to do\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nWith hurting other people\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nIn order to like\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nReverse psychology\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nThe baseline\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nIs total aid\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nIf you meet somebody at a party\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nThat just says\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nI'm very lonely, would you like to make out later?\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nLike\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nHe's not\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nThat guy\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nYou have a reasonable time\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nLike\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nBecause then you're playing money ball\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nWith statistics\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nI resent the fact that that\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nBleeds into this other\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nCamp that's about\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nTaking it back from women\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nWho never took it away\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nThat's why I want to\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nPut a big fucking fat asterisk on that\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nBut I was going through that phase\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nWhere I was like\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nI was just going on dates a lot\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nFor the first part of my life\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nEvery girl I talked to that I was attracted to\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nI was trying to be in this zone\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nWhere I'd be like, I'm very attracted to you\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nI would try not to\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nSnowplow them\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nI got a lot of\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nLike fucking humiliating\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nEye rolls, I'm like walk away\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nReally, you'd say that to me\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nBut I'd be like, I'm very attracted to you\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nAnd I'd like to make out with you\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nNow that you don't need those lines anymore\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nCan we hear one of them or\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nNo, he intimidated me\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nAt the Super Bowl parties\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nSuper\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nJoe Hodgson things\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nThat's some people for 15 years of their life\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nSome people die\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nAt 65 years old staying that way\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nYou hear the humanity in him talking about\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nTrump and all this stuff\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nThat's why I was in his intimidated\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nI feel I need to do a\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nStar Trek joke to get you back\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nBecause I can't believe you\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nYou told these people everything about\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nDan, now I see why Larry\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nDavid fuck with you\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nPeople think I'm an easy\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nMark, but\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nI got sued by this guy\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nAnd I didn't get bullied\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nI didn't get bullied with the guy with their straining order\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nI pushed him away\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nWhat happened with the end of that\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nAnd he\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nTo give him credit\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nHe didn't know it was illegal\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nWhat he was doing\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nTo threaten you and intimidate you\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nTo bang on my door, leave notes\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nAnd say let's go on Dr. Drew\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nSo when you say\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nRestraining order\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nDid you file it or did he file it?\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nThis is the funny thing\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nI\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nI filed the restraining order\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nSome friends\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nServed him\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nAnd then a few days later\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nHe serves me with one\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nSaying\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nI can't go near him because I'm threatening him\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nWait, so I could get arrested\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nIf I'm in my own hallway where he lurks\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nIf he gets this restraining order\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nYou're describing Cape Fear\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nYes, yes\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nIt's like competing radiuses\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nDid anyone ever file for restraining order\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nThat room you go to downtown\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nI feel like there's probably two people\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nAt least in the room that have\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nIt was weird because there's all different types\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nIt's probably not a fun situation\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nMinorities, all different people, rich, poor\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nAnd then\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nWe had one hand up\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nWould you be willing to talk about\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nYour restraining order?\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nOkay, would you like to come up please?\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nHa ha ha\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nSee, that's\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nHappy Memorial Day\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nAnd you had to go to a place\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nDowntown where you wait with all the people\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nOh, what happened?\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nCheck\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nIf you're listening to the\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nLive free Wednesday podcast\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nAnd my mic was bad for the first\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nHalf of the show\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nWe've replaced it\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nHave you seen Breaking Bad?\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nI've seen Breaking Bad\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nSo my dad was like a Jewish Walter White\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nSorry, what's your name, sir?\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nOri?\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nKeep the mic like kissy distance\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nWait, your father was a Jewish anything?\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nYeah\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nNo, no, no, you got to turn your head\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nAt the same time\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nYou had one job, one job I gave you\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nOne job\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nYou think I'm sitting like this because I'm comfortable?\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nHa ha ha ha\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nUm, so yeah\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nMy mother\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nA Jewish Walter White\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nIn what way?\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nWell, he sold crystal meth and women\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nWelcome to the newest guest\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nOf Harmontown\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nHe'll be controlling from now on\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nWas he a chemistry teacher?\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nNo, he was a car stereo and alarm salesman\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nSo he went from pimping cars\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nTo pimping women\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nYou don't hear Jews as pimps\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nNo, I'm a handler, I'm making fun of\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nA Jewish pimp\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nI'm just so distracted by the math\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nOf my head that he sold crystal meth and women\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nSo he had both\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nYeah\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nAnd he wasn't done?\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nWell, I mean, he, don't forget car stereos\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nOh, okay\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nHe saved car stereos\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nAnd could never get them\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nI mean, his trinity was\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nHe would get hookers to sell crystal meth to guys\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nOh, you ain't got to tell us\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nAnd then they would fuck the guys\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nAnd then do the math\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nAnd then when the job was all done, they'd smoke the math\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nAnd then the math would make them clean\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nSo that everything would be spotless\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nThe meth would make them clean?\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nWell, you know, because meth makes you all like\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nClean like a maid\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nOh, clean the house\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nYou're about to buy a shit ton of meth\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nYou'll be like\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nMeth can make me clean\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nI would like to try some meth\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nI'm so dirty\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nJust got to get that colonic\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nOh, my God, yeah\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nBy the way, Levy is obsessed with colonics\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nI am not obsessed\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nHe keeps asking me\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nTo get one because he wants to\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nI was driving the car the other day\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nAnd I go, Levy\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nI order you to\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nCheck out getting a colonic for me\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nAnd he was like\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nReally? Okay\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nI know what's happening\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nI'm more curious if I actually got one\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nIf you\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nNo, no, I think\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nFor me, I would only do it\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nIf that meant you absolutely had to do it\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nIt would\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nWe support you\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nI don't want to do it\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nWhat do you mean you don't want to do it\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nYou keep bringing it up\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nCan we get back to hookers\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nAnd meth and car stereos\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nI'm trying to learn something in this motherfucker\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nNow he runs a rehab center\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nOff of Melrose\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nNow he runs\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nI don't care about him cleaning himself the fuck up\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nI want to know\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nWhat was your restraining order for\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nBecause he was doing a lot of meth\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nAnd that's not good for a grown child\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nSo how old were you at the time?\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nI was like 16\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nSo did you have to go to the police department\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nNo, I wasn't minor, my mom had to go\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nBecause the DEA came into our house\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nAnd they were like, hey, your dad's doing some shit\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nWhy do you need a restraining order\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nIf the DEA has already taken him away\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nOh, no, they were looking for him\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nOh, and he may come back\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nIs that a friend of yours\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nOr one of your dad's bodyguards\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nI have no idea\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nWe just got killed by a Sicario\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nAnd what ended up happening to him\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nIn your relationship with him\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nThat's why I'm back in LA\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nI came back to work on a relationship with him\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nYou should have him on the show\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nI would\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nIf there was a story we thought we could track\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nThat would be worth clicks\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nWhat has changed\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nHas there been an arc in terms of you or him\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nI mean, basically\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nFrom when I was a kid, like 16\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nIt all started happening\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nSlowly but surely I found out what he was doing\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nHe was in jail, he had a kingpin\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nYeah\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nJewish kingpin\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nThat was made for me in jail\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nOh\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nWow\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nYeah\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nDid you just say anything for you in jail\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nWow\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nSo, but you're saying\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nWhat's changed is the experiences\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nHumanized you, at 16\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nIt was so volcanic\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nYeah, it was traumatizing at that age\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nYou got out of there because you're a survivor\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nCan you ask how old you are?\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nI'm 25 now, yeah\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nOkay, so I can ask how old you are\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nYou're a young prick\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nAnd he's got weed in his pocket\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nBut as a functioning adult\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nThis is very admirable\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\n25, I'd still be paying my rent\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nOff my anger at my dad\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nI mean, he's being adult child\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nSupport basically right now\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nYou're looking back and you're going like\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nBut who's the guy, is he in jail now?\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nNo, now he's running a rehab center\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nThere's so many Jewish and adult people\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nLike get off the streets\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nThere's so many Jewish kingpins\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nI like the placement of the and there though\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nOther Jewish and adult people\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nOff the street\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nSo if you're Jewish\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nYou could be a third trimester fetus\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nAnd addicted to crack\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nRight\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nSo that sounds like\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nI didn't want to force that narrative where it's like\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nSo he's clean now, so it's time to repair\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nBut it sounds like he is clean\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nBecause he's running a rehab center\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nSo it's time to revisit it\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nYeah, well no, let's have him on\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nTell him your podcast\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nWants to talk about fathers and sons\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nAnd all that shit\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nIf he wants to come on, for sure\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nWho, what about\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nMy stained glass company?\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nWell, it's not very interesting\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nNo, I think that's\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nWho am I arguing with\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nIn my head\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nWhy do I always sound like I'm defending myself\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nWho's attacking me\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nMy girlfriend woke up this morning and she went\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nOh, baby, and I went\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nWhat, what now?\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nAnd she went, I have a headache\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nAnd I went, oh my god, I'm so sorry\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nI was so fucking ready\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nFor women to attack me in the morning\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nLike what am I, a fucking like\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nWeird cyborg?\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nI have so much neurological work to do\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nDo you believe in neuroplasticity, Fred?\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nI never heard of it\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nBut now I do believe in it\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nThis is when your brain can change throughout time\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nNo, I late in life I got into weed\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nBecause I do believe that\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nAnd I tried mushrooms and it didn't work\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nBut I believe things could be better\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nIt didn't work like nothing happened?\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nWell, yes and no\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nDo you want to hear this story?\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nYeah\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nIs Larry David in it?\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nNo wrong answers\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nAlright, I'll try to make a long story short\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nI got into edibles\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nAnd I like them because I have realizations\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nRevelations where something hits you\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nAnd it's like in a visual\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nWow, and I had a breakthrough\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nAnd now I won't go back\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nAnd I love that someone goes\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nYou really get that on mushrooms\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nAlright, I want to\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nSo you always crave that\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nSee, this is an important thing\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nI'm opening the cut\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nI feel an energy from you\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nWhen I interrupt you and do my prattling\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nThat you're like Jesus Christ is talking\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nAnd I'm on a fucking track\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nI want to get back to that thing\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nSo that I can get back to the thing I was talking about\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nI love him\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nI'm trying to show I know stuff\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nHey\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nOver the garden wall\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nI was in that\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nThe idea of\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nRealizations, yes\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nYou don't have anxiety about a bad trip\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nOr anything like that\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nI've had paranoia\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nBut\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nWell, it's like anything\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nIt's like if you're in a very bad state\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nIt's going to compound it\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nA thousand percent\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nLike the loneliness, the isolation\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nI got dumped on acid once\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nBy your dad\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nNo, no, by a girl\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nIt was very confusing at the time\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nYes\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nThis is something that no one would ever assume about you though\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nI guarantee you that\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nBecause the average person\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nI think I'm so neurotic about it\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nThe average person doesn't do ayahuasca\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nOr mushrooms because of the Fred Stoller voice inside\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nSo to find out\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nThat Fred Stoller\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nWho has that voice\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nIs like, yeah, no\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nI just don't know how to get it\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nWhat happened?\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nDid you buy it at a store?\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nHow do you park there?\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nHow do you keep people from judging you\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nWhen you're trying to buy ayahuasca?\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nAgain\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nBeing the old guy in the 80s\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nThe few times I did weed\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nThe Fred Stoller neurotic guy\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nMy throat hurts for three weeks\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nMy sore throat, I'm dizzy\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nAnd I don't like alcohol\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nBecause of the Fred Stoller neurotic guy\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nI wake up dry-mouthed\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nThree hours later, I'm doing an oppression of myself\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nI don't like it\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nSo I thought weed was like\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nHey, man, did you move the car?\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nNo, I forgot\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nI don't want that\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nSo, you know\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nLike, you know, Brian Posein\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nHey, man, hey\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nI like comic books, yeah\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nI'm a stoner\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nSo that's what I thought weed is\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nJust from your observation\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nOf other people from outside\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nYou're like, I don't want to be like that\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nBut you found out\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nBut then I found out someone said it opens your mind\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nSo it's got more sophisticated\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nI think in the 80s when I tried it once or twice\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nIt was just anything\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nAnd I smoked it, like I said, sore throat, paranoia\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nBut then, you know, you see on the news\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nYou know, the legalization\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nThere's actually different strains\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nYes, and someone said it opens your mind\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nSo, and then I listened to Sam Harris\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nWho, not the guy who\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nNo, you know who he is\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nAnd he's saying\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nI read the book on tape\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nOne of his that he's got daughters\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nHe goes, I wouldn't like if they did\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nI'd be concerned if they did meth\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nOr crack, but I would want them\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nTo try\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nIt opens your mind, and I started thinking about it\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nSo, and I then\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nDid some edibles\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nAnd yeah, I'd have things\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nWhere I think I have a funny idea\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nThat never makes sense\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nBut I really felt\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nAnd I even would meditate\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nYou have a breakthrough where\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nIt's a visualization where you got something\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nAnd once you got it, I can't go back\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nTo what that was\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nSo someone said mushrooms is better\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nAnd it wasn't\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nIt wasn't, it didn't work on you\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nCome on, something happened and it took mushrooms\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nOkay, tell us a story, sorry\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nYeah, Ory\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nJust checking if I remember the name\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nSomeone, a very sweet\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nBuckle up\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nThe lights are warmer up here\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nA very sweet woman\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nWho I don't want to put down\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nShe reached out\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nShe has a boyfriend, but you know\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nShe's seen me on things, hey\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nYou're an interesting character, and I like you\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nNot like me that way, but she said\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nAnd I, you know, she saw me on\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nSome podcast talking about weed\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nAnd no, she does weed\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nSo she met me and she got me a $40 top\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nJoint thing\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nShe saw you on the podcast\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nDoug loves movies, other things\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nI didn't do Doug loves movies\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nA lot of podcasts have live video feeds\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nNow for $5 a month, you can subscribe\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nIs there one that you might know of, offhand?\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nYeah, no, the one where you smoke weed\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nYes\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nWith Doug Benson\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nAnd again, that's another guy\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nYou don't think of him as breakthroughs\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nYou know, so\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nBut she goes\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nTalking about that, I go\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nI'd like to do mushrooms, but how do you do it\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nShe goes, I'll get you some\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nAnd we'll do it\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nCan I interrupt here?\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nYes\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nShe's local, she's in your life physically\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nOr are you connected with her online?\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nShe sort me out\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nThrough Twitter or whatever the hell\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nBut it wasn't like a catfish\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nBecause we had mutual friends, so it wasn't so psychotic\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nI just want to know\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nIs she a person\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nLike, because\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nI'm trying to figure out\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nWho she is?\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nNo, I'm trying to figure out\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nHow much of this was like\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nYour anxiety was mitigated\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nBy this person\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nThat was drawing you in\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nShe trusted her\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nI trusted her\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nAnd this is how you met her\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nBut then you were going to meet her\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nYes, we met and she had the joint\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nAnd\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nAnd we talked\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nAnd I said I never did that, I'm curious\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nAnd I had a birthday\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nA few months ago where I'm tired of every\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nBirthday you sit around with eight friends\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nYou know, yeah, yeah, my friends\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nAnd the check comes, you know, I want to do something\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nAdventuresome\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nSo I said, I want to do mushrooms\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nAnd\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nSo then\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nThere's a\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nThat's your description of a birthday?\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nI mean, by no means do I\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nClaim that birthdays are fun\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nBut\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nYour description of a birthday\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nOh, it gets more ridiculous\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nWould make Vinogat kill himself\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nYes\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nSit around a table\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nSeven to eight friends\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nI'm older, the check comes\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nAnd everyone's dipping it off\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nIt sounds like the way a rock\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nWould describe\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nDNA\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nYou shape yourself different, then you reproduce\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nIt's always the same restaurant\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nAnd it's the same eight people\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nThey're all very nice\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nI'm always alone\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nYeah, and no significant other\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nSo basically\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nSo I said I want to do something\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nCrazy, you know\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nSo there's another\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nFemale comedian\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nWho once in a while, she heard about the edibles\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nShe goes, let's do edibles\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nShe texts me and I go, well\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nI want to try mushrooms, yeah, let's do that\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nSo I wanted to bring her there\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nSo it's three of us\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nI don't want to be uncomfortable\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nAnd be sexual\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nI thought it's like ecstasy\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nYou're kissing\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nWhich ecstasy isn't, just so you know\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nI just did it with\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nI haven't done it with you\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nEcstasy is like\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nSynthetic mushrooms\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nIt's like mushrooms with a salary cap\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nIs this being homophobic\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nIf I say\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nI was afraid to do mushrooms with a friend\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nBecause I thought, oh, you start making out with a guy\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nYou make out with whoever you're with\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nNo, not that guy\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nOkay, well, so\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nThat's poppers\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nSo they're what\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nIt's like, but you weren't afraid\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nHere, let me show you\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nI'm a hypocrite, right?\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nWhere would you get that from?\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nI can't even finish\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nBecause of my self-loathing\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nI can't finish my question, but for your answer\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nI'm saying\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nHere, let me lay out\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nI was hoping the woman that has a girlfriend\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nMay be something with her\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nWhen I was in my 20s\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nI think if anybody said\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nThis is mushrooms\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nThat's why I did mushrooms\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nThat's why I did acid\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nBecause I was in my 20s\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nAnd when you're in your 20s\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nYou're just driving into trees\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nBecause you're like, why can't I die?\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nPeople just\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nHand you pizza and go\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nGoing out for three days\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nAnd you're like, why not four?\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nBecause you can't wait\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nTo feel pain\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nAnd you will someday\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nI got food poisoning\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nAt one point in my 30s\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nEverything\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nI had bad trips in my 30s\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nBut when I was in my 20s\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nThat's when I feel like my roster of drugs\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nThat I was willing to do\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nWas completed\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nBecause it's like the map of the world\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nAnd stuff\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nI'll never try heroin\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nBecause I made it to 30 without doing heroin\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nThank God\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nI'll never do it\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nThis is what\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nBut the fear\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nThe Fred Stoller voice inside of me\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nThat would not want to do mushrooms\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nWouldn't want to not do mushrooms\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nBecause I'd be afraid of anything that would happen\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nBecause of a successful mushroom\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nIt would be afraid of an unsuccessful mushroom\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nPeople reassured me\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nOkay, so this is what happened\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nThe woman said, I'll be a mushroom coach\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nI'm here for you\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nI was a trip advisor, that's fun\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nShe goes, if you're freaking out, I'll take you aside\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nSo you've been told this drug represents\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nSuch a threshold\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nThat the worst case scenario\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nWas women taking care of you\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nI'm starting to come around\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nThis is what I was seeking was like\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nI'm not judging you\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nYou're still bolder than me\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nBecause you're outside of your\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nThe fact that the story starts with you saying\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nI want to try mushrooms\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nI just wouldn't have done it\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nI would have looked for\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nWell, again, I like the realizations\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nI'm very into meditating\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nAnd Duncan Trussell\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nGot me into Ram Dass and all this stuff\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nRam Dass ain't no joke\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nYeah\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nYou know who he is?\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nI know who he is, he ain't no joke\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nBro\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nHe's not saying to be fucked with\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nYou know about my book\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nYou can go back two episodes and he cedes\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nRam Dass ain't no joke as a runner\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nFor no seeming reason\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nYou're a time traveler, aren't you?\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nYou set yourself up for a callback\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nYou're Marty McFly\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nThe reason I do\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nRam Dass ain't no joke made no sense back then\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nAnd now it's a callback\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nEveryone go back\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nEveryone stop listening to this episode\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nGo back two episodes\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nHe said Ram Dass ain't no joke in this weird voice\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nI bought it though\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nI'm getting drunk, sorry\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nThe reason I'm doing it later in life\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nIs I don't have any guilt\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nI fucked around my 20s, 30s, 40s, my 50s\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nIt's like I tried my hardest\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nTo meet women and write\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nAnd do the career\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nAnd you made it to now visit\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nYou look fantastic\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nThat's layering in why I was mentioning that\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nYou have the American dream\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nYou may as well put your dick under a bulldozer\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nWhen Edible works right\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nWhen I'm lying in my bed\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nIt's time to find out you're into anything\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nYes\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nWas it a tea?\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nSo this is what I thought\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nThey said you can't do mushrooms\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nIn your apartment\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nYou gotta be on the beach and beautiful\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nIn Malibu\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nSo she said you gotta get a room\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nSo I rented a room\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nAnd that way we could go out\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nCome back in, yeah sleep\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nThe morning, wake up\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nI spend my money\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nAnd I'm not that rich on a place in Malibu\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nFor the night\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nAnd she goes okay I'm your mushroom coach\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nIf it gets too much and this and that\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nSo me, her and\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nThe third very nice woman\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nWe go to a\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nCheck into the hotel\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nIt's like that candy wrap\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nYou wrap it in\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nYou know what I'm saying\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nI don't know, the taffy\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nYou're just describing cellophane\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nThey made like a mushroom taffy\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nYes, so\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nRight away I'm throwing some things off\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nCause I'm eating it no problem\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nShit the mushroom coach is saying\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nSo then we go\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nAcross the street to Malibu\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nAnd right away it hits her\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nAnd she's lying in the sand\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nAnd I'm picking her up\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nAnd this is the coach\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nAnd\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nAnd this guy\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nThe only thing that hit me\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nThe guy who owned the house was Martin Sheen\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nCause I know it's in Malibu\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nAnd he's looking and there's a girl lying in the sand\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nAnd they're just gonna throw up\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nAnd he's on the phone and go you gotta get out of here\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nSo I'm not really feeling anything\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nWait I'm sorry, is it the track\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nMartin Sheen is it just something that leaps into your head\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nBecause you know\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nMaybe I was a little paranoid\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nThat's the only paranoia\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nThe only one I knew was Martin Sheen\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nAnd he's there and he's on the phone\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nYou're imagining in your head Martin Sheen\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nI doubt it\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nI think that might be Fred Stoller\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nPicking up a phone\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nAnd it's burning in the sand\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nAnd I'm trying to lift her up\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nSo the other woman ran off to get water\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nShe said she's gonna throw up\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nSo like\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nSo then the only\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nI think I did it for fun\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nI pretended we were like Dee Dee on the beach\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nAnd she was a wounded soldier\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nAnd I have to get her back to the hotel\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nSo she's the coach and I'm escorting her\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nAnd we're just taking her\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nAnd then\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nAll of a sudden I start narrating it\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nPeople are walking by\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nLook at these people\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nThey have houses and lives\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nAnd they're dogs and they're kids\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nAnd I'm the 59 year old guy\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nWith two women trying mushrooms on my birthday\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nAnd\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nAnd I'm saying that out loud\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nAnd people are walking\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nSo\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nSo then you notice a tunnel that goes from the beach\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nYou know in Malibu to this\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nSo she couldn't take it anymore\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nShe's gonna throw up and she's worthy\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nIs that the word on the floor\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nAnd then this guy comes by\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nWith his family and goes\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nWhat's wrong? And I go\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nOh she got nauseous looking at the water\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nAnd he goes\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nAnd he goes\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nShe got seasick on her beach\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nAnd that has nothing to do with the story\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nBut I have to say it, he goes\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nDon't go on a cruise then\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nDon't go on a cruise\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nYou can do the voice\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nYes\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nI miss that you were waving\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nBy the way, he's like\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nBecause that's the punchline of the story\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nDon't go on no cruises\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nThat's not your black guy boys\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nCan I do it? I'll do it\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nDon't go on a cruise then\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nMotherfucker\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nAwful\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nI don't know\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nI assume that he grew up in Pittsburgh\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nI was trying to\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nMake a shady spot\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nSo that he could have a picnic\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nI thought I'd take the hit\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nI thought I'd create a racist canopy\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nSo that he could be like\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nHere's what he really sounded like\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nI'd be like that's great\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nLike the waves in Malibu are so crazy\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nYou look at them, you can't walk\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nYou have to have two people escort you\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nSo then she\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nOh I forgot this part, the mushroom coach gave good advice\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nIf you need to have a bowel movement\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nDo it before it kicks in\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nSo that was an erotic Jew in me\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nAndy Kiddler\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nOh I gotta make\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nDid I not go?\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nIs that just because taking a shit on mushrooms\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nWill make you feel like you're the universe's\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nAsshole?\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nI'm trying to figure out why that is\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nI love that that's a document\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nThat's like\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nThat's as clean as like\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nThrow the grenade, not the pin\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nTake a shit\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nBefore the mushrooms kick in\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nI guess I understand that\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nYour turd will be infinite\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nI'm having to go and you're tripping\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nIt won't work, I don't know\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000\nSo then she goes I gotta shit\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nI gotta throw up, so here she gave the advice\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nSo she goes get me back to the room\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nSo\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nSo get out\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nI need the room\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nSo we leave her there\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nAnd she's probably doing what she's gotta do\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nAnd then my\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nThe phone battery died\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nI go to charge it, get out of here\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nStone opened the fucking light\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nSo we had to stand by\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nThe door\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nI'm with you\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nThe entire way\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nThere's people attacking you now\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nI would try to come in the hotel room\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nI paid for to charge my battery\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nAnd she goes get the fuck out of here\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nWho said that?\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nThe mushroom coach\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nNow known as the deuce dropper\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nShe was freaking out\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nShe was freaking out\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nShe was okay\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nWe were both like\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nWe were standing outside the door\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nAnd we're not allowed in\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nSo we couldn't, I guess it didn't work\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nCause we were like we gotta save the coach\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nAnd\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nSo I didn't have any great\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nThe only realization I had\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nWas the comedian I was with\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nI go you look like Bonnie McFarlane\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nI would never\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000\nRealize that\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nThat was the only thing\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nThat I realized\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nBut you did live through\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nAlthough no one would pay\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nMoney for this\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nThe experience of oh what would I do\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nIf I was in charge of a person\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000\nThat I thought was supposed to be in charge of me\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nThat's a fucking valuable experience\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nNo I felt very proud in machismo\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nIt's not birthday valuable\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nI would have you have a better birthday\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nNo\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nShe's a sweet woman\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nAnd she was very ashamed\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nAnd\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nSo the woman\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nThe other woman who was okay\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nShe has a girlfriend\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nThat said get down to wherever she lives\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nWhere does Ray Donovan take place\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nNear Malibu I forgot\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nIn a world where\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nSecrecy is your last option\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nSo her girlfriend kept saying\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nGet over here, get over here\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nAnd she didn't want to let her know she was stoned\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nSo I'm at a birthday party\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nAnd she didn't believe her\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nSo we had to go to a restaurant\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nAnd take pictures pretending\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nThe beginnings of your stories\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nHave packets of information in them\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nThat I missed because I'm an afterglow\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nFrom your last story\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nI think that's what it is\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nBecause you change locations and casts\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nI was trying to say it was so crazy\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nThat the other woman\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nWe were outside the door\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nAfraid to go in\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nAnd lay there\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nShe didn't want to be with anybody\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nWhile she was freaking out\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nI always make it everyone else's problem\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nIf I'm having a single issue\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nWith anything\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nSociety is the first place I go\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nWipe my ass on\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nEverything\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nThat's why the election made me so upset\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nI'm like I'm alone\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nI can't wipe my ass on anybody\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nThey're all wiping their ass on each other\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nI was like this is fucked up\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nI didn't mean to bring it back to that\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nNo, so\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nThat was the mushrooms in my birthday\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nSo you never tried mushrooms again?\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nNo, I'd like to\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nMy bad mushroom chips are like\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nWhen you have bad mushrooms\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nI got a pain in my neck\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nI looked in a mirror\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nAnd I thought I was a walrus\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nAnd they're kind of like bad mushrooms\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nSo it's basically like acid\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nBut there's still a\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nCylosil\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nCylosil\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nI'll get it eventually\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nWe'll edit it back in\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nWhen we do the bad mic pass\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nBut yeah\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nCylocybin\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nIs that in acid\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nOr is that just in mushrooms?\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nNo, acid's\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nLysergic acid\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nSo mushrooms\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nThey've researched\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nI guess I want to urge you\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nBecause you're fucking bold and bad ass\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nOn your 29th birthday let's do mushrooms\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nPlease do them again\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nI think you'll enjoy them very much\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nWhat about acid?\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nPeople are micro dosing now\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nMicro dosing\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nSo good that his father's rehab center is doing\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nDo acid\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nDon't do meth, do acid\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nHe's really\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000\nBecome his father in his bad years\n\n01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000\nDo acid\n\n01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nI mean my dad's a Jew\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000\nHoffman was a Jew, we're all Jews\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000\nNo, I'm not looking to do anything ridiculous\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nBut I like expanding the mind\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000\nHave you done ecstasy?\n\n01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nNo\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000\nThat's really easy\n\n01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000\nThat kind of can't go wrong\n\n01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nI was scared that I would do harm to my cat\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nBut over my cat\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000\nYou just pat him bone dry\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nThe cat's like Jesus Christ\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nYou have my number\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nYou have the job\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nYou give me food\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nI don't know what you ate tonight\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000\nBut I was already\n\n01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nAt an equilibrium spot\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000\nWe had a business going here\n\n01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nI missed my cat so much\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000\nI missed that kind of affection\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nI lost two\n\n01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000\nOne was 18, one was 19\n\n01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nAnd I wasn't going to get another\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nBut someone got one from a shelter\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000\nAnd the other cat wasn't getting along\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000\nI'm glad it happened\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000\nI love my dogs\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000\nI can't believe I got dogs\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nAnd they're like what are you doing\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nAnd I'm like it's called nothing\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nYou're supposed to enjoy it\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nThey're like just throw the thing\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nI'm like if I throw it\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nYou'll just bring it back\n\n01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nAnd they're like yeah\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nNo they're not like yeah\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nBecause if they were like yeah then they'd be sentient\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nBut they're like no throw it, throw it\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000\nDamn\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nFrom the future\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nBecause my brain's bigger than a peanut\n\n01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000\nOh\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nYou're just gonna keep bringing it back\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000\nAnd I'm telling you\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nThat you're never gonna understand this as a species\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000\nIt never gets any better\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000\nThan sitting under a tree\n\n01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nGrooming another monkey\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nAnd waiting to die\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nAnd if a spotted leopard comes around\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nYou go\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000\nAnd you all go to safety\n\n01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000\nUntil the spotted leopard's gone\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nAnd that is where humans\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nStarted fucking up\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nBecause we had nailed it\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nAnd then one was like what if a spaceship\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nAnd they were like you're great Carl\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nBut Carl's not bad either\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000\nBecause those chimps are gonna die anyway\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nI'm sorry I hurt this a lot\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000\nI saw the documentary of Coco\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000\nThe sign language in Guerrero\n\n01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000\nWith my friend who was so cynical going\n\n01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nThere's all these theories\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nCoco didn't really know sign language\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nShe's just copying\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000\nAnd really bothered me\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000\nYour friend bothered you or Coco?\n\n01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nMy friend bothered me that\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000\nHis cosmology was so specific\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nThat it was important to him\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000\nThat Coco not knows sign language\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000\nYeah, Coco's full of shit\n\n01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000\nI find myself wondering that all the time\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nWhen you're with somebody and you're like\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000\nWait, what's with the pushback at this point?\n\n01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000\nYes\n\n01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nLet's examine this\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000\nThey had a 30 year scam\n\n01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nThat Coco was just copying\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000\nNot really signing\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nIt's not even like I'm open to finding out\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nThat Coco's full of shit\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nI'm totally open to it\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nI find it weird when you meet the guy\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000\nThat's like Coco's full of shit\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nAnd I know it\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000\nIt's not a tested hypothesis\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nIt's just a strong belief\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nYou're like the guy in Awakening\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nBut if you wanted monkeys\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nTo not talk to you\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000\nIt's weird to have\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nThat strong an opinion\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nGiven that there's no stakes to being proven right\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000\nOnly thing that happens if you're proven right\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nIs they got a documentary\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nAbout Coco\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nDo you know Pat Sajak\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nWas like a global warming guy\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nThat bummed me out so much\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nPolitics and the internet ruined everything\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nTurns out Pat Sajak is a global warming\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nDenier\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nAnd his tweets at a certain point\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nWere like\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nFollow the money\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nFollow the money\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nFollow the money\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nGlobal warming\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nYes, yes, there's someone right now\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nSomeone is making a billion dollars\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nBy you believing\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nThe world is getting hotter\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nYeah, that's\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nIt's like a cartoon\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nOr a game show where people spell\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nCommon phrases\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000\nSo disappointed\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nYou want Pat Sajak to walk off screen\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nOff a wheel of fortune\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nYou want him to slide down a pole\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nInto like a den with a banner rug\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nWith a martini\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nAnd solve crimes or something\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nThat are based on rudimentary English\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000\nOr just enjoy his life\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nI care if he jerks off at a bowl and drinks it\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000\nLike I want him to be happy\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000\nI want someone\n\n01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nTo affirm the myth of retirement\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nTo me\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000\nWhy is it the higher you look\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nThe less happy everybody is\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000\nYou know, Rupert Firebamoon\n\n01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nDied today\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nHe had 95 divorces\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nHe\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nHis face was a scowl\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nHe owned 900,000 newspapers\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nHe could tell\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nThree countries what to think\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nBut it was\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nNo one ever saw him smile\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nHe died\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000\nLike where does it go\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nDavid Hasselhoff was night rider\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nHe can't stop drinking long enough to go\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nI thought he had the rights for the Baywatch\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nI thought he made a lot of money from that\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nI don't care about him\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000\nBecause I'm looking for one person\n\n01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000\nTo show me the path\n\n01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000\nBecause otherwise, then it's me\n\n01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nI'm going like, okay, so I\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000\nHave to sit in my bed and I have to\n\n01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nJust jerk off on my girlfriend\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nLike\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nAnd watch Star Trek\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nYou don't have to\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nNo, I'm saying if I want to win the game of life\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nThe way I have to do it\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000\nIs not owning nine airplanes\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nIt is exactly what I have right now\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000\nAnd then you go, okay, so\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000\nOh, so now I\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nWait to die\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nThat's not fun, I don't want to\n\n01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000\nNo, no, no, no\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000\nExpand your horizons\n\n01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000\nBecause Fred Stoner is like, let me do\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nMushrooms, I want to, yeah, okay\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nLet me ask you again\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nI want to check\n\n01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000\nI think we just entered a first perfect show\n\n01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nI was just looking for the first time\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nAnd you were here\n\n01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000\nYou were here\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000\nI'm not depressed these days\n\n01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nBecause I like being creative\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000\nI'm not being an asshole plugging my stupid kindles\n\n01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nSaying nulls and books\n\n01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000\nIt's called 5 Minutes to Kill\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nIt's about the 1989 Young\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nComedians special\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000\nYou guys, I don't know if you remember\n\n01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nYou said these big Young Comedians specials\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nA lot of people were launched\n\n01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000\nAnd I wrote about the one I was on\n\n01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nBecause I found it interesting\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000\nThe trajectory and the diversity\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nOf the careers and lives\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nTwo of them made it big\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nRob Schneider and David Spade\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nThey were discovered from the Young Comedians special\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000\nTwo of them had tragedies\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nWarren Thomas and Drake Sather\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nWarren Thomas was the best\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nShe's beautiful, she's struggling\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000\nSo I kind of interviewed\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nWidows and people\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000\nAnd it's like those\n\n01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000\n30 by 30s\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000\nThis is a college team\n\n01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nThey were all supposed to be pros\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nTwo made it, two didn't\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nIs this you checking in with\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nSo it starts in 1989\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nWith\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000\n6 young hopeful people\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nAnd I wasn't so young even in 1989\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nAs a comedian\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nI did break the Young Comedians special\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nAnd then what happens right away\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nSchneider and\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nYou can call him Schneider here\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000\nSchneider and Spader\n\n01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000\nOf course Schneider gets his break\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nThey get their breaks\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nAnd Warren Thomas had an opportunity\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nTo be on Saturday Night Live as the black guy\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nI'm looking at you\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nAnd it's so sticky\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000\nWas Warren Thomas the\n\n01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nDid he have a Mike Tyson impression\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000\nI'm going to put my dick in the butter\n\n01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nYeah, so he was this guy that\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nThere's a thing\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000\nOn Sunday Night Live\n\n01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000\nYou're talking about the exact special that I remember\n\n01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nI'm like fifth or I don't know\n\n01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000\n19 in Milwaukee\n\n01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000\nI don't know\n\n01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nWas it the HBO comic specials\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nAnd it was\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nMe, Rob Schneider, David Spade\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000\nDrake Sather and Jen Karam\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000\nJen Karam was a precursor\n\n01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000\nTo all the beautiful like Whitney Cummings\n\n01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nAnd Sarah\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nWomen who were hot\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nAnd she was really beautiful\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nBut she didn't own her hotness\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000\nLike hey, making guys come\n\n01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000\nI'm not saying I do those jokes\n\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000\nSort of like Kytlinger\n\n01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000\nYeah, that kind of type of stuff\n\n01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nSo she was really ahead of her time\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000\nIn that way with comedy\n\n01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000\nSo yeah, so I follow from after\n\n01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000\nOur quote unquote break\n\n01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000\nWarren Thomas\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nWhen there's a ritual I didn't know about\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nThat when you meet Lauren Michaels\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000\nInitiation and he said fuck this\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000\nAnd he left and\n\n01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nEnded up going to Chris Rock, that spot\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000\nSo it just takes us\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nTo 2017\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000\nFollowing the triumph and the tragedy\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nOf the six people on it including myself\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nThat's great\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000\nI don't have to\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000\nPronounce that that sounds great\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nSo I forgot\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000\nOh yeah, so in my Seinfeld\n\n01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nYear, so what I'm trying to say is\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nI'm happiest being creative and just writing\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nThings in my own voice\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000\nSo the theory I have is\n\n01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000\nAnd maybe antidepressants help\n\n01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nBut no, I'm happiest when I'm being creative\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000\nNot trying to fit into puzzles\n\n01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000\nIs that depression serves a purpose\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000\nBecause then you're not afraid to die\n\n01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nAnd we're all going to die\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000\nSo I wonder if\n\n01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000\nSo exciting to hear you talk\n\n01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000\nThat's why you need to be pitching television shows\n\n01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nBut when I'm depressed\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000\nI'm more in tune\n\n01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000\nBecause when I'm really depressed I go\n\n01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000\nIn an interesting time with Twitter and Instagram\n\n01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000\nI'm more in tune and in touch\n\n01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000\nAnd in reality, so maybe\n\n01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000\nDepression is the real thing\n\n01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000\nWas supposed to be, I wonder\n\n01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000\nBecause now I don't want to die\n\n01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nAnd I'd be afraid to\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000\nNo, I don't want to, which is good, right?\n\n01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nBut maybe\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nBut I'm very depressed\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000\nI'm not afraid of it, I welcome it\n\n01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000\nSo maybe depression makes more sense\n\n01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000\nDoes this make sense?\n\n01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000\nWell, depression is practical\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000\nIs more practical than avoiding it\n\n01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nThan thinking that it's wrong\n\n01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000\nAnd everything's great\n\n01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000\nLet's say there's two types of something\n\n01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000\nFor once in our lives\n\n01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000\nI know we hate saying there's two types of things\n\n01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000\nLet's say there's two types of depression\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000\nAnd let's say that the two types of depression\n\n01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000\nAre un-fucking controllable biochemical depression\n\n01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000\nWhere, as we all know\n\n01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000\nIf you're in a bad mood\n\n01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000\nAnd you get a flat tire\n\n01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000\nYour flat tire is the end of your world\n\n01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nIf you're in a good mood and you get a flat tire\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000\nIt's kind of funny you get a flat tire\n\n01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000\nIf you're in a good mood and you win $500\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000\nIn a scratch-off\n\n01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nIt's fucking fantastic\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nIf you're in a bad mood and you win $500\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nIn a scratch-off\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nIt's like\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nEvidence that capitalism has its hopes in you\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000\nAnd so on and so forth\n\n01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000\nLike mood matters more\n\n01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nThan fact\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000\nEspecially when you relate it to\n\n01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nFact, so like\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nFuck, I forgot why I was talking about this\n\n01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000\nBut is it more practical\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nTo not be afraid of death\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000\nLike you'd be depressed\n\n01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nWhichever of those things are true\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000\nWhether you are biochemically\n\n01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000\nUncontrollably depressed\n\n01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nOr whether it's actually\n\n01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000\nThere's the other\n\n01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000\nSituational\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nThere's been like five bad\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000\nThings that have happened\n\n01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000\nAnd it's kind of hard to be in a good mood today\n\n01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000\nAnd\n\n01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000\nI was being glib when I said there was\n\n01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000\nTwo kinds because it's like\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000\nA combination of things\n\n01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000\nIt doesn't matter, your bad mood\n\n01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nStill means the exact same thing\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nAnd committing to your bad mood\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nIs still\n\n01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000\nPractical\n\n01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000\nThe problem is when people\n\n01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000\nConnect\n\n01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000\nFactuality to their mood\n\n01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000\nWhen you say, regardless\n\n01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000\nOf the cause of your bad mood\n\n01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nWhen you say that because of your bad mood\n\n01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000\nYou\n\n01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000\nSay something\n\n01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000\nAnd we all know what the stuff\n\n01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nYou want to do when you're in a bad mood is\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000\nOr, but this is something\n\n01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nThat we overlook a lot\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000\nWhen you think that because\n\n01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000\nThat you're in a bad mood because of the shit\n\n01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000\nThat happened to you recently\n\n01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000\nBecause of everything that your life has\n\n01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000\nBeen\n\n01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000\nThose are big mistakes\n\n01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000\nYou're connecting shit that may be\n\n01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000\nCo-relative, but it's not\n\n01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nCause-effective\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000\nAnd that's why, but if you can just go\n\n01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000\nI am in a bad mood\n\n01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000\nHere's how I feel when I'm in a bad mood\n\n01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000\nI feel like\n\n01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000\nThis, and you\n\n01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000\nWrite it down, or\n\n01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000\nLike, just feel it\n\n01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000\nSo much that you create\n\n01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000\nAny kind of snapshot with it\n\n01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000\nI'm telling you that snapshot\n\n01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000\nIs as valuable to humanity\n\n01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000\nAs a photograph\n\n01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000\nFrom an oceanographer\n\n01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000\nOf the Marianas Trench\n\n01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000\nBecause you might be experiencing\n\n01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000\nDepths that are no deeper\n\n01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000\nThan the person that never\n\n01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000\nWent deeper, but you're experiencing\n\n01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000\nDepths from an angle\n\n01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000\nThat has never been seen\n\n01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nAnd we need, before we all die\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000\nWhen we will probably die\n\n01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000\nBy our own hand, so\n\n01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000\nNo matter how depressed you get\n\n01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000\nWhy bother killing yourself\n\n01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000\nWhen you know humanity will do that\n\n01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000\nFor you\n\n01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000\nLike, leave it to them\n\n01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000\nIt's like the one area\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nOf human society that you can leave\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000\nTo the customer service department\n\n01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000\nLike, you know they'll get around to it\n\n01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nYou don't have to do it, but\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000\nI'm not saying logic is a reason to not hurt\n\n01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000\nYourself, I'm just saying\n\n01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000\nWhen you're at that point when it feels\n\n01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000\nLike you have no course of action other than something\n\n01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000\nI'm telling you\n\n01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000\nFuckin' wait it out\n\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000\nBecause you are a sensor\n\n01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000\nThat has been shot from God\n\n01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000\nLike, to look at that spot\n\n01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000\nIt's the spot that only you can see\n\n01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nIt may seem unremarkable\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000\nNo life grows there\n\n01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000\nIt's jagged and unfriendly\n\n01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000\nAnd all it says to you\n\n01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nIs, fuck you\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000\nYou shouldn't be here\n\n01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000\nWell, that's the whole point of a probe\n\n01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000\nLike, you shouldn't be there\n\n01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000\nYou won't be there at some point\n\n01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000\nLike, you will get out of there\n\n01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000\nAnd you will be stronger\n\n01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nAnd the people around you will be stronger\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000\nBecause you got down there\n\n01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000\nAnd you live down there, Fred Stoller\n\n01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000\nYou were a\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000\nYou were a Marianas trench cruiser\n\n01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000\nWow, thank God\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000\nChurch\n\n01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000\nTo make it to, like I was out here\n\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000\nLike, every day you're just like cruising\n\n01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000\nThrough the fucking\n\n01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000\nDepths, the lowest\n\n01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000\nPlaces that the ocean can afford\n\n01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nThat's valuable data to everybody\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000\nIt's gonna end up making Jared Kushner\n\n01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nLive a more fruitful life\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000\nHe's gonna be on his elliptical\n\n01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nAnd he's gonna be like, I learned from Fred\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000\nThat there's a new way to describe the feeling you have\n\n01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000\nWhen watermelon makes you feel bad\n\n01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000\nI kind of lost at the end there\n\n01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000\nThat's why\n\n01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000\nDrugs, I get things\n\n01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000\nBut I can't articulate it\n\n01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nThat's why this guy's amazing\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000\nBecause I can articulate nothing\n\n01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000\nI'm like a box\n\n01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000\nAnd if a breeze blows through it\n\n01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nIt sounds like something's being said\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000\nSo\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000\nWhen you hold it up to anyone\n\n01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000\nBut you have to hold it up at a distance\n\n01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nAlright, well we should end our show\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nI got\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000\nReal drunk during it because I love\n\n01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000\nListening to you\n\n01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000\nSo\n\n01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000\nWhat's the book?\n\n01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000\nTell us the book again so we can get off\n\n01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000\nThis podcast and go get it\n\n01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000\nIt's called 5 Minutes to Kill\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nThere's a subtitle they came up with\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000\nThe\n\n01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000\nHBO Young Comedian Special\n\n01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000\nChanged the Lives of\n\n01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000\n1989 Six Funniest People\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000\nThat's they came up with\n\n01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000\nIt's a dollar 99\n\n01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000\nBut it's legit\n\n01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000\nI can't wait to read the book\n\n01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000\nBy their marketing department called\n\n01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000\nRefining\n\n01:58:43.000
