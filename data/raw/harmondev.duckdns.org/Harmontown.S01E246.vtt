WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Music

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Makes some noise!

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Music

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
So happy to see you, Burbank!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Armadon is proud of his possession

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
With a very special guest tonight

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
We have a special guest tonight

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Sitting in for a spinster crimson

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
It's Steve Levy!

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Music

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
We miss you so much, Jeff Davis!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Nobody's more than me

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
I'll be sitting here, my name is Brandon Johnson

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Let's bring up the mayor of Harmontown

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Applause

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Thank you, thank you very much

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I don't have any notes, I don't have any

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
There's no show, there's no show tonight

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's a beautiful summer night

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you for coming out to Burbank

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
If you were here last week

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
We started, we're zeroing in on the 8 o'clock start time

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
This time I believe it was our fault

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I think we walked up at 8 o'clock

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
So I don't think we could have started the show sooner

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
We're batting down the hatches

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
If that's what you do on a ship

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
When you're making it a better ship

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I think that's not what you do

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I think that's what you do when a short ship storm is coming

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Welcome Steve

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Thank you

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Big shoes to fill

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Just keep judging me

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Sorry Spencer's not here

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I'll tell you some things about Spencer since he's not here

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
He's usually...

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
He's a Libertarian

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
He voted for...

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
That misfired

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
So it's 30% of my viewership

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Listenership

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I was going to say he's a Republican

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
But I thought it was too archa-joke

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
So I tried to make something funnier

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
If somebody says how old is that

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And you could go like 85

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It's funnier to say 27

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Unless he's 85

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Spencer's 85

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
And a Republican

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
A Nazi Republican

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Not even a log cabin supportive of gay people

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Because it makes fiscal sense Republican

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Like a fucking hardcore master race Republican

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And he hates the fans

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
He hates them

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
He isn't grateful for them

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
He considers them a pox

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And he doesn't...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
He likes dungeons a little bit

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Hates dragons

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Never uses dice

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And we got...

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I moved into this new space because people kept saying

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
They were coming from out of town

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I want to see Spencer

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
So I lifted him up and put him over there

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Put a mannequin behind him

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And now he can't show up

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Because you know why? You know where he is?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
He's whale hunting

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
He's out hunting whales

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
For sport

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Not even for oil

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
He's hunting whales for sport

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Do you know where he gets his...

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
The oil for his whale harpoon gun

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Which uses twice as much oil

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
As a whale generates?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Zebra

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
He uses zebra oil to hunt whales

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
For sport

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Did you tell him about the puppy dress he made?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
He didn't even wear it

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
With his ivory sewing machine?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Conflict ivory?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Not regular free range

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The elephant knows it's been raised

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
To give ivory ivory

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Like actual fucking like

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
There's a Gaza strip of the ivory poachers

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And I know this is challenging for you

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
But there's two kinds of poachers

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And one is technically relatively other kind

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
The good kind of poacher

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And Spencer is not on their side

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
He exploits them

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
The poacher you'd feel sorry for

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
If you were sealed in a room with only poachers

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
And had only known them

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That's the poacher that he exploits

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Alright, well so be thankful

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
He's not here is my point

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It's just little old me

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
With his lack of a show

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh boy, let's go to Burbank

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And pay, what is it $5 now?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Man, I snuck in

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
$75?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Oh, they're creeping it up

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
So I thought $5 was like

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Look, it'll be half price

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Like half what they paid at Meltdown

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And then we can be twice as bad

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And you'll break even

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
How much was that drink?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay, we'll see

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It was an optional dollar

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, it cost you a dollar

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
There was a jar that made you feel guilty

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
The cost of being a human

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Is a dollar

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
The drink was free

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Otherwise we're under arrest

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It's the Marmot Town, speak easy

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
But thank you, thank you

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
You're welcome here, sir

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You're not mic'd, but you're welcome here

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Alright, well, yeah, I've spent

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
See, I've been doing this thing

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I ran in last minute because

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
But this is really valuable for me

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I started making these little

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Garage band songs and music videos

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
And putting them on Instagram

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And it's been very therapeutic for me

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Because it's not something I'm supposed to be good at

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm not a musician

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Nope

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Wrong, I am, it turns out

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
No, no, no, I'm just making these goofy little songs

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm using only the free software

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And only using my phone

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And my little earbud microphone

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And anything that exceeds that

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Because I want it to be a hobby, not a profession

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
So I'm not supposed to be good at it

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
So it was very relaxing to me

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I was having a really good time

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
And it was churning out these amazing little hits

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
We cannot wait

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
These little loopable...

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
We cannot wait

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
He's quite a wordsmith

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Oh, shit

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay, here we go

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
World premiere

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
It's still my other hobby

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Which is getting this show to the point

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Where I can just play shit

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm falling behind in that hobby

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I can't, it'll take ten minutes of dead air

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But yeah, if you follow me on Instagram

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I just make these little ditties about taking poops

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And being hungover and stuff

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And so I was having a good time

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It would take about two hours to make the song

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And then run around and shoot stuff

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Like knee-pooping and stuff

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And then I'd put it together in Loomah Fusion

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
The IOS is a premier non-linear editor

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
We lost Brandon, we lost him

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It's not a good show

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
No, you can go do it

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
You were gonna make a drink

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
No, we're fine

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
We're fine

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Okay

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
What?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
He was helping

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh, oh, you're picking the thing up

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I want to hear the story

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, don't pick up

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Bad optics

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
All right, so the...

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I'm really relaxed, I'm happy

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Then Cody gets sick

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
She's got like a throat thing or something

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Some kind of throat thing

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And it's like she's quarantined

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
So we can't see each other

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So I'm like, I'm gonna make...

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Thank you, Chris

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
He got the phone to work

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Steve Levy is plugging in the phone for you

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Oh, you plugged it, you plugged in my phone

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Or you plugged in...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
It's my phone, you're on Instagram

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
You're a public figure, that's how it works

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Okay

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
All right

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
That makes sense

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
He got the Spencer shit down

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I've been watching a lot of Star Trek too

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And it really makes me miss Spencer

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Because the relationship between Kirk and Spock

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Is not to endow myself as Kirk

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
But the dynamic between them

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Makes me miss Spencer a lot

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But that show is straight up racist

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
But before you could even be regular racist

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I get a millennial sense

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
It was like, not only...

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Forget about...

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
We'll talk about Nichelle Nichols in a second

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And the treatment of her character

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
And all the women

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
But forget about that

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
We know that the 60s were an unenlightened time

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
And that we are now living in a camelot

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Of progression

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Historians will look back on 2017

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And say they really understood

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
They really got it

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
There's gonna be a hot dog on our dollar next week

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
We might as well just do whatever we want

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
No one's ever gonna see from history

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Which is what you were supposed to be doing

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Through the canopy of fucking Trump

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
You might as well just do whatever you want down here

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Women, I don't like them

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
You guys only heard that

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
The aliens will never hear it

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
They'll be watching him touch a ball with a wizard

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
They're like, these people were fascinated with this man

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Who was so strange and wonderful, I guess

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Because we don't know anything

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Our DNA only has three letters

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And all of them are genius

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And so we have no life

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
We sleep for a million years just to make bread

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Because it comes all the way around

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
They're genetically washed out

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
We conduct people and replenish our DNA with ape man

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And cow anus

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I love this recipe already

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Part ape man, part cow anus

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Try it, blimp flock

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm feeling a little feisty

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Like you could make a coffee table book

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
No, don't be ridiculous

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I am part of the me mards

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Then keep trying and I'll be back with more cow anus

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
But we already tried that

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Shut up

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, Star Trek

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, well whatever, man

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
But I'm saying that show didn't even know

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
That non-white people belong on TV yet

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And it was still racist

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Because they made up a race called Vulcans

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And all they did was bust his balls the whole show

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Because he only had one thing about him

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And he was just like, look, I have one gimmick

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's kind of easy to understand

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
It's sort of my religion

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I have a funny haircut, pointy ears

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And it's associated with the fact that I only deal in logic

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't deal in emotion

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And then they're like, okay, got it

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
So we understand that

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
So at the end of every episode

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
They'd be like, of course, that was kind of feelings, wasn't it, Spock?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And he's like, it's like, why...

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
He's just like, everything in his face is like

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Like, why do you do this?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Why do you...

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Like, when is this gonna get funny?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I can't hear the fucking impish music

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I can only yes and you logically

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I know that's gonna make you even funnier

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Like, what if I...

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
What if Spock was just like, you're right, come on, guys

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Leave me alone!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And then they'd be like, ew

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
And then you'd hear that like flute, that comedic Star Trek flute

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But then they'd stop respecting him, right?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Because he'd stop saving their life all the time

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And he wouldn't be able to throw them through walls

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
But he... I don't know

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
That's how we treated exchange students

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Did you have exchange students in your high school?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Like, there was some kid from a...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
They'd go like, this is Andre

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And he's from...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Germany

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I mean, Germany is the easiest to pick on

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Like, the German ones were the hardcore

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Because the jeans would be too short and too tight

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And there'd be like one ball hanging out awkwardly

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
There was a guy from Barcelona that came to our high school

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I didn't want to say that because I don't want you to think I went to some rich people's high school

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And I don't know, it feels like exchange students

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Like, they come from like warmer climates, maybe you're richer or something

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Like, I went to a shitty high school

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Like, I don't know why anyone from Barcelona would come to Milwaukee

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
But God damn, they must have been so fucking bummed out

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
And then to be in our little 600-kid high school

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
And this brown deer with Scott said

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
And the kids were just like, so fascinated for the first two weeks

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
They're like, hey, say this

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Say, say, meh-ball

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Whatever our thing, you know, whatever our shwiftie

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I tried to change it from shwiftie last minute in the tip work

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I tried to say, just say, goy already

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
You know, like in your high school, you got your little things

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
You go like, Nordflork, and that means pussy

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
But it also means like, the principal's fat or whatever

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
You got your codes

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And then so the kid, you say, Nordfe, say, hey, Andre, say Nordflork

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And he's like, what does this mean, it's Nordflork

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
He said, just now, that's already funny

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
What does this mean, it's Nordflork?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
He asked what Nordflork is

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
That's not actually funny, it doesn't, when you grow up and start practicing comedy

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You find out that doesn't qualify as a joke

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
To confuse someone and for them to seek clarification

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
It's not funny, it wouldn't work if you saw it on SNL

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
They wouldn't, you know, I'm not saying that's a gold standard

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
But they wouldn't say this sketch is ready to go

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah, third grade style, like fifth grade jokes

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
But then they finally go Nordflork

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
And then, whoa, the roof comes off the school

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
And Andre said, Nordflork, and then he says it again

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Like, because either he's gonna play ball

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
He's like, that was a real Nordflork

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
And then you're like, ugh

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
And then that's how we consume people, that's what we do

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
We're just a big, that's what society is

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We're individually, we're wonderful people

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
We're better than the drafts, that doesn't sound like a broken record

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
But the chimpanzee is a beautiful beast

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And we are basically chimps

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
The thing that we created by becoming the perfect chimp

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Which is society, a byproduct

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I would say a wasteful byproduct at this point

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
We're all choking on it

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Society is like carbon monoxide from a car

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Like it's exhaust, society has been created around us

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Or let's say, excess society

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Society you probably wouldn't complain about

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
If you were running through the apocalypto forest

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And there were people behind you going like, you know

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
You don't have a society, so we're gonna kill you

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And then your society came the other direction

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And through the jungle it'd be like, thank god for society

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
But that's just gang shit in a jungle

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Then you start like making things to grind your food

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Instead of it and blah blah blah

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
And then you cut to, you know, the stuff that we're in right now

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Where you're like looking at Twitter and you're getting mad

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Because there's a guy with a shirt that says Buc-O-Fama

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And you're like, you can't swear?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You don't know how to swear?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
What are you, what are you, posh?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
You don't want to, you don't want to sully

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Your fucking forebrain with a profanity?

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It's a free country, say Buc-O-Fama

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
You fucking hillbilly nerd

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I wouldn't want to use the F word

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
But let's just say that person's not human

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Where was I, I don't know how to say I

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm, man, I'm stuck on that superior champ thing

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, well yeah, well that was amazing

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
But then we're done together, we're this biomass

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And what we do is, starting on the playground

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
We see individuals and we start practicing coalescing

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
We go like, oh, what kind of shoes do you have?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't know, what kind of shoes do you have?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Same shoes, same shoes, well that's good

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Your shoes are two the same, well my shoes will be a little bit different

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Okay, well that person's a different shoes

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
They're a little cool, they're a little cool

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And you're forming this little blob

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And then there's the kids, all of whom became my listeners

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Who are in, or like further away from the blob

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
There's never going to be any coalescence

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It's going to be, it's like way over here

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So the blob goes like, whoa!

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Just visiting, not coming over here

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
What's with your shoes

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And you go like, I fail to see the logic

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
And why you're asking the shoes

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Energy!

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
And there was no exchange about shoes and all

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Your soul was just sucked away

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
And the blob goes, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot goes away

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Or the suckers go, oh come on guys

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I'll try a little harder next time

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And kind of follow the blob along

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
But they'll never be a part of, and like

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Those are the people like in Blade

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
That have the tattoo on the back of their neck

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
The thralls, the glyph slaves, the familiars

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
The renfords that will then run out into the night

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Or the daytime for Dracula and go do whatever

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Renf, renf, renf, what the hell was that guys?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Renfield, Renfield, that was close

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh shit, we have a guest, he's standing over there

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Okay, what do you want?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Did you schedule anything for me tomorrow?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It's Memorial Day

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Okay, but I didn't know that when

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, you didn't remember

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I was asked to schedule that day

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Who asked you to schedule something?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Smalls

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Okay, that's writing work

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
No, not Leonard Smalls, who's Leonard Smalls?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I could work with Leonard Smalls if I wanted

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Whoever that is

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So you want me to cancel?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
No, because we're way behind on that

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Well, maybe, look

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
We should do this right now you guys

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
You have a fun dinner tomorrow night

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
We should do this right now

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Because there's no, you know, there's not a guest over there

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Fred, I'll bring you up in a second

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I just got a few calendar items to serve

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I want to clear my day tomorrow

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Respect for one person's time on stage, it's mine

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm a real wizard about it

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
Let's welcome my good old friend Fred Stoller

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I'm already all sweating so I don't want to hug you

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I forgot the water, this is pressure

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, they told me just have fun

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So I'm glad when they remind me to do that

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Because sometimes they don't

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
And you come up here and you cry

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You seem like a guy, I've known you a while

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And you're always a guy that knows how to just have fun

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And go crazy

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Something tells you like, don't try too hard

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Like you know how to do that

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, you were talking about the pressure

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Because they didn't pay a lot

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And when I used to headline and stand up

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Which is very brief

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I used to feel sorry for the people waiting online to see me

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Headline and comedy

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's not confidence

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
I mean, yeah

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, you got to really think you're entitled and you're great

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
So hopefully you could pull up the slack of this

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm not getting into this

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, I'll be here, I'll be here all night

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I always, I felt bad

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
But when you were doing stand up, are you still doing stand up?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Do you still actively?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
No, no, no

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I did it a long time ago

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And first of all, the confidence

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
When I saw the people lining up to see your show

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And I walked by them

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And they had no idea who I was

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
And I'm the whole show

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And he's whispering

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I look familiar is what I got

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
Sometimes I get a, maybe he said a

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
But if I'm lucky

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
People, they come up to me to go

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Where do I know you from?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Right

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And I list my credits

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And if it's a single mom

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Then I do that kid's animation

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Right

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Trying to hit on them like a pedophile

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
You know, hi, I'm Rusty from Handi Mani

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Is your daddy not around?

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Hey, I'm a monkey wrench at talks

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Just ignoring the kid

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And trying to talk to the mother

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Are you a bachelor right now

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And tell me, by the way, I don't know

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
If I'm ever prying or anything

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
You don't have to talk about stuff

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I don't know why

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, I'm like Greg Proops

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I only rift about pop culture

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Nothing personal

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
No, I just...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Does anyone know me?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
No, I...

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I need something

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I think that when people see your face

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
This is the lucky kind of fame I would say

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I would wager there's plenty of people

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
That wouldn't maybe see your face

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And go, oh, that's who that guy is

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
But then when they say

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Where do I know you from?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
It doesn't matter what credit you choose

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Because as soon as you start talking

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
They go, oh, Fred Stoller

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Not into that

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Usually they recognize me

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And they go, I don't mean to bother you

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And I'm so glad someone broke up the isolation

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
That now I'm bothering them

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Right, right

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I go, hey, where are you going?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I've been to the grove before

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
And I'm following them

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
And I'm so lonely

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
The frustrating thing is

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I did one sign, fell just a few raiments

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
And people think I'm rich

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Like they point to the Hollywood Hills

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
He must live up there

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Specifically, show them the exact little apartment

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
There's a new thing called celebrity net worth

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Have you looked up yourself on this?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
No, no

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
It has, you know, with him

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And it's, you know, probably, you know, 18 million

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You know, all that stuff

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
And I'm on it

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And it's very wrong

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It's 1.5 million

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
And, you know, so I've had dates

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
That one woman goes, this can't be right

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Yeah, you have to have more than that

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
So people now look up my credits

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
They see a lot of stuff

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
That would be nerve-wracking

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
Because somebody was in a Twitter spat with me

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
And there must, my income or something

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Must have come up, whether I'm fancy or rich

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Or because it must have been

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So then somebody posted as if, like, spiking a football

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
This link

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I was like, what is this going to be a link to?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Is this how you get, like, Doxt or whatever you got?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And I clicked on it

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And it was this thing, like, yeah

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Like, what are they, worth.org or something like that?

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
It says, Dan Harmon, worth 5 million dollars

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I was like, wow

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, yeah

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Money you don't know about

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
And then I went through it

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I said, I guess maybe if I, like, sold everything

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I guess worth is, like, yeah, it's not liquid

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It doesn't say how liquid are they

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Like, maybe if I sold everything

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
And borrowed money, no

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Like, what Rick and Morty will be worth

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And syndication, they're putting all their money

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Oh, well, yeah, well, jeez

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I mean, if you're allowed to start counting that

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Then I'm Enron, right?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Like, I get to just go

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Because if you get to start counting that

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Then it's like, well, because I'll never see that money

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
However, I do have a stake in it

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
So it's like, sometime when I'm 70 years old

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
In theory, a check for, like, hot topic Rick slippers

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Will come in or something

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
And I'll be like

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Like, it'll be at the right medical technology

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Or they'll be able to just feed those checks into the machine

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That keeps my heart beating

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Ten more beats

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And I'll be like, Mr. Harbin, you're doing great

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You're 70 years old

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Most of your average person lives to 35 today

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Can you hear the gunshots outside?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Can you smell the sulfur?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I love how savvy...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
More money, more rick and money

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
More rick and money

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
He calls it rick and money now

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I love how savvy people are now

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I mean, you are savvy because, you know,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Show business from following him

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But it was at this thing, hey

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
You get good results, you get checks

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
You know, they hear what Larry David, hey

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
They'll see a sign felt that was on

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Hey, checks are coming to you, how much?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
That's my impression of a moron

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Really

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
But answering your question, I used to just stand up

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
And I fell into it during the 80s comedy boom

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Which no one...

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
You were alive or...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
That's how a lot of their parents conceived them

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Both of their parents had an open mind

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
During the 80s stand-up boom

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
And here they are

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
And I was very shy and depressed, believe it or not

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
And now people have different ways to make it

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You go on YouTube, you see this and that

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
But I only knew, like, stand-up someone

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I thought to make it as an actor

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Your parents have to put you in the Brady Bunch

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Only children, and I was another reason to hate my parents

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
For not putting Fred in a TV show

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Like, you fuck

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Like, they knew they were supposed to do that

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
So then I went to...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I guess that makes sense if you're a kid

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And you're thinking about the people on TV

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
You're like, how else would they...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Yeah, you don't know, like I said

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Now there's every, you know, e-harm

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
You know, these links, like this is how you make it

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Like, I probably wouldn't have been a stand-up

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
If I tried now, I don't know what I would have done

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
But you're just savvy with everything

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You'd have been on an improv team

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Yeah, I would have been so good as you could see

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, I think that's because the internet hasn't changed

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Anything about the industry in the important ways

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Like the idea that...

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I mean, that's a ridiculous generalization

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
The internet has changed some things about the entertainment industry

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
But the biggest change is basically

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
The size of the waiting room for auditions

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
Like, that's how I put it

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Like, especially for actors

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Nothing's changed for actors

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Like, oh, how do I get my start as an actor?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Well, you know, you want to say like

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh, just get on YouTube and put on a fresh face

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
And just like...

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
They've been doing that for 15 years

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And all it does is they might as well be doing that

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I mean, they can make a million dollars doing that

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And never get into Hollywood

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Then Google will say, sorry, fartsmart's been shut down now

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
No more fartsmart, I grew up on it

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Well, yeah, it's like people think, Fred

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Isn't there so many more opportunities now?

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Well, no, there's just more bullshit, you know

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
When I came to Hollywood, there weren't so many things

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
But they were like real things

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Like a pot on Murphy Brown

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
You know what I mean?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Or like, amen or something

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It was like a big deal when I moved to LA

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
In the mid-90s, late-90s, it was like

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
A person would get a spot on a sitcom

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
Like, they'd be like, the pizza guy that hits on Dharma

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
But it turns out to be Griggs, a clone

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
No, not clone, why would clone?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I can't even pitch a fucking idea

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I can't get through one idea

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I fucked it up at the end

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
He says, clone, use the same actor, you dipshit

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
You already own that guy

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I've done so many delivery guys

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, so...

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
I've lost it, I've lost it

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
There's so many more quote-unquote opportunities

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
But it's so saturated

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
But we would have parties

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
We would have everybody

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Everybody would show up at that person's apartment

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
You'd have chips and nachos

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Chips and nachos

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Fucking, I'm gonna kill myself

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I'm gonna fucking kill myself on this stage

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Next week

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And I'm not saying that for clicks

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Are you...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Maybe you'll kill and murder yourself

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You'd have cheese puffs and little doodles

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Because, hey, so-and-so, they're gonna be...

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
What, one time it was...

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
On wings, like a guy going, come on through

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
So the guy would come through and be your friend

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
And he'd go, someone ordered pizza

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And he'd go, like, ah-ha

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
And then the commercial would start

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
And you'd turn up the music

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And you'd just be like, you know...

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
When I would do guest spots, my friends would say

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Where were you on it?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Meeting at the beginning, the middle...

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
So how much of that shit do I have to see?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It's like a chore to them, you know?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Because they're flicking back, what's that?

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Don't ask him what's that

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
What's in there?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
I know, there's a gimmick

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
With the people yelling stuff out that I've encouraged somehow

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
That's alright, I'm not gonna be a pussy

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You don't have to be gentle for me

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Usually, if somebody starts yelling something out

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Because they're so concerned about something

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
I find that about 75% of the time it becomes fruitful

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm like, what is this person, you've lost your mind

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
We're talking about ninjas or dolphins or something

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And then they'll keep talking and go

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Do you want to just come up here so that you step

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Routing the show and talking to the microphone

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
And then they come up and then, you know

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Several of them become parts of the show

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And so it's a fun, nice part of the show

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
It's like a town meeting

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
But then I have guests on

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
And then somebody goes like, hold the butter

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
And then I can see your nervous system go

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
That means I'm failing

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Because it does, if you're at a stand-up club

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Like, Kumail, you know Kumail Nanjiani?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Yeah, of course

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
He's like the brightest, smartest, sharpest dude

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
But he has a stand-up DNA

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
So when people talk in the audience

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
I can see his iron giant...

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Like...

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
It's just like, oh no, what?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
What were you saying?

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Oh, so you're saying you're a fucking idiot

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Okay

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And then he just continues

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
And I'm like, okay

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Well, when you trained in stand-up

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Like I said, the comedy boom in the 80s

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Then when I started getting some guest spots

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
We think we're bombing

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Because I come in, Murphy Brown

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Hey, I'm the delivery guy

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Oh, I suck, you know what I mean?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Because it's da-da-da, da-da-da

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
But then you go into the writer's room

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Haven't you worked in writer's rooms and stuff?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Not too many

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
The only thing, I was on Seinfeld as a writer

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And there was no writer's room

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Did you know how Seinfeld worked?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Not really

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
There's...

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I was brought in in the 94-95 season

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Again, before you're born

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And what happened was

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I knew Larry David from the New York stand-up days

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And he would kind of taunt me

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Which...

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Sound like an Indian now

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
You're like a pathetic loser

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
You're like a piece of shit

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
You make everyone feel uncomfortable

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Because you're like a handicap guy walking around

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And they want to look at you

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Your head's down

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
When was it last time someone like you got laid?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
And...

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
That's really what he said to me

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
I was at my friend's surprise birthday party

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
And this became a curved episode

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
He came late

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I want to scream surprise like a fucking idiot, you know?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Alright, I'm in here now

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Hey, not Shrodney

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
He's just Rob Schrab, but 9 octaves lower

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah, so he was...

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Everyone in 94 was writing a spec script

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
You know, for Seinfeld

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
And he was like, you never wrote a spec script

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
And...

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm an idiot

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Because again, people are savvy

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I thought when you wrote on a sitcom

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
You make the salary

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I didn't know that sitcom writing became

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
5 jobs ahead

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Like, the idea is not to

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Hey, I'm going to write on Seinfeld

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
And make whatever the 2000 a week would be

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Sorry, we're at home right now

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Why was that funny? 2000 a week

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Alright, I'm getting them a little bit

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Dan has to get a kettle bottle

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And the ice is completely attached

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I'm thinking, alright

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah, don't steal focus

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Fred's telling a story

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Fred doesn't want to like...

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
And then I've lifted it

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
It's like a fucking Marx Brothers bit

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
It's everything you want

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Dan, what I mean is now people know about...

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
There's nothing more primordial than this

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
The ice to get broken off

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
And what I mean is now people who...

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I forgot why I was playing...

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
You want the liquid out of the bottle

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I don't mean to bash Harvard

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Because you know, it's cliche

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And I'm sure you went there and the community writers

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
But they know...

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I went to dirt

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Alright

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Don't you know that's my issue? You don't

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Because we're both narcissists

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So you don't know, I have class issues

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
That's why I couldn't function in writer's rooms

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Because everybody was from Stanford and Harvard and Yale

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Every time we got into a fight about coffee

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I'd be like, you know...

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Enough of your Ivy League bullshit!

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Well, when I was temporarily on Seinfeld

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Which I'm plugging, I had a Kindle single

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Called my Seinfeld year

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Did anyone hear this?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Well, it made him laugh in one person

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Alright

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
We will be handing out copies at the end of the show

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Well, the actual thing is

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'm happy to see you, but only disappointed

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Because thinking I was going to plug

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
I have a new one and I sent Jeff Davis

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
The PDF of it to save $1.99

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
What it cost

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Thinking he'll be like, hey, it's great

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Wait, I want to make sure I understand this

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
You sent Jeff Davis a PDF of my new book

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Of your new book, okay

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Thinking, you know, go hey

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I don't want him to spend $1.99

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
These things called Kindle singles

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
They're legit

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I know at $1.99 people make fun of them

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And yeah, dudes send it to me

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
And so, could you pretend it's really good

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
For five minutes to kill and you're Jeff

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That book, it changed my life

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I've read a lot of authors

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And this book, your book, the book

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Alright

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Well, I'm positive that it's in any way

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I talked to Lee Daniels about

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Making your book into

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
At least a four part movie series

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
What about Leonard Smalls?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
And Biggie Smalls

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Biggie Smalls as well

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
But when I was on Seinfeld

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
One of the Harvard guys goes

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
To my life, which was just fucked up

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
You know, he goes

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Nothing bad ever happened to me

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I have to make things up

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And I wanted to punch him like

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Now something bad happened

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
These guys were never unemployed

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
A millisecond in their life

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
But they learned how to do the Larry formula

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Of just doing things

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
So basically, there's no room

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
You know what a writer's room is, right?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Okay

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
They can put it together

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Julie

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
So basically

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You have to come up with a Jerry Kramer

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Or Lane, and who's the fourth one?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
George

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
George, I by accident did

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
50 milligrams of an edible the other night

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I'm an idiot

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Yes, and it's still in me

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
So you have to pitch

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
There's no room

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
No one's trying to come up with stories together

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
My analogy, it's like a homicide division

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
We're all trying to sell murders, but our own murders

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
And fuck you

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I'm doing the O'Daniel's murder

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
We shut our door, we don't help you

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
So I'm walking around

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And there's a guy I have a restraining order

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
From, I'm not making this up

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
From my book

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
My Seinfeld Year, check it out

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I talked about some people

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
And I got sued

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
And I have a restraining order against someone

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I didn't mention his name, a writer

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And I called him a pseudonym

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And he would, he lately, when my book came out

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
He would pound on my door

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Fuck you, you ruined my life

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
You know, because

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I haven't worked in ten years

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Because of your book that's been out three years

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You should read my book looking for someone to blame

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Yes, yes

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
So, so he would like

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Bang on my door, leave notes

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
And he had this fixation, we would go and Dr. Drew

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
And, and he'd leave notes

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
We're gonna tell the world what a piece of shit you are

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
And Dr. Drew, that was his manifesto

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Wait, I'm sorry, backup

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Because I don't understand that, you said

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
He had, you were on

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
No, no, no

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
He thinks that I know Dr. Drew so well

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Oh

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
That we were gonna go on his podcast

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
And I would confess

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
What a piece of shit liar I am

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
That is some bullshit

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
He was like, oh, I got this deal

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
You should get us on some Dr. Drew so I can get some money

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
And it gets this episode

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
We'll give residuals

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And I ended to be my mentor

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
So I was on my own and he goes, bro

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
It's like, nah, I'm here, but, but I'll show you

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
The ways, and I was, I made

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Myself look like an asshole for listening

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
To this guy, so I was the one who put

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Myself down in the book that I'm such a schmuck

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I don't believe that you would put yourself down

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
In your book, I feel like it must be

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Another one of these, I'm such a big shot

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Yes, and I don't get the narcissist

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
But in a different way, I get it

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Oh, yeah, you know what I mean

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You know what I mean

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I just felt about Howard Stern

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
And one way he goes, yeah, I'm cool

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Then he puts himself down

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Didn't you see that dichotomy in Howard Stern?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, to me

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I relate to that, but you're a

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Purebred something, like I don't know

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Like you're amazing, and that's why you're

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I mean, I'm jealous of you, because you

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Your voice, like

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
So much of this guy's walking out

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
He's getting that, he's just

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Taking a poop piece of time

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
But no, when you would get up

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
On stage at the

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
When I was

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I was living in Milwaukee, I hadn't moved to L.A. yet

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
And you were the

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
One of the, like, 5, 6, 5

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
There used to be a thing, like there was so many

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Comedy segments, so many of these

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Cable, Evening at the Improv

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Pulpervenza

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Mario Joiner, that you could make

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
A marginal living doing the same set

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Every, you know, on all these

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
The A-list, we called it a list

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Because everyone was on it

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
But you would come out, I mean

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
We were coming out of an age where

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Someone would come up with a hammer on their head

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And say, hey, I'm hammerhead, and people would laugh

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
And then that person would be kind of fucked for 10 years

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
But you weren't one of those

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
But the funny thing is that

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
You were so on point, you were so true to

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Your own voice, that I bet a lot of

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
People think you're doing a character

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Because you would come up on stage

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And the audience would stop clapping

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And then you would say something like

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, I'm kind of, I guess you're probably

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Thinking, I'm like

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Oh, hey, look at the cool guy

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Or just, or like

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
That's why I quit stand-up, because of stuff like that

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
And reactions

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, exactly, that's why I never, but you know

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I'm a bit of a thrill seeker or whatever

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
You had your bits about it

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I drank milk that expired yesterday

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And these all these jokes

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
But when you would say, I'm a thrill seeker

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
The audience would unanimously laugh

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
And that's the thing, that seems to be

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Part of your voice is that you're like

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Like, why is that funny?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Well, because

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
They looked at you and you said

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Something that they were thinking, remember

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Louis Anderson's bit when he would say

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
He would open with fat jokes and then he

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
After he did like three minutes of fat jokes

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
He'd take a pause and then he'd say

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I always have to open with the fat jokes

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Because if I didn't, someone in the audience

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Would be sitting there saying, do you think he knows?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
And

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
And that is like

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
A thing of like, it's about essence

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It's like what Sam Christensen is

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
This class that I took in

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Right here in Burbank? You told me

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And you said you'd guarantee I'd get laid

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
If I took it and you were going to pay

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Did you take it? No, because

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
You didn't pay like you said you would

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
You guaranteed I'd get laid

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Didn't I say, well I'll pay for it

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Maybe he was going to pay for the lay

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Yes

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
He's looking up Sam Christensen

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And yes, know who

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
You know, the thing is

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Like a lot of comedians were insecure

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
But I never learned overcompensation

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Like these scrappy guys

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Hey, I'm Greg Fitzsimmons

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Or whoever, I'm scrappy, hey

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Shots fired

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Mad comic beats right now

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I feel embarrassed

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Yeah, like saying hey

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I'm great and all that stuff

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
So like I said, I got into stand up

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Because it seemed to way, my idol was like

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Jimmy Walker

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I never saw a guy like him skinny, black, funny looking

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I go, hey, don't keep looking at me man

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I know, if I don't

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
If I don't, it's racist

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
You know when you're on purpose

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It's not Dino Mike

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
But

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
He looked away on funny looking

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
But I had to get it because he was

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
You know, he's trying

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
It's like, I

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Can't pitch shows, a few times you do

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You ever try to engage like the third person

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
The show you're not just talking about

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
A really important person, so in this show

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
And then, hi third person

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
We're not ignoring, there'll be

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Three different arc breaks

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
And you're the really important person

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
And I'm talking about

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Is that fourth one

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I went

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
To a show where it was

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Right when the stand up thing

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Gave way to storytelling, so now I was

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Allowed on stage with you guys

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
And like a Beth Lapita's show

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Or something like that in LA

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
And one thing I did was

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Because I'm such a master storyteller

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
That just stuck out my head

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
What the fuck did that sound like

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Now I'm in

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I was waiting for my opening in this world

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It was because of a TV credit

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I'll be frank, but then you're allowed

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
To co-opt to these cabaret shows

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And you have a drink and you say

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
My dad hit me and they're like, that's great

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Here's a drink

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I did one of those

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And it was like me, Marc Maron

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
And maybe like Scott Thompson

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And it was like

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
We almost outnumbered the audience

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And it was like right on that bubble

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Where it's like they must have talked

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
About canceling the show, there's like six people

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Sitting there and then three

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And then the other two performers

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
And I remember distinctly

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
It was such a weird thing that Marc Maron

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
While he was on stage, he coped

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
With the

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Weird sensation of performing

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
To only that many people

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
For the first time that night

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
But he just kept on

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Maybe my laugh was louder or something

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
But he basically kind of did his whole act to me

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
But it really filled me with confidence

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I think I killed with the six people

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Afterwards, but

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I probably went on before him

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And so he was just like, you know what I mean

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
You know what I mean

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Yeah, you need the feedback

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
When you're talking about comedians

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
How they, you know, like

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
A man of the cool

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Memes, the guy, you know, Silicon Valley

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Dinesh, but, um...

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Camille. Oh yeah. Kumail Nanjiani.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Yes, well how, I did some guest spots

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Bob Saget had a show called Raising Dad

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Which sounds funny

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And it was the two kids

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Grew up, Harrison Briel

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And Kat Jennings

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
So Saget and Kenner

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
They were just working

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Paramount had these tours going through

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
And they'd be doing a rehearsal

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And hey, hey, and you know

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
You have comedians and you're doing a scene

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
But they'd work the other people for laughs

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So comedians have that mindset

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
But what you just said about

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Storytelling

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I'm bringing back to the Seinfeld writing

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
So this guy would always say

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I'll tell you when to pitch laughs

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Because you have to approach his door

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And knock and come in and pitch a Jerry Kramer

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Laying a George story and you can't do anything

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Till they're approved and I'd be approaching

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
He goes, not a good time, bro

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Not a good time and I was so insecure

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Everything out on him

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And he kind of ended up sabotaging me

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And so sometimes

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
One thing I learned from

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Writing and so there was no room

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
You're totally on your own

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
The one lesson I learned from writers

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
And I'm sure you could attest to this

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Is when you try things out

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
On friends, people, smart people

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Only try it out on the guy that could say yes or no

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
You know what I'm saying

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Because I tried out things on this day

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
He said, no, no, no, I'm concerned

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
That's not good. Then someone else ended up doing it

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Not because they stole it

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
But because they tried it out

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
On Larry David and I asked these middlemen

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Well, yeah

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I want to interject because

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
And not because there's anything to defend

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Or correct, but because

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I find this fascinating

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
That every show is different

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And I'm surprised

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
To hear that, but like

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
A lot of shows do have just the rooms

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Where the people sit pow wow

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And then there's like one

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Community worked like that

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Because that's how I understood it to work

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Or rather maybe that's what Neil and Garrett

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Who worked on Scrubs and were helping me

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Like run my first show

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
That's the way most like 97% work

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
So you come into work and you sit

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
And then you've got a bunch of

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It's like a police station where it's like

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
You got your

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
What's been going on since yesterday

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
So how is it going in that room

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
In that room and then people kind of go off

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Back to there, so there's always like one person

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Who's working on a draft or an outline

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
There's like a couple people working

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Hopefully if you're really healthy

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
That they're a joke room and they're punching stuff up

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
And then there's a story breaking room

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
No, I had no idea what other episodes

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Were in the pipeline

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
What was going on, you totally

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
So you couldn't do anything

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
One time I made a mistake

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I tried out this idea

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Cramer does a one man show called

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
One Time My Uncle Hit Me

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Like those confessional things

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
So I said that's good, that's good

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
So I'm writing it up and then I bring Larry

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
And I'm like what the fuck is that

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
You don't fucking put things on the board until I see it

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
But Lapis said it was good

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
What the fuck you idiot

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
So you can't

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Is it possible

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Larry David

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
That there's something missing from your translation

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Of him, like maybe he's smiling while he's saying something

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Well

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
He seems to be a joyful guy

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I know he's grumpy

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
One time this happened

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Like a bad guy from Revenge of the Nerds

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Like

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
He just wanted to hurt you

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
One time this happened to me

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
The editing room was next to my room

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
So you can't do anything until

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
The stories are connected

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So I would like, one time I stood outside

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
The room trying to pitch

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I waited an hour and these two aggressive guys

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
From Harvard went right in

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And then they pitched

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And I was so exhausted from waiting

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I went in my room and snapped for an hour

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
So I would go play pinball

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
You know walk around

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
And one time he passes

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
So he wasn't the worst guy

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Because he said something nice for a moment

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
He goes I see you

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
You're not part of the clique

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I see that

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
He goes Jesus

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
That's the nicest thing

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Wait till the story goes

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
He goes you know when I was on Saturday Night Live

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Alright I don't have to

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It's like doing the Norm MacDonald way

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Don't get me started

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
You can't do a story with that

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
You got the three sneakers

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
You fucker

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I think you should keep doing your Larry David

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Alright so he goes

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
When I was a writer at Saturday Night Live

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
My office was right by the elevator

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And all the writers would walk by for lunch

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And not include me

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I see you're not part of the clique

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
He goes so you gotta get aggressive

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
You gotta find me on the floor

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
You look

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
And you throw things at me

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Just throw things at me

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And I went alright

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
So they go hey Larry

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I had this idea

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
There was a guy in that season

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Mr. Pitt

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I don't know if you remember who he was

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
And I said what if he gets into it

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
With Jerry Stiller's character

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
He goes that's a fucking stupid idea

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Alright I did tell you to try things out

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
It's fucking stupid Freddy

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I did tell you

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
But not that shit

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Why did he hire you?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
There's something missing from this story

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I do think it

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
You know Schrab and you know our friend

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Abed

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
So you're saying I'm like Abed

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
No the dynamic

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
You've seen Schrab abuse Abed

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
But he doesn't hate him

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
My theory is that he sees in me

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
What he doesn't like about himself

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Because when he was on Saturday Night Live

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
He didn't like any of those

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The equivalent of Harvard writers

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
But then when it's this thing

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I started and stand up with him

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
And Gilbert Gottfried he goes

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Me, you and Gilbert were the three biggest fucking losers

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
He goes Freddy you're only chance of getting a woman

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Is if you're blind

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Because you're doomed you're a Jew from Brooklyn

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
We went to the same high school

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I don't know you saw something

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
So basically how I got the job

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Was Steve Scroban and if you know who he is

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And it doesn't help in the story

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
He was the one who had the surprise birthday party

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
So in 94-95

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Before they got this influx

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Of the Ivy League guys

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
He would like hire

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Stand ups from his New York days

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
And they would

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And so it's almost like the beginning of Platoon

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Where

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
They go you're going to like the Nam

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Because I had friends of mine

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
That were just

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
They would do the same thing

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
But they had camaraderie

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Four New York stand ups came in

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
And they were totally on their own

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And you weren't sure if you were supposed to start up a story

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
So he kind of got a kick at it

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
He goes you know a lot of shitty things happen to you

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Maybe you could use the shitty things from your life

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
For the Seidfeld episodes

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
So he goes

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
How come you never wrote a spec script

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
He goes write one nothing will happen

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
But I will read it

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
And I wasn't gonna

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Cause that wasn't the route I wasn't smart

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Like I said people now they know

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
What I mean they're five jobs ahead

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Is I thought you know you make a salary

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Now all the guys at lunch

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Were executives from Castle Rock

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
On their next three deals

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
You know what I'm saying I wasn't savvy

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I wasn't even savvy I could get laid as a writer

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I was oh man

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I didn't have time

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
That makes me feel I feel bad

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I don't want to feel bad for you

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Cause I don't want my pity to sprinkle on you

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Throw a pity receptor

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
No no I'll tell you it's all a happy ending

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Because no that was in my route

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I know comics they watched

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
The raw Petrie

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Dick Van Dyke and they wanted to be around a table

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I just wanted to be a character actor

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
You know what I mean

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I didn't know about houses

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And you write on sitcoms

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
You're appealed to me like you know

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
You see the run throughs

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
They're like cows moving on to Jerry's apartment

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
And you see them on the Ratford lot

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
They look like cows you know what I mean

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
They just you know the writers

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I was always jealous of those people too

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I mean I don't want to interrupt your story

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
No so basically what happened was

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I wasn't going to write a spec script

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
But in 1994 there would be people

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Dying to have Larry David

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Read this Seinfeld spec script

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
You know so I said

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Just write one just in case

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Like the next Dan Harmon goes

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Hey Fred do you have a spec script

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I'd have one ready

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Or that Dan Harmon

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Just to have it ready

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And again I'm an old man

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Going back then they didn't have the internet

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And I had to really look

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
For a Seinfeld script to see how it's done

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And my friend helped me with the format

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
And in my spec script

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I used a story based on

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Many years ago

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
When you're old you keep saying

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
My new book I wrote

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Everything is back before the internet

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Back before cell phones

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
And before

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Before there was the internet

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Remember when there was

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Now there's no such thing as a blind date

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Unless your name is like Phyllis Smith

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Because oh there's what she looks like

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
What she makes

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
You know you get pictures, Facebook

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
So someone wanted to set me up with a woman

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
But she was away from where

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Summer and I was so excited

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I wanted to have the visualization to be excited

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I thought of a funny bit where

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
What if I hire a police

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Composite artist

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
To sketch what she looks like to go

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Alright yeah looking forward to that

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
So

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
That was part of the spec script

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And then I once

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
This day I ended up using

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
At Seinfeld I met a woman in London

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And it was unbridled sex

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
This was 1990

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
1996

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
And I remember

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
No 1990

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I remember

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I confessed to her

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I haven't had sex in six months

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I remember when that was so long

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Wow I wish it was that recent

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
You know why we had so much sex in 1990

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
We had no idea how to dress

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Right

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It was 1989 New Year's Eve

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
We were like what are we going to do about all this velcro

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Yeah

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
We can't just start dressing like hippies

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
We will by 93

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
So I put in a storyline

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Where I flew her to LA

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
And it was almost like she

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Gave her a ticket to a woman

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
That looked like her because you flew me here just for sex

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
And if I said what

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Instead of pardon she'd scrunch

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
So I liked the spec script

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Let me show it to Jerry

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
So he liked

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
This stuff and I was brought on

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And just as a quirky guy

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And then I'm brought on

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
To be on screen

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
No no no as a staff writer

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
So that's the

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
So rewinding

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
From that before that

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Spec triumph

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
What were you doing? You were at the office

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
You were being abused by coworkers

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
But you weren't getting paid

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Wait a minute I'm confused

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
You may have been a slave

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And it's illegal

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
You're not getting paid

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I thought you were

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
When you said you're five jobs behind

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
What I meant is that

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
They're strategizing writers now

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Speculating

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
You don't go

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I just got a writing job on community

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You go

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Then I'll be able to

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Pitch FX shows

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
You meant being on

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Staff on a sitcom

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
That's hardly the end of any rainbow

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
But they don't think

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
It was called program consultant

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I'm making 2200 a week

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
No they think Seinfeld

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
They'd be on lunch getting their next deals

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
They're five jobs ahead

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
And the unspoken implication there

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Or maybe I'll put words in your mouth

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Or maybe why don't I just say my own

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Is the reason that's really true

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Is because you could get that far

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
You could have a staff writer job on a sitcom

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
But then both because of what happened to the industry

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
And technology

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
You're competing with

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Aggressors

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
You're competing with professional

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I don't want to undercut

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Everyone that can hurt me in the business

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And everyone that

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I wouldn't want to hurt because I like them

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Because they became my friends some of them

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
But there's a DNA there

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
I always look at it like dog breeds

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Where it's like

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Because there's dogs that are good

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
He's a great joke writer

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
But he's so

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I think a joke writer is that

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
He drives that person and that person's so nuts

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
He has to fax his jokes in from home

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
And that person's

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Not that good a joke writer

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
But they're so

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Like vibrant in the room

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
That their jokes seem funnier

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Like 20%

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
And then these other people who are different breeds

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Like they end up pushing that

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Joke and because there's the

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
There's the breed of

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It's a chemistry assignment

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And I would never want to say it

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Because there's no such thing as a breed of dog

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
That's a good dog or a bad dog

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Unless pugs are evil

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Kidding

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I know that pug owners

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Are driven by their protectiveness

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
That's why I made that joke

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
You can't talk shit about pugs

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
That's the point of that breed

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
It wouldn't exist

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
But for the

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Surplus of protectiveness

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
In the human breeders that bred it

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
It can't breathe unless you Q-tip

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
It's face every three weeks

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It is a dog that is falling

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Apart, it is a pile of dog

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It looks like you spilled a dog

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Their eyes pop out

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
They do

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And what could they ever do

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
A doxened, I'll tell you what

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
They used to use them to clean cannons

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I know every breed

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
They all had a use

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Anyways

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
They were all quivers

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
They would clean them with doxens

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
But pugs

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Pugs are just there so that we can feel

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Angry

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
About people making fun of our dogs

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
The dogs cute for the first two years of its life

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
And they do not age well

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Old pugs

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Are ugly as fuck

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And old pug owners know it

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Pugs were part of an

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Ill-advised program

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
To breed rescue dogs

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
For murder

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
That's how we get a big laugh

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I was like, this is impressive

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I can't do stand-up

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I would have wrote that down on a yellow pad

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
This will kill

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Pugs are part of an ill-advised program

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
To breed rescue dogs

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Laugh, but no

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Because you're breeding them all

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Fucked up as like

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
So you don't have to go to the humane center

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
To find, you know, because it's like

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Oh, the dog has three legs and one eye

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
But no, it's a pug

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
It could be a thoroughbred pug

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It needs your help

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
You made a face like

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
No, stop

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
It also elicits that feeling

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Because if you look at a pug, you go

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
That's me

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I'm not an underdog

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
That's me in grade school

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
It's the little girl dressed as a bee

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
In the blind melon video

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
That's what a pug is

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Because sometimes

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Doxons, you want to be tempted, but you're not

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
No, that's the kid that was into sports casting

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
And so all the basketball players thought he was cool

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Can I kill the momentum

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Of this bit that's killing?

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
No, right?

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
No, I just did

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
A writer's question, which I don't

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I don't know if they care about this stuff

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Do you think it's easier to fake

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Being a writer on a sitcom than

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Like a show like Breaking Bad or Justified

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Like a guy could just be aggressive

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
And loud and throw out jokes

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
He could fake a million-dollar career

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
In sitcoms, but can someone

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Fake that in the world of those drama?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I want to make sure I understand the question

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Because I do want to answer it

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
But I don't understand the question

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Well, it sounds like you were saying

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Or maybe I'm saying that

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
You could fake your way to a nice career

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
In a sitcom at a table

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Fake it just by making jokes

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
And not really being as good a writer

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
But there's more of a skill set

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Is what I'm thinking, those one-hours

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
You can't fake it, you can't be loud

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Then Brian Cranston dies

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Hey, hey, they'll have

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
A stripper by him, ooh, yeah

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I don't want to piss off my friends

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
That work on drama shows

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
But they're a less

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Fraternal bunch, so they probably

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Aren't as easily pissed off

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
And the few I've talked to about this

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Will confess that

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Because when a comedy writer sits

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
In a drama writer, only a matter

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Of a couple drinks before the comedy writer says

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Admit it, it's easier, and they go, yes

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Yes, of course it's easier, there's no jokes

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I knew it, I knew it

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
But you cannot tell anyone I ever said that

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
See, I'm in awe of that

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Like, justified, because I think

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Rayland, like, whatever

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
But I just want to make sure

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Because I didn't mean to imply

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I didn't want to be too cynical

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
And say, just because there's all these

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Feeds of writer

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
First of all, the idea that writers

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Could work as a pack, which is again

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
How my metaphor is awesome

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Is an achievement of the species

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Because writers aren't supposed to be

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Subject to the Henry Ford principle

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
That should have been the death of

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Entertainment, we should have been in

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
The era that we're in now

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
In terms of, like, our definitions

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Of comedy and stuff, way back when

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
The first studios were like, yeah, but

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Can't you make it faster? I don't know

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
And writers

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Were stuck in a room together

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
And just imagine that cave painting

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Of writers being forced to do that

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
And they're the worst

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
They're egotistical, they're defensive

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
They're thin skin, they're thick skin

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
To the wrong ways, they're, you know

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
They're the monsters

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And then

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
They go, fuck it then, we'll have rules

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
For that, and we'll

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
To me, that's analogous with the human species

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
So it's almost like a Seinfeld writer's room

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Or it's more natural

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
It sounds like

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
It was weird

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
You heard that, but

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I think that's probably a successful show too

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
When the stakes get high

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And then it's like you're coming in

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
The army knows what it's doing too

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
So if you come in as a new writer

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
It's not like, hey, my name's Samantha, here's your bunk

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
It's like, fuck you

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Die or figure it out

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
That's what a good pack does

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
But I wanted to bring it

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Around to the fact that, because there's so much

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
My connection

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
To you is the self-abuse

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I mean, you can't stop

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
You just

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
You have a potato in one hand

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And a potato peeler in the other

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
And before you ever come around to peeling the potato

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
You'll be like, fuck it

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
You will be fully peeled yourself

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
When people tell Fred you've been on every sitcom

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
In the 90s, not news radio

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Not Frasier

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I gotta correct that

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's the thing

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I don't even know if it's possible for you

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
To become a douchebag because of that

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Because you're going to be one of those over

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You said in the beginning

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
You didn't overcompensate

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
We know that breed

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
That's a dangerous breed

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
That's 85% of people who

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
The world

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Comedically like guys who were nerds

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And then they go, well, but I was funny

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And then they got that stick that says they were funny

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And then they start using it

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Like if they didn't have that stick

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So it's a weird thing

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But it's like, well, if you're fucking a victim

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And someone gives you the power

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Because if they like watching you be a victim

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It's hard

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And your voice, you've always had

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
That voice, you've always been

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
That guy for real

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And people have always been drawn to it

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And some people are even drawn to abuse you

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Because, yes, Norm MacDonald, when I opened for him

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And let's not go there

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And I'm just kidding, no, they're booing me

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
They're doing something they don't know

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
You know, that didn't happen, Fred

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
No

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Like a guy like Dom Herrera

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Even they want to fucking abuse you right now

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Like a guy like Dom Herrera

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
No one's going to bully him because I think

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yeah, I see there's a morning

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
There's a guy, I'll tell you later

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But I don't want to turn on this crowd

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Why don't you do that, Fred? It is sweating

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
No, see, I grew up

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
There was no such thing as nerds

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
They were nebishes, sad sacks

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Or, like, cool

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And it's like, you know, now

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
There's a lot of comedians now

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
There's Shlubby

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And, you know, this guy

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Good guy, Matt Myra

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You know who he is? He's a great guy

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
But if he was in the 80s, hey, I'm a Shlub

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But it's like, hey, yeah, you're not a loser

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Hey, you know, so it's this pop culture

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
You know, I'm like being a nerd

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Is referencing Matt Myra

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But, you know

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So I'm like, yeah

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Like, when I did stand up

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
There was no thought that I want to do it to be cool

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Furthest thing

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It's embarrassing being cool

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
So now it's sort of like

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
The old nerds that were picked on

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Someone said, the nerds now are like the bullies

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You know

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I remember back in the 90s, when this was starting

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
A Bobcat Goldthwait

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I'm stealing his line, all these, like, Largo people

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
He goes, they're all so cool

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Like, cancel each other out

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And, uh, so

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yes, so nerd became

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Cool, and I resent that

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Well, yeah

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And you should, and then there's

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Like, Andy Kindler, who is awesome

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
At moving with that resentment

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And maybe that's not your essence

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Like, maybe, maybe, maybe

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
But Kindler, I have a problem with

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Shots fired

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I have a problem with him

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I already went on Marc Maron

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Did five minutes of why he bothers me

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Now, he's a great guy, he's hysterical

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
He would do these alternative

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Rooms, and it's like

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Aye, aye, aye, I'm nervous

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
It's like an old Jewish guy

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Why is this alternative, you know

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
It's like, there's a guy Bruce Smirnoff

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Who's like a Jewish guy

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Aye, it's very guns and knives

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Aye, yes

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So Kindler, why Mrs. Herald

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Has this alternative

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Guy

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
This rebel

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Who is the biggest schmoozer

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Oh, no, he's a great guy

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
No, I already teased him about this

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But you know what I'm saying

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
You know what it is, my mother once said

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I don't like pushy, nervy people

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Because I resent them, I wish I could

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Be pushy and nervy

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
So I resent Kindler because he could schmooze

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
He's good at it

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I wish I had their

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Abilities sometimes, I mean

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
How many times have you been cut off in traffic

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And there's some small part of you

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That's like, god damn it

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That person's winning it life

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I've never cut anyone off in traffic

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Which means that I have spent

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So much more of my life

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
In fucking anxiety and thinking about other people

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Than I needed to

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Because that person clearly never thinks about

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Fucking anything

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And had that time for Pokemon or something

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Yes, yes

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And I don't, it's never like

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I'm

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I just want to

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I want to make sure

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
You understand

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And I think you do

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I do, I don't

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Don't feel bad for me, I'm happy

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Because I could never survive in a writer's room

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
But let's forget about

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's a feel right

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Forget about pity and bad

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And feeling bad and all that stuff

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I want you to know

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Like how prudent it is

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
How strategically

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Justified

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It is for you to stay who you are

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Because it ends up paying

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Big money

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
It ends up paying more

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Whether you have to

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Well, it's just about what you can live with

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And no, I consider

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
When I was younger

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It was more like comparing myself

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Why aren't I this

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
But it's really so liberating when you get older

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
When you're out of the games of women

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Trying to meet women

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And trying to get pilot season

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
When it's sort of over, now I can do what I'd like to do

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I'm too old a guy to be pitching

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
On my own show

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And it's so liberating

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
As I told you when I saw you upstairs

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I was dreading seeing you

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Because I haven't seen you in three years

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And everyone that I haven't seen in three years

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Is going to make me feel like I'm 90 years older

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Because we're all melting at a parabolic rate

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So I was like

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I was telling my girlfriend about you

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And like, oh, I'm going to see Fred

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And she knew who you were by reputation

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And stuff like that

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
What the fuck does that mean?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I have a reputation

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
With a girl you talk to

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
What the fuck are you holding out on before?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
But no, I was talking

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
To her about you and I

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I was like, you know, he's Fred Stoller

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And I was doing my impression of you

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Because you're fun to do an impression of

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I'm sure that makes you very happy

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Especially when Tom Kenny gets extra money

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Of voiceovers

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And then I stopped a little

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And I got really scared because I was like

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Oh, Fred's

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Fred, you could

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Draw on a cave wall

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Even if you hadn't gone to art school

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Inside and out

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Fred is so specific

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And so archetypal

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And now I'm going to see him

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And there's going to be something

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Is going to spoil that for me

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It looked like Christopher Lloyd

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Something that was equally beautiful

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But if I'd known you for 20 years

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
As the other thing, I'd be like

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Time can suck my god balls

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Whatever

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
No, it's still

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I sound like Billy Crystal

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Doing that Fernanda Lama's character

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The idea that you look good

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And that's supposed to make you feel good

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I'm saying, why would you

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Not be pitching your

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
No, I've tried

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But I'm the weird older guy

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That's the point

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
It's point of view now

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The game is not to

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
350 million people go

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I had an idea for a web series

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
They like the idea, let's do it

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
A web series to go

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Can you get some YouTube stars

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Any time I've tried

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Who do you know that's more famous than you

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Who are your friends

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Can you bother Fred Willard again

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
No, no more bothering Fred Willard

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I always bother him

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You used to call me on the phone

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And there were still landlines

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And I was trying to write Monster House

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And I was doing a lot of cocaine

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And I think it was because

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I just found out how easy it was to buy an LA

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And it was so hard in Milwaukee

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And I was like, I don't even like Coke

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
But now it's so cheap

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And so I just had the CD case

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
There were these things called CDs

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
You turned them and listened to them

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
With a laser needle

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And it was covered with

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Coke residue

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And then I'd be trying to figure out

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Why a house would be a monster

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You'd be calling me because we had just made friends

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And you were like

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The idea that I was the

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Paragon of confidence for you

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Was, says a lot

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Because you're calling me for advice

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I'm like, what is this matter for

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
You're like, listen

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
What do you do when you park

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
In a grocery store

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Do you look for the park

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Because I've been driving

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I went to the store

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I just drove away

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I couldn't handle the pressure anymore

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You couldn't handle the pressure

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Of parking at a grocery store

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And you called me

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
No, you

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Intimidated me because the last few times

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I bumped into you were really like

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Angry Dan

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Intimidating

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Larry David

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
No, you were nice to me

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But there were these stupid nature

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Half moon walks

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
The full moon

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I just had a fucking get laid

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And like

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I was in a bad place

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I was like, yeah

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I'm fucking this bitch

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I didn't say bitch

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
But that helped a little bit

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
That helped to laugh a little bit

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
You were so brave

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I would have said

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I'm gonna have sex with this girl

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
That was the mode I was in

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I bumped into her since

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And I was so jealous

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
She was sweet

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And you said

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I'm just here to fucking get laid

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I don't think you said fuck

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But you said to get laid

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Fuck all this, you know this nature

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
But no, you're great

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I was in a phase at that time

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
But you were acting like the asshole

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And you were getting laid

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
There was a girl that told me

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And this is not negging

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
This isn't that red pill shit

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I had come into my own

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
The justification in my head was

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
For about a year

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I was a pig

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But not like

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I don't think I was abusive

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I was a pig

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
One woman said to me

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Which I will always remember

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It actually summed up exactly what I was doing

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And she was a customer

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
That was explaining

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
This is why I stopped and bought this fucking soup

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That made me sick

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I was like, oh that's what's on the label

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I spent so much energy

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Trying to catch guys

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And their red flags

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And you wave yours like a matador

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And that's what it was

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And it wasn't

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I want the kids to know

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I want these millennials to know

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
First of all, I said that was a year

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And I almost killed myself

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And I was miserable, I almost burnt my apartment down

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It was a bad time, I'm also not saying

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Don't ever do that, do it

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
But that is not

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
The same as this, because these are weird fucking times

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And that shit is kissing cousins

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
With some ideologies that have to do

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
With hurting other people

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
In order to like

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Reverse psychology

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
The baseline

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Is total aid

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
If you meet somebody at a party

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
That just says

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I'm very lonely, would you like to make out later?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Like

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
He's not

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
That guy

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
You have a reasonable time

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Like

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Because then you're playing money ball

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
With statistics

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I resent the fact that that

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Bleeds into this other

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Camp that's about

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Taking it back from women

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Who never took it away

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
That's why I want to

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Put a big fucking fat asterisk on that

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
But I was going through that phase

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Where I was like

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I was just going on dates a lot

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
For the first part of my life

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Every girl I talked to that I was attracted to

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I was trying to be in this zone

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Where I'd be like, I'm very attracted to you

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I would try not to

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Snowplow them

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I got a lot of

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Like fucking humiliating

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Eye rolls, I'm like walk away

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Really, you'd say that to me

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
But I'd be like, I'm very attracted to you

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And I'd like to make out with you

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Now that you don't need those lines anymore

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Can we hear one of them or

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
No, he intimidated me

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
At the Super Bowl parties

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Super

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Joe Hodgson things

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
That's some people for 15 years of their life

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Some people die

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
At 65 years old staying that way

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You hear the humanity in him talking about

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Trump and all this stuff

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That's why I was in his intimidated

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I feel I need to do a

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Star Trek joke to get you back

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Because I can't believe you

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You told these people everything about

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Dan, now I see why Larry

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
David fuck with you

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
People think I'm an easy

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Mark, but

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I got sued by this guy

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And I didn't get bullied

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I didn't get bullied with the guy with their straining order

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I pushed him away

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
What happened with the end of that

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And he

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
To give him credit

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
He didn't know it was illegal

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
What he was doing

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
To threaten you and intimidate you

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
To bang on my door, leave notes

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And say let's go on Dr. Drew

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So when you say

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Restraining order

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Did you file it or did he file it?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
This is the funny thing

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I filed the restraining order

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Some friends

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Served him

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And then a few days later

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
He serves me with one

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Saying

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I can't go near him because I'm threatening him

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Wait, so I could get arrested

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
If I'm in my own hallway where he lurks

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
If he gets this restraining order

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
You're describing Cape Fear

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yes, yes

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It's like competing radiuses

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Did anyone ever file for restraining order

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That room you go to downtown

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I feel like there's probably two people

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
At least in the room that have

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It was weird because there's all different types

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It's probably not a fun situation

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Minorities, all different people, rich, poor

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And then

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
We had one hand up

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Would you be willing to talk about

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Your restraining order?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Okay, would you like to come up please?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Ha ha ha

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
See, that's

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Happy Memorial Day

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And you had to go to a place

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Downtown where you wait with all the people

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Oh, what happened?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Check

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
If you're listening to the

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Live free Wednesday podcast

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And my mic was bad for the first

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Half of the show

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
We've replaced it

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Have you seen Breaking Bad?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I've seen Breaking Bad

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
So my dad was like a Jewish Walter White

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Sorry, what's your name, sir?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Ori?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Keep the mic like kissy distance

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Wait, your father was a Jewish anything?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
No, no, no, you got to turn your head

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
At the same time

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
You had one job, one job I gave you

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
One job

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You think I'm sitting like this because I'm comfortable?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Ha ha ha ha

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Um, so yeah

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
My mother

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
A Jewish Walter White

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
In what way?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Well, he sold crystal meth and women

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Welcome to the newest guest

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Of Harmontown

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
He'll be controlling from now on

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Was he a chemistry teacher?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
No, he was a car stereo and alarm salesman

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So he went from pimping cars

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
To pimping women

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
You don't hear Jews as pimps

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
No, I'm a handler, I'm making fun of

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
A Jewish pimp

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I'm just so distracted by the math

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Of my head that he sold crystal meth and women

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
So he had both

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Yeah

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And he wasn't done?

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Well, I mean, he, don't forget car stereos

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Oh, okay

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
He saved car stereos

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And could never get them

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I mean, his trinity was

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
He would get hookers to sell crystal meth to guys

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Oh, you ain't got to tell us

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And then they would fuck the guys

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And then do the math

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And then when the job was all done, they'd smoke the math

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And then the math would make them clean

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So that everything would be spotless

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
The meth would make them clean?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Well, you know, because meth makes you all like

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Clean like a maid

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Oh, clean the house

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You're about to buy a shit ton of meth

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
You'll be like

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Meth can make me clean

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I would like to try some meth

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I'm so dirty

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Just got to get that colonic

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Oh, my God, yeah

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
By the way, Levy is obsessed with colonics

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I am not obsessed

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
He keeps asking me

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
To get one because he wants to

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I was driving the car the other day

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And I go, Levy

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I order you to

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Check out getting a colonic for me

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
And he was like

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Really? Okay

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I know what's happening

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I'm more curious if I actually got one

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
If you

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
No, no, I think

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
For me, I would only do it

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
If that meant you absolutely had to do it

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It would

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
We support you

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I don't want to do it

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
What do you mean you don't want to do it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
You keep bringing it up

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Can we get back to hookers

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And meth and car stereos

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I'm trying to learn something in this motherfucker

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Now he runs a rehab center

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Off of Melrose

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Now he runs

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I don't care about him cleaning himself the fuck up

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I want to know

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
What was your restraining order for

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Because he was doing a lot of meth

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And that's not good for a grown child

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
So how old were you at the time?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I was like 16

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So did you have to go to the police department

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
No, I wasn't minor, my mom had to go

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Because the DEA came into our house

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And they were like, hey, your dad's doing some shit

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Why do you need a restraining order

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
If the DEA has already taken him away

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Oh, no, they were looking for him

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Oh, and he may come back

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Is that a friend of yours

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Or one of your dad's bodyguards

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I have no idea

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
We just got killed by a Sicario

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And what ended up happening to him

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
In your relationship with him

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
That's why I'm back in LA

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I came back to work on a relationship with him

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
You should have him on the show

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I would

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
If there was a story we thought we could track

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
That would be worth clicks

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
What has changed

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Has there been an arc in terms of you or him

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I mean, basically

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
From when I was a kid, like 16

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
It all started happening

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Slowly but surely I found out what he was doing

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
He was in jail, he had a kingpin

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Jewish kingpin

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
That was made for me in jail

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Oh

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Wow

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Yeah

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Did you just say anything for you in jail

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Wow

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So, but you're saying

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
What's changed is the experiences

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Humanized you, at 16

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
It was so volcanic

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Yeah, it was traumatizing at that age

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You got out of there because you're a survivor

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Can you ask how old you are?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I'm 25 now, yeah

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Okay, so I can ask how old you are

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
You're a young prick

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And he's got weed in his pocket

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But as a functioning adult

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
This is very admirable

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
25, I'd still be paying my rent

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Off my anger at my dad

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I mean, he's being adult child

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Support basically right now

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
You're looking back and you're going like

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
But who's the guy, is he in jail now?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
No, now he's running a rehab center

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
There's so many Jewish and adult people

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Like get off the streets

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
There's so many Jewish kingpins

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I like the placement of the and there though

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Other Jewish and adult people

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Off the street

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
So if you're Jewish

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
You could be a third trimester fetus

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And addicted to crack

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Right

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So that sounds like

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I didn't want to force that narrative where it's like

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So he's clean now, so it's time to repair

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
But it sounds like he is clean

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Because he's running a rehab center

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So it's time to revisit it

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah, well no, let's have him on

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Tell him your podcast

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Wants to talk about fathers and sons

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And all that shit

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
If he wants to come on, for sure

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Who, what about

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
My stained glass company?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Well, it's not very interesting

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
No, I think that's

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Who am I arguing with

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
In my head

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Why do I always sound like I'm defending myself

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Who's attacking me

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
My girlfriend woke up this morning and she went

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Oh, baby, and I went

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
What, what now?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And she went, I have a headache

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And I went, oh my god, I'm so sorry

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I was so fucking ready

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
For women to attack me in the morning

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Like what am I, a fucking like

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Weird cyborg?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I have so much neurological work to do

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Do you believe in neuroplasticity, Fred?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I never heard of it

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
But now I do believe in it

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
This is when your brain can change throughout time

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
No, I late in life I got into weed

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Because I do believe that

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And I tried mushrooms and it didn't work

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
But I believe things could be better

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It didn't work like nothing happened?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Well, yes and no

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Do you want to hear this story?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Yeah

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Is Larry David in it?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
No wrong answers

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Alright, I'll try to make a long story short

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I got into edibles

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And I like them because I have realizations

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Revelations where something hits you

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And it's like in a visual

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Wow, and I had a breakthrough

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And now I won't go back

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
You know what I mean?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And I love that someone goes

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
You really get that on mushrooms

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Alright, I want to

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So you always crave that

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
See, this is an important thing

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I'm opening the cut

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I feel an energy from you

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
When I interrupt you and do my prattling

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That you're like Jesus Christ is talking

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And I'm on a fucking track

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I want to get back to that thing

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So that I can get back to the thing I was talking about

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I love him

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I'm trying to show I know stuff

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Hey

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Over the garden wall

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I was in that

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
The idea of

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Realizations, yes

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You don't have anxiety about a bad trip

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Or anything like that

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I've had paranoia

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
But

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Well, it's like anything

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It's like if you're in a very bad state

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
It's going to compound it

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
A thousand percent

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Like the loneliness, the isolation

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I got dumped on acid once

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
By your dad

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
No, no, by a girl

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
It was very confusing at the time

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Yes

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
This is something that no one would ever assume about you though

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I guarantee you that

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Because the average person

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I think I'm so neurotic about it

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The average person doesn't do ayahuasca

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Or mushrooms because of the Fred Stoller voice inside

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
So to find out

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
That Fred Stoller

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Who has that voice

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Is like, yeah, no

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I just don't know how to get it

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
What happened?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Did you buy it at a store?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
How do you park there?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
How do you keep people from judging you

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
When you're trying to buy ayahuasca?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Again

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Being the old guy in the 80s

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
The few times I did weed

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
The Fred Stoller neurotic guy

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
My throat hurts for three weeks

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
My sore throat, I'm dizzy

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And I don't like alcohol

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Because of the Fred Stoller neurotic guy

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I wake up dry-mouthed

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Three hours later, I'm doing an oppression of myself

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I don't like it

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So I thought weed was like

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Hey, man, did you move the car?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
No, I forgot

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I don't want that

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
So, you know

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Like, you know, Brian Posein

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Hey, man, hey

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I like comic books, yeah

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm a stoner

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So that's what I thought weed is

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Just from your observation

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Of other people from outside

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You're like, I don't want to be like that

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
But you found out

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
But then I found out someone said it opens your mind

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So it's got more sophisticated

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I think in the 80s when I tried it once or twice

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
It was just anything

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And I smoked it, like I said, sore throat, paranoia

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
But then, you know, you see on the news

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
You know, the legalization

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
There's actually different strains

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Yes, and someone said it opens your mind

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So, and then I listened to Sam Harris

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Who, not the guy who

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
No, you know who he is

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
And he's saying

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I read the book on tape

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
One of his that he's got daughters

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
He goes, I wouldn't like if they did

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I'd be concerned if they did meth

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Or crack, but I would want them

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
To try

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
It opens your mind, and I started thinking about it

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
So, and I then

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Did some edibles

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And yeah, I'd have things

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Where I think I have a funny idea

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
That never makes sense

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
But I really felt

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
And I even would meditate

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
You have a breakthrough where

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
It's a visualization where you got something

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And once you got it, I can't go back

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
To what that was

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So someone said mushrooms is better

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And it wasn't

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
It wasn't, it didn't work on you

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Come on, something happened and it took mushrooms

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Okay, tell us a story, sorry

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Yeah, Ory

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Just checking if I remember the name

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Someone, a very sweet

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Buckle up

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
The lights are warmer up here

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
A very sweet woman

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Who I don't want to put down

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
She reached out

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
She has a boyfriend, but you know

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
She's seen me on things, hey

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
You're an interesting character, and I like you

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Not like me that way, but she said

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And I, you know, she saw me on

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Some podcast talking about weed

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And no, she does weed

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So she met me and she got me a $40 top

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Joint thing

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
She saw you on the podcast

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Doug loves movies, other things

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I didn't do Doug loves movies

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
A lot of podcasts have live video feeds

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Now for $5 a month, you can subscribe

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Is there one that you might know of, offhand?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Yeah, no, the one where you smoke weed

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Yes

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
With Doug Benson

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And again, that's another guy

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
You don't think of him as breakthroughs

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You know, so

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
But she goes

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Talking about that, I go

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
I'd like to do mushrooms, but how do you do it

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
She goes, I'll get you some

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And we'll do it

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Can I interrupt here?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Yes

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
She's local, she's in your life physically

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Or are you connected with her online?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
She sort me out

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Through Twitter or whatever the hell

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But it wasn't like a catfish

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Because we had mutual friends, so it wasn't so psychotic

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I just want to know

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Is she a person

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Like, because

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
I'm trying to figure out

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Who she is?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
No, I'm trying to figure out

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
How much of this was like

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Your anxiety was mitigated

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
By this person

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
That was drawing you in

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
She trusted her

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I trusted her

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And this is how you met her

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
But then you were going to meet her

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Yes, we met and she had the joint

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And we talked

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And I said I never did that, I'm curious

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And I had a birthday

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
A few months ago where I'm tired of every

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Birthday you sit around with eight friends

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You know, yeah, yeah, my friends

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And the check comes, you know, I want to do something

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Adventuresome

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
So I said, I want to do mushrooms

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
And

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So then

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
There's a

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
That's your description of a birthday?

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I mean, by no means do I

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Claim that birthdays are fun

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
But

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Your description of a birthday

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Oh, it gets more ridiculous

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Would make Vinogat kill himself

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Yes

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Sit around a table

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Seven to eight friends

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I'm older, the check comes

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And everyone's dipping it off

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
It sounds like the way a rock

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Would describe

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
DNA

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
You shape yourself different, then you reproduce

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It's always the same restaurant

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And it's the same eight people

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
They're all very nice

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I'm always alone

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Yeah, and no significant other

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So basically

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
So I said I want to do something

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Crazy, you know

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
So there's another

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Female comedian

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Who once in a while, she heard about the edibles

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
She goes, let's do edibles

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
She texts me and I go, well

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I want to try mushrooms, yeah, let's do that

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So I wanted to bring her there

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
So it's three of us

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I don't want to be uncomfortable

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And be sexual

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I thought it's like ecstasy

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
You're kissing

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Which ecstasy isn't, just so you know

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I just did it with

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I haven't done it with you

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Ecstasy is like

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Synthetic mushrooms

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
It's like mushrooms with a salary cap

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Is this being homophobic

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
If I say

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I was afraid to do mushrooms with a friend

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Because I thought, oh, you start making out with a guy

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
You make out with whoever you're with

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
No, not that guy

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Okay, well, so

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
That's poppers

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So they're what

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
It's like, but you weren't afraid

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Here, let me show you

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm a hypocrite, right?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Where would you get that from?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I can't even finish

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Because of my self-loathing

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I can't finish my question, but for your answer

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I'm saying

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Here, let me lay out

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I was hoping the woman that has a girlfriend

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
May be something with her

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
When I was in my 20s

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I think if anybody said

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
This is mushrooms

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
That's why I did mushrooms

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That's why I did acid

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Because I was in my 20s

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And when you're in your 20s

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
You're just driving into trees

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Because you're like, why can't I die?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
People just

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Hand you pizza and go

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Going out for three days

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And you're like, why not four?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Because you can't wait

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
To feel pain

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And you will someday

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I got food poisoning

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
At one point in my 30s

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Everything

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I had bad trips in my 30s

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But when I was in my 20s

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
That's when I feel like my roster of drugs

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
That I was willing to do

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Was completed

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Because it's like the map of the world

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And stuff

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I'll never try heroin

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Because I made it to 30 without doing heroin

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Thank God

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I'll never do it

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
This is what

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
But the fear

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
The Fred Stoller voice inside of me

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
That would not want to do mushrooms

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Wouldn't want to not do mushrooms

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Because I'd be afraid of anything that would happen

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Because of a successful mushroom

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It would be afraid of an unsuccessful mushroom

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
People reassured me

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Okay, so this is what happened

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
The woman said, I'll be a mushroom coach

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I'm here for you

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I was a trip advisor, that's fun

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
She goes, if you're freaking out, I'll take you aside

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So you've been told this drug represents

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Such a threshold

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
That the worst case scenario

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Was women taking care of you

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I'm starting to come around

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
This is what I was seeking was like

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I'm not judging you

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You're still bolder than me

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Because you're outside of your

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
The fact that the story starts with you saying

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I want to try mushrooms

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I just wouldn't have done it

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I would have looked for

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Well, again, I like the realizations

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I'm very into meditating

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And Duncan Trussell

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Got me into Ram Dass and all this stuff

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Ram Dass ain't no joke

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Yeah

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
You know who he is?

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I know who he is, he ain't no joke

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Bro

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
He's not saying to be fucked with

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
You know about my book

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
You can go back two episodes and he cedes

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Ram Dass ain't no joke as a runner

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
For no seeming reason

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
You're a time traveler, aren't you?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
You set yourself up for a callback

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You're Marty McFly

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
The reason I do

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Ram Dass ain't no joke made no sense back then

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And now it's a callback

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Everyone go back

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Everyone stop listening to this episode

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Go back two episodes

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
He said Ram Dass ain't no joke in this weird voice

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I bought it though

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I'm getting drunk, sorry

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
The reason I'm doing it later in life

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Is I don't have any guilt

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I fucked around my 20s, 30s, 40s, my 50s

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It's like I tried my hardest

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
To meet women and write

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And do the career

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And you made it to now visit

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
You look fantastic

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
That's layering in why I was mentioning that

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
You have the American dream

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
You may as well put your dick under a bulldozer

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
When Edible works right

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
When I'm lying in my bed

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
It's time to find out you're into anything

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yes

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Was it a tea?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
So this is what I thought

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
They said you can't do mushrooms

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
In your apartment

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
You gotta be on the beach and beautiful

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
In Malibu

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
So she said you gotta get a room

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
So I rented a room

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And that way we could go out

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Come back in, yeah sleep

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
The morning, wake up

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I spend my money

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And I'm not that rich on a place in Malibu

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
For the night

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And she goes okay I'm your mushroom coach

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
If it gets too much and this and that

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
So me, her and

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
The third very nice woman

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
We go to a

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Check into the hotel

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
It's like that candy wrap

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You wrap it in

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
You know what I'm saying

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I don't know, the taffy

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
You're just describing cellophane

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
They made like a mushroom taffy

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Yes, so

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Right away I'm throwing some things off

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Cause I'm eating it no problem

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Shit the mushroom coach is saying

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
So then we go

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Across the street to Malibu

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And right away it hits her

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And she's lying in the sand

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And I'm picking her up

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And this is the coach

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And this guy

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
The only thing that hit me

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
The guy who owned the house was Martin Sheen

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Cause I know it's in Malibu

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And he's looking and there's a girl lying in the sand

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And they're just gonna throw up

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And he's on the phone and go you gotta get out of here

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
So I'm not really feeling anything

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Wait I'm sorry, is it the track

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Martin Sheen is it just something that leaps into your head

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Because you know

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Maybe I was a little paranoid

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
That's the only paranoia

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
The only one I knew was Martin Sheen

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And he's there and he's on the phone

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
You're imagining in your head Martin Sheen

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I doubt it

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I think that might be Fred Stoller

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Picking up a phone

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And it's burning in the sand

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And I'm trying to lift her up

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So the other woman ran off to get water

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
She said she's gonna throw up

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
So like

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So then the only

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I think I did it for fun

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I pretended we were like Dee Dee on the beach

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And she was a wounded soldier

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And I have to get her back to the hotel

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So she's the coach and I'm escorting her

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And we're just taking her

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And then

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
All of a sudden I start narrating it

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
People are walking by

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Look at these people

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
They have houses and lives

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
And they're dogs and they're kids

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And I'm the 59 year old guy

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
With two women trying mushrooms on my birthday

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And I'm saying that out loud

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And people are walking

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
So

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
So then you notice a tunnel that goes from the beach

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
You know in Malibu to this

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
So she couldn't take it anymore

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
She's gonna throw up and she's worthy

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Is that the word on the floor

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And then this guy comes by

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
With his family and goes

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
What's wrong? And I go

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Oh she got nauseous looking at the water

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
And he goes

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And he goes

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
She got seasick on her beach

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And that has nothing to do with the story

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
But I have to say it, he goes

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Don't go on a cruise then

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Don't go on a cruise

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
You can do the voice

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Yes

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I miss that you were waving

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
By the way, he's like

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Because that's the punchline of the story

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Don't go on no cruises

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
That's not your black guy boys

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Can I do it? I'll do it

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Don't go on a cruise then

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Motherfucker

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Awful

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I don't know

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I assume that he grew up in Pittsburgh

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I was trying to

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Make a shady spot

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
So that he could have a picnic

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I thought I'd take the hit

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
I thought I'd create a racist canopy

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
So that he could be like

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Here's what he really sounded like

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I'd be like that's great

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Like the waves in Malibu are so crazy

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
You look at them, you can't walk

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
You have to have two people escort you

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
So then she

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Oh I forgot this part, the mushroom coach gave good advice

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
If you need to have a bowel movement

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Do it before it kicks in

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So that was an erotic Jew in me

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Andy Kiddler

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Oh I gotta make

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Did I not go?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Is that just because taking a shit on mushrooms

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Will make you feel like you're the universe's

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Asshole?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I'm trying to figure out why that is

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I love that that's a document

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
That's like

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
That's as clean as like

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Throw the grenade, not the pin

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Take a shit

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Before the mushrooms kick in

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I guess I understand that

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Your turd will be infinite

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I'm having to go and you're tripping

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It won't work, I don't know

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So then she goes I gotta shit

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I gotta throw up, so here she gave the advice

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
So she goes get me back to the room

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
So get out

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I need the room

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
So we leave her there

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And she's probably doing what she's gotta do

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
And then my

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
The phone battery died

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I go to charge it, get out of here

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Stone opened the fucking light

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So we had to stand by

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
The door

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I'm with you

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
The entire way

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
There's people attacking you now

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I would try to come in the hotel room

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I paid for to charge my battery

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
And she goes get the fuck out of here

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Who said that?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
The mushroom coach

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Now known as the deuce dropper

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
She was freaking out

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
She was freaking out

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
She was okay

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
We were both like

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
We were standing outside the door

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
And we're not allowed in

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
So we couldn't, I guess it didn't work

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Cause we were like we gotta save the coach

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
So I didn't have any great

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
The only realization I had

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Was the comedian I was with

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I go you look like Bonnie McFarlane

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I would never

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Realize that

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
That was the only thing

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
That I realized

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
But you did live through

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Although no one would pay

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Money for this

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
The experience of oh what would I do

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
If I was in charge of a person

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
That I thought was supposed to be in charge of me

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
That's a fucking valuable experience

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
No I felt very proud in machismo

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It's not birthday valuable

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I would have you have a better birthday

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
No

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
She's a sweet woman

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And she was very ashamed

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
And

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
So the woman

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
The other woman who was okay

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
She has a girlfriend

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
That said get down to wherever she lives

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Where does Ray Donovan take place

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Near Malibu I forgot

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
In a world where

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Secrecy is your last option

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
So her girlfriend kept saying

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Get over here, get over here

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And she didn't want to let her know she was stoned

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
So I'm at a birthday party

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And she didn't believe her

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
So we had to go to a restaurant

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And take pictures pretending

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
The beginnings of your stories

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Have packets of information in them

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
That I missed because I'm an afterglow

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
From your last story

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I think that's what it is

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Because you change locations and casts

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I was trying to say it was so crazy

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
That the other woman

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
We were outside the door

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Afraid to go in

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And lay there

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
She didn't want to be with anybody

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
While she was freaking out

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I always make it everyone else's problem

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
If I'm having a single issue

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
With anything

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Society is the first place I go

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Wipe my ass on

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Everything

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
That's why the election made me so upset

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I'm like I'm alone

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I can't wipe my ass on anybody

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
They're all wiping their ass on each other

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I was like this is fucked up

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I didn't mean to bring it back to that

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
No, so

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That was the mushrooms in my birthday

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
So you never tried mushrooms again?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
No, I'd like to

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
My bad mushroom chips are like

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
When you have bad mushrooms

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
I got a pain in my neck

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I looked in a mirror

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
And I thought I was a walrus

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
And they're kind of like bad mushrooms

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
So it's basically like acid

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
But there's still a

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Cylosil

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Cylosil

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I'll get it eventually

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
We'll edit it back in

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
When we do the bad mic pass

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
But yeah

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Cylocybin

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Is that in acid

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Or is that just in mushrooms?

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
No, acid's

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Lysergic acid

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
So mushrooms

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
They've researched

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I guess I want to urge you

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Because you're fucking bold and bad ass

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
On your 29th birthday let's do mushrooms

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Please do them again

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I think you'll enjoy them very much

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
What about acid?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
People are micro dosing now

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Micro dosing

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So good that his father's rehab center is doing

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Do acid

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Don't do meth, do acid

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
He's really

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Become his father in his bad years

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Do acid

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I mean my dad's a Jew

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Hoffman was a Jew, we're all Jews

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
No, I'm not looking to do anything ridiculous

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
But I like expanding the mind

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Have you done ecstasy?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
No

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
That's really easy

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
That kind of can't go wrong

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I was scared that I would do harm to my cat

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
But over my cat

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
You just pat him bone dry

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
The cat's like Jesus Christ

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
You have my number

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You have the job

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
You give me food

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I don't know what you ate tonight

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
But I was already

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
At an equilibrium spot

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
We had a business going here

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I missed my cat so much

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I missed that kind of affection

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I lost two

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
One was 18, one was 19

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And I wasn't going to get another

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
But someone got one from a shelter

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And the other cat wasn't getting along

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I'm glad it happened

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I love my dogs

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I can't believe I got dogs

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
And they're like what are you doing

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And I'm like it's called nothing

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
You're supposed to enjoy it

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
They're like just throw the thing

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I'm like if I throw it

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You'll just bring it back

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
And they're like yeah

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
No they're not like yeah

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Because if they were like yeah then they'd be sentient

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
But they're like no throw it, throw it

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Damn

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
From the future

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Because my brain's bigger than a peanut

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Oh

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
You're just gonna keep bringing it back

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
And I'm telling you

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
That you're never gonna understand this as a species

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
It never gets any better

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Than sitting under a tree

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Grooming another monkey

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And waiting to die

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And if a spotted leopard comes around

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
You go

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And you all go to safety

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Until the spotted leopard's gone

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And that is where humans

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Started fucking up

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Because we had nailed it

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And then one was like what if a spaceship

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And they were like you're great Carl

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
But Carl's not bad either

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Because those chimps are gonna die anyway

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I'm sorry I hurt this a lot

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I saw the documentary of Coco

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
The sign language in Guerrero

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
With my friend who was so cynical going

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
There's all these theories

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Coco didn't really know sign language

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
She's just copying

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And really bothered me

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Your friend bothered you or Coco?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
My friend bothered me that

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
His cosmology was so specific

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
That it was important to him

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
That Coco not knows sign language

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Yeah, Coco's full of shit

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I find myself wondering that all the time

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
When you're with somebody and you're like

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Wait, what's with the pushback at this point?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Yes

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Let's examine this

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
They had a 30 year scam

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
That Coco was just copying

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Not really signing

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It's not even like I'm open to finding out

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
That Coco's full of shit

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I'm totally open to it

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I find it weird when you meet the guy

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
That's like Coco's full of shit

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And I know it

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
It's not a tested hypothesis

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
It's just a strong belief

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
You're like the guy in Awakening

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
But if you wanted monkeys

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
To not talk to you

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
It's weird to have

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That strong an opinion

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Given that there's no stakes to being proven right

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Only thing that happens if you're proven right

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Is they got a documentary

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
About Coco

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Do you know Pat Sajak

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Was like a global warming guy

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
That bummed me out so much

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Politics and the internet ruined everything

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Turns out Pat Sajak is a global warming

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Denier

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
And his tweets at a certain point

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Were like

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Follow the money

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Follow the money

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Follow the money

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Global warming

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Yes, yes, there's someone right now

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Someone is making a billion dollars

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
By you believing

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
The world is getting hotter

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Yeah, that's

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
It's like a cartoon

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Or a game show where people spell

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Common phrases

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
So disappointed

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
You want Pat Sajak to walk off screen

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Off a wheel of fortune

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
You want him to slide down a pole

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Into like a den with a banner rug

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
With a martini

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And solve crimes or something

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
That are based on rudimentary English

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Or just enjoy his life

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I care if he jerks off at a bowl and drinks it

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Like I want him to be happy

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I want someone

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
To affirm the myth of retirement

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
To me

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Why is it the higher you look

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
The less happy everybody is

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
You know, Rupert Firebamoon

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Died today

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
He had 95 divorces

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
He

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
His face was a scowl

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
He owned 900,000 newspapers

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
He could tell

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Three countries what to think

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
But it was

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
No one ever saw him smile

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
He died

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Like where does it go

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
David Hasselhoff was night rider

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
He can't stop drinking long enough to go

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I thought he had the rights for the Baywatch

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I thought he made a lot of money from that

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I don't care about him

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Because I'm looking for one person

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
To show me the path

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Because otherwise, then it's me

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I'm going like, okay, so I

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Have to sit in my bed and I have to

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Just jerk off on my girlfriend

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Like

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
And watch Star Trek

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
You don't have to

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
No, I'm saying if I want to win the game of life

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
The way I have to do it

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Is not owning nine airplanes

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It is exactly what I have right now

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
And then you go, okay, so

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Oh, so now I

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Wait to die

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
That's not fun, I don't want to

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
No, no, no, no

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Expand your horizons

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Because Fred Stoner is like, let me do

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Mushrooms, I want to, yeah, okay

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Let me ask you again

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I want to check

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I think we just entered a first perfect show

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I was just looking for the first time

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And you were here

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
You were here

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I'm not depressed these days

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Because I like being creative

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I'm not being an asshole plugging my stupid kindles

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Saying nulls and books

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
It's called 5 Minutes to Kill

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
It's about the 1989 Young

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Comedians special

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
You guys, I don't know if you remember

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
You said these big Young Comedians specials

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
A lot of people were launched

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And I wrote about the one I was on

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Because I found it interesting

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
The trajectory and the diversity

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Of the careers and lives

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Two of them made it big

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Rob Schneider and David Spade

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
They were discovered from the Young Comedians special

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Two of them had tragedies

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Warren Thomas and Drake Sather

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Warren Thomas was the best

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Yeah, yeah

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
She's beautiful, she's struggling

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
So I kind of interviewed

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Widows and people

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And it's like those

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
30 by 30s

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
This is a college team

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
They were all supposed to be pros

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Two made it, two didn't

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Is this you checking in with

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
So it starts in 1989

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
With

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
6 young hopeful people

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And I wasn't so young even in 1989

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
As a comedian

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I did break the Young Comedians special

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
And then what happens right away

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Schneider and

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You can call him Schneider here

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Schneider and Spader

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Of course Schneider gets his break

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
They get their breaks

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
And Warren Thomas had an opportunity

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
To be on Saturday Night Live as the black guy

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I'm looking at you

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And it's so sticky

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Was Warren Thomas the

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Did he have a Mike Tyson impression

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I'm going to put my dick in the butter

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Yeah, so he was this guy that

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
There's a thing

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
On Sunday Night Live

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
You're talking about the exact special that I remember

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I'm like fifth or I don't know

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
19 in Milwaukee

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I don't know

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Was it the HBO comic specials

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And it was

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Me, Rob Schneider, David Spade

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Drake Sather and Jen Karam

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Jen Karam was a precursor

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
To all the beautiful like Whitney Cummings

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
And Sarah

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Women who were hot

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
And she was really beautiful

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
But she didn't own her hotness

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Like hey, making guys come

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
I'm not saying I do those jokes

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Sort of like Kytlinger

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Yeah, that kind of type of stuff

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
So she was really ahead of her time

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
In that way with comedy

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
So yeah, so I follow from after

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Our quote unquote break

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Warren Thomas

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
When there's a ritual I didn't know about

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
That when you meet Lauren Michaels

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Initiation and he said fuck this

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And he left and

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Ended up going to Chris Rock, that spot

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
So it just takes us

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
To 2017

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Following the triumph and the tragedy

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Of the six people on it including myself

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
That's great

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I don't have to

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Pronounce that that sounds great

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
So I forgot

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Oh yeah, so in my Seinfeld

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Year, so what I'm trying to say is

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I'm happiest being creative and just writing

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Things in my own voice

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
So the theory I have is

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
And maybe antidepressants help

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But no, I'm happiest when I'm being creative

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Not trying to fit into puzzles

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Is that depression serves a purpose

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Because then you're not afraid to die

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And we're all going to die

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
So I wonder if

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
So exciting to hear you talk

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
That's why you need to be pitching television shows

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
But when I'm depressed

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I'm more in tune

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Because when I'm really depressed I go

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
In an interesting time with Twitter and Instagram

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I'm more in tune and in touch

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
And in reality, so maybe

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Depression is the real thing

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Was supposed to be, I wonder

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Because now I don't want to die

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And I'd be afraid to

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
No, I don't want to, which is good, right?

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
But maybe

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
But I'm very depressed

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I'm not afraid of it, I welcome it

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
So maybe depression makes more sense

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Does this make sense?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Well, depression is practical

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Is more practical than avoiding it

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Than thinking that it's wrong

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
And everything's great

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Let's say there's two types of something

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
For once in our lives

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I know we hate saying there's two types of things

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Let's say there's two types of depression

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
And let's say that the two types of depression

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Are un-fucking controllable biochemical depression

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Where, as we all know

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
If you're in a bad mood

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
And you get a flat tire

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Your flat tire is the end of your world

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
If you're in a good mood and you get a flat tire

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
It's kind of funny you get a flat tire

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
If you're in a good mood and you win $500

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
In a scratch-off

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It's fucking fantastic

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
If you're in a bad mood and you win $500

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
In a scratch-off

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
It's like

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Evidence that capitalism has its hopes in you

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And so on and so forth

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Like mood matters more

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Than fact

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Especially when you relate it to

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Fact, so like

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Fuck, I forgot why I was talking about this

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
But is it more practical

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
To not be afraid of death

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Like you'd be depressed

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Whichever of those things are true

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Whether you are biochemically

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Uncontrollably depressed

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Or whether it's actually

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
There's the other

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Situational

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
There's been like five bad

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Things that have happened

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And it's kind of hard to be in a good mood today

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I was being glib when I said there was

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Two kinds because it's like

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
A combination of things

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It doesn't matter, your bad mood

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Still means the exact same thing

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
And committing to your bad mood

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Is still

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Practical

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
The problem is when people

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Connect

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Factuality to their mood

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
When you say, regardless

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Of the cause of your bad mood

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
When you say that because of your bad mood

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
You

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Say something

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And we all know what the stuff

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
You want to do when you're in a bad mood is

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Or, but this is something

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
That we overlook a lot

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
When you think that because

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
That you're in a bad mood because of the shit

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
That happened to you recently

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Because of everything that your life has

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Been

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Those are big mistakes

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
You're connecting shit that may be

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Co-relative, but it's not

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Cause-effective

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And that's why, but if you can just go

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I am in a bad mood

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Here's how I feel when I'm in a bad mood

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I feel like

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
This, and you

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Write it down, or

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Like, just feel it

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
So much that you create

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Any kind of snapshot with it

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
I'm telling you that snapshot

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Is as valuable to humanity

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
As a photograph

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
From an oceanographer

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Of the Marianas Trench

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Because you might be experiencing

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Depths that are no deeper

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Than the person that never

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Went deeper, but you're experiencing

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Depths from an angle

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
That has never been seen

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And we need, before we all die

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
When we will probably die

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
By our own hand, so

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
No matter how depressed you get

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Why bother killing yourself

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
When you know humanity will do that

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
For you

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Like, leave it to them

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
It's like the one area

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Of human society that you can leave

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
To the customer service department

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Like, you know they'll get around to it

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You don't have to do it, but

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I'm not saying logic is a reason to not hurt

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Yourself, I'm just saying

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
When you're at that point when it feels

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Like you have no course of action other than something

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I'm telling you

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Fuckin' wait it out

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Because you are a sensor

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
That has been shot from God

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Like, to look at that spot

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
It's the spot that only you can see

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
It may seem unremarkable

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
No life grows there

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
It's jagged and unfriendly

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And all it says to you

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Is, fuck you

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
You shouldn't be here

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Well, that's the whole point of a probe

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Like, you shouldn't be there

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
You won't be there at some point

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Like, you will get out of there

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And you will be stronger

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And the people around you will be stronger

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Because you got down there

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
And you live down there, Fred Stoller

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
You were a

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
You were a Marianas trench cruiser

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Wow, thank God

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Church

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
To make it to, like I was out here

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Like, every day you're just like cruising

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Through the fucking

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Depths, the lowest

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Places that the ocean can afford

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
That's valuable data to everybody

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
It's gonna end up making Jared Kushner

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Live a more fruitful life

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
He's gonna be on his elliptical

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And he's gonna be like, I learned from Fred

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
That there's a new way to describe the feeling you have

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
When watermelon makes you feel bad

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I kind of lost at the end there

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
That's why

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Drugs, I get things

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
But I can't articulate it

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
That's why this guy's amazing

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Because I can articulate nothing

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I'm like a box

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
And if a breeze blows through it

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
It sounds like something's being said

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
So

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
When you hold it up to anyone

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
But you have to hold it up at a distance

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Alright, well we should end our show

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I got

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Real drunk during it because I love

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Listening to you

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
So

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
What's the book?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Tell us the book again so we can get off

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
This podcast and go get it

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
It's called 5 Minutes to Kill

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
There's a subtitle they came up with

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
The

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
HBO Young Comedian Special

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Changed the Lives of

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
1989 Six Funniest People

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
That's they came up with

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
It's a dollar 99

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
But it's legit

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I can't wait to read the book

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
By their marketing department called

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Refining

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
The key to

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Killing something

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Because whatever it's called

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Whether it's grapes or celery

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
It should be short and we should remember it

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
5 Minutes to Kill

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Forget the other part

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Please tell your publisher to

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Stop doing that

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Fred Stoller everybody

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Brandon Johnson was your Comptroller

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Ori's gonna come back with his dad

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And we're gonna connect about

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
This very common story

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
About fathers and sons

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
You drift apart, then you come back

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I wanna be there

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
And collect a loose change that hits the floor

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Steve Levy you did so good

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
In Spencer's job

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
By not saying anything

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Yeah, alright

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
But you scheduled something for tomorrow

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I'm supposed to just write another show

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Yeah

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I'll just write another show tomorrow

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
While everyone else is memorializing things

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
But then you get to celebrate Memorial Day

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
With AAA Celebrity

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Tomorrow night

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I gotta look at what he's talking about

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I'm having

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Andy Kenner guilt

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
For those comments

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I already met him

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Wow

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
He doesn't even like me

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
He clearly does

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Could be anybody

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Alright

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Cancel all of it

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
But no, the guy

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
He'll think it's a famous prank

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Alright

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Give me a rap beat

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I'm gonna rap

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
But then Fred

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
When I point at you

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
You have to

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Just say

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Just say

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Just be the my Fred Stoller

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Intervoice

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Do we have a track?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
I can make one on GarageBand

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
You're not ready yet, Liberace

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Oh shit

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Little volume please

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Yeah

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Heard him dead

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Oh lord

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Oh god above

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I pray for the strength

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I pray for

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Chord length

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Yo

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Yo

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Yo

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I pray for your strength

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I pray in church

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I pray for more Chord length

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
I want the insulation

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And the 60 cycle hum

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I want your mama and your daddy to say

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Drum drum drum

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
From the savage to the

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Collaborative

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Our society's got nothing to give

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
When it grows from

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
One strong chimp to a bunch of simple shit

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
That goes beyond limp and

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Across the space to the moon

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
And then you don't go back

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Did we have an attack

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Of neuroses?

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Are we not going places

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
That we need to be?

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
It's imitated by the crowd

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
I thought they wanted to see a sci-fi

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Animation stuff

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And they're going

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Who's this fucking older guy

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
He's sort of familiar

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
But I think they like some of the stuff

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Maybe the writing, Seinfeld, I don't know

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Oh

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Yo give it the strength

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Give me some of that

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Chord length

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Yo

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I went into a car

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And I drove to a tar pit

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I saw the dinosaur and more

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I went down into it

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
And I said I'm now extinct like you

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
But here's what I'm gonna do

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I'm gonna eat you up

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
But you're covered in tar

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
So you taste worse than a candy bar

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
But when you're in my stomach

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I'll take you far

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
To the places where carbon based life

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Couldn't reach

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I'm glad my relatives are older

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And don't listen to this podcast

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
I'm nervous

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
That they're gonna hear about mushrooms

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And spending money at Malibu

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Freddie

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
You got the money?

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Why'd you do that?

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
She took advantage

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
They're strangers

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Stars

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Cosmic stars

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Stars just from Mars

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
It was down on your planet

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
And you know

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
No matter how hard your planet you can't

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Make a motherfucking thing

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Happen to you

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
That wasn't gonna happen to you

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I've had a dick

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
And it was a flag

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I don't know what I'm saying

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I'm so drunk I can't lie

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
From my rapping and my rhyming

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Won't fuck a mama tonight

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Mic equals voices in my mind

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Low I gotta rap

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Down in low I gotta text

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Thinking about it too hard

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Get out of my yard

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
This isn't rap

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I'm rapping

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Confident now after doing tonight

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Gonna go home without the GPS

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Make my way back to

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Cancers

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Get some food

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
That's how confident I am

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I'll find

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Kawanga somehow

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Without the GPS

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
I'll do it

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Maybe they got some tweets

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I haven't checked my thing

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
In like two hours

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
This is great

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
As long as I'm gone

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Alright French Scholar everybody

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Thank you so much for coming back

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Brandon Johnson, Zac McKeever, Sarah Hill

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I'm too drunk, do you remember anybody that works on the show?

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I think you nailed it

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
There's somebody back there

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Kris Boruff who does everything

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Oh thank you so much

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Thank you

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Yeah

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Just pretend you kept clapping longer

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Make some noise

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Good night Burbank

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
This has been Harmontown

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Drive fast

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Live fast

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Drive faster

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Did you get any of that?

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000
It's a good show
