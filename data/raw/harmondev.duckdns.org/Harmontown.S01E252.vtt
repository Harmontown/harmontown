{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.000\nWelcome once again to beautiful Uptown Burbank Harmontown is now in session\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:21.000\nLet's welcome to stay Spencer Crittenden and everybody Spencer Crittenden\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:31.000\nSpencer Crittenden and Steve Levy bringing me a cocktail\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:35.000\nHe'll be back, the mayor of Harmontown, you know him, you love him, Mr. Dan Harmon\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:40.000\nThank you\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.000\nThank you very much\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:57.000\nMy dog was, he was, you know, it's the weekend so, and it's like the dog has a dog sitter like all week Allison\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:58.000\nWhich dog?\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:03.000\nHarvey, well I'm talking about Harvey, I'm telling a story about my relationship with Harvey\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:09.000\nbecause Nigel gets lots of, I don't know, he's a snuggler and stuff and Harvey's a very large dog\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:17.000\nI don't say that in front of him, I call them both, I say, my two equally normal sized dogs\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:23.000\nbecause there's no such thing as a normal dog, it takes a long time to say and that's why it's kind of exhausting\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:33.000\nand so on the weekends which is when I'm there the most like Harvey who is a creature of warmth and love\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:40.000\nlike, I don't know, sometimes he gets a little antsy like he thinks maybe when I get up to go get more ice cream\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:49.000\nor like emergency battery for whatever electronic device I'm staring at\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:55.000\nand then he gets all excited like he thinks maybe I'm going to jog around the block or wrestle a bear with him\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:03.000\nand I was going to breakfast today and he got excited and ran over the door because he's like, oh man, he's going outside\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:08.000\nhe's probably like Allison the dog sitter, he's probably going to like put a leash on me and go running around with me\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:16.000\nand I looked at him and I said, listen man, like you know the score, like I'm a bad dog owner\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:26.000\nI'll just relax and we're both going to die and I'll see you in heaven\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:35.000\nand I heard myself say that and I thought it was kind of funny the idea of dogs going to heaven and then like, you know, us actually all going to the same heaven\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:42.000\nbecause then everything you ate would be in heaven and like octopus are like really smart creatures and they'd all be in heaven\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:54.000\nbut like there's like a, you know, obviously it's like a six year old thinks of this stuff like but just the idea of all biology merging in heaven\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:01.000\nwhich is what happens in life because you die and you break down so heaven doesn't exist and it's nothing\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:08.000\nit's not news to you guys, I just had to kind of, I don't know where that was going to go\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nit's just that I didn't want to open the show and go, so Donald Trump Jr. had this meeting\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:16.000\nI didn't want to like, I figured you guys are running from that and I didn't want to go\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nso Game of Thrones, you're missing it, thank you so much\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:23.000\nclearly we took a hit, this better be a Game of Thrones hit\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nhave you guys seen Game of Thrones yet?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nI did, oh yeah\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nyou guys want to know who did\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:39.000\nI say, I mean, no I don't want spoilers but I'm enough of an anarchist to want you to spoil it for everybody right now\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nI was, now here's another\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\ndoes his name rhyme with Ron Flo?\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nI don't know\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\ndo you guys want my opinion about Lena Dunham's dog?\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nDan, what's your opinion on Lena Dunham's dog?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nI was thinking about that, I was reading that article\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:01.000\nI don't want to know his opinion about whatever he just said, I was reading the article about it\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:04.000\nand I was like, I wonder what Dan's opinion on this is\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nthis is a perfect opportunity\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:11.000\nI don't think that Animal Adoption Shelters should do that\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:17.000\nI think that people that want dogs to be happy and end up in good homes should see the bigger picture\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nI feel like, what does Lena Dunham have to do before we stop kicking her in the face?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nwhat did she do?\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nI don't know what you're talking about, so hit me to the giant\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nshe's lying about her dog\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:33.000\nI mean, she's throwing it around\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:39.000\nshe took her dog to, she gave up her dog she had for four years and she said it was biting\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:45.000\nit had aggressive behavior and had a dark past and something\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:49.000\nwhatever she said, what the fuck\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nshe's not under oath and she's not a god damn\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nwhat's the definition of a lie?\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nshe had the dog for four years, she's giving it up and it bit people\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nbut then there was this communique issued by the shelter she got it from\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nit was like, hmm, Miss Dunham adopted that dog from us\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nwe knew it for three weeks and that dog certainly never exhibited\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nit was like this big long like\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\nMiss Dunham, Miss Dunham says\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:23.000\nhmm, however, according to this animal shelter\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:27.000\nlike they didn't re, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nso don't do that\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nI want to tell people Nigel got his stitches out, he's home, he's safe\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:39.000\nwhat if the animal hospital was like, also he had bruises that we couldn't account for\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:43.000\nyou had a fucking social worker\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nare you admitting that Nigel has bruises that can't be counted for?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nno\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nhe keeps falling\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nwell, wait, so I thought it was like\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:59.000\nsomeone came to interview the shelter being all like\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\noh, what's the score? and then someone's like\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:07.000\nthat's not what I saw, I saw an open letter to the people about someone's dog\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nif that's true, that's kind of a bummer, yeah, I thought someone came and interviewed the guy and he was like\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:15.000\nhere's what I know, but yeah, that's kind of weird if they're like\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nthat's not true\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nwell, let's just commit to the sadness, like I was going to have something happy to talk about it\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nGeorge Romero died, Merton Landau died\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\noh, yeah\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nRomero was one of the first Hollywood meetings I ever had, Schrab and I came out here\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:31.000\nI can't remember who set it up, I don't know if it was\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.000\nhe was with the Gersh agency back then, I just remember like wow, we're meeting George Romero\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:41.000\nand he wore his, he wore that vest that directors wear to the meeting\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nand he signed a copy of, he signed Schrab's\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.000\nDawn of the Dead, I think it was\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nI can't remember what movie Schrab had him sign\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:57.000\nI don't know, why do people deal with celebrity death like that, like I worked with him once\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nextra pity that he's dead\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nTony and I had the honor of doing a scene together in Surfer Ninjas\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nnow it's bad that he's died\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nand there's the other thing that everyone does when it's a celebrity\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nlike everyone wants to connect the dots, they're like Tony\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nTony from, Tony Johnson died\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nSurf's up brother, don't watch out for those ninjas\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.000\nstop that, stop it, just look at someone with a ghost buster\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nGeorge Romero died, you'll be eating brains of your victims in heaven\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nbut this, I guess this leads into, this is why I'll finish up\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nI had an epiphany about this, I haven't executed this epiphany yet\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:45.000\nI haven't acted on it, but my epiphany has been this, alright? Are you listening?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nAre you paying attention? I'm buckled all the way up\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nThe reason I've been getting mad at people on Twitter is because\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nfor 30 years of internet usage\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:01.000\nI have always been assuming\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nthis one thing that was going to be a common like assumption among everyone which is that\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:09.000\neverything that you're saying on the internet is something that you're\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nimplying you would say to my face in real life\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.000\nor out loud in a crowded room if you're like broadcasting it\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:21.000\nand I was just taking a pee at work the other day and I was like\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nbecause we were talking about the internet and then I was like, I don't know, it was an epiphany\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:29.000\nand I like, we have all the time and it's like I think the warm water\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nleaves your body and your brain like shifts, whatever you were just talking about\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nhas a chance to like click. You said epiphany?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nI didn't coin it, I don't think.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:45.000\nI'm writing it down. But my epiphany was\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:49.000\nholy shit, nobody, everyone in the world is a moron\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:53.000\nand so when the internet gave them the ability to\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:57.000\nsay things to each other, a lot of these people\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\ninherited for the first time in their life the\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:05.000\nability to say things to anyone in any way\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:09.000\nand so these are not people who would\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nbe at your party and then say that while\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:17.000\nyou were saying what you're saying. Like I just tweet, even when I'm like\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nin a tweet storm, I'm just doing what I\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.000\ndo, ask anybody that knows me, I just talk and I don't fucking stop\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:29.000\nand I yell at everybody and I'm like, here's another thought about Lena Dunham's dog\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.000\nbut then I look at my\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nreplies and I think, oh these are all the things that people\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nwould say while I was doing that. It's like you should be mad\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:45.000\nright away if they were going to, you're just reading their dumb little\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nminds, you're talking to someone on the internet, that's what's happening is\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:53.000\nwe have very low grade telepathy, you're just seeing what's going on in\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:57.000\ntheir little lobster brain. Now they have the ability\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nto accidentally project it, they're typing it\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\nand so they're like, I'm racist\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:09.000\nand you're like, well what if you heard that as a voice over\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:13.000\nfrom a guy next to you in a subway?\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:17.000\nIt's still important to know that they're racist, that's valuable\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:21.000\ninformation but I wouldn't get as mad at them, I'd\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nturn and go like, huh, nice and they'd be like, what?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nI'm racist and they'd be like, I can't fool me\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nand I'd feel like empowered and feel like a superhero and therefore I wouldn't\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nget that mad at them. I had this idea, I had this idea\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:41.000\nlike an evil plan, like if I was an evil villain, that like you could take\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:45.000\nall the stupid things that people say online in the 1940s\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:49.000\njust wouldn't be online and able to be searchable\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:53.000\nby a robot and you get all this racist stuff and I don't know how\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nyou flag it but you flag it as dumb racist stuff and you collect it\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nall and then you use the bot to find these people's kids when they're\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.000\nlike 13 or 11 or 12 and you just show them all this racist\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nstuff that their parents said and all this stupid shit and it's like, here's\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nyour fucking parents, they're fucking dipshits, don't listen to anything they say\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nand it'll be like a time bomb that just goes off simultaneously like 20 years\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nin the future and it'll be an entire generation of like kids, they're like, wow\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nmy parents are really fucking stupid and I just didn't see their Twitter feed\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:29.000\nall this time, the society will break down.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nI'm charmed by the notion that people don't\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nknow their parents are full of shit. No, but you just see all this. Four years old.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nIt'll be great. I mean it would be like, I mean I don't want to, but more importantly\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nlike also you yourself, right? Like just anything, like\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nhere's all the shit that you said when you were activated and like thought you were fighting\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nsomething. Yeah, if my kids saw that, I'd be like, well I can't send him to\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nhis room. That's the thing is that you're going to raise a generation of\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:01.000\nPippi Longstockings, like they're going to have no parents. Yeah, it'll be great, but they'll be a little\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:05.000\nsad, they'll be a little sad because the bot's going to say, here's\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nyour parents, everything they say is full of shit and the kid's going to say, they just said happy birthday.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nJust, you know, rattle the\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:17.000\nnests. It's just the orphan maker\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.000\nof the 5,000 bot just floating through neighborhoods, peeking in windows\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:25.000\ngoing, love insincere,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\ninsincerely proven. What was the source of Pippi Longstockings\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:33.000\nsuper strength? Why was she so powerful? She found out her mom was racist.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:37.000\nShe found out her mom was racist.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:41.000\nIt was her spinach. She would pull up her mom's\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:45.000\nFacebook if anybody was in trouble and she would read like\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nwhat is this rant about Islam?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nThis is\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\neasily proven with a cursory Snopes visit.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nSomeone made a Snopes\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nfake news sound. Or did I project that onto them?\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.000\nI think I can assume that people that came out on Game of Thrones night are here.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:13.000\nWhat is that sound?\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nWhy didn't you make that sound after I said a cursory Snopes visit?\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:21.000\nThey\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:25.000\nfeel the same way you do. They hear the word Snopes?\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.000\nThey were breathing out. They were like, that was fun Dan, thanks for sharing all that.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:33.000\nNow they feel singled out.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nWhat's the Pippi Longstocking?\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nWhat is half of what he says? It's just grandpa gibberish.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\nLet's bring up younger blood.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nI'm just a big fan of this person.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nI really don't know that much about her.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:57.000\nShe's out there in Brooklyn tweeting away.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:01.000\nShe has this amazing\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\noutlook.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nI've told you up here\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:13.000\nabout that which is starting at zero because I felt like\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nyou heard me. You can rewind my fucking\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nstuff and you can hear me talking about things that are true\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nwhich is that the bipartisan system doesn't work. But now we all miss it\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:29.000\nvery much. I do. I'll speak for myself.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:33.000\nI'm just kind of like, I got, what's\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:37.000\nthat sound? Why are you making that sound? It was laughter. It was somebody's laugh.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:41.000\nIt's at the wrong time and it's the wrong kind.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:45.000\nI am vulnerable.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nSomebody was enjoying the show. See, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nThat's what happened to me after the election.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:57.000\nI started experiencing vulnerability. His name is Charlie\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nSnopes. I don't care. Oh, Mr.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:05.000\nSnopes from the New Hampshire Snopes.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:09.000\nActually, that's not true. We're not from New Hampshire.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nAh, those Snopes. Would you like\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nsome dip? That's not dip. Okay, getting annoying.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:21.000\nDon't invite the Snopes over. Okay.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nI stalked her Facebook page when she was flying in today and I was like,\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nI don't know. I look at her Facebook page and I saw that you can actually say things that are\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:33.000\nlonger than on Twitter and stuff. This is from December 1st.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:37.000\nThis is shortly after.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nThroughout the campaign and election, I felt that something was truly\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\noff about our institutions, the way people were absorbing and discussing\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\npolitics and the lack of discussion about policy. I thought for a while\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nabout the source of this problem and potential solutions and I made a decision.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nI'm working on a project to develop the concept of citizenship.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:01.000\nIt's more than just knowing facts about the system, though\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nI saw somewhere that only 36% of Americans can name the three branches of government.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:09.000\nIt's a series of habits that reinforce the ways a citizen\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:13.000\nabsorbs information, participates in our system, and reacts to the decision of those\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:17.000\nin power. Decisions of those in power. It is not partisan in nature\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:21.000\nany more than the Constitution itself. It is about seeing politics at its core\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nas identifying and solving problems. At the moment, too many\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:29.000\nsee politics as a battle of dueling ideologies or degrading horrors. The concept\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nof we are the people being in charge of our own government\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nand destiny is without faith and with few advocates. I want to rebuild\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:41.000\nthat faith. We are our government. We can make decisions about our lives.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nWe can take pride in accepting reality even when it doesn't match our ideology.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:49.000\nWe can see how the media, we consume values as our perceptions. We can fight\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nself-serving perceptions with evidence and empathy. We can engage in identifying and solving\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:57.000\nour problems. We can engage in identifying and solving problems bigger than our\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:01.000\nindividual lives, whether that is through government, involvement, or restraint.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:05.000\nWe can get honesty from our politicians about their plans, demand a dignity,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:09.000\nand respect for the power they hold via their offices and punish them with ouster\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:13.000\nwhen they fail to bring solutions. And she goes on and on\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:17.000\nand I wanted to go on and on up here. So let's bring to the stage\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:29.000\nCaitlin Byrd.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:33.000\nHello.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nI forgot the one thing I should have asked you backstage was, oh wait, am I supposed to\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:41.000\nuse your real name or did I just like...\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nNo, we can edit that out very easily.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:49.000\nOkay. Because your\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nmeaningful identity to me is Gotham Girl. What's your Twitter handle?\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:57.000\nGotham Girl Blue. Where you have\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\n1,000 followers, which I didn't do anything to earn\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:05.000\n400,000. I did things that explain why I have them,\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:09.000\nbut the things that you're doing\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:13.000\nin that corner of the internet seem magnificent to me\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:17.000\nand I'm coming to you for this episode of the podcast.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nJust want to get a little like clarity\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:25.000\nbut also hear from the side because I guess\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nwhy am I explaining to you how I'm about to interview you?\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nIt's good. I've never been interviewed before. So this is good. I need some prep.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.000\nAlright, well let's talk about what else are you going to ask?\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:41.000\nYou do all these kind of like tutorials. If people go to your...\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:45.000\nyou have a separate Twitter that's like CitizenZero...\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:49.000\nCitizenZero blog I think is the name of the Twitter handle.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:53.000\nAnd you're admittedly just starting that and you're not...this isn't your wheelhouse\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:57.000\nthat in particular. You're not like a web genius or whatever\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:01.000\nbut you're hoping this can be kind of a project that people get\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:05.000\ninterested in. It's about the analysis\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:09.000\nof what it is. What does it mean to be an\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.000\nactive citizen? What does it mean? And so I guess the thing that I want to start with\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:17.000\nis because all of us are familiar with this aspect which is arguing\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:21.000\nonline about politics. How do we do that right?\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nLike I guess to start, I did\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:29.000\nlike actually write a post because I'm a terrible person\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:33.000\nwho writes blogs forever. But the first thing\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.000\nI think to start with is always to have an idea of what you actually want to get out of the\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\ndiscussion. Like if you go into a political discussion and your aim\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:45.000\nyou don't know what you want it to look like when it's done you're going to end up\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:49.000\nin a flame war where you call somebody cunt. It's going to happen.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.000\nBecause you're secretly like not...that's what you actually are burnt up about.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:57.000\nYou can actually do yourself good\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:01.000\nand do the other people good by actually knowing that that's what you're thinking first of all.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:05.000\nLet's do an example of how to...\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nSo if I'm just sitting over here stewing, so first of all\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:13.000\nif I'm mad, I hate women. Like let's say\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:17.000\nlet's just hypothetically say\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nI hate women. I just heard about the Wonder Woman premiere\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:25.000\nor the Wonder Woman screening where you're not allowed to have men at the\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nthing, at the Alamo Draft House. So I just read about that on Facebook\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:33.000\nand now I'm real mad or maybe I'm not even acknowledging that I'm mad\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:37.000\nI'm bemused. Because people don't understand\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:41.000\nhow illogical it is but like what should I be doing\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\nin my status update or like is that the first mistake\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.000\nis that people don't start discourse that way. They don't be honest and say this is how\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:53.000\nI feel. I think first of all would be like\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:57.000\nwhat kind of topic do you actually want to cover? Because if you want to just talk about how you feel about something\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:01.000\nthere's so much space for that. There's a lot of it but you know if you want to use\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:05.000\nsocial media as your therapy session, which is totally cool, just acknowledge\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:09.000\nthat that's what you're doing because then people don't want to engage with you.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:13.000\nIf you're like having those feels, I feel like that's not a great way to start\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:17.000\na political discussion. I think the easiest way\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:21.000\nI don't know, I was really upset about\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:25.000\nI think the thread that you noticed that got you to follow me\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:29.000\nwas the one about Bernie Sanders. And I started from this place where\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nI was like wow I've got a lot of thoughts about Bernie Sanders but so many in my head\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:37.000\nso maybe I should like put them out there. And I started from this place\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:41.000\nof like I don't want to be confrontational. I don't want this to be like oh my god\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:45.000\nI hate Bernie, all of you can suck it. So I came from another place because\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:49.000\nI know that that was going to end badly. So I was like okay let's talk about\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:53.000\nwhy people don't like Bernie Sanders. Let's talk about that first.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:57.000\nLet's talk about why people might not be involved in his campaign or not\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:01.000\nfeel like he insults them or feel they're distant from his\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:05.000\nconcepts. At least if I get that out then at least you know where I'm coming\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nfrom when I say that I don't like him and I don't want him to be president of the\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:13.000\nUnited States. It's not personal\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nmy dislike but it means that I have to be honest about where I'm coming from\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nwhat's motivating me and be able to explain and defend it\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:25.000\nwhen somebody comes up to me. So a good place to start from if you just want to vent\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:29.000\nsome stuff which is all of our rights to do.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:33.000\nIt's probably best to just be like the more honest\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:37.000\nthe better. Although some of us are you want to be funny about it and you want to\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:41.000\nhave a point of view and sometimes that involves sarcasm and sometimes that involves like\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:45.000\noh the next thing that's going to happen is this and there's not really an argument\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:49.000\nthere. But let's say you were honest enough to say\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nhere's why some people don't like the Bernie movement\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:57.000\nthat's why some of us feel a little betrayed even as you feel\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nbetrayed and all this stuff and you say these things and you lay out your thoughts.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:05.000\nSo now let's go to the next step which is you're being\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:09.000\nattacked. Someone's going to talk down to you\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:13.000\nwhatever you want to call it but you seem to have this\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.000\nability online which was inspiring to me like you don't automatically\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:21.000\nassume even though you know because\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:25.000\nback stage and Cody said how many times does it end with a conversion of\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nsomeone zero absolutely 100% zero ever but\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:33.000\npeople are watching and we're performing on Twitter but anyways\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:37.000\nanswering your question for you. Here comes the I'm going to be like\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:41.000\na dummy like a mannequin like\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:45.000\nI'm going to be like\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nyou just said all that stuff about Bernie. So then I respond to you and I say\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:53.000\nyeah\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:57.000\nwell what makes you because\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:01.000\nyou started it with like this is why some people so I'm going to hit you there and I go\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:05.000\nwhat makes you think you speak for the people you think you're speaking for? Why do you think you're\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:09.000\nspeaking for those people? He lost the primary by 4 million votes\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:13.000\nso I'm pretty sure I'm speaking for a lot of people\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:17.000\nwho didn't vote for him. So then that person's going to get\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:21.000\nriled up now because you're going down there.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:25.000\nThat person's now riled up because now they're going to go\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:29.000\nwell the reason he lost the primary is because the primary\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:33.000\nwas not a fair fight.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:37.000\nYou can see in the leaked emails that she's\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:41.000\nconspiring against him the Democratic\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nparty is villainous and unfair. I don't know how I fit that in 140 characters but I did.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:49.000\nNo you totally did. So my response also in 140 characters\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:53.000\nis that\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:57.000\nBernie basically lost the race around March 1st and\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.000\nyou would need to show exactly, explain to me exactly what the DNC did\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:05.000\nbefore March 1st that secured the fact that he would never get\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:09.000\nenough delegates to win the nomination. If you can explain that to me I will gladly take your\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:13.000\nposition, I will acknowledge it, I will say like I totally understand where you feel\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:17.000\nyou're coming from but you got to show me the evidence\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nof a problem that could not be solved by his campaign.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:25.000\nDo you ever have, are you, do you, because I just\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:29.000\nlike what, because this isn't going to fuse, maybe let's\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.000\nlearn a little bit about your like from birth forward, like your early\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nstory. Because I'm curious about\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:41.000\nhow after that election and those spreadsheet results\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:45.000\nwhere certain demographics were revealed to be\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\njust as chaotic as life itself.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:53.000\nThings that we thought if you had this quality or that quality from birth\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:57.000\nthat, so how, and then that has put us\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:01.000\nall into a tizzy and there's\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:05.000\nactually on that spreadsheet as I said after the election if you cross\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:09.000\nall of it, it's like there's one group of people that should be taking their hands off\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:13.000\nthe wheel right now and be more jaded than ever and that's black women\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:17.000\nbecause they turned out to the polls and like\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:21.000\nI don't know who those 3% were, 2% or whatever it was, but it was like\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:25.000\nand did you, well go back to that first of all, did you feel a\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:29.000\nbetrayal the next morning?\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:33.000\nFrom your other Democrats? From white people?\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:37.000\nFrom white people. From white women?\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:41.000\nI mean you expected it from white men maybe, but were you shocked\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:45.000\nthat women didn't wonder women it through\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:49.000\nas one gender?\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:53.000\nI guess, first of all I was kind of in a coma after\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:57.000\nthe election results because I was with my best friend and we were hanging out\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:01.000\nand we were so excited and then I started calling Florida and I was like\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:05.000\noh this is not good, this is not good and my friend was like\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:09.000\nfreaking out because she was, I mean we're both black women\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:13.000\nand she was freaking out and she was like we go and die, we gonna die\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:17.000\nand I was like maybe not, maybe something will happen and then she'll win\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:21.000\nand then we won't die and it didn't work out like\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:25.000\nthat, fortunately we're both still alive. I kept yelling at Cody\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:29.000\nlike he's not winning, you know like I was like\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:33.000\nI was like mad at her for thinking it was possible\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:37.000\nfor women to have their hearts broken. Like no, it's not gonna\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:41.000\nhappen, you don't get the universe, okay?\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:45.000\nSo I did feel to a certain degree I was like this wasn't supposed to\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:49.000\nhappen, the numbers weren't supposed to work like this, I had\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:53.000\nI mean I grew up in local politics so I actually\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:57.000\ndid my first door-to-door petition drive at three.\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:01.000\nThis will stop any minute now. That's my car I think.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.000\nIt was really mad about me talking about freedom.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:09.000\nJust hearing those labels you're gonna ring ting tingling too.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:13.000\nWait, take us to the moment of birth if that's not too invasive.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:17.000\nOh no, it's definitely not invasive. How long was the labor? What hospital?\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:21.000\nNo, are we born and raised in New York? Yeah, I was born and raised in New York\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:25.000\nboth of my parents were like very civically minded. My mom\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:29.000\ncurses too much to be an elected official so she never really got into\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:33.000\nthe negotiation of politics because she doesn't have patience. Can you do an impression of your mother\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:37.000\ncursing? No, no, I've died.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:41.000\nBy the way, I'm from the future coming through a portal into your mother's kitchen about her political\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:45.000\ncareer. It's not because of your swearing, it will only ever be because you're a\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:49.000\nwoman. We are going to elect a man who talks\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:53.000\nlike a sewer and in all the ways that really matter\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:57.000\nand then I'm gonna go back through the portal and enjoy a nice\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:01.000\ncocktail. Yeah, no, that's good. And then\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:05.000\nmy dad was an actual local elected official. He actually\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:09.000\nhelped preserve a local train line that was going to get\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:13.000\ntorn down and I got a chance to ride on it because he'd done all that work.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:17.000\nAnd it was really cool to kind of grow up in local politics except that\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:21.000\nknowing all your politicians, local politicians means that you find them really\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nhuman and really petty all the time. But it was a good\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:29.000\nexperience to see what it looks like to do all the time, like\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\npetition drives and try to get people involved and all that other stuff. And then\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:37.000\nafter the election, I was sitting there after having spent lots of\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:41.000\nhours yelling at my television about like, that doesn't matter!\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:45.000\nDoesn't matter! Doesn't matter that he loves golf!\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:49.000\nLike, why does anyone care? Who is talking about these really important things?\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:53.000\nLike, are we going to upgrade our energy grid? That's really important. We can't\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:57.000\njust let it sit there for the next 20 years, deteriorating. Is anyone going to talk about\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:01.000\nglobal warming? Is any, like literally at all, like just maybe like five minutes\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:05.000\ncould you just ask him a question about climate change? And then if he doesn't answer\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:09.000\ncorrectly, because there's a correct answer, there's only one answer actually. There's literally\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:13.000\nhe, there's no multiple choice. It's like one answer. A, the Earth\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:17.000\nis getting warmer. B, the next question would be what are we going to do\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:21.000\nand the answer is fix it. That's like, there are only two answers to those questions.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:25.000\nYou were talking backstage about the original zero sum game, which sounds\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:29.000\nexactly like that, which is human rights. Because, and you take it,\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nyou're telling me things about the Dixie Cratson and history that I'm\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:37.000\njust here to absorb. Because I was thinking about\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:41.000\nSoylent or something for those years. So like,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:45.000\nhuman rights used to be a part of the Republican party platform. When they\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:49.000\nstarted, like when the Republicans party started. And defining human rights, because now\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:53.000\nwe live in this post-nationalist, like do we meet American human rights or do we meet\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:57.000\nany human rights when you're talking about slavery? There's kind of like no\n\n30:57.000 --> 31:01.000\nseparation between American human rights, just regular human rights. They're the same\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:05.000\nthey're the same concept. And when you're talking about\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:09.000\nthe ability to access your civil society, like if that's the standard that you're setting\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:13.000\nfor your citizenship, like white dudes get to participate in society. That's\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:17.000\nthat's a human right. At that point, it's not like a right for a particular\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:21.000\ngroup. If it's necessary to make it possible for that entire group to\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:25.000\nvote, then it's necessary for everyone to be able to vote. That's how it should work.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:29.000\nThe only reason we have an age cut-off is because you met 17-year-olds, like no.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:33.000\nThey're not allowed to do anything. Yeah, I don't want a world run by\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:37.000\nme at 32 or five seconds ago.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:41.000\nWe move forward and we grow. Hopefully the society, whatever. Why am I\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:45.000\ndoing this?\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:49.000\nA sidebar on that, because I keep reading about voter\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:53.000\nsuppression. I get gerrymandering. I understand that a little bit.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:57.000\nThat's simply the horrible kind of sometimes functional,\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:01.000\nbut ultimately erosive process of playing chess with like\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:05.000\nwhere districts are drawn so that blah blah blah. We all know what gerrymandering is\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:09.000\nand how that is voter suppression. What is the what is the shit going on with\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:13.000\nlike why is it really as simple as\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:17.000\nlike with voter ID laws? Talk about the state of\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:21.000\naffairs with voter ID laws. Is that different from state to state? I'm lost there.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:25.000\nEvery state gets to determine what it's going to do with its own election, which is\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:29.000\na good thing in some ways and bad thing from like a national perspective when we're voting\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:33.000\nfor president because it's really annoying. State by state\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:37.000\nbasically what you can do is you can create a standard for voting.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:41.000\nOnce you do that, you basically can control the rules of\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:45.000\nwhat it means to get to participate in voting. I know that there was\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:49.000\nan automatic voter registration bill that was going through in Nevada. I believe\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:53.000\nthere's a state or two that's working with on it. It might be Oregon. Oregon actually\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:57.000\npassed it, which means that you're automatically registered at 18 and you have to\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:01.000\ngo and deregister or something like that in order to stop being on the voter rolls\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:05.000\nor death certificate. That means that\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:09.000\nvoter suppression works this way, which is basically if you set a standard\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:13.000\nthat only some people can meet, even though everybody's an eligible voter,\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:17.000\nthen you get to choose who filters through.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:21.000\nThat's what voter suppression is about. You can apply a drug\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:25.000\ntest. How does an ID, how does the idea\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:29.000\nof needing an ID, how does it\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:33.000\ntalk about that filter as an actual manifestation? The first thing is\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:37.000\nis that they use the fact that only some forms of ID\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:41.000\nare legitimate ID. Your college ID is not a legitimate form of ID\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:45.000\neven has your address on it. That means college students now have to get\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:49.000\na separate ID in the state with all their birth information, rather\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:53.000\nthan just being able to use their student ID to vote. You can register\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:57.000\nat school, at college, and vote. Actually, again,\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:01.000\nmy bestie was in school in Philadelphia and she voted out\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:05.000\nRick Santorum and that was one of her great, she's always like, I can die now.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:09.000\nHaving done that, I voted out Rick Santorum that feels so good.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.000\nShe didn't need to present photo ID,\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:17.000\nshe was able to go present the evidence that she lived in Philadelphia\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:21.000\nas her means of doing it. Right now what happens is that\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:25.000\nwith voter ID laws, basically what they do is they set a standard\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:29.000\nthat you have to meet. You have to bring your birth certificate or this. How many people\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:33.000\nright now in this room can tell, say specifically where your\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:37.000\nbirth certificate is right at this moment? Not me. Anybody, how many people?\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:41.000\n17. Okay, everybody who did not raise their hand, you can't vote.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:45.000\nYeah, I mean, just adding any, it just occurred to me,\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.000\nadding any hoops, even if they're\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:53.000\nseemingly not, like they're not like, hey,\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:57.000\nif you are a fan of the patriots, you need to,\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:01.000\nthe filter only needs to be a filter in order to slow down\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:05.000\npoor people, young people, people\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:09.000\nthat are working a lot. It's like any extra steps, the harder\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:13.000\nyou make it to vote, the more, I think that's essentially\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:17.000\nwell, it occurs to me, we're down a fucking branch\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:21.000\nthat I took you down because, okay, voting is a human right.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:25.000\nThat is a, that's an argument that we're\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:29.000\nstill having needlessly. The idea that voting is a human right\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:33.000\nforget about shelter, medicine, all these things. So take\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:37.000\nus back to somewhere around the 1800s\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:41.000\nabout, and let's step forward where human rights is like this\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:45.000\nissue that starts fragmenting us into\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:49.000\nweird bedfellows. I mean, it's always been fragmenting us.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:53.000\nSo let's start from the basic sentence, the basic concept, right? The idea\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:57.000\nof America is that it's not based off of where you came nationally, you know, it's always the dream.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:01.000\nIt's the mythology that we talk about on July 4th is that we built a country\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:05.000\non ideals and you could come here and you could dream what you wanted to\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:09.000\ndream, you know, dream the impossible dream, all of that. I can't sing so I'm not going to\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:13.000\ntry it. But the point is that you can\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:17.000\nthere's this notion that we were built differently\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:21.000\nand we had explicitly\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:25.000\nhuman rights as part of our declaration. You know, they talk about tyranny and\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:29.000\nbloodshed and controlling us and we deserve the right, we are endowed\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:33.000\nby our creator, whoever that is. And like come on\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:37.000\nthey said it right up there, we're endowed with our creator with certain inalienable rights.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:41.000\nAnd among these is the right, you know, all those happy\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:45.000\nrights that they talk about. That you come out of a womb or even ostensibly\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:49.000\nthat constitution holds up to us being test tube babies. Sorry to cut you off\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:53.000\nbut I saw a sci-fi angle here. You're coming into this world one way\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:57.000\nor the other but the constitution is this document, like they sat down\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:01.000\nand they said let's form this labor union of a country, this hotel lobby of a country\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:05.000\nthat says no matter what happens, no matter what anyone would try to use it as an excuse,\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:09.000\nthat the idea is that everyone in this country\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:13.000\nas soon as you draw your first waking breath\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:17.000\nyou are actually, you have these\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:21.000\nrights. They are not given to you, I know I sound like a sixth grade teacher but I was just like\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:25.000\nwe have forgotten that in our bones, right?\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:29.000\nAnd well early on so continue. Yeah so except for slaves\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:33.000\nlike the rule was like everybody who's a white\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:37.000\ndude has inalienable rights but I don't know about the rest of you.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:41.000\nLike maybe white women, I don't know, we're working it out.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:45.000\nWell we're kind of masters of the unspoken exception.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:49.000\nIf we had to write it goes back to that thing. If you had to declare, like if you were passionate\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:53.000\nat the framing of the constitution you would have to write it in like look black people\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:57.000\nlet's write about them for a while and you'd have to do it but\n\n37:57.000 --> 38:01.000\nyou don't have to do that when you're, you can just say all people\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:05.000\nare created equal and I'll find out what I mean by that later but for now\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:09.000\nI mean Phil and his cousin Tony. Anyways\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:13.000\nsorry, it's these negative spaces that we're now like coming to bear out and that's\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:17.000\nwhy there's amendments and that's really because we didn't, by the way\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:21.000\nyou're talking mean this, go please continue.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:25.000\nSo then leaving people out of that discussion of human rights\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:29.000\neventually fractured the country in two because one group was like nah they definitely don't\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:33.000\nhave human rights and the other group was like maybe they do.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:37.000\nJust a little bit, just like maybe a handful of human rights are not like equal to us\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:41.000\nbut they seem to be human. I think actually after quite a lot of time\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:45.000\nthey do appear to be human beings so we might need to just\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:49.000\nset up them as part of the country and they're like whoa you can't do\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:53.000\nthat and then they decide to murder each other over it for about four years\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:57.000\nand the Republican Party's concept was like\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:01.000\nwe actually recognize that slavery is bad because it infringes upon human\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:05.000\nrights and they held up that end of the bargain\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:09.000\nuntil basically shortly after the\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:13.000\nbasically until 64, 1964 Republicans\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:17.000\nheld on pretty well and the only thing that cracked\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:21.000\nthe black vote away from them was the New Deal policies because they were like wow\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:25.000\nyou screwed up real bad, like we have no money, we might not be able to vote for you again\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:29.000\nactually, this guy might, FDR might have some solutions for us\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:33.000\nand we're okay with splitting away from you\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:37.000\nand you saw the black vote start to diverge and split into two pieces but the reason\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:41.000\nit didn't go fully democratic under FDR was because they had\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:45.000\nthe Dixie Crack Coalition, the same people at the founding who were like no no no\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:49.000\nwe gotta keep slaves and the same people in 1865 who were like no no no no\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:53.000\nwe have to kill Lincoln and continue trying to impose slavery and the people\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:57.000\nwho terrorized black people in the years between Jim Crow, those people\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:01.000\nwere the same people who've been arguing this entire time like no\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:05.000\nhuman rights are not actually fundamental to this republic, they're not\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:09.000\nthey're only for some people. And we're seeing that play out now\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:13.000\nthese words that moved up to six months ago are just grown-up words to me\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:17.000\nand continued about, I don't care about fucking Medicaid, healthcare, all this shit\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:21.000\nthese words they sound, they're more boring than a\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:25.000\nCentral American country's presidents last name\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:29.000\nlike this doesn't have anything to do with me, Medicaid, Medicare\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:33.000\nall this stuff but it's like then you peel back the layers\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:37.000\nand you're like Jesus fucking Christ you just think that cancer is\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:41.000\npunishable by more death if you're poor than if you're rich\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:45.000\nwhich is fucking insane if you wrote it in the crawl of a sci-fi movie\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:49.000\nand said the people are divided between people that think that if you\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:53.000\nhave a random thing happen to you while you are on American\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:57.000\nsoil and American citizen, if you have sickness\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:01.000\nwhich is just a part of life, we believe\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:05.000\nthat then your life should just be shortened by your\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:09.000\npoverty and no one is having that, I mean now everyone's having that\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.000\nconversation but we're still not just watching Paul\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:17.000\nRyan struggle through that power point that he made\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:21.000\nwith like Cranes where he's like he thought he was going to blow our minds\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:25.000\nI think because his mind had just recently been blown\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:29.000\nhe was like let me break this down like I don't know if you guys get it but\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:33.000\nbasically what people are suggesting is that\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:37.000\nout of these sick people, do you know what happens when you get sick\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:41.000\nyou can't make money so\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:45.000\nthey're like the poorest people in the world and the sickest\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:49.000\nthis is a problem that solves itself\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:53.000\nand that's what he was yelling at us and everyone was like\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:57.000\nwhat the fuck don't you understand about every step of\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:01.000\nsociety that all of us have ever learned since our mommy sat us down\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:05.000\nand said your roommate needs the rent check\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:09.000\nI'll bail you out this time but get your shit together or you have to move back\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:13.000\nhome and I make fun of you\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:17.000\nevery college kid gets it\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:21.000\nI don't know what my question is\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:25.000\nso where do you stand, this is an interesting segue into this\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:29.000\nI'm getting the impression then that you're probably not one to\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:33.000\nwhere are you in all this\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:37.000\nthis trees in Russia like\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:41.000\nsoap opera, I'm guessing your answer is to the extent that it's\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:45.000\nthere's evidence and rule of law let's proceed forward but let's not\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:49.000\nlet it distract us from the occasional law being pushed forward\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:53.000\nit's the most important thing that's ever happened in American\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:57.000\ndemocracy I knew it\n\n42:57.000 --> 43:01.000\nbecause\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:05.000\na hostile foreign actor totally\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:09.000\nwent into our most sacred institution and fucked it all up\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:13.000\nam I allowed to say that\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:17.000\nif you want to talk\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:21.000\nthere's the metaphor of the body politic and people use that all the time\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nimagine voting as being your spine\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:29.000\nyou wouldn't be like we're cool\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:33.000\nyou'd be like no that really fucked up my whole life\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:37.000\nmy perception is that people are distracted first and foremost by this\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:41.000\nvictory parade they're having which is not happy at all\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:45.000\nand that they perceive that they don't even\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:49.000\nget to start going down the block before people are pouring weird\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:53.000\nthey think that people are cheating by going like Russia Russia Russia\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:57.000\nand I think that the biggest thing that they don't understand\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:01.000\nthe people that are still bothering to like go come on get over it\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:05.000\nwhere's the evidence I'm tired of hearing this\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:09.000\nis that they think that at the end of this whole process\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:13.000\nHillary Clinton gets to become president because they cheated\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:17.000\nshe should\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:21.000\nput extra votes in there\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:25.000\nis that like if you were to cheat in like a local election\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:29.000\nand they found out they would just nullify the election your opponent would win\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:33.000\nthat's how it works there's no complicated thing there\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:37.000\nbut it depends on your definition my impression is that what we're debating with them\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:41.000\nbecause it seems like to the extent maybe Spencer you can jump in or you have a beard\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:45.000\nbut it seems like we've long since kind of dropped\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:49.000\nmaybe we'll find out more but right now\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:53.000\nwe're sort of like not worried about\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:57.000\nthe results of the election we saw them\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:01.000\nthey bummed us out and were surprising but at the same time\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:05.000\nlike it's fine and is the result of\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:09.000\nthis constant effort on the part of a foreign hostile\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:13.000\nformer superpower the most dangerous psychological\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:17.000\npost internet fucking threat you could have that what we've learned about Russia\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:21.000\nis that that's how they handle their satellite states that's how they like\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:25.000\nthey've just been like they have troll farms all that shit is real\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:29.000\nand that doesn't mean that if we prove collusion\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:33.000\nsomeone else gets to be president except for the fact that you can't be president from prison\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:37.000\nbut I think\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:41.000\nthe people that are still hanging on are really even\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:45.000\ndumber than me about politics and are thinking stop trying to act\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:49.000\nbut this election is not going to stick and I'm like it's stuck\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:53.000\nnow he goes to prison what happened I mean\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:57.000\nprison that's really hard to do impeachment yeah it's really\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:01.000\nhard we've never put a president in prison another thing is that\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:05.000\nI like to think about this like it's kind of scary don't don't freak out everybody\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:09.000\nbut like we're kind of in the place right now that we were before the civil war where like\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:13.000\nthere's no real chance to like the only thing that fix the civil war\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:17.000\nwas the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution like there was never\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:21.000\nany like hey I don't know can we just sit down and talk about whether or not\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:25.000\nit's okay to leave the United States over slavery can we just let's just have to sit down have a\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:29.000\nconference and we'll talk it out like we need to build a process and it's going to be\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:33.000\nlike the craziest thing we've ever done is to build a process to deal with the reality\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:37.000\nthat an election was stolen at this level and if we\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:41.000\ndon't figure that process out what did I say to you\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:45.000\nduring the opening monologue\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:49.000\nI'm sorry I like him\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:53.000\nhe's so passionate sorry why did we\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:57.000\nwhy did I operate in tandem with this guy to derail you\n\n46:57.000 --> 47:01.000\nit's like you're a writer, you're a blogger, you're an activist\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:05.000\nlike how are you going to help save the world\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:09.000\nyou've got to help us and what's the next steps that we have to do\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:13.000\nin case you can't tell my solution is fly her out, let her talk\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:17.000\nand then I'll just worship her, vote for you, then my problems are solved\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:21.000\nanything can I get back to Mario Kart\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:25.000\nthat is what everyone's dealing with is both inside them\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:29.000\nand with any people that they choose to talk to is like man we all\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:33.000\nit was working\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:37.000\nI wake up every day I think like a lot of people do with this kind of dopamine drip of\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:41.000\nDonald Trump juniors doing this thing we did it\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:45.000\nthey're all going to jail, they're not fucking going to jail, they're not going away\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:49.000\nwell it took six years for Nixon he won two elections by a landslide\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:53.000\nand then had to find his own shame at the end of that\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:57.000\nstory still and that cascaded from\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:01.000\nyour grandma and uncle and people at Thanksgiving not having facebook\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:05.000\nto bolster them every morning with more emphatic\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:09.000\noutrage but in fact they had to come around to, I think Nixon's a dick\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:13.000\nsick of it, sorry I told you you're a lesbian\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:17.000\nthat's a hard line to take, Nixon's a dick\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:21.000\nyou know what he's tricky too, I wish there was shorthand for any of this\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:25.000\nbut honey there's no facebook yet, I've got three pigs to slaughter before lunch\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:29.000\nI leave town every couple weeks and I turn off the news\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:33.000\nand I don't read a paper and I come back assuming that Donald Trump\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:37.000\nkilled a kindergarten because it seems\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:41.000\nlike he will one day and they're always in trouble\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:45.000\nthere's always some bullshit in the news cycle and then nothing happens\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:49.000\nand we all think it's going to be fixed but it's not going to be fixed\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:53.000\nwe actually have to revolt at some point, we have to\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:57.000\ntake it to the streets, well let's get back to this amendment\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:01.000\nlet's make three new amendments, do you think it's called\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:05.000\ntaking it to the streets? Are you suggesting that maybe we take our lumps with\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:09.000\nTrump and let this cancer ride out knowing that we are bombarding it with the chemo\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:13.000\nof fucking holy shit what the fuck have we done that's going to make us sick\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:17.000\nbut that if that stops the\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:21.000\ncancer of fascism that the thing we need to do\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:25.000\nis beat this metaphor dead\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:29.000\ntake on the dietary and environmental changes\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:33.000\nare you talking about election protection amendments\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:37.000\nlike things that actually federalize and centralize the election process\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:41.000\nand make it hack proof because I felt like the hacking\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:45.000\nwas cultural in this case, it was like Russia taking advantage of the fact that we're all\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:49.000\nlike so what do you think\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:53.000\nwhat do we need to change\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:57.000\nif you're not thinking about impeachment or arrest\n\n49:57.000 --> 50:01.000\nI'm definitely thinking about both impeachment and arrest but we've never had\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:05.000\na significant portion of our line of succession all removed\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:09.000\nsimultaneously and of course if, let's just be honest, if he\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:13.000\nstole an election he's not legitimately president, if he stole an election Mike Pence is not legitimately\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:17.000\nvice president, we don't have any idea what's going on with Paul Ryan\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:21.000\nbut I strongly believe that he probably had\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:25.000\nsome idea since he used to hack DCC, DCCC emails\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:29.000\nagainst house candidates which means that he either didn't know\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:33.000\nhe was using stolen information from Russia or he knew and just didn't care\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:37.000\nI think Paul Ryan stole our hearts\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:41.000\nhe's a dreamy\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:45.000\nthat lizard face\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:49.000\nbut okay so yeah\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:53.000\nbecause that's what we're all thinking right now, like we wake up\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:57.000\nat that fucking meeting where somebody\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:01.000\nmade the reference before I did, I thought I'd be the oldest person on Twitter and go\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:05.000\nyeah, Serrano's got the discs which is a reference to Midnight Run in which\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:09.000\nthe resolution is all Robert De Niro\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:13.000\nhas to do is to get crime boss Tony Serrano\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:17.000\nto accept discs that it's been established Serrano believes\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:21.000\nare fruit of the hacked election\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:25.000\nyes, like a Russian government lawyer\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:29.000\nand it's amazing that they identify themselves that way\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:33.000\nbecause the Russians probably are going\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:37.000\nwhen you're Russia, everything you do is a win-win-win-win-win\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:41.000\nthere is not even one lose in there, there's no wrong move for Russia to make\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:45.000\nthey can just email you and go, hey we've got naked pictures\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:49.000\nof Hillary Clinton, hey I've got naked pictures of your mother too\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:52.000\nthey can just send out whatever they want, any meeting you take\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:56.000\nnow they've got you for that, and then the further\n\n51:56.000 --> 52:00.000\nthe relationship deepens, the more stoked they get\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nthe longer they wait, the more they offer up\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:07.000\nand you have to figure that combined with the collective IQ\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:11.000\nof the Trump team who never thought they were going to win\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:15.000\nlike they've got to be in so fucking deep it's insane\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:19.000\nso then we all wake up realizing this, we're all starting to realize this\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:23.000\nthat this treasonous path probably very likely, Occam's razor says\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:27.000\nthese motherfuckers, like before they knew\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:31.000\nit was even possible to commit treason, when all you want to do is\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:35.000\njust win the presidency, they committed treason so long ago\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:39.000\nwe're going to find it out, and then you just like, wait what\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:42.000\nwe're all just sitting here going, then what do we do?\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:45.000\nthere's actually no actual process for that or answer\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:48.000\nI kind of wish I could give one, the answer\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:51.000\nI think we talked backstage, it was about\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:55.000\nknow what you want to see, right, so what do we want to see?\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:58.000\nlike imagine, like really imagine right now\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:01.000\nlike the president of the United States has not been legitimately elected\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:05.000\nnone of his cabinet can take over for him, not his vice president either\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:09.000\nwe have no system whatsoever has ever had this happen\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.000\nso what do you, what happen, what do we as citizens want to see?\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:16.000\nbecause if you can't figure out that next step, which is like we will re-run the election\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:20.000\nwe could, we have the money, it's not like we can't afford to run a second election\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:23.000\nthen the problem is republicans have to put somebody new up\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:26.000\nshould we give them the opportunity?\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:30.000\nyou know, should we just claim that it's illegitimate\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:33.000\nhave installed Hillary, that's going to go well\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\npeople will be very calm\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:41.000\nyou know, so the problem is that you need to know what you want to achieve first\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:44.000\nand then the answer is to start working backwards\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:48.000\nso what can we do as citizens to make it easier to understand\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nwhat that result should look like\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:54.000\nand I honestly believe that we should declare the election illegitimate\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:57.000\nand Hillary Clinton should be president of the United States\n\n53:57.000 --> 54:00.000\nand I don't just say that because I really liked voting for her\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:04.000\nbut also because, I mean in all honesty that's what happens with virtually\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:07.000\nevery other contest that we've ever run where we find somebody cheated\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:10.000\nwe're like every other time in all of the history of the world\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:14.000\nwhen we're like, hey, turns out you're a fucking cheater\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nyou actually totally stole that thing\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:19.000\nyou don't get your medals, you don't get to win the game\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nyou're a race in the history books\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:24.000\nwe remove things, like that's just how it's always gone\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nit happens in local elections\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:29.000\nwhen am I allowed to make fun of Barron?\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:32.000\nwhat age does he have to be before we can go?\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nthere's a statute on that one\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:37.000\nyou are clearly, because I've got so many tweets just backlogged\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nyeah\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\noh my god, I can't, talk a lot\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:44.000\nlike many of the things that I want to see\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:47.000\nare felonies to say out loud into a microphone\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:50.000\nI've researched it\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:54.000\none of them may or may not be, like I just can't\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nBarron's adulthood in general\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:59.000\nI can't wait until he's walking around\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:02.000\nI am endlessly entertained by Donald Trump Junior\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:05.000\nI think because I just like, he\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nit's like\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:11.000\nhis tweets like, and with his avatar\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nwith that hair and his face\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nlike I just regressed to\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:18.000\na time in every cell in my body\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nwhen I was absolutely the underdog\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:24.000\nI didn't know that I would find out 40 years later\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nthat, you know\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:30.000\nthat my view of things is limited to where I turn my head\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:33.000\nbut when I knew I had righteous anger\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:36.000\nwhen I knew who the bad guys were\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nand why I was a hero\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nthat fucking kid, and I'm calling him a kid\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:43.000\nbecause his dad calls him a kid, which is part of the problem\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nhe's my age\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nhe's such a villain\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nhe's always been a villain\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:52.000\nand I love that he's entered the fucking forefront of everything\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nit makes me so happy\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nnow I'm rooting for\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nI'm rooting for evil to have happened\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.000\nI'm rooting for him to disappoint his father\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:04.000\nI want one of the two of them\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nmythically\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:09.000\nfor federal officers listening\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nI just, I just, I just\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:14.000\nI want the whole thing to end in all of them\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:17.000\nin a reservoir of dogs crossbow fight\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\ncrossbow\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nwhere a secret service like\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\ncommander, whatever their highest ranking official is\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nhas been locked out of the room\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nlike a firewall\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nlike in that life movie\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nwith Jaygills\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nthey're on the space station\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nand the octopus monsters\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nfirewalls, and they're locked out of the oval office\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nthey're like, we need to be in there\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nand then they come in and it's like\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\npeople are talking about what happened with flowcharts\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nfor six years\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nbecause all you see is just\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nthey all did it to themselves\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nlike there's just crossbow bolts everywhere\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nand freedom\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\na vacuum of freedom\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nand then from then on the oval office\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nis like

it used to be\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nit was already the\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nthing you were looking forward to\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nnow it's also got a lot of\n\n57:12.000 -->

all just die of some sort of weird\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nI don't want to wait those that many generations\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\nlike\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\ndid you just fart or was

officials\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nand especially when you grow up with them\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nyou see\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\na lot of their foibles\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nbut

--> 58:48.000\nthere are people who are going to ask you some of the stupidest shit you've ever heard in your life\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nand you're going to have to be like\n\n58:50.000 -->

wrong\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nbut it seems to me that\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nour class of politicians from top to bottom\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nhas become an inversion\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nof that demographic\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nwe all went to high school\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nwith people that we\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nremember and go like\n\n59:56.000 -->

degrees\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\non a different road\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nthey're directed that way by\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nI don't want to say Hydra\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nbut I don't want to get into a\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nconspiracy theory like a reptilian\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nalien that's taken over our earth\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nbut there's definitely\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nthere's a problem there and it all\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\ncomes back to the individual's definition\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nof what it means to be an American citizen\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nwhich we have been\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nespecially recently but

01:14:24.000\nwhat will happen\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nit'll be good\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nsuffice it to say\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nif you do\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nthere's a million apps and it's a google away\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nthis idea of calling your congressperson\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nthere's\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nthere's pretty much\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nno chance\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nof having the experience that you have\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nif you were to call fries\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nelectronics or the DMV\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nor your own dentist\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nlike the people\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000\non the other end of the phone are\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nlike they're\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nthey're passionate about politics\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000\ntheir job is to pick up that\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nphone you're going to\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nget through it it's okay to\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nmaybe even kind of only\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000\nlike maybe be figuring out\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nwhat the fuck your problem is\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nlike a little bit right\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nyou'd recommend not doing that\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nnot using it as a therapy session\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nbut at the same time\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nthe thing that keeps me in line is this fear of\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nI'm just going to feel stupid\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nI mean again\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nI think well first of all you got to get through\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000\nto the line because a lot of the time\n\n01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nespecially on a big legislative vote\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nthey're getting calls from like a billion calls\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nso like the line might get jammed\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nin which case then you can just have\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nthe quietly experience existential fear\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nwhile you're on the hold line\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nbut that's kind of it is kind of comforting though\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nif something happens that you're watching CNN\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nand you're your internet thing\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nand you're like I'm alarmed about this\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nand you pick up the phone and it's busy\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nyou kind of draw comfort from that right\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nlike when there's a blackout or\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nthe internet's out and like you call Time Warner\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nand it's like your call will be\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nanswered in 17\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nthousand hours\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nand then there's like an edit in there\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000\nif you're calling about the fucking internet outage\n\n01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nit's being or dealing with it\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nlike yeah that would be nice to\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nI mean that is totally comforting\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nbecause it does mean that a lot of other people\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nhave the exact same idea that you did\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000\nwhen that's always nice to know that\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nI mean I think one of the reasons politics is so hard\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nis because we all feel like a little bit like an island\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nand you're like oh I'm having\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nall these thoughts or I'm having feelings about politics\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nand I want to get involved and it's like\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nit's super intimidating\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nlike it's so hard to do that first thing\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nand you don't want to go to the meeting\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nand you're afraid that you'll be stupid\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nand like the truth is that we're all\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nstupid I'm stupid\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nlike I got called an activist I'm not\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nI'm like crazy lazy\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nit's unbelievable how lazy I am I just sit around\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nand I write things and I have ideas\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nbut I haven't been to like\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000\none of a political club meeting now\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nin like a year because I'm like the laziest person\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nI was during the

phone using the site\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nbecause like Hillary created a site\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nand you could just randomly phone call\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000\npeople from like all these different calls\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nand I was like this is perfect for me\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nI'm the laziest person in the

01:17:18.000\nI literally did not go inside of it\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nso you're saying if you'd worked a little harder\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nHillary would be in office right now\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nhaha\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nwe landed at LAX in the middle of the LAX\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nlike when the travel ban went up\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nand we like landed there\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000\ncame out of first class we had our luggage\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nJeff had his suit over his shoulder\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nand we were like oh it looks like a protest\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nand we like we hung out there\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nand then for the next three weeks I would shut up\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nabout our responsibilities and\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nand then I bought a gun\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nbecause I was just like\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\neverything's changing\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nI want to shoot it for changing\n\n01:17:50.000 -->

to shout 9-11\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nlike they always do at 9-11\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nthat's very nice\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nI think we live in a

01:19:08.000\nbecause that sucks\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nor whether or not it's creating a K-8\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000\ncurriculum because I'm working on\n\n01:19:12.000 -->
