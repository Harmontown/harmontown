00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Welcome once again to beautiful Uptown Burbank Harmontown is now in session

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Let's welcome to stay Spencer Crittenden and everybody Spencer Crittenden

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
Spencer Crittenden and Steve Levy bringing me a cocktail

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
He'll be back, the mayor of Harmontown, you know him, you love him, Mr. Dan Harmon

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Thank you

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Thank you very much

00:44.000 --> 00:57.000
My dog was, he was, you know, it's the weekend so, and it's like the dog has a dog sitter like all week Allison

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Which dog?

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Harvey, well I'm talking about Harvey, I'm telling a story about my relationship with Harvey

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
because Nigel gets lots of, I don't know, he's a snuggler and stuff and Harvey's a very large dog

01:09.000 --> 01:17.000
I don't say that in front of him, I call them both, I say, my two equally normal sized dogs

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
because there's no such thing as a normal dog, it takes a long time to say and that's why it's kind of exhausting

01:23.000 --> 01:33.000
and so on the weekends which is when I'm there the most like Harvey who is a creature of warmth and love

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
like, I don't know, sometimes he gets a little antsy like he thinks maybe when I get up to go get more ice cream

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
or like emergency battery for whatever electronic device I'm staring at

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
and then he gets all excited like he thinks maybe I'm going to jog around the block or wrestle a bear with him

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
and I was going to breakfast today and he got excited and ran over the door because he's like, oh man, he's going outside

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
he's probably like Allison the dog sitter, he's probably going to like put a leash on me and go running around with me

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
and I looked at him and I said, listen man, like you know the score, like I'm a bad dog owner

02:16.000 --> 02:26.000
I'll just relax and we're both going to die and I'll see you in heaven

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
and I heard myself say that and I thought it was kind of funny the idea of dogs going to heaven and then like, you know, us actually all going to the same heaven

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
because then everything you ate would be in heaven and like octopus are like really smart creatures and they'd all be in heaven

02:42.000 --> 02:54.000
but like there's like a, you know, obviously it's like a six year old thinks of this stuff like but just the idea of all biology merging in heaven

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
which is what happens in life because you die and you break down so heaven doesn't exist and it's nothing

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
it's not news to you guys, I just had to kind of, I don't know where that was going to go

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
it's just that I didn't want to open the show and go, so Donald Trump Jr. had this meeting

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I didn't want to like, I figured you guys are running from that and I didn't want to go

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
so Game of Thrones, you're missing it, thank you so much

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
clearly we took a hit, this better be a Game of Thrones hit

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
have you guys seen Game of Thrones yet?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I did, oh yeah

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
you guys want to know who did

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
I say, I mean, no I don't want spoilers but I'm enough of an anarchist to want you to spoil it for everybody right now

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
I was, now here's another

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
does his name rhyme with Ron Flo?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't know

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
do you guys want my opinion about Lena Dunham's dog?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Dan, what's your opinion on Lena Dunham's dog?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I was thinking about that, I was reading that article

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't want to know his opinion about whatever he just said, I was reading the article about it

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
and I was like, I wonder what Dan's opinion on this is

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
this is a perfect opportunity

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't think that Animal Adoption Shelters should do that

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
I think that people that want dogs to be happy and end up in good homes should see the bigger picture

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I feel like, what does Lena Dunham have to do before we stop kicking her in the face?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
what did she do?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I don't know what you're talking about, so hit me to the giant

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
she's lying about her dog

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
I mean, she's throwing it around

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
she took her dog to, she gave up her dog she had for four years and she said it was biting

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
it had aggressive behavior and had a dark past and something

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
whatever she said, what the fuck

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
she's not under oath and she's not a god damn

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
what's the definition of a lie?

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
she had the dog for four years, she's giving it up and it bit people

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
but then there was this communique issued by the shelter she got it from

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
it was like, hmm, Miss Dunham adopted that dog from us

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
we knew it for three weeks and that dog certainly never exhibited

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
it was like this big long like

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Miss Dunham, Miss Dunham says

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
hmm, however, according to this animal shelter

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
like they didn't re, what the fuck are you doing?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
so don't do that

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
I want to tell people Nigel got his stitches out, he's home, he's safe

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
what if the animal hospital was like, also he had bruises that we couldn't account for

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
you had a fucking social worker

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
are you admitting that Nigel has bruises that can't be counted for?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
no

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
he keeps falling

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
well, wait, so I thought it was like

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
someone came to interview the shelter being all like

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
oh, what's the score? and then someone's like

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
that's not what I saw, I saw an open letter to the people about someone's dog

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
if that's true, that's kind of a bummer, yeah, I thought someone came and interviewed the guy and he was like

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
here's what I know, but yeah, that's kind of weird if they're like

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
that's not true

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
well, let's just commit to the sadness, like I was going to have something happy to talk about it

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
George Romero died, Merton Landau died

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
oh, yeah

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Romero was one of the first Hollywood meetings I ever had, Schrab and I came out here

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I can't remember who set it up, I don't know if it was

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
he was with the Gersh agency back then, I just remember like wow, we're meeting George Romero

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
and he wore his, he wore that vest that directors wear to the meeting

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
and he signed a copy of, he signed Schrab's

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Dawn of the Dead, I think it was

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I can't remember what movie Schrab had him sign

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
I don't know, why do people deal with celebrity death like that, like I worked with him once

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
extra pity that he's dead

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Tony and I had the honor of doing a scene together in Surfer Ninjas

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
now it's bad that he's died

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
and there's the other thing that everyone does when it's a celebrity

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
like everyone wants to connect the dots, they're like Tony

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Tony from, Tony Johnson died

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Surf's up brother, don't watch out for those ninjas

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
stop that, stop it, just look at someone with a ghost buster

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
George Romero died, you'll be eating brains of your victims in heaven

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
but this, I guess this leads into, this is why I'll finish up

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
I had an epiphany about this, I haven't executed this epiphany yet

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
I haven't acted on it, but my epiphany has been this, alright? Are you listening?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Are you paying attention? I'm buckled all the way up

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
The reason I've been getting mad at people on Twitter is because

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
for 30 years of internet usage

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
I have always been assuming

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
this one thing that was going to be a common like assumption among everyone which is that

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
everything that you're saying on the internet is something that you're

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
implying you would say to my face in real life

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
or out loud in a crowded room if you're like broadcasting it

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
and I was just taking a pee at work the other day and I was like

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
because we were talking about the internet and then I was like, I don't know, it was an epiphany

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
and I like, we have all the time and it's like I think the warm water

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
leaves your body and your brain like shifts, whatever you were just talking about

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
has a chance to like click. You said epiphany?

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
I didn't coin it, I don't think.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm writing it down. But my epiphany was

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
holy shit, nobody, everyone in the world is a moron

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
and so when the internet gave them the ability to

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
say things to each other, a lot of these people

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
inherited for the first time in their life the

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
ability to say things to anyone in any way

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
and so these are not people who would

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
be at your party and then say that while

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
you were saying what you're saying. Like I just tweet, even when I'm like

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
in a tweet storm, I'm just doing what I

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
do, ask anybody that knows me, I just talk and I don't fucking stop

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
and I yell at everybody and I'm like, here's another thought about Lena Dunham's dog

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
but then I look at my

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
replies and I think, oh these are all the things that people

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
would say while I was doing that. It's like you should be mad

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
right away if they were going to, you're just reading their dumb little

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
minds, you're talking to someone on the internet, that's what's happening is

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
we have very low grade telepathy, you're just seeing what's going on in

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
their little lobster brain. Now they have the ability

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
to accidentally project it, they're typing it

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
and so they're like, I'm racist

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
and you're like, well what if you heard that as a voice over

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
from a guy next to you in a subway?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
It's still important to know that they're racist, that's valuable

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
information but I wouldn't get as mad at them, I'd

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
turn and go like, huh, nice and they'd be like, what?

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
I'm racist and they'd be like, I can't fool me

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
and I'd feel like empowered and feel like a superhero and therefore I wouldn't

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
get that mad at them. I had this idea, I had this idea

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
like an evil plan, like if I was an evil villain, that like you could take

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
all the stupid things that people say online in the 1940s

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
just wouldn't be online and able to be searchable

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
by a robot and you get all this racist stuff and I don't know how

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
you flag it but you flag it as dumb racist stuff and you collect it

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
all and then you use the bot to find these people's kids when they're

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
like 13 or 11 or 12 and you just show them all this racist

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
stuff that their parents said and all this stupid shit and it's like, here's

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
your fucking parents, they're fucking dipshits, don't listen to anything they say

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
and it'll be like a time bomb that just goes off simultaneously like 20 years

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
in the future and it'll be an entire generation of like kids, they're like, wow

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
my parents are really fucking stupid and I just didn't see their Twitter feed

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
all this time, the society will break down.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm charmed by the notion that people don't

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
know their parents are full of shit. No, but you just see all this. Four years old.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
It'll be great. I mean it would be like, I mean I don't want to, but more importantly

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
like also you yourself, right? Like just anything, like

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
here's all the shit that you said when you were activated and like thought you were fighting

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
something. Yeah, if my kids saw that, I'd be like, well I can't send him to

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
his room. That's the thing is that you're going to raise a generation of

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Pippi Longstockings, like they're going to have no parents. Yeah, it'll be great, but they'll be a little

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
sad, they'll be a little sad because the bot's going to say, here's

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
your parents, everything they say is full of shit and the kid's going to say, they just said happy birthday.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Just, you know, rattle the

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
nests. It's just the orphan maker

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
of the 5,000 bot just floating through neighborhoods, peeking in windows

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
going, love insincere,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
insincerely proven. What was the source of Pippi Longstockings

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
super strength? Why was she so powerful? She found out her mom was racist.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
She found out her mom was racist.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
It was her spinach. She would pull up her mom's

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Facebook if anybody was in trouble and she would read like

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
what is this rant about Islam?

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
This is

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
easily proven with a cursory Snopes visit.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Someone made a Snopes

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
fake news sound. Or did I project that onto them?

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
I think I can assume that people that came out on Game of Thrones night are here.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
What is that sound?

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Why didn't you make that sound after I said a cursory Snopes visit?

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
They

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
feel the same way you do. They hear the word Snopes?

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
They were breathing out. They were like, that was fun Dan, thanks for sharing all that.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Now they feel singled out.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
What's the Pippi Longstocking?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
What is half of what he says? It's just grandpa gibberish.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Let's bring up younger blood.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm just a big fan of this person.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I really don't know that much about her.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
She's out there in Brooklyn tweeting away.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
She has this amazing

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
outlook.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I've told you up here

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
about that which is starting at zero because I felt like

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
you heard me. You can rewind my fucking

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
stuff and you can hear me talking about things that are true

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
which is that the bipartisan system doesn't work. But now we all miss it

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
very much. I do. I'll speak for myself.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
I'm just kind of like, I got, what's

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
that sound? Why are you making that sound? It was laughter. It was somebody's laugh.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
It's at the wrong time and it's the wrong kind.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
I am vulnerable.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Somebody was enjoying the show. See, that's what I'm talking about.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
That's what happened to me after the election.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I started experiencing vulnerability. His name is Charlie

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Snopes. I don't care. Oh, Mr.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Snopes from the New Hampshire Snopes.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Actually, that's not true. We're not from New Hampshire.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Ah, those Snopes. Would you like

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
some dip? That's not dip. Okay, getting annoying.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Don't invite the Snopes over. Okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
I stalked her Facebook page when she was flying in today and I was like,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't know. I look at her Facebook page and I saw that you can actually say things that are

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
longer than on Twitter and stuff. This is from December 1st.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
This is shortly after.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Throughout the campaign and election, I felt that something was truly

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
off about our institutions, the way people were absorbing and discussing

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
politics and the lack of discussion about policy. I thought for a while

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
about the source of this problem and potential solutions and I made a decision.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm working on a project to develop the concept of citizenship.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
It's more than just knowing facts about the system, though

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
I saw somewhere that only 36% of Americans can name the three branches of government.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
It's a series of habits that reinforce the ways a citizen

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
absorbs information, participates in our system, and reacts to the decision of those

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
in power. Decisions of those in power. It is not partisan in nature

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
any more than the Constitution itself. It is about seeing politics at its core

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
as identifying and solving problems. At the moment, too many

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
see politics as a battle of dueling ideologies or degrading horrors. The concept

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
of we are the people being in charge of our own government

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
and destiny is without faith and with few advocates. I want to rebuild

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
that faith. We are our government. We can make decisions about our lives.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
We can take pride in accepting reality even when it doesn't match our ideology.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
We can see how the media, we consume values as our perceptions. We can fight

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
self-serving perceptions with evidence and empathy. We can engage in identifying and solving

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
our problems. We can engage in identifying and solving problems bigger than our

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
individual lives, whether that is through government, involvement, or restraint.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
We can get honesty from our politicians about their plans, demand a dignity,

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
and respect for the power they hold via their offices and punish them with ouster

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
when they fail to bring solutions. And she goes on and on

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
and I wanted to go on and on up here. So let's bring to the stage

17:17.000 --> 17:29.000
Caitlin Byrd.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Hello.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
I forgot the one thing I should have asked you backstage was, oh wait, am I supposed to

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
use your real name or did I just like...

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
No, we can edit that out very easily.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Okay. Because your

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
meaningful identity to me is Gotham Girl. What's your Twitter handle?

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Gotham Girl Blue. Where you have

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
1,000 followers, which I didn't do anything to earn

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
400,000. I did things that explain why I have them,

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
but the things that you're doing

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
in that corner of the internet seem magnificent to me

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
and I'm coming to you for this episode of the podcast.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Just want to get a little like clarity

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
but also hear from the side because I guess

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
why am I explaining to you how I'm about to interview you?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
It's good. I've never been interviewed before. So this is good. I need some prep.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Alright, well let's talk about what else are you going to ask?

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
You do all these kind of like tutorials. If people go to your...

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
you have a separate Twitter that's like CitizenZero...

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
CitizenZero blog I think is the name of the Twitter handle.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
And you're admittedly just starting that and you're not...this isn't your wheelhouse

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
that in particular. You're not like a web genius or whatever

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
but you're hoping this can be kind of a project that people get

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
interested in. It's about the analysis

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
of what it is. What does it mean to be an

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
active citizen? What does it mean? And so I guess the thing that I want to start with

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
is because all of us are familiar with this aspect which is arguing

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
online about politics. How do we do that right?

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
Like I guess to start, I did

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
like actually write a post because I'm a terrible person

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
who writes blogs forever. But the first thing

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
I think to start with is always to have an idea of what you actually want to get out of the

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
discussion. Like if you go into a political discussion and your aim

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
you don't know what you want it to look like when it's done you're going to end up

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
in a flame war where you call somebody cunt. It's going to happen.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Because you're secretly like not...that's what you actually are burnt up about.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
You can actually do yourself good

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
and do the other people good by actually knowing that that's what you're thinking first of all.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Let's do an example of how to...

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
So if I'm just sitting over here stewing, so first of all

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
if I'm mad, I hate women. Like let's say

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
let's just hypothetically say

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
I hate women. I just heard about the Wonder Woman premiere

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
or the Wonder Woman screening where you're not allowed to have men at the

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
thing, at the Alamo Draft House. So I just read about that on Facebook

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
and now I'm real mad or maybe I'm not even acknowledging that I'm mad

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm bemused. Because people don't understand

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
how illogical it is but like what should I be doing

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
in my status update or like is that the first mistake

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
is that people don't start discourse that way. They don't be honest and say this is how

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
I feel. I think first of all would be like

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
what kind of topic do you actually want to cover? Because if you want to just talk about how you feel about something

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
there's so much space for that. There's a lot of it but you know if you want to use

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
social media as your therapy session, which is totally cool, just acknowledge

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
that that's what you're doing because then people don't want to engage with you.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
If you're like having those feels, I feel like that's not a great way to start

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
a political discussion. I think the easiest way

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
I don't know, I was really upset about

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
I think the thread that you noticed that got you to follow me

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
was the one about Bernie Sanders. And I started from this place where

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I was like wow I've got a lot of thoughts about Bernie Sanders but so many in my head

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
so maybe I should like put them out there. And I started from this place

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
of like I don't want to be confrontational. I don't want this to be like oh my god

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
I hate Bernie, all of you can suck it. So I came from another place because

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I know that that was going to end badly. So I was like okay let's talk about

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
why people don't like Bernie Sanders. Let's talk about that first.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Let's talk about why people might not be involved in his campaign or not

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
feel like he insults them or feel they're distant from his

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
concepts. At least if I get that out then at least you know where I'm coming

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
from when I say that I don't like him and I don't want him to be president of the

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
United States. It's not personal

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
my dislike but it means that I have to be honest about where I'm coming from

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
what's motivating me and be able to explain and defend it

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
when somebody comes up to me. So a good place to start from if you just want to vent

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
some stuff which is all of our rights to do.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
It's probably best to just be like the more honest

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
the better. Although some of us are you want to be funny about it and you want to

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
have a point of view and sometimes that involves sarcasm and sometimes that involves like

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
oh the next thing that's going to happen is this and there's not really an argument

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
there. But let's say you were honest enough to say

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
here's why some people don't like the Bernie movement

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
that's why some of us feel a little betrayed even as you feel

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
betrayed and all this stuff and you say these things and you lay out your thoughts.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
So now let's go to the next step which is you're being

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
attacked. Someone's going to talk down to you

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
whatever you want to call it but you seem to have this

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
ability online which was inspiring to me like you don't automatically

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
assume even though you know because

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
back stage and Cody said how many times does it end with a conversion of

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
someone zero absolutely 100% zero ever but

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
people are watching and we're performing on Twitter but anyways

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
answering your question for you. Here comes the I'm going to be like

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
a dummy like a mannequin like

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
I'm going to be like

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
you just said all that stuff about Bernie. So then I respond to you and I say

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
yeah

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
well what makes you because

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
you started it with like this is why some people so I'm going to hit you there and I go

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
what makes you think you speak for the people you think you're speaking for? Why do you think you're

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
speaking for those people? He lost the primary by 4 million votes

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
so I'm pretty sure I'm speaking for a lot of people

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
who didn't vote for him. So then that person's going to get

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
riled up now because you're going down there.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
That person's now riled up because now they're going to go

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
well the reason he lost the primary is because the primary

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
was not a fair fight.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
You can see in the leaked emails that she's

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
conspiring against him the Democratic

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
party is villainous and unfair. I don't know how I fit that in 140 characters but I did.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
No you totally did. So my response also in 140 characters

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
is that

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Bernie basically lost the race around March 1st and

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
you would need to show exactly, explain to me exactly what the DNC did

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
before March 1st that secured the fact that he would never get

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
enough delegates to win the nomination. If you can explain that to me I will gladly take your

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
position, I will acknowledge it, I will say like I totally understand where you feel

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
you're coming from but you got to show me the evidence

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
of a problem that could not be solved by his campaign.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Do you ever have, are you, do you, because I just

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
like what, because this isn't going to fuse, maybe let's

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
learn a little bit about your like from birth forward, like your early

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
story. Because I'm curious about

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
how after that election and those spreadsheet results

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
where certain demographics were revealed to be

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
just as chaotic as life itself.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Things that we thought if you had this quality or that quality from birth

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
that, so how, and then that has put us

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
all into a tizzy and there's

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
actually on that spreadsheet as I said after the election if you cross

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
all of it, it's like there's one group of people that should be taking their hands off

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
the wheel right now and be more jaded than ever and that's black women

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
because they turned out to the polls and like

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
I don't know who those 3% were, 2% or whatever it was, but it was like

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
and did you, well go back to that first of all, did you feel a

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
betrayal the next morning?

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
From your other Democrats? From white people?

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
From white people. From white women?

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I mean you expected it from white men maybe, but were you shocked

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
that women didn't wonder women it through

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
as one gender?

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
I guess, first of all I was kind of in a coma after

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
the election results because I was with my best friend and we were hanging out

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
and we were so excited and then I started calling Florida and I was like

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
oh this is not good, this is not good and my friend was like

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
freaking out because she was, I mean we're both black women

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
and she was freaking out and she was like we go and die, we gonna die

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
and I was like maybe not, maybe something will happen and then she'll win

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
and then we won't die and it didn't work out like

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
that, fortunately we're both still alive. I kept yelling at Cody

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
like he's not winning, you know like I was like

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
I was like mad at her for thinking it was possible

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
for women to have their hearts broken. Like no, it's not gonna

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
happen, you don't get the universe, okay?

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
So I did feel to a certain degree I was like this wasn't supposed to

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
happen, the numbers weren't supposed to work like this, I had

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
I mean I grew up in local politics so I actually

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
did my first door-to-door petition drive at three.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
This will stop any minute now. That's my car I think.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
It was really mad about me talking about freedom.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Just hearing those labels you're gonna ring ting tingling too.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Wait, take us to the moment of birth if that's not too invasive.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
Oh no, it's definitely not invasive. How long was the labor? What hospital?

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
No, are we born and raised in New York? Yeah, I was born and raised in New York

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
both of my parents were like very civically minded. My mom

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
curses too much to be an elected official so she never really got into

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
the negotiation of politics because she doesn't have patience. Can you do an impression of your mother

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
cursing? No, no, I've died.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
By the way, I'm from the future coming through a portal into your mother's kitchen about her political

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
career. It's not because of your swearing, it will only ever be because you're a

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
woman. We are going to elect a man who talks

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
like a sewer and in all the ways that really matter

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
and then I'm gonna go back through the portal and enjoy a nice

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
cocktail. Yeah, no, that's good. And then

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
my dad was an actual local elected official. He actually

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
helped preserve a local train line that was going to get

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
torn down and I got a chance to ride on it because he'd done all that work.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
And it was really cool to kind of grow up in local politics except that

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
knowing all your politicians, local politicians means that you find them really

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
human and really petty all the time. But it was a good

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
experience to see what it looks like to do all the time, like

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
petition drives and try to get people involved and all that other stuff. And then

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
after the election, I was sitting there after having spent lots of

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
hours yelling at my television about like, that doesn't matter!

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Doesn't matter! Doesn't matter that he loves golf!

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
Like, why does anyone care? Who is talking about these really important things?

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Like, are we going to upgrade our energy grid? That's really important. We can't

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
just let it sit there for the next 20 years, deteriorating. Is anyone going to talk about

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
global warming? Is any, like literally at all, like just maybe like five minutes

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
could you just ask him a question about climate change? And then if he doesn't answer

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
correctly, because there's a correct answer, there's only one answer actually. There's literally

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
he, there's no multiple choice. It's like one answer. A, the Earth

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
is getting warmer. B, the next question would be what are we going to do

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
and the answer is fix it. That's like, there are only two answers to those questions.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
You were talking backstage about the original zero sum game, which sounds

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
exactly like that, which is human rights. Because, and you take it,

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
you're telling me things about the Dixie Cratson and history that I'm

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
just here to absorb. Because I was thinking about

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
Soylent or something for those years. So like,

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
human rights used to be a part of the Republican party platform. When they

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
started, like when the Republicans party started. And defining human rights, because now

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
we live in this post-nationalist, like do we meet American human rights or do we meet

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
any human rights when you're talking about slavery? There's kind of like no

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
separation between American human rights, just regular human rights. They're the same

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
they're the same concept. And when you're talking about

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
the ability to access your civil society, like if that's the standard that you're setting

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
for your citizenship, like white dudes get to participate in society. That's

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
that's a human right. At that point, it's not like a right for a particular

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
group. If it's necessary to make it possible for that entire group to

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
vote, then it's necessary for everyone to be able to vote. That's how it should work.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
The only reason we have an age cut-off is because you met 17-year-olds, like no.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
They're not allowed to do anything. Yeah, I don't want a world run by

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
me at 32 or five seconds ago.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
We move forward and we grow. Hopefully the society, whatever. Why am I

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
doing this?

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
A sidebar on that, because I keep reading about voter

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
suppression. I get gerrymandering. I understand that a little bit.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
That's simply the horrible kind of sometimes functional,

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
but ultimately erosive process of playing chess with like

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
where districts are drawn so that blah blah blah. We all know what gerrymandering is

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
and how that is voter suppression. What is the what is the shit going on with

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
like why is it really as simple as

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
like with voter ID laws? Talk about the state of

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
affairs with voter ID laws. Is that different from state to state? I'm lost there.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
Every state gets to determine what it's going to do with its own election, which is

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
a good thing in some ways and bad thing from like a national perspective when we're voting

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
for president because it's really annoying. State by state

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
basically what you can do is you can create a standard for voting.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Once you do that, you basically can control the rules of

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
what it means to get to participate in voting. I know that there was

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
an automatic voter registration bill that was going through in Nevada. I believe

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
there's a state or two that's working with on it. It might be Oregon. Oregon actually

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
passed it, which means that you're automatically registered at 18 and you have to

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
go and deregister or something like that in order to stop being on the voter rolls

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
or death certificate. That means that

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
voter suppression works this way, which is basically if you set a standard

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
that only some people can meet, even though everybody's an eligible voter,

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
then you get to choose who filters through.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
That's what voter suppression is about. You can apply a drug

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
test. How does an ID, how does the idea

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
of needing an ID, how does it

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
talk about that filter as an actual manifestation? The first thing is

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
is that they use the fact that only some forms of ID

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
are legitimate ID. Your college ID is not a legitimate form of ID

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
even has your address on it. That means college students now have to get

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
a separate ID in the state with all their birth information, rather

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
than just being able to use their student ID to vote. You can register

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
at school, at college, and vote. Actually, again,

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
my bestie was in school in Philadelphia and she voted out

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Rick Santorum and that was one of her great, she's always like, I can die now.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Having done that, I voted out Rick Santorum that feels so good.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
She didn't need to present photo ID,

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
she was able to go present the evidence that she lived in Philadelphia

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
as her means of doing it. Right now what happens is that

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
with voter ID laws, basically what they do is they set a standard

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
that you have to meet. You have to bring your birth certificate or this. How many people

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
right now in this room can tell, say specifically where your

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
birth certificate is right at this moment? Not me. Anybody, how many people?

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
17. Okay, everybody who did not raise their hand, you can't vote.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
Yeah, I mean, just adding any, it just occurred to me,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
adding any hoops, even if they're

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
seemingly not, like they're not like, hey,

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
if you are a fan of the patriots, you need to,

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
the filter only needs to be a filter in order to slow down

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
poor people, young people, people

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
that are working a lot. It's like any extra steps, the harder

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
you make it to vote, the more, I think that's essentially

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
well, it occurs to me, we're down a fucking branch

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
that I took you down because, okay, voting is a human right.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
That is a, that's an argument that we're

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
still having needlessly. The idea that voting is a human right

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
forget about shelter, medicine, all these things. So take

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
us back to somewhere around the 1800s

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
about, and let's step forward where human rights is like this

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
issue that starts fragmenting us into

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
weird bedfellows. I mean, it's always been fragmenting us.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
So let's start from the basic sentence, the basic concept, right? The idea

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
of America is that it's not based off of where you came nationally, you know, it's always the dream.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
It's the mythology that we talk about on July 4th is that we built a country

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
on ideals and you could come here and you could dream what you wanted to

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
dream, you know, dream the impossible dream, all of that. I can't sing so I'm not going to

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
try it. But the point is that you can

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
there's this notion that we were built differently

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
and we had explicitly

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
human rights as part of our declaration. You know, they talk about tyranny and

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
bloodshed and controlling us and we deserve the right, we are endowed

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
by our creator, whoever that is. And like come on

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
they said it right up there, we're endowed with our creator with certain inalienable rights.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
And among these is the right, you know, all those happy

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
rights that they talk about. That you come out of a womb or even ostensibly

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
that constitution holds up to us being test tube babies. Sorry to cut you off

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
but I saw a sci-fi angle here. You're coming into this world one way

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
or the other but the constitution is this document, like they sat down

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
and they said let's form this labor union of a country, this hotel lobby of a country

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
that says no matter what happens, no matter what anyone would try to use it as an excuse,

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
that the idea is that everyone in this country

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
as soon as you draw your first waking breath

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
you are actually, you have these

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
rights. They are not given to you, I know I sound like a sixth grade teacher but I was just like

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
we have forgotten that in our bones, right?

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
And well early on so continue. Yeah so except for slaves

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
like the rule was like everybody who's a white

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
dude has inalienable rights but I don't know about the rest of you.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
Like maybe white women, I don't know, we're working it out.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
Well we're kind of masters of the unspoken exception.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
If we had to write it goes back to that thing. If you had to declare, like if you were passionate

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
at the framing of the constitution you would have to write it in like look black people

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
let's write about them for a while and you'd have to do it but

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
you don't have to do that when you're, you can just say all people

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
are created equal and I'll find out what I mean by that later but for now

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
I mean Phil and his cousin Tony. Anyways

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
sorry, it's these negative spaces that we're now like coming to bear out and that's

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
why there's amendments and that's really because we didn't, by the way

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
you're talking mean this, go please continue.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
So then leaving people out of that discussion of human rights

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
eventually fractured the country in two because one group was like nah they definitely don't

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
have human rights and the other group was like maybe they do.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
Just a little bit, just like maybe a handful of human rights are not like equal to us

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
but they seem to be human. I think actually after quite a lot of time

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
they do appear to be human beings so we might need to just

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
set up them as part of the country and they're like whoa you can't do

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
that and then they decide to murder each other over it for about four years

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
and the Republican Party's concept was like

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
we actually recognize that slavery is bad because it infringes upon human

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
rights and they held up that end of the bargain

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
until basically shortly after the

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
basically until 64, 1964 Republicans

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
held on pretty well and the only thing that cracked

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
the black vote away from them was the New Deal policies because they were like wow

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
you screwed up real bad, like we have no money, we might not be able to vote for you again

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
actually, this guy might, FDR might have some solutions for us

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
and we're okay with splitting away from you

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
and you saw the black vote start to diverge and split into two pieces but the reason

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
it didn't go fully democratic under FDR was because they had

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
the Dixie Crack Coalition, the same people at the founding who were like no no no

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
we gotta keep slaves and the same people in 1865 who were like no no no no

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
we have to kill Lincoln and continue trying to impose slavery and the people

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
who terrorized black people in the years between Jim Crow, those people

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
were the same people who've been arguing this entire time like no

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
human rights are not actually fundamental to this republic, they're not

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
they're only for some people. And we're seeing that play out now

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
these words that moved up to six months ago are just grown-up words to me

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
and continued about, I don't care about fucking Medicaid, healthcare, all this shit

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
these words they sound, they're more boring than a

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
Central American country's presidents last name

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
like this doesn't have anything to do with me, Medicaid, Medicare

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
all this stuff but it's like then you peel back the layers

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
and you're like Jesus fucking Christ you just think that cancer is

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
punishable by more death if you're poor than if you're rich

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
which is fucking insane if you wrote it in the crawl of a sci-fi movie

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
and said the people are divided between people that think that if you

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
have a random thing happen to you while you are on American

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
soil and American citizen, if you have sickness

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
which is just a part of life, we believe

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
that then your life should just be shortened by your

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
poverty and no one is having that, I mean now everyone's having that

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
conversation but we're still not just watching Paul

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
Ryan struggle through that power point that he made

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
with like Cranes where he's like he thought he was going to blow our minds

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
I think because his mind had just recently been blown

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
he was like let me break this down like I don't know if you guys get it but

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
basically what people are suggesting is that

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
out of these sick people, do you know what happens when you get sick

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
you can't make money so

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
they're like the poorest people in the world and the sickest

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
this is a problem that solves itself

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
and that's what he was yelling at us and everyone was like

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
what the fuck don't you understand about every step of

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
society that all of us have ever learned since our mommy sat us down

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
and said your roommate needs the rent check

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
I'll bail you out this time but get your shit together or you have to move back

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
home and I make fun of you

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
every college kid gets it

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
I don't know what my question is

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
so where do you stand, this is an interesting segue into this

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
I'm getting the impression then that you're probably not one to

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
where are you in all this

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
this trees in Russia like

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
soap opera, I'm guessing your answer is to the extent that it's

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
there's evidence and rule of law let's proceed forward but let's not

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
let it distract us from the occasional law being pushed forward

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
it's the most important thing that's ever happened in American

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
democracy I knew it

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
because

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
a hostile foreign actor totally

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
went into our most sacred institution and fucked it all up

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
am I allowed to say that

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
if you want to talk

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
there's the metaphor of the body politic and people use that all the time

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
imagine voting as being your spine

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
you wouldn't be like we're cool

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
you'd be like no that really fucked up my whole life

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
my perception is that people are distracted first and foremost by this

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
victory parade they're having which is not happy at all

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
and that they perceive that they don't even

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
get to start going down the block before people are pouring weird

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
they think that people are cheating by going like Russia Russia Russia

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
and I think that the biggest thing that they don't understand

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
the people that are still bothering to like go come on get over it

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
where's the evidence I'm tired of hearing this

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
is that they think that at the end of this whole process

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
Hillary Clinton gets to become president because they cheated

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
she should

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
put extra votes in there

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
is that like if you were to cheat in like a local election

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
and they found out they would just nullify the election your opponent would win

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
that's how it works there's no complicated thing there

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
but it depends on your definition my impression is that what we're debating with them

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
because it seems like to the extent maybe Spencer you can jump in or you have a beard

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
but it seems like we've long since kind of dropped

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
maybe we'll find out more but right now

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
we're sort of like not worried about

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
the results of the election we saw them

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
they bummed us out and were surprising but at the same time

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
like it's fine and is the result of

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
this constant effort on the part of a foreign hostile

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
former superpower the most dangerous psychological

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
post internet fucking threat you could have that what we've learned about Russia

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
is that that's how they handle their satellite states that's how they like

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
they've just been like they have troll farms all that shit is real

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
and that doesn't mean that if we prove collusion

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
someone else gets to be president except for the fact that you can't be president from prison

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
but I think

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
the people that are still hanging on are really even

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
dumber than me about politics and are thinking stop trying to act

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
but this election is not going to stick and I'm like it's stuck

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
now he goes to prison what happened I mean

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
prison that's really hard to do impeachment yeah it's really

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
hard we've never put a president in prison another thing is that

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
I like to think about this like it's kind of scary don't don't freak out everybody

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
but like we're kind of in the place right now that we were before the civil war where like

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
there's no real chance to like the only thing that fix the civil war

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
was the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution like there was never

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
any like hey I don't know can we just sit down and talk about whether or not

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
it's okay to leave the United States over slavery can we just let's just have to sit down have a

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
conference and we'll talk it out like we need to build a process and it's going to be

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
like the craziest thing we've ever done is to build a process to deal with the reality

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
that an election was stolen at this level and if we

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
don't figure that process out what did I say to you

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
during the opening monologue

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm sorry I like him

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
he's so passionate sorry why did we

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
why did I operate in tandem with this guy to derail you

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
it's like you're a writer, you're a blogger, you're an activist

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
like how are you going to help save the world

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
you've got to help us and what's the next steps that we have to do

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
in case you can't tell my solution is fly her out, let her talk

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
and then I'll just worship her, vote for you, then my problems are solved

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
anything can I get back to Mario Kart

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
that is what everyone's dealing with is both inside them

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
and with any people that they choose to talk to is like man we all

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
it was working

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
I wake up every day I think like a lot of people do with this kind of dopamine drip of

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
Donald Trump juniors doing this thing we did it

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
they're all going to jail, they're not fucking going to jail, they're not going away

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
well it took six years for Nixon he won two elections by a landslide

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
and then had to find his own shame at the end of that

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
story still and that cascaded from

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
your grandma and uncle and people at Thanksgiving not having facebook

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
to bolster them every morning with more emphatic

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
outrage but in fact they had to come around to, I think Nixon's a dick

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
sick of it, sorry I told you you're a lesbian

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
that's a hard line to take, Nixon's a dick

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
you know what he's tricky too, I wish there was shorthand for any of this

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
but honey there's no facebook yet, I've got three pigs to slaughter before lunch

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
I leave town every couple weeks and I turn off the news

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
and I don't read a paper and I come back assuming that Donald Trump

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
killed a kindergarten because it seems

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
like he will one day and they're always in trouble

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
there's always some bullshit in the news cycle and then nothing happens

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
and we all think it's going to be fixed but it's not going to be fixed

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
we actually have to revolt at some point, we have to

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
take it to the streets, well let's get back to this amendment

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
let's make three new amendments, do you think it's called

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
taking it to the streets? Are you suggesting that maybe we take our lumps with

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
Trump and let this cancer ride out knowing that we are bombarding it with the chemo

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
of fucking holy shit what the fuck have we done that's going to make us sick

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
but that if that stops the

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
cancer of fascism that the thing we need to do

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
is beat this metaphor dead

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
take on the dietary and environmental changes

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
are you talking about election protection amendments

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
like things that actually federalize and centralize the election process

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
and make it hack proof because I felt like the hacking

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
was cultural in this case, it was like Russia taking advantage of the fact that we're all

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
like so what do you think

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
what do we need to change

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
if you're not thinking about impeachment or arrest

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
I'm definitely thinking about both impeachment and arrest but we've never had

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
a significant portion of our line of succession all removed

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
simultaneously and of course if, let's just be honest, if he

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
stole an election he's not legitimately president, if he stole an election Mike Pence is not legitimately

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
vice president, we don't have any idea what's going on with Paul Ryan

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
but I strongly believe that he probably had

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
some idea since he used to hack DCC, DCCC emails

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
against house candidates which means that he either didn't know

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
he was using stolen information from Russia or he knew and just didn't care

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
I think Paul Ryan stole our hearts

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
he's a dreamy

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
that lizard face

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
but okay so yeah

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
because that's what we're all thinking right now, like we wake up

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
at that fucking meeting where somebody

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
made the reference before I did, I thought I'd be the oldest person on Twitter and go

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
yeah, Serrano's got the discs which is a reference to Midnight Run in which

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
the resolution is all Robert De Niro

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
has to do is to get crime boss Tony Serrano

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
to accept discs that it's been established Serrano believes

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
are fruit of the hacked election

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
yes, like a Russian government lawyer

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
and it's amazing that they identify themselves that way

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
because the Russians probably are going

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
when you're Russia, everything you do is a win-win-win-win-win

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
there is not even one lose in there, there's no wrong move for Russia to make

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
they can just email you and go, hey we've got naked pictures

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
of Hillary Clinton, hey I've got naked pictures of your mother too

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
they can just send out whatever they want, any meeting you take

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
now they've got you for that, and then the further

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
the relationship deepens, the more stoked they get

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
the longer they wait, the more they offer up

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
and you have to figure that combined with the collective IQ

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
of the Trump team who never thought they were going to win

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
like they've got to be in so fucking deep it's insane

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
so then we all wake up realizing this, we're all starting to realize this

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
that this treasonous path probably very likely, Occam's razor says

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
these motherfuckers, like before they knew

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
it was even possible to commit treason, when all you want to do is

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
just win the presidency, they committed treason so long ago

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
we're going to find it out, and then you just like, wait what

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
we're all just sitting here going, then what do we do?

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
there's actually no actual process for that or answer

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
I kind of wish I could give one, the answer

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
I think we talked backstage, it was about

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
know what you want to see, right, so what do we want to see?

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
like imagine, like really imagine right now

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
like the president of the United States has not been legitimately elected

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
none of his cabinet can take over for him, not his vice president either

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
we have no system whatsoever has ever had this happen

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
so what do you, what happen, what do we as citizens want to see?

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
because if you can't figure out that next step, which is like we will re-run the election

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
we could, we have the money, it's not like we can't afford to run a second election

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
then the problem is republicans have to put somebody new up

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
should we give them the opportunity?

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
you know, should we just claim that it's illegitimate

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
have installed Hillary, that's going to go well

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
people will be very calm

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
you know, so the problem is that you need to know what you want to achieve first

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
and then the answer is to start working backwards

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
so what can we do as citizens to make it easier to understand

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
what that result should look like

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
and I honestly believe that we should declare the election illegitimate

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
and Hillary Clinton should be president of the United States

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
and I don't just say that because I really liked voting for her

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
but also because, I mean in all honesty that's what happens with virtually

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
every other contest that we've ever run where we find somebody cheated

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
we're like every other time in all of the history of the world

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
when we're like, hey, turns out you're a fucking cheater

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
you actually totally stole that thing

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
you don't get your medals, you don't get to win the game

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
you're a race in the history books

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
we remove things, like that's just how it's always gone

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
it happens in local elections

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
when am I allowed to make fun of Barron?

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
what age does he have to be before we can go?

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
there's a statute on that one

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
you are clearly, because I've got so many tweets just backlogged

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
yeah

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
oh my god, I can't, talk a lot

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
like many of the things that I want to see

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
are felonies to say out loud into a microphone

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
I've researched it

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
one of them may or may not be, like I just can't

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Barron's adulthood in general

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
I can't wait until he's walking around

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
I am endlessly entertained by Donald Trump Junior

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
I think because I just like, he

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
it's like

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
his tweets like, and with his avatar

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
with that hair and his face

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
like I just regressed to

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
a time in every cell in my body

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
when I was absolutely the underdog

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
I didn't know that I would find out 40 years later

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
that, you know

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
that my view of things is limited to where I turn my head

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
but when I knew I had righteous anger

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
when I knew who the bad guys were

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and why I was a hero

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
that fucking kid, and I'm calling him a kid

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
because his dad calls him a kid, which is part of the problem

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
he's my age

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
he's such a villain

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
he's always been a villain

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
and I love that he's entered the fucking forefront of everything

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
it makes me so happy

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
now I'm rooting for

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I'm rooting for evil to have happened

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
I'm rooting for him to disappoint his father

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
I want one of the two of them

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
mythically

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
for federal officers listening

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I just, I just, I just

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
I want the whole thing to end in all of them

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
in a reservoir of dogs crossbow fight

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
crossbow

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
where a secret service like

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
commander, whatever their highest ranking official is

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
has been locked out of the room

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
like a firewall

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
like in that life movie

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
with Jaygills

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
they're on the space station

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
and the octopus monsters

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
firewalls, and they're locked out of the oval office

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
they're like, we need to be in there

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
and then they come in and it's like

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
people are talking about what happened with flowcharts

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
for six years

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
because all you see is just

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
they all did it to themselves

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
like there's just crossbow bolts everywhere

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
and freedom

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
a vacuum of freedom

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and then from then on the oval office

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
is like this weird place where like

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
well we couldn't tear it down

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
but here's where the tour gets

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
even more interesting than it used to be

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
it was already the

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
thing you were looking forward to

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
now it's also got a lot of

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
ghost stories

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
we don't need them to have crossbows

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
we just need to make it like hemophilia

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
they should all just die of some sort of weird

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I don't want to wait those that many generations

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
like

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
did you just fart or was that your chair?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
okay, I thought

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Dan, when I fart you'll fucking know it

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
that's what I thought

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
that's what I thought was happening, I thought you farted and I knew it

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
the one who heard it

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Keeland Turden

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
so what about you personally

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
as a person

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
part of what's inspiring

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
about you is

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
you have that I don't want to

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
be your Joan of Arc

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
stop treating me like something that's going to solve all your problems

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
vibe which makes me want

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
to treat you like that

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
just tell me what to do and tell me what to think

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and I'll vote for you, do you have political aspirations

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
do you want to?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
no, I don't

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
you will never see my name on a ballot

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
not ever

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
not good, not good over there

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
but does that to say

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
there's sideways

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
like your citizen zero blog

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
yeah, why be a politician if we are the people

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
yeah

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
first things first is that I am not

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
polite enough to be

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I have a really high standard for elected officials

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
and especially when you grow up with them

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
you see

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
a lot of their foibles

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
but also a lot of

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I'm going to be really nice to my local politicians

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
a lot of kindness

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
a lot of patience

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
there are people who are going to ask you some of the stupidest shit you've ever heard in your life

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and you're going to have to be like

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
yes, I understand your issue

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
it is really terrible that the lines are that

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
particular shade of yellow

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
in the two lines are

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
it's so tough, I understand

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
I will definitely take that up

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
at the next council meeting

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I will absolutely do it

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
they walk off and you're like

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
what's that?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
you're looking at your local people

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
and you're just looking at them like your staff

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and like did that really just happen?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
did someone just yell at me about the shade of yellow

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
on our streets, okay cool

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I just want to know that happened

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
and then you go back to doing real hard work

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
and I don't have any patience for that

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I would just be that person like

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
did you come to me with that?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
that's my time

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I only have so much time alive and you chose to spend

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
five minutes talking to me about that

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
that's not okay

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I'm overpaid in the standard salary

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
and correct me if you think I'm wrong

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
but it seems to me that

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
our class of politicians from top to bottom

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
has become an inversion

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
of that demographic

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
we all went to high school

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
with people that we

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
remember and go like

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
you know that person should have been an alderman

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
that person should have been president

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
because

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
actually they would enjoy civil service

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
they would enjoy

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the drudgery of it

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
they like to be fair

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
they don't blow their stack when they talk to idiots

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and those people are

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
180 degrees

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
on a different road

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
they're directed that way by

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I don't want to say Hydra

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
but I don't want to get into a

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
conspiracy theory like a reptilian

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
alien that's taken over our earth

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
but there's definitely

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
there's a problem there and it all

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
comes back to the individual's definition

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
of what it means to be an American citizen

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
which we have been

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
especially recently but probably for my entire life

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
we

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
we feel like we got born here

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and then there's this immigration thing

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and the whole like

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
melting pot thing and we learned that

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
in high school and school house rock videos

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and the

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
idea of gaining citizenship and that

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
meaning like you just have like a card

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
that says you can participate

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
but like what it actually

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
means to be the citizen of a Democratic Republic

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and so

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I don't want to put you on the spot

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
as much as I want to gain some clarity

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
in my life

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
what do I do differently

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
we have people up here and I ask

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
all the time so what do I do

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
so we've all heard

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
you gotta call your so and so

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
you gotta do this and that

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I don't

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
yes it should be

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
it should be working we should want to figure it out

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
is there

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
a way to like get a better map

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
of it like how much of my day

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
is given over

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
to being a citizen if I'm an active

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
participant in that role

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
well I would say

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
well first thing that I want to say

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
is that I'm hoping to build a system

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
if you guys go to citizenzeroproject.org

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
or.com

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I own both

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
it's all it's just good it's good for brand

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
so

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
if you go there I actually have a project

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
that I'm working on

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
which would be an online web portal

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I really want to build this

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
where basically people could log in

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and find out like all the things that their

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
elected officials have been doing and you get updates

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
like every week every two weeks or every month

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
depending on when you wanted to see it

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and you'd be able to like build a report card

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
so it would like summarize a lot of the stuff

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
that you do and don't agree with your elected officials about

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
that way you wouldn't actually have to do all that

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
legwork by yourself because that sucks

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
like it really does and I do it

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and I spend way too much time doing it

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and it's really exhausting

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
on the basic citizenship scale

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and like the national scale I should say

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
that you should probably be on top of at least

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
you should have like one issue

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
you really care about at least one

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
it doesn't have to be like very fancy

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
or anything like that you just be like wow

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
those stagnant pools of water are totally going to attract mosquitoes

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
it's gross if you're aware

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
of something like that in your neighborhood

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I know it's really small and stupid but like

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
that's a thing

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
we care about that thing

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
but what if you want to be a nice person

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
so I have a stagnant pool of mosquitoes

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
in my, I see it's two blocks away

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
now I'm going to definitely

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
the person in me that's both nice

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and that wants to just get back to Mario Kart

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
that's a dangerous

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
combination of agreement because both of them

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
say don't

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
because you're going to call

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
a congressperson about

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
stagnant pools of mosquitoes and you're going to be an idiot

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and you're someone's going to answer

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
that you're going to feel dumb and disempowered all day

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
you're going to get on a phone tree and all this stuff

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
there's a first step there that's like

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I don't know who to call

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
an alderman, an ombudsman

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Comptroller

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
is there like

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
that's why I said I don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to make

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I don't want to make

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
humanities

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
tendency to be a robotic

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
coward your fault and problem

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
to solve

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
but the closer we could

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
get to like actually

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
here's how you do a layup or whatever

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
so that if

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
you want to expand on it

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and make your own style that's great but I

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
only speaking for myself

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
that's how I feel about it is being in gym class

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and the coach says it's great it's a layup

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
it's like the most common thing

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
in basketball you just do this and do that

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and then you go like that and I'm like I can't

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
know what the fuck you're talking about

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
slow down

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
what foot goes where first

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
put cutouts on the floor

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
if you really care about me

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
ever caring about this sport

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
you'll like come in my bedroom window the way

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
video games do and say

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
just push this button

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and like

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
or do we say stop catering

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
to that and fuck you if you can't

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
be a man

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I would say that the easiest thing to do

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
is just find as I said find

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
an issue a lot of it's easy

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
when staying at mosquito water

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
say mosquito water or you can choose something

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
at a national level climate change

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
is a big one net neutrality

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
net neutrality so I know I should I call my

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
congressperson and go hi

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
my name is so and so I but

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
you know I'm concerned about net neutrality

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
don't start with the call

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
that your congressperson unless you know what you're

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
going to say before you pick up the phone

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
in all honesty that's why you feel disempowered

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
all day is because you started out

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and you're like I feel really strongly

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
you get on the phone with a representative

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
like a person they're like so

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
why and you're like because

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
feelings I have

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
so many feelings because I watched

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
John Oliver last night

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
well God for I mean if you watch

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
John Oliver then you kind of know what to say

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
what about the people what about the people

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that don't that feel

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
like like I look I'm

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I'm doing this like I

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
there's gotta be people who are more

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
scared than I am of getting on the phone

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and having who answers

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and what do you like

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I like I like you

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
you say like know what you want

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
but you grew up around politics like it's

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
possible you see

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
more of the fishbowl than I do

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I again I

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
would actually start like much smaller

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
which is instead of

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
trying to make the action go outside of yourself

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
just figure out like literally spend some

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
time I would say like an hour

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
a week maybe an hour or two

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
just sitting around and being like okay what is about this issue

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
like who's talked about it who's an expert

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
in this issue that I care about you care about

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
net neutrality you should be reading up on

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
as much stuff about where it comes from

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
what the term means

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
you should at least know the basics of that

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
term and it really just takes like that's just like

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
an hour a week that's just and then

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
when you're ready you can take a whole month

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
if you want to a whole four hours

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
and then once you've looked at something

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
for four hours and you can say like do I want to call

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
my congressman over this like first of all

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
you'll learn just by checking up on that

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
issue for four hours

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
like okay this is who's responsible

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
like you'll learn like okay we need to

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
talk to federal people because you'll see in their

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
research you'll be like whoa this is a

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
federal issue it's definitely not something for

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
my state legislator then you might check on

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
something like climate change and find out well we're

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
in California you're just gonna be your state

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
all right well let's do an exercise I'll be

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I'm gonna be this and

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
the fun thing about this is you can't do wrong

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
because I'm live

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I'm a manifestation of my own

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
fear in this exercise

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I'm the person on the other end of the phone

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
you be you

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
you're a citizen you're activated about an

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
issue you don't even have to tell me what it is

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I'm answering the phone at the

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
house of representative level

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
for your district

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
all right are you gonna make this ringing

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
sound effect or should I

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
you should definitely do the ringing sound effect

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
ring

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
oh

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
okay

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
good afternoon

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
congressman she's spandam and this office

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
hi I'm Caitlyn

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I'm really interested in

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
our roads and bridges

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
okay do you have an appointment to speak

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
an appointment to speak

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
yeah I'm a citizen of the United States

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I don't need an appointment to speak to my congressman

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
yeah

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
speaking hours are from

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
3 to 5 every Tuesday except Wednesday except every

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Thursday is Tuesday

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I would say

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
that my first amendment

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
right is open anytime

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
okay yeah first amendment

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
meeting is

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
okay bye thanks for calling

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
cool

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
so that doesn't happen right

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
that's my fear that is from my first fear

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
this is

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
a healthy exercise like that doesn't happen

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
it doesn't happen

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
because it happens

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
when I need my teeth fixed and it happens

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
like

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I don't know or maybe it just only happens in my

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
fucking head

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
like when I need my driver's license renewed

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
but that doesn't happen

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
no it does not happen you don't need to

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
worry about your congressman's office

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
blowing you off because that's

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
in general when they are discredits on the

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
phone they find out that that person was

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
actually really important and now they've got

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
like a donor who's going to be like

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
hey I am my

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
my sister called up and you treated her

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
horribly and then as a sudden it's like oh I

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
just lost million dollars thank you

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
that's what happens actually

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
can you guys reverse roles and Dan you call

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
her up

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
take us at least that far and then we can

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
move forward from there so I'll do what you

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
did I think

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
but I'll probably offend you

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
that means you have to do the ring

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
sound okay

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
ring

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
ring

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
ring

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
oh wait I should already be on the phone

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
hey you called her

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
hi this is the congressman

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
love as office how can I help you

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
yes I'm very concerned

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
fuck hold on a second

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
oh

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I forgot what I was concerned about

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
you're not concerned about anything

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
were you concerned about net neutrality

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I was concerned about roads and bridges

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
sorry

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I forgot

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
hi this is

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
hi I'm concerned

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
about roads and bridges

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
okay that's great

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
what specific road

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
or bridge were you worried about

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I mean we take our federal bridges

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and stuff

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
well I

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
well all I know is

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
all I know

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
is that I drive

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
over the third street bridge every day

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
and it seems

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
to be getting worse and worse I've been taking that route

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
for 30 years and I keep reading these things

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
in the paper about

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
funding and stuff and I just

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
feel like there's so many potholes and it feels

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
like

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
and I see other things about infrastructure

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and other parts of the country I don't want to be one of

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
those cities where

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
people don't say hey

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I want my bridge traversable

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
oh my god

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
yeah we don't want a situation like Minnesota

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
because we're so much better than that

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
fuck those fucking pieces of shit

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
so let me take that

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
you just

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
could tell from my voice that I would

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I would bite on the anti-Minnesotan

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
yeah I

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
totally did and so what I'm going to do

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
is I'm going to take down your concern

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I'm going to route it to the appropriate offices

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I'm going to talk to our legislative aid

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
on infrastructure

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
okay but is this like the run around

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
what are you doing to me here

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I don't know what

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
can I call back later and every time I have a bridge

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
concern

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
if I call back every day

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
do I have to change my voice

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
to be taken seriously

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
and if I continue to be

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
concerned about the bridge every time I answer the phone

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
will you eventually file a restraining order against me

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I don't believe that

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
members of Congress can file

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
restraining orders against

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
are you a member of Congress

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
are you going to call me every day

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
aren't you going to be working there

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
for a while

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I mean like we rotate

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
it's not just me on the phone

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
what's your name

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
what's your name

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Sandy

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I'm Dan

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I'm Caitlyn

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I live in Brooklyn

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
by the 3rd Street Bridge

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
that's really great

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
so I do have to take down the concern

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
because it's a big one

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
it's a big thing to get going

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I can't just do it by myself

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I'm not giving you a run around

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I want to make sure that the concern is

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
noticed, logged, and we know when it came in

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
and then we can talk about

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
because we're having a meeting

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
next week on the bridge

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
we're going to be doing a town meeting

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Martha

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
where's the notepad

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Dan

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
are you pretending to be Caitlyn again

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and bothering your congressman

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I got to write down a meeting

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I pay your rent, dip me a notepad

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
motherfucker

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
so there's a meeting I like to

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I want a divorce

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
excuse me for a second

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
phone

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
down but then you just hear fucked up shit

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
fucked up shit

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I'm not going to do it

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
it'll be trivializing

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
but I'm just saying as a writer

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
you hear fucked up shit

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
the dog's barking and then you hear

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
somebody whimpering

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
and they're like thugs

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
okay

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
so tell me more about this meeting

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I want to be involved in democracy

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
where am I going

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
why am I doing that

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I mean

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I'm going to hang up

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I'm going to hang up and become myself

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
somebody call the police

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
shut up

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
call 911

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
you get in the food hut

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
whatever that means

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
oh my god my face

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
what happened to my face

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
you get in the food hut

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
it's the title of the indie movie that will be made about your experience

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
if you're lucky click

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
okay

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
that's what they like

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
they like human tragedy

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
thank you for that nice applause

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
for domestic abuse

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
that was very nice of all of you

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
well that's the part I didn't want to make a cartoon about

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I thought if it was like a rear window thing

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
where you're like oh my god there's a murder

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
alright but anyways

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and then as a sad legislative aid

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I have to try to figure out

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
what will happen

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
it'll be good

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
suffice it to say

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
if you do

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
there's a million apps and it's a google away

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
this idea of calling your congressperson

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
there's

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
there's pretty much

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
no chance

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
of having the experience that you have

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
if you were to call fries

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
electronics or the DMV

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
or your own dentist

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
like the people

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
on the other end of the phone are

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
like they're

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
they're passionate about politics

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
their job is to pick up that

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
phone you're going to

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
get through it it's okay to

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
maybe even kind of only

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
like maybe be figuring out

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
what the fuck your problem is

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
like a little bit right

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
you'd recommend not doing that

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
not using it as a therapy session

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
but at the same time

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
the thing that keeps me in line is this fear of

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I'm just going to feel stupid

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I mean again

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I think well first of all you got to get through

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
to the line because a lot of the time

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
especially on a big legislative vote

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
they're getting calls from like a billion calls

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
so like the line might get jammed

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
in which case then you can just have

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
the quietly experience existential fear

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
while you're on the hold line

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
but that's kind of it is kind of comforting though

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
if something happens that you're watching CNN

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and you're your internet thing

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and you're like I'm alarmed about this

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and you pick up the phone and it's busy

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
you kind of draw comfort from that right

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
like when there's a blackout or

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
the internet's out and like you call Time Warner

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and it's like your call will be

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
answered in 17

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
thousand hours

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and then there's like an edit in there

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
if you're calling about the fucking internet outage

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
it's being or dealing with it

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
like yeah that would be nice to

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I mean that is totally comforting

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
because it does mean that a lot of other people

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
have the exact same idea that you did

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
when that's always nice to know that

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I mean I think one of the reasons politics is so hard

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
is because we all feel like a little bit like an island

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and you're like oh I'm having

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
all these thoughts or I'm having feelings about politics

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and I want to get involved and it's like

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
it's super intimidating

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
like it's so hard to do that first thing

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and you don't want to go to the meeting

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and you're afraid that you'll be stupid

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
and like the truth is that we're all

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
stupid I'm stupid

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
like I got called an activist I'm not

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I'm like crazy lazy

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
it's unbelievable how lazy I am I just sit around

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and I write things and I have ideas

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but I haven't been to like

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
one of a political club meeting now

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
in like a year because I'm like the laziest person

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I was during the campaign

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and I did some phone banking

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
but I did it like the laziest way possible

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
from my cell phone using the site

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
because like Hillary created a site

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
and you could just randomly phone call

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
people from like all these different calls

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and I was like this is perfect for me

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I'm the laziest person in the world

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I worked the floor below

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
her campaign office

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I literally landed

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I literally did not go inside of it

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
so you're saying if you'd worked a little harder

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Hillary would be in office right now

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
haha

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
we landed at LAX in the middle of the LAX

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
like when the travel ban went up

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and we like landed there

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
came out of first class we had our luggage

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Jeff had his suit over his shoulder

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and we were like oh it looks like a protest

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and we like we hung out there

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
and then for the next three weeks I would shut up

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
about our responsibilities and

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and then I bought a gun

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
because I was just like

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
everything's changing

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I want to shoot it for changing

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
haha

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
what time is it

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
we should probably thank Katelyn

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
for coming up here today

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
we have a more important business to do

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I think they were being very classy

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and didn't want to shout 9-11

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
like they always do at 9-11

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
that's very nice

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I think we live in a world

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
we live in a world

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Katelyn you think you're lazy

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
for not making phone calls more

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
these people didn't shout out 9-11

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
but yeah I mean I guess

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I want to make sure there's an action item

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
or something just for people who are more

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
interested

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
still have more questions all that stuff

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
obviously we've said your twitter name

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
which is Gotham Girl Blue

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and Citizen

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Citizen Zero Project

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
is that the twitter handle

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
that is actually that's not my twitter handle

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
that is the site I literally just upgraded it

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
with all the stuff that the

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
non-profit that I'm working on is going to do

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I can't take donations yet

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
hoping to do so as of August 1st

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
but like there are literal

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
projects that I'm working on

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
whether or not that's creating discussion groups

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
and training other people to lead them

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
whether that is creating the online

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
portal and the app so that way you can

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
do more passive citizenship and you don't

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
have to actually collect all that news by yourself

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
because that sucks

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
or whether or not it's creating a K-8

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
curriculum because I'm working on

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
getting kids to understand that they're citizens

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
so that way you build the habits early

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and then you don't have to worry about doing it

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
as an adult because you've already been doing it

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
yeah that's right

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
okay well we'll cheer for Caitlyn Bird

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
everybody

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
look her up and she'll be back

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
and we'll continue to maybe

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
we'll

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
how we can help you in Los Angeles

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
we'll be like sister cities

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
alright thank you Caitlyn

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
the rest of the show will make no sense to you

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
but you're

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
you can go watch it with Ronald

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
unless you've been listening

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
alright so let's bring up Steve Levy

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Steve Levy

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
to the stage

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Levy in the house

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
or did

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Steve Levyus

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Steve Levy

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
oh

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Steve Levy

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
is upstairs doing lines

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
off another guy's wiener

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Steve Levy

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Steve Levy everybody

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Steve Levy

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
hey everybody

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
sorry church was telling me a fascinating

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
story

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Steve Levy

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
say what? no church was telling me a fascinating

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
story backstage and I

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
about what?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
just personal stuff

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
you see

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
in a more primitive society

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
that would be

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
a huge

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
like you came on stage

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
your girlfriend was off stage telling me some shit

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I can't talk about

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I don't want to

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
you don't want to cause no trouble

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
this is not a forum to disclose anyone's

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
stories

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
don't necessarily

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
alright

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
what's going on?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
we can't tell you

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I got a little educated

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I think

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
the most important thing I learned is

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
it is that membrane

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I'm bad on the phone man

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I tell people to call their congresspeople

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
at the drop

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
of a fucking hat

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and I stand before you naked

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
and trembling at the prospect

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
we've been on a lot of phone calls together and I gotta say

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
some of them you're really great

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
others

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
not so great

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
what is the difference do you think?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
how much attention you're paying

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
how much you actually care about what we're talking about

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
maybe

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
so a bad phone call but one in which

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
everybody wants something from me

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
and I don't know why I'm on the call

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I don't know

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
sometimes you turn those around and it's like

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
you're a hero

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I want to make you name examples

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
so bad

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
but it'll only hurt me

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and you just have this luxury

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
you're like Varys in Game of Thrones

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I don't know who that is

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
look it up

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I don't watch Game of Thrones

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
it's cool

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
so for those of you just joining us

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
tonight

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
we now play a game called Pathfinder

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
which is kind of like Dungeons & Dragons

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
wow laptop

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I'm just checking

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
hey did you

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
did you have any thoughts

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
about

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
you politically?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I know you and I both feel like the world is probably ending

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
oh yeah

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
you're still getting your ham radio license

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
oh man

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
it's going great

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
it seems like it's really hard though

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I could see why they don't want everyone just doing it

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I saw on a Friday

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
something about a ham radio

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
is that

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
are you building a radio

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
on a Friday?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I'm building a radio on Friday

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
alright

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
and it's going to be the biggest radio

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
ever seen on the west coast

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
is your new hobby lying?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I'm working on my improv

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I use it

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
no I did this podcast

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I did this podcast

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
it's called a UCB radio

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I did this podcast on Saturday

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
and I really just feel like I shit the bed

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and so like

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I just want to die

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
oh man

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I just am feeling the worst

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and everyone should download it

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
and not listen it so everyone thinks

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
oh wow it really performed really well

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
but then don't listen to it

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
because otherwise you won't even be able to be honest about

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
you know

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
what did you think you did what are you most embarrassed about?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I just I feel like I'm mechanically bad

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
at talking

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
if there were a race of talking

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I would lose

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
like I would be like a fat person at talking

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
like you talk a lot

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I do but I

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
are you calling him fat?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
he's calling me

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
he's the marathon man of talking

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
well like Malcolm Gladwell

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
10,000 hours it's like

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
you've had a lot of practice at talking

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
but I feel like I probably just don't talk very much

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and I'm bad at it as a result

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
well I don't perceive it that way

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
well I'm just saying that like

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
what thank you so much

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
say what madam what was it

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I will tell you

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
thank you that's so nice

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
it's definitely a soothing voice

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
like that's just

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I just I don't know

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
just couldn't make sense as it was just bad

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
it was bad news I don't even want to talk

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
well especially that you have a chance for redemption right now

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
because now's your chance to talk

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
will you recap our last episode

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
of Pathfinder D&D

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
that's okay

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I wanted to

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I wanted to help him with his

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
anxieties before

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
we could have just teed up

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
the worst D&D ever because he's like

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
yeah I feel like I'm bad at talking

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I fall asleep to you talking

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I'll see you're good at talking

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
yeah maybe well let's do D&D

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
you're in a forest

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
fuck

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
you come upon me in a rope

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I'm in the middle of something

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I don't know I'm not saying you did anything wrong

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I'm just saying like I was worried about

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I wanted to like put a pin in it

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
acupuncture pin

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
do you think acupuncturists have

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
when they say put a pin in it

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
do you think they get confused

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I could just stand up I could just stand up

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
that's a stand up bit

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
do you think acupuncturists get confused

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
man why do people keep talking about putting

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
a pin in it that means deal with it

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
right now

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
when you tell them to put a pin in

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
they're always finishing the task

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
like an acupuncturist

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
comes to your book club and goes like

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
well I think we should have a policy for which books we choose

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
well let's put a pin in that

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm trying to

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
putting a pin right now

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
where was this at the top of the show

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
you're only four and a half minutes away

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
from a set

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
you got that one joke

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
92

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
alright anyway sorry I got excited about that

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
but I want to put an acupuncture pin

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
in your tits

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
and now we don't want to deal with it

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
now

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
he wants to put a pin in your tits

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I mean who doesn't

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
these tits

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
well it's fine

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I just wanted to express that because

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
you know it might come out

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
on the internet sometimes that I was on a

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
podcast

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and I don't want anyone to listen to it

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
but I do want them to download it

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
what I admire about you

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and I think a lot of our audience would agree with me

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
is that when you talk

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
you call your shots and it's usually very accurate

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I was bad

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I agree with that in a general sense

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
on my best times

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
but I was just off my game it's like you know

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
sometimes you have a bad day

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
you know it was just bad but now I'm just

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
sitting in it I'm like man

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I went on kumail

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
and Emily's podcast once and I was so fucking

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
happy because all they wanted to do

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
was talk about video games because that's the whole podcast

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
was about I was so excited just to talk

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
about video games I walked out of there so happy

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
and then like I read

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
two tweets

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
like no one's gonna like tweet and go like that was

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
fine that was fine like it was the two

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
guys that were like don't let Harmon

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
explain computer science ever again

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
he doesn't get it that's not was

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
like he tried like I'm always like

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
wrong about shit I feel awful

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I want to go to a cave and like eat my own leg

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
yeah

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
it's not

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
eating doesn't solve all your problems

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
but unless you eat

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
your own body then you're

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
it solves itself

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
it's kind of like weight loss

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
if you could turn your own body into poop

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
you'd lose weight you could poop your own leg

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
eat your own leg

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
then you got one leg less

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
than I did before I ate my leg

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
but a smart person

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
would say yes but you just cut your ability

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
to exercise in half

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
and you're gonna regret that

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
you're gonna be sitting there and you're gonna be eating

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
you're not gonna be able to eat much anymore

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and you're gonna slowly die

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
so

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
what I'm saying to you is I get it

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
just

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
keep hanging out with me and you'll always

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
you'll always look better

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
last time

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I'm on Harmon Time

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
what happened

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
you guys had just

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
finished the fight

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
and you beat the ghost

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
no you beat the demon freeing the ghost

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
and it took you to the graveyard

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
you discovered that in place

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
of Archer Fell's

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
corpse was the corpse of a rotting dog

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
who's fucked up

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
and then you left you went to Dairy Hill

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and met with Rhonda who took you

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
to meet the

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
other farmer, Manil

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
because it seemed that the farmers were dealing

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
with some ripped murdered cows

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
and Manil was being weird

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
for a while but Diarrhea Junior

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
unleashed the snacks

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
and it seemed to be

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
winning them over and that's where we left it

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
in Manil's

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
farmhouse

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
yeah

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
even that terrible showing

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
was much better than anything I did

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
largely our fault

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
no I'm saying that if you called that good

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
what I did on that podcast

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
was bad

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
all you're making me do

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
is want to listen to this podcast

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
more than I would have already

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
we'll do that

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
it sounds like you're just pumping up the show

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
you're trying to

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I just want people to go well at least he

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
at least he knew

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
it's a good point I mean that's what

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
propels me

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
at least he knew

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
you can't shoot me through a hole I self inflicted

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
right

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
you missed again they never get it

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
they're like bang bang bang

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
what's that hole I'll shoot at it

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
you're like that hurts too

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
shot myself there

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
an hour ago you fucking plebe

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
what's on the sheet

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I don't know I do that with menus too

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Cody busted me today

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I already ordered and I was just like

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
and he's like you ordered

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
put the menu down

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I'm uncomfortable

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
in life

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
you know what DJ

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
you're all right and he starts taking

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
the snacks out of your hands

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
you like

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
you enjoying those snacks Donovan

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
than that guy

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Fel yeah that Tom

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
he's a real piece of shit you know

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
his cows they suck

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
all he did you know he's a bad farmer

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
all the farm crops he was doing he was just

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
trying to feed his cows with them

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
he put all your eggs in one basket that's how

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
it happens I'll go one step further I say

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
he's a bad father he let his son get

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
killed

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I'll go one step further I'll say I wish

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
that someone would go to his house light his

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
like you

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
you have a vision of what the world should look

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
like when you're living in it we already did

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
it we're good representatives

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
of your church right

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
so why don't you reward us

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
with some good old-fashioned

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
information

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000

like who's to blame where

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
can we track down the evil

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
like as it's happening I don't know man

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I'm sitting on a couple of cow corpses if you

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000

he he turns around and

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
he pulls a sheet off of two cow corpses

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
in his main room

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
he's been standing in a we've been

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
standing in a room

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
yeah it looked like like just furniture

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
or something at first

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
how long have they been dead for

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
manil manil donovan manil

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
donovan I'm not judging you

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
you it's an objective truth

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
that you downplayed the cattle mutilation

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
when we came to see you

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
well I you know did you drag

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
the corpses in here really murdered in this

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
room well Ron to help me but no

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
they weren't murdered in this room

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I would have seen who done it

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
no I'm just you know I'm fired up about that

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
son of a bitch Tom and that's what you came

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
in talking about you know it's just

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
it's how we got into your good graces but

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
initially there was like a kind of a force field around the

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
topic of cattle mutilation yeah it was because

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I was so angry do you think Tom

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
fell murdered your

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
cows I don't know you'd

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
have to be some sort of monster to be able to pull

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
that out off not out

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
do you mind if my team

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
and I who are clerical

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
professionals from a church

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
which at this time in this

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
class of society is also

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
the equivalent of being doctors

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
could

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
could we check

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
out your mutilated cows he puts

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
the sheet back over the cows and then he pulls

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
the sheet off again well

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
are you being a little cutesy no I'm just

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
trying to reiterate

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
oh you're saying that

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
when you pull a sheet off a cow the

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
invitation to explore is implicit

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
yeah and I'm a fool for

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
asking permission well you know

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I'm assuming

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
my spell of handle animal won't

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
work on dead cows probably right no

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000

examine the cows get in there

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I use my knowledge of nature

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
on the cows to see what's your

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
what's your bonus there

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000

I use handle animal and I try

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
to I try to convene with the animal to

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
communicate with this animal find out what happened

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
one general it's a

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
stabilized I have a spell

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
cause a dying creature to

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
stabilize don't panic the key is to not panic

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
you cast it

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and it doesn't affect it almost as if

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
it's dead and not alive

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
but you said it was alive

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
oh yeah

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000

I

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I use I use heal on the animal

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
shit zombie I

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I check for dust on the animal

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
it's not dusty

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
does it there's a cow it's

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
a coping mechanism when I fuck up I

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
pretend like I know what I'm doing

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
and I do

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I also sharpen a pencil I do I do

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
things that make it look like I know does a cow open

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
wounds

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
the cow looks like it has these big like

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
like like slash marks

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
you know like from a big creature

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
can I

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
can I use my magnifying

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
lens to look closer

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
at the wounds yeah

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
it's a zombie cow

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
it's an undead cow

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
you see

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
that the cows clearly dead

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
but alive but not alive

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
was it like

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
wait a minute

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
you said it was kind of alive yeah I did say that

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
so undead

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
well can I do Jeff looked at it

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
he thought it was alive

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
oh his because I

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
he rolled that well

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
so I'm just an idiot

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
yeah it's a weird thing to have

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
so low I thought a dead thing was alive

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
oh man

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
and he's the smartest of all three of us

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
why did we just open up a restaurant

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
stop being fucking church people

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
can I determine whether it's like

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
claws or

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
a weapon that yeah they look like

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
big kind of big claws

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
big five five clawed claws

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
you know like a claw

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
oh looks like

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
a monster of some kind

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
murdered these cows

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
monster of some kind

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
never studied

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
knowledge

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
you can't just say the word knowledge

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
you have to

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
make it complete

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
knowledge arcana

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
knowledge history

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
knowledge nobility in case the werewolves

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
that attack this cow is a duke

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
knowledge planes

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
because it's happening on a plane

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
knowledge religion

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I mean I'm running through the gambit

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I have really nothing

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
in all of them they're just checked off because I'm a cleric

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
mm-hmm oh you don't have any of this

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
well it doesn't I mean it

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I mean I have them all checked off yeah

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
knowledge religion is two

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
okay well let's we could try that one

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
yeah

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000
you're gonna find out this cow is religious

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
this cow is Mormon that's fantastic

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
it just seems like it seems

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
like some sort of otherworldly

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
creature you know you can't really

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
see what you don't know what it is

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
like whether it's like a werewolf

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
or like a demon or whatever you don't know

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
what it is but it's definitely some sort

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
of big monster rather than like a

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
natural beast but it looks like the same

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
monster killed both of these cows yeah

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
yeah yeah it's consistent

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
and one was seven days ago and one was three days

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
ago right looks like there's a monster

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
roaming the

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
well look look look

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
if I'm

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
doing the math right

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
seven to

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
you know three maybe it's every four days

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
and because this was three days ago

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
in the next day maybe another cow

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
will be murdered how often farmer

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
manil

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
manil does this take place

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
every four days about well it's been

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
speeding up it actually

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
was happening like once every month or so

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
but then you know these past

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
two have been like once every two

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
weeks and then more than once a week

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
and so now we're just gaining

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
strengths and confidence well good and if we

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
take what if we side I pulled

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I pulled diarrhea and Carlos

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
what if we dress up like

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
these dead cows and

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
go out in the field

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
and wait like wait for

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
we should definitely do a steak

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
how long has it been since the last cow

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
got mutilated three days

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
three days no four days

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
he said three days

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
it's so hot right now it's insane do you have

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
live cows still no there's

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
no more cows there's no more cows no

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
they all got killed there's just two here

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
yeah we're a small town there's only about

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
ten cows at the beginning well what

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
if we got one of these cows and then we

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
wear it and pretend that we're a cow

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
in the field do we have your permission

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
to use your otherwise wasted

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
cows as costumes

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
uh

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I don't know I mean you're gonna have to buy them

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
off me because like you know I can still

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
use this meat

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
wait wait one more question did

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Tom fell have any

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
have his cows murdered oh yeah

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
yeah many we should go over there actually

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
what oh yeah

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
he's got the most mutilated cows

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
in town look there's a couple bargain it twice

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
the price yeah he

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
he's giving his cows away he doesn't

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
deserve any money you know

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
no no we wouldn't look there's some

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
options we have right we could we could

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
steal a cow from Tom and bring it back

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
here or we could pay him for a live

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
cow and bring it back bottom bottom

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
bottom is

bottom is bottom line is

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
hoping to solve the problem that keeps

killing everyone's cows right

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
this feels like a stereotype

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
but

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I I'm gonna

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
talk talk yeah yeah I'll

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I'll lean into it okay

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
um

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
do you have any what other problems you

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
had around the house I mean look we're

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
knowledgeable and we could we could we

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
could barter we could fix some stuff

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
for the cows

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
yeah fix the cows

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
no that's that's not fixable

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
is it I don't know are you

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
we just just get the best price for the

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
cows we're all right we want to we want

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
to take their yeah they're dead they're

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
well what are you asking how many

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
that's what happens at the end of a cow

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
you get a dead cow and

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
then you sell pieces of her for money

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
it's part of being a farmer

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I uh I conjure

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
a flame in my hand

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
and just hold the flame

this is good

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
in there

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
to go back to Tom fells house

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
they have it

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I wasn't going to go back there

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
are they dressed like cows eating hamburgers

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
no no

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
we're waiting the two hours

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
all right

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
costumes they're done

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
okay so now

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
who gets to wear the costumes

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
how many are there

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
there's two cow size

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
costumes

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I want to be in one

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I mean I'm too small to be

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I'm a gnome so I'm too small so you guys

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
well which of you two has the best like

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
ranged

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I have 110 foot range with my bow

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
are you good

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
with a bow

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
obviously

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I'm going here it's like a

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I have a range I mean you guys are big enough

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
to look like cows I'm a gnome I

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
won't look like I think that what should happen

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
is look I'll do the cow

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I'll look like a cow with you but when

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
if this creature comes when it comes

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Jeff should light a ring of fire

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
and then trap it in our little

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
ring so we could square off with it

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
okay I mean I've also got a ranged

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
bow of a hundred feet

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
with piercing

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and I can shoot fireballs

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I can light this monster up

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
with fire okay so

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
you're going to stay back and watch over the

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
perimeter I'm going to hide gnome like

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
in a haystack nearby

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
you guys are going to look like just too

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
too regular work a day cows

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
okay

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
minding their business

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
maybe they look a little worse

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
worse for wear

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I don't think this thing is picky whatever it is yeah

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
right yeah he's going to see two cows

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
moving about and go oh easy pickings

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
what time is it in the day

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
well it's been two hours so it's

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
like one eight one p.m

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
okay all right

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
well why don't we

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
we're well fed

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
you guys go get put your cow costume on

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
let's work on your cow movements

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
yeah let's practice the

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
have a training montage where we learn to

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
act like cows what time general way

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
that you move is it

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
does this thing come at night

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
does the creature come at night

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
yeah the attacks have happened at night

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I mean I could have answered that

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
all right let's go let's go learn to

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
move like cows

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
backyard

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
does it feel like it's working who's watching

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
I'm watching

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
more bovine

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
more bovine

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
do they move one

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
back foot and one

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
front foot at the same time

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
is it like

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I think it's

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I think they go like

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
exactly one

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
one forward on the front one forward

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
on the back

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
that was the whole point of

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
biology

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
you guys are moving too much

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
cows don't really move around

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
all that much

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I just want to look like while I'm standing still

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
look like prey, look like easy food

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
yeah yeah yeah

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
am I doing

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I can't tell

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I lay down like a

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
naked farmer so you guys can suck my dick

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
and kiss me on the face

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
that's a callback to another

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
episode

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
thanks for coming out tonight

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
if it's your first time here

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm just

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
walking around I just want to know

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
from a distance do I look like a cow

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
you guys are looking pretty good

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I'm convinced if I were a cow eating

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
monster I would be all over you guys

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
that's true I'm making

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
my tail move

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I think that's convincing

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
right you guys feel like

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
you're doing a pretty good job

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
alright

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
alright so that took

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
like an hour

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
oh yeah now it's 2pm

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
now it's time to lay low

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
we're well fed we're well trained

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
now it's a waiting game

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
for

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
the monster to attack

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
make sure that beneath your

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
cow hide uniforms

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
that you guys have your weapons ready to rock

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
alright let's just take a quick inventory

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
are we

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
are we doing everything right

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
like just in a larger sense

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
like when I came to this town

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I don't see how this plan could possibly fail

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I just

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
want to ask like how we focused on the right

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
priorities because we

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
we did get sidetracked by

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
what could be called like a distraction

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
like I don't know

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
while Carlos is saying all this I'm getting

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
really method in eating the grass

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
okay

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I'm making a ring

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
of

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
like an open-ended ring of hay

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
that I can light on fire

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
we can lure the monster

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
into that

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
and then you guys could jump over

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
maybe like we could just trap it in a hay fire

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
and cast a fire bolt

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
don't eat the ring of hay

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
he's putting that out there for a reason

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
okay so

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
we got to the town

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
and

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
we got off and we harassed a local

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and then we went to the church

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
and then the church we had a

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
we had an uncomfortable conversation with

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
we couldn't figure out what was going on with them

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
so we went back to the first people

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
and just we did

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
we expelled a ghost

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
the ghost led us to the cemetery

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
the cemetery led us to a dog

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
a dog in the place of their

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
dead daughter

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
we talked to a farmer that was just standing there

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
that's where this breaks down

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
from the A story

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
we talked to the watch lady Ronda

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
who led us to the other farmer

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
who said

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
who sold us his cow hides

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
but in a six person town

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I would say something that's killing

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
two of the people's cows

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
yeah we discovered there's a creature out there

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
we can figure this out if we can solve this

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
we're gonna be cockatawock

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
we're a big shit

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
who knows where this is gonna take us

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
and then we're gonna parlay that into

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
to start turning this town around

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I sit down

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
let's wait it out and I go into

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
a druidic

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
meditation to conjure up powerful spells

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
okay

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
you go into it

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I want to do an offensive load out of spells

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
if we're gonna actually chill

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
yeah there's enough time to change up your spells

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
so I'm doing load out three which is your

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
offensive load out

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
for the kids out there

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
it includes the spells guidance

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
which is just something

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I can just put on somebody that gives them

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
an extra

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
accuracy or something

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
can I change my load out to load out three

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
offensive? oh yeah

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
light, stabilize

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
again you've heard all about that

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
virtue

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
signaling which allows

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
it turns one cock into

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
a beta

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
what does it virtue signaling

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
what does that mean if virtue is a signal to you

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
we've got sociopaths

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
we've got four minutes

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
level

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
and then summon

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
monster and divine favor

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
summon monster is

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
hair trigger

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
can't wait to do that

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
oh can you summon a cow

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
who cares

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
it's fine

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I'm not trying to give you guys

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
the answers

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I mean not that that's the answer

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
so just a summary of your preparations

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
where is this going to go down

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
in which farm, which area

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
we're at Neal's farm

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
outside Donovan Neal's farm

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
just the cow place where cows would be

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
and then you put a circle of hay

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
right and I hide

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
and a hay stack to hide in

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
and these two are dressed as cows

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
in cow form

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
being pretty life like cow

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
eating the grass I heard

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
yeah

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
anything else is that

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
anything else you guys are going to do

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
we've got our loadouts

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
we've got our spells ready to go

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
learn a loadout

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
something

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I know it's zero of that song

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
that song is all frog DNA

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
an an an

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
you learn a spell

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
learn a spell right on me

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
part of my spell craft

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
is there anything I could do to kind of summon

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
these demons

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
bring them out into play

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
uh

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
no

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I mean just the way we're dressed

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
is we're asking for it

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
we're going to wait this out

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
you guys

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
what are your guys HP just to be clear

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
they want to get gone

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
well I haven't been injured recently

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
right so I'm 15

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
have we been healed

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
you guys got in a fight

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I can heal you

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I think I'm 14

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I took a few damage but I ate the good berries

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
right you ate the good berries

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I need healing

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
what kind of healing

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
the burst the blast

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
channel energy

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
he heals them for 10

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
nice that's fully healed

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
thank you

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
silver flame

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
protects all

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
you're right

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
now we just find out

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
if it's worthwhile doing this

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and wait for the demons to attack us

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
alright night falls

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
on the first day

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
you hear something

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
it's the barest slightest of rustling

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
that's coming from

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
uh

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
the north

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
coming from north

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
like

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
everybody play it cool

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
play it cow like

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
we got bogies in the wire

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I move into

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
resting position

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
start eating some of that grass

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
got my hand

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
it's night time

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
and would cows be eating grass

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
at night time

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
um well

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
it just factors

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
into your disguise role

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
God

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
is that

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
the horses make

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
that sound

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
alright

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I can hear my heart pounding

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
me too I'm scared because my role

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
is to get like pounced upon I don't know when

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I was to go surprise motherfucker

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
but I'm about to

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
you okay so the rustling

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
stops as if the thing froze

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
right it's like it's being cautious

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
and then you hear it take a couple

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
couple cautious steps forward but still

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
it's still nowhere near you it's still

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
at least 30 feet away from you

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
hold on

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
are you actually

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
speaking

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
no

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
oh

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I'm making my tail

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
move back and forth a little bit

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
very clever

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
move

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
okay alright alright

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I'm gonna fucking do it

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
wait for it

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
what are you gonna do

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
wait for it don't

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
wait for it

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
alright I wait

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I take some steps north and continue moving

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
move

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
move

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
alright

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
yeah it takes two steps backwards

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
now

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
it's like being weirded out by you

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
guys

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
surprise motherfucker

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I fling off

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
my cow costume and I cast

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
a light spell

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
wait where do you cast it

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
just on you

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
on my hand

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
what's up

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
while I take out my bow

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
and get ready to shoot it

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
immediately you illuminate

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
your surroundings

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
and there's kind of a glare

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
as your eyes quickly adjust

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
and you can see an outline

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
on the edge of the farm

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
it's too far away to be

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
kind of caught by your

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
light because it's pretty far away

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
and the light doesn't go super far

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
but it looks like it's a robed

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
figure and it

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
leaps up into the air

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
and flies away

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I fucking sick wait for it

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
let's get out

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
let's get out

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
we start running after the figure

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
alright it's going towards

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
the church

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
building

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
it's flying

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
it's a flying creature

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
it's a flying dude

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
it's a figure

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
who knows what's under that hood

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
we're going to find out next time

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
cliffhanger
