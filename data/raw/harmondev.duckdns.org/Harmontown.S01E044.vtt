{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.240\nOh, it's so nice to be back at Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater here in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:23.240 --> 00:31.640\nI've triumphant returned back to our cozy little nest in our loyal harmonians.\n\n00:31.640 --> 00:40.240\nWe've been all over the country. I'm not sure what we learned, but I do know that it's very nice to be sitting here again with you people.\n\n00:40.240 --> 01:04.240\nHarmontown is finally back in session in Hollywood, California. Put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:04.240 --> 01:24.240\nI may be wrapped out, I don't know. Fuck you guys that applauded. I'm a rap master. That's why I'm wrapped out, because I perfected the art, not because it was obnoxious and tiresome.\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:47.240\nIt is really, really oddly comfortable to be back. It's really weird. We tried to do this shot, Neil, the guy doing the documentary, wanted to do this shot where I would walk down the sidewalk outside NerdMelt, walk through the door into an empty comic book store, just keep walking, and it would be perfectly timed with Jeff bringing me up.\n\n01:47.240 --> 01:57.240\nDid I fuck it up? I don't know. I don't know if you fucked it up. I have no idea. It's fucked up.\n\n01:57.240 --> 02:00.240\nWere you standing in the doorway for like 10 seconds?\n\n02:00.240 --> 02:02.240\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:02.240 --> 02:04.240\nShould we try it again?\n\n02:04.240 --> 02:12.240\nWell, go back outside. Just yell at me, Neil. This is fucking bullshit.\n\n02:12.240 --> 02:19.240\nYeah, welcome home.\n\n02:19.240 --> 02:33.240\nOh, we're back everybody. Meltdown Congress in Hollywood, California. Harmontown is once again in session.\n\n02:33.240 --> 02:48.240\nPut your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n02:48.240 --> 03:05.240\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I walked from the sidewalk to the back. It was seamless.\n\n03:05.240 --> 03:11.240\nWow. Dan, where were you? We missed you. I was in the green room. You left for a while.\n\n03:11.240 --> 03:18.240\nJeff, I do what I always do before a show. I went and stood outside of 7-Eleven.\n\n03:18.240 --> 03:22.240\nYou climb up on top of the fire escape and stand there like Batman.\n\n03:22.240 --> 03:29.240\nI stare at my fist and talk about the darkness of the city. And then when the mood takes me, I clamber down and I just make a beeline.\n\n03:29.240 --> 03:33.240\nI just hope to God that you're starting the show at that particular time.\n\n03:33.240 --> 03:42.240\nHow could you possibly have any idea that I'm starting the show? I'm just hoping that you hear the frequency of audience joy.\n\n03:42.240 --> 03:48.240\nThe truth is, Jeff, there are parallel universes where you're in the middle of introducing the show and I just walk up and tell you to fuck off.\n\n03:48.240 --> 03:50.240\nI just interrupt you.\n\n03:50.240 --> 03:51.240\nSo we just got lucky once again.\n\n03:51.240 --> 03:57.240\nYeah, Harmontown is a show that is not written, therefore it is written by God.\n\n03:57.240 --> 04:04.240\nAnd he doesn't make mistakes. You don't punch him up.\n\n04:04.240 --> 04:14.240\nHis draft is final, man. That's all you gotta do is do nothing at all and you are doing the work of a master.\n\n04:14.240 --> 04:21.240\nWhat if I get really serious about that and told you the good news?\n\n04:21.240 --> 04:29.240\nI am feeling very spiritual lately. I was going on the tour and also, I was a bad friend for not listening to it in the first place,\n\n04:29.240 --> 04:34.240\nbut I've been really, really diving into Duncan Trussell lately. He is amazing.\n\n04:34.240 --> 04:45.240\nEvery Lutheran bone in my body, every superstitious fiber of my being makes me want to knock on every piece of wood in the room and say,\n\n04:45.240 --> 04:55.240\nplease, universe, this isn't how it sounds, but in all seriousness, there's no other way to express this.\n\n04:55.240 --> 05:09.240\nHe makes testicular cancer sound fun. He's so fucking cool. You're just like, oh man, I could get cancer. That would be no problem.\n\n05:09.240 --> 05:16.240\nYou almost want to get it, like listening to him because he's so fucking cool.\n\n05:16.240 --> 05:23.240\nI think he puts a very beautiful, heroic, funny face on it, but still, radiation is a giant bummer. You wouldn't last a minute.\n\n05:23.240 --> 05:29.240\nNo, I wouldn't at all. He doesn't deny any of that stuff though. He doesn't say it's not a bummer.\n\n05:29.240 --> 05:40.240\nHe's very emphatic about embracing also the pain of life and acknowledging it for pain. That's what's so fucking cool about him. God damn it, I want to make love to him.\n\n05:40.240 --> 05:50.240\nBut let's do his podcast. It's great. He's a sister of Harmontown, a sister podcast.\n\n05:50.240 --> 05:53.240\nI'm going to get a drink. What do you want to talk about, Jeff?\n\n05:53.240 --> 06:00.240\nI actually do have some questions because we came back and we did this tour and there was an unanswered question.\n\n06:00.240 --> 06:09.240\nIf you answered it one-on-one with the filmmakers, I wasn't there. There seemed to be the eternally unanswered question of what the point of it all was.\n\n06:09.240 --> 06:17.240\nYou said that as you returned and you came back to LA at the big Egyptian theater show that you learned nothing.\n\n06:17.240 --> 06:26.240\nBut I realized tonight in the green room, I actually finally figured it out. It's the dumbest thing in the world because it's right under your nose and it's sort of so generic.\n\n06:26.240 --> 06:33.240\nThe entire time we were out there, we were doing these shows. We were doing performances. Shows can be good or bad.\n\n06:33.240 --> 06:48.240\nThere was a good show. There was a bad show. The show's not going so good. You talked about Chevy Chase in that show. It was a season four premiere.\n\n06:48.240 --> 07:04.240\nThinking about it as a performance beforehand, no matter how much you try to not think about it and not pre-write anything and stuff, then we went out on a bus that said, like, show's coming to town and went to Portland and went, hello, Portland, we're doing a show.\n\n07:04.240 --> 07:12.240\nI don't know why we're Southern when we do the show. It's because we're like this Wild West show. We're out there like, we're doing a show here. Now we're doing a show there.\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:24.240\nNow we're doing a show here and the whole time we were doing shows everywhere, we kept saying, both in our hearts and our brains and out loud with our mouths, we kept saying, at some point we're going to go back home.\n\n07:24.240 --> 07:36.240\nNow when we say home, we don't mean me and my underwear watching Die Hard 2. We mean like this. So if this is home, then this isn't a show anymore.\n\n07:36.240 --> 07:54.240\nAnd so the transformative thing, probably for the audience's lack of benefit, is that I don't give a shit anymore. Pat Noswalt was right. I came back. I was in the green room and I was like, the thought of it as a show did not hit my head.\n\n07:54.240 --> 08:03.240\nIt's a tee-up for some critic from the audience to yell out, like, start thinking of it as a show now, please. $10, my friend, still green.\n\n08:03.240 --> 08:11.240\nIt's better when you just, like, my favorite show was Salt Lake City where there was 62 people and we brought a Mormon chick up on stage and we talked about it. And it was like, it felt like this.\n\n08:11.240 --> 08:19.240\nThat was the closest we had to Meltdown was this small little comedy club with iron girders here and there and it was a small little room, but you didn't need another person in there.\n\n08:19.240 --> 08:32.240\nAnd it really was like the most communicative and together. I like the show here because it's become this little revival tent and we start meeting people and like when we connect with that night's audience.\n\n08:32.240 --> 08:40.240\nAnd it's cool to go to Salt Lake City where, you know, you don't have any expectations like, fucking, we're gonna hit Salt Lake, baby, the city of lights.\n\n08:40.240 --> 08:51.240\nBut that was my favorite one because that was the most like this. I think when you're not Wayne Brady, you're not gonna get up there and sing a big song and do a tab dance and that.\n\n08:51.240 --> 08:57.240\nDan, it's time you fucking own the fact that you're never gonna be Wayne Brady, man.\n\n08:57.240 --> 09:02.240\nFor those of you listening, my expression is deeply and sincerely hurt.\n\n09:09.240 --> 09:12.240\nAlright, well, let's find out if you are Wayne Brady, you know?\n\n09:12.240 --> 09:15.240\nShould I do an impression of the clumps?\n\n09:15.240 --> 09:28.240\nI saw him do that once.\n\n09:28.240 --> 09:31.240\nNow you're Wayne Brady. Yeah, you're gonna be Wayne Brady.\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:33.240\nI am Wayne Brady.\n\n09:33.240 --> 09:46.240\nWhy are you hanging out with him?\n\n09:46.240 --> 09:57.240\nI don't hate hoes. I love them. And I love singing in different styles with accents.\n\n09:57.240 --> 10:05.240\nI'm not really familiar with his work.\n\n10:05.240 --> 10:10.240\nI saw him in the Chappelle thing. It was awesome.\n\n10:10.240 --> 10:13.240\nWe'll edit all this out. That's my new mantra.\n\n10:13.240 --> 10:16.240\nNo, that fucking stays.\n\n10:16.240 --> 10:21.240\nAnyways, let's get to the goods, man. Let's get to the confessional goods.\n\n10:21.240 --> 10:25.240\nDig some shit out of me, Jeff. That's the thing that I'm going to town.\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:29.240\nHi, Portland. Hey, Portland. I looked on Wikipedia.\n\n10:29.240 --> 10:37.240\nYour town has a tall building and a weather phenomenon called the Borealis Fagoris.\n\n10:37.240 --> 10:41.240\nYour sports team is the Cougars.\n\n10:41.240 --> 10:44.240\nSmall talk, small talk. Jeff, small talk.\n\n10:44.240 --> 10:46.240\nCouldn't wait to get back here and get deep.\n\n10:46.240 --> 10:49.240\nTalk to me about my butt and my dick and stuff.\n\n10:49.240 --> 10:51.240\nBut why couldn't you get deep with those people?\n\n10:51.240 --> 10:54.240\nI could. No, that was my mistake. That's not Portland's mistake.\n\n10:54.240 --> 10:56.240\nI'm just saying, going out there, that's what happened to me.\n\n10:56.240 --> 11:00.240\nI was like, oh, hi, Portland. Thanks for having me in your town, Portland.\n\n11:00.240 --> 11:03.240\nOh, I love you, Portland. Oh, hi, Austin.\n\n11:03.240 --> 11:05.240\nOh, would you like a mint?\n\n11:05.240 --> 11:11.240\nAustin, trivia fact, the cowboy hat was invented here.\n\n11:11.240 --> 11:15.240\nAnd then, oh, I fucked your mom in a cowboy hat.\n\n11:15.240 --> 11:17.240\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n11:17.240 --> 11:20.240\nJeff, it's not real. I want to get real.\n\n11:20.240 --> 11:23.240\nI couldn't wait to get back here and get real.\n\n11:23.240 --> 11:29.240\nThese are my 50 shades of gray seto masochistic partners.\n\n11:29.240 --> 11:31.240\nThese are the safety pin nipples.\n\n11:31.240 --> 11:33.240\nThese are the hot wax people.\n\n11:33.240 --> 11:37.240\nSee, here's what I concerned, this behavior that you're showing right now\n\n11:37.240 --> 11:42.240\nwas my concern towards the end that Harmontown was a very dangerous thing for you.\n\n11:42.240 --> 11:45.240\nBecause you do this show, you go, I would talk about my Hemiroy,\n\n11:45.240 --> 11:47.240\nand I'm going to talk about fucking your mama, and like nothing I got hate.\n\n11:47.240 --> 11:49.240\nI dare you to not like me.\n\n11:49.240 --> 11:54.280\nnot like me. And then after the show, everybody comes up and likes you and wants you to sign\n\n11:54.280 --> 11:59.920\na thing and sign your image or sign your book or do this. And you find out possibly a very\n\n11:59.920 --> 12:08.840\ndangerous thing for you. The idea that you can't do something wrong, right? On the tour\n\n12:08.840 --> 12:15.440\nbus, you started to kind of hulk out a couple of times. It's called Harmontown. You called\n\n12:15.440 --> 12:19.880\nit Harmon Country. Yeah. And there's images of you everywhere. There's all these shirts\n\n12:19.880 --> 12:25.560\nand there's pins and there's books and there's just this giant narcissist jacuzzi that you\n\n12:25.560 --> 12:32.960\njust settle into. You just sit there like a definitely had the upper hand in fights\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:46.200\nwith my girlfriend Harmontown. Read the sign. Population me. It's me. Well, my one prediction\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:50.960\nwas right. You fuckers fought a lot on that trip. I mean, I think again, you might have\n\n12:50.960 --> 12:54.000\nmaybe that's as much as you fight when I'm not with you all the time. I've never been\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:58.800\nwith you almost all the time. The kind of day and night we were around each other quite\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:06.000\na bit. But you guys, wow, we like to go at it. Sometimes on stage. Sometimes she's my\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:12.360\ntempestuous, fiery Irish muse. And now she it's a the thing that blew my mind. We were\n\n13:12.360 --> 13:19.680\nin Pittsburgh. I don't know if anybody heard that one. The ladies, the ladies left Pittsburgh.\n\n13:19.680 --> 13:26.080\nThe guys are like, he was right in the middle of a fart joke. I'm surprised. I thought Pittsburgh\n\n13:26.080 --> 13:31.240\nset the set the woman's rights movement back about 75 years, because she came out and she\n\n13:31.240 --> 13:34.440\nhad been crying about a bit that you had been doing about fucking a young girl. And it was\n\n13:34.440 --> 13:39.400\ntotally a bit. And then she announced that you call her the C word. And then the show\n\n13:39.400 --> 13:46.240\ncame to just a screech, just to a total stop. And then at the end of that, she said, So\n\n13:46.240 --> 13:52.000\ncan I move in with you? And I was like, Wow, I thought I thought that was yeah, that made\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:58.240\nme not ask her to move in with me for like two extra weeks. But then you end you end\n\n13:58.240 --> 14:04.200\nthe tour by asking her to move in with you. Yeah, that's two weeks. I was going to ask\n\n14:04.200 --> 14:09.520\nher any minute. And then she fucking said it. Like, you know, I can't say yes. When someone\n\n14:09.520 --> 14:12.160\nwe were thinking the same thing at the same time, we're in love with each other, deal\n\n14:12.160 --> 14:20.160\nwith it. We're soulmates. And Jeff, you're great. You're very cool. You're in your suit,\n\n14:20.160 --> 14:24.080\nyou know, and you, you're, you're, you're, you have this, you have this, you have this\n\n14:24.080 --> 14:29.120\narmor against the world, you know, you're, you're the emotionless, like, even, even\n\n14:29.120 --> 14:34.280\nkeel, even keel guy, you know, he's, he likes his front bronca and he's, he likes to watch\n\n14:34.280 --> 14:39.520\nthe history channel. And every, every, every, every city we went to, he went to a bookstore\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:48.160\nand bought an obscure book and then went to a, went to a bar and read it. Like, I just,\n\n14:48.160 --> 14:52.000\nI know he sounds awesome. You're not allowed. You're not allowed to hate it.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:57.000\nDoes he have a sister?\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.560\nYou know, and you're fine. You're the master of your, of your, of your domain. Oh, speaking\n\n15:00.560 --> 15:06.240\nof which, I haven't jerked off in like three days for three days. Like, like, like it might\n\n15:06.240 --> 15:10.480\nbe four now. Yeah. I made this decision. I went on Duncan Trussell's podcast. We talked\n\n15:10.480 --> 15:13.840\nabout jerking off. And how did you connect that? We're talking about how awesome I am\n\n15:13.840 --> 15:19.000\nto master, master of, well, I heard the word master. He's not about your dick. No, no,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:25.920\nno, no. He reads too many books. He doesn't watch Seinfeld. Master of my domain is a Seinfeld\n\n15:25.920 --> 15:31.600\nlike line in reference to the episode where they all tried to not jerk off. But yeah,\n\n15:31.600 --> 15:39.520\nI, I, I, I'm, I'm four days into what the, what they call on Reddit, no FAP.\n\n15:39.520 --> 15:44.560\nThe word FAP is a bummer. It is a bummer. It's a huge bummer. Don't say FAP. It's so\n\n15:44.560 --> 15:50.440\nit did not fucking say FAP over any circumstances. Don't type it. Don't read it. Don't fucking.\n\n15:50.440 --> 15:54.640\nYeah. It is the worst. Like, like I was introduced to that word when we first started doing community\n\n15:54.640 --> 15:58.760\nand there was an interview with Alison Brie and the, in the onion or something. And then\n\n15:58.760 --> 16:02.280\nthere was a comment section and there, there was like a comment that said like FAP, FAP,\n\n16:02.280 --> 16:09.800\nFAP, FAP, FAP, FAP. And I was like, what is that? Oh, it made me, it just made me,\n\n16:09.800 --> 16:14.800\nyeah. Imagine your Hawaiian shirt and your surgical gloves and your, just your, I can,\n\n16:14.800 --> 16:21.360\nI can, I can, I can. What did you just reveal about your software?\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:27.160\nThat I've seen the movie. What was it called? The hardwired or whatever. Wow. 90s movie.\n\n16:27.160 --> 16:32.920\nDon't conjure up imagery for me. Don't, don't make me part of your world. No onomatopoeia\n\n16:32.920 --> 16:38.640\nin sexuality. Don't ask black people time travel questions. No onomatopoeia in sex.\n\n16:38.640 --> 16:48.160\nThat's it. That's it. We got, we found our constitution. We did it. It took us a whole\n\n16:48.160 --> 16:53.200\ntour to figure that out. Go deep, Jeff. Come on. Get me, get, I want to reveal something.\n\n16:53.200 --> 16:59.040\nThat's, that's what the show is. Come on. Hit me in the quick. I don't want to, I want\n\n16:59.040 --> 17:05.720\nto talk about something real. Okay. Do you watch the Grammys?\n\n17:05.720 --> 17:15.960\nDon't cry. Don't cry. I didn't.\n\n17:15.960 --> 17:20.520\nFuck the Grammys too. Fuck it, fuck it up. Whatever.\n\n17:20.520 --> 17:27.120\nWell, I mean, I don't know, man. I, I, I really feel like, I don't know. I wanted to barber\n\n17:27.120 --> 17:30.480\nWalter, Walter's you tonight, but we have guests we want to bring up. But then I thought\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:33.080\nlike, I'm not going, I'm not going because I don't even know what the angle would be.\n\n17:33.080 --> 17:37.960\nI, I really feel that there was an opportunity, not that you're going to go out there and\n\n17:37.960 --> 17:40.880\nyou, you, you, you, not that you're Walt Whitman and you're going to go find that where you\n\n17:40.880 --> 17:44.960\nlived and what you lived for and shit, but you would come back with the disco like, oh,\n\n17:44.960 --> 17:49.480\nthat's why, or this is what's important to me. This is what Harmontown is. This is what,\n\n17:49.480 --> 17:54.880\nI mean, we learned little details and stuff like that, but I feel like there was, there\n\n17:54.880 --> 17:59.240\nreally is a reason you did it. There was, there was, there was some reason you stood\n\n17:59.240 --> 18:03.520\nafter every show and met those people. There was something driving you to do that in the\n\n18:03.520 --> 18:06.680\nfirst place. That was more than, oh, it's a birthday present to myself. I think there\n\n18:06.680 --> 18:12.200\nreally is a subconscious desire and drive there that I don't know that you even know\n\n18:12.200 --> 18:13.200\nwhat it is.\n\n18:13.200 --> 18:14.200\nNo, I don't, Jeff. I don't.\n\n18:14.200 --> 18:15.200\nAre you being serious?\n\n18:15.200 --> 18:18.520\nNo, I don't, I don't. That's something to do with connecting with people. And I think\n\n18:18.520 --> 18:21.800\nI was looking forward to getting back here because this is the place where people, like,\n\n18:21.800 --> 18:25.080\nlike we would go to certain places where you couldn't hear the people, but they had listened\n\n18:25.080 --> 18:29.560\nto the podcast. So they know that if Maddie here in the front row, whose name I know, because\n\n18:29.560 --> 18:32.480\nyou can see everybody in the audience and you can hear everybody in the audience, if\n\n18:32.480 --> 18:36.000\nshe pipes up, if she goes like, that reminds me of pants.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:40.320\nThen I go, I'm sorry, what the fuck are you talking about, Maddie? What are you, why did\n\n18:40.320 --> 18:44.320\nyou say that? It reminds you of pants. And then she'll say like, well, cause I love pants\n\n18:44.320 --> 18:48.440\nand you just said Christmas and Christmas is good pants are good. Well, okay. Very good.\n\n18:48.440 --> 18:54.440\nSo you want to come up here and talk about your fucking Christmas pants, Maddie?\n\n18:54.440 --> 18:57.960\nI wonder if anybody out here, I mean, this is a tough question. And I don't want Adam\n\n18:57.960 --> 19:04.640\nGoldberg to storm the stage when I ask this. I wonder if anybody, because there are, if,\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:07.800\nhow many of you, and I'm not like just like asking for like a round of applause, but how\n\n19:07.800 --> 19:11.400\nmany of you listen to all of them, like the, all the podcast? Don't raise your hands.\n\n19:11.400 --> 19:12.400\nOof.\n\n19:12.400 --> 19:16.880\nYou have to clap. All right. So I wonder like maybe, maybe one of these people would have\n\n19:16.880 --> 19:21.240\na better like overall perspective on what that actually was, if it was anything at all, if\n\n19:21.240 --> 19:22.480\nit succeeded at anything.\n\n19:22.480 --> 19:25.360\nYou're really begging for Adam Goldberg to storm the stage.\n\n19:25.360 --> 19:27.200\nI certainly am not certain.\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:30.040\nMaddie, did you listen to all those shows?\n\n19:30.040 --> 19:31.040\nYeah.\n\n19:31.040 --> 19:33.400\nAll right. Would you, would you like to come up and give us a little report?\n\n19:33.400 --> 19:37.840\nHello, Maddie. Come on up on stage.\n\n19:37.840 --> 19:41.720\nYour mother list tonight, your mother's not here. She's all grown up.\n\n19:41.720 --> 19:53.920\nOkay. Maddie, Maddie is a young child that used to come to the show with her mother. That\n\n19:53.920 --> 19:55.520\nis now, now you're in college.\n\n19:55.520 --> 19:56.520\nI am.\n\n19:56.520 --> 20:01.240\nEverything's cool. All right. I feel less guilty now of saying the things I say in front\n\n20:01.240 --> 20:02.240\nof you.\n\n20:02.240 --> 20:03.240\nWhat are you studying in college?\n\n20:03.240 --> 20:04.240\nLooking into media studies.\n\n20:04.240 --> 20:05.240\nWho? Media studies?\n\n20:05.240 --> 20:06.240\nYeah.\n\n20:06.240 --> 20:07.240\nYeah.\n\n20:07.240 --> 20:08.240\nWhat's cool?\n\n20:08.240 --> 20:09.240\nOccidental.\n\n20:09.240 --> 20:10.240\nOh, great.\n\n20:10.240 --> 20:11.240\nYeah.\n\n20:11.240 --> 20:18.520\nAll right. So what's your, what's your take on the, what, what, what, the tour? Anything.\n\n20:18.520 --> 20:19.520\nSay it.\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:22.680\nI can handle anything now. I'm a master.\n\n20:22.680 --> 20:25.680\nYou declared yourself God at the last show.\n\n20:25.680 --> 20:31.000\nAnd in this one, and, and every day forth, I am God.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:36.880\nI think Maddie, sorry to interrupt, but I really think that you're in a dangerous psychological\n\n20:36.880 --> 20:37.880\nplace right now.\n\n20:37.880 --> 20:42.560\nOr, or whatever the opposite of dangerous is. Safe?\n\n20:42.560 --> 20:49.640\nIt doesn't feel safe. So I guess it's probably dangerous.\n\n20:49.640 --> 20:53.520\nI think you're closer to being Hans Gruber than John McClain now.\n\n20:53.520 --> 20:57.520\nYeah. You know, you know, you know who else was in a dangerous psychological place?\n\n20:57.520 --> 20:58.520\nDon't say Jesus.\n\n20:58.520 --> 20:59.520\nGod.\n\n20:59.520 --> 21:00.520\nOkay.\n\n21:00.520 --> 21:07.080\nBecause he was nothing at the beginning of everything and it bummed him out so much\n\n21:07.080 --> 21:09.200\nhe had to explode into some things.\n\n21:09.200 --> 21:11.240\nAre you saying you're going to explode?\n\n21:11.240 --> 21:14.560\nI, he hasn't jerked off for three days.\n\n21:14.560 --> 21:16.560\nHe's coming for you.\n\n21:16.560 --> 21:20.400\nAre you going to create a universe of jizz in this place?\n\n21:20.400 --> 21:21.400\nJesus.\n\n21:21.400 --> 21:22.400\nShe's, she, she, Maddie.\n\n21:22.400 --> 21:23.400\nSorry.\n\n21:23.400 --> 21:24.400\nHow much now, but she's still a kid.\n\n21:24.400 --> 21:25.400\nOkay.\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:26.400\nAll right, Maddie. What's your take?\n\n21:26.400 --> 21:33.400\nWell, I think you definitely exceeded in becoming God in your own mind. I think, I think, I\n\n21:33.400 --> 21:38.080\nthink the more, the more you met people and the more people were in the audience, you\n\n21:38.080 --> 21:40.600\ntook on that God role and.\n\n21:40.600 --> 21:42.080\nWhat's that guy doing? What's that guy doing?\n\n21:42.080 --> 21:43.080\nYeah.\n\n21:43.080 --> 21:44.080\nWhat are you doing?\n\n21:44.080 --> 21:45.080\nWhat are you doing, dude?\n\n21:45.080 --> 21:46.080\nWhat are you, what are you?\n\n21:46.080 --> 21:47.080\nHe's typing on his phone.\n\n21:47.080 --> 21:48.080\nAre you tweeting his quotes?\n\n21:48.080 --> 21:49.080\nWell, no, what's he, are you, are you?\n\n21:49.080 --> 21:50.080\nYou're going to post a vine.\n\n21:50.080 --> 21:53.200\nOh, okay. That's all right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to terrify you.\n\n21:53.200 --> 21:56.200\nYes, you did. You did mean to.\n\n21:56.200 --> 21:59.440\nDo you have a hand like mine?\n\n21:59.440 --> 22:03.280\nBut no, you do. You actually does. Okay. I'm not God.\n\n22:03.280 --> 22:04.280\nNot yet.\n\n22:04.280 --> 22:09.160\nBut then, but then, but then when you found out that he was putting up a vine image, I\n\n22:09.160 --> 22:11.760\ngot a gift of you doing something, you're like, oh, that's cool. Keep it up.\n\n22:11.760 --> 22:14.760\nOkay. Fine. Yeah. As long as it's not of Duncan Tressel. All right.\n\n22:14.760 --> 22:20.560\nOkay. Continue, Maddie. Sorry. I just, there was somebody that was not, you know.\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:25.400\nNot, not, not bowing, not scraping, not, not, not, not worshiping at the altar.\n\n22:25.400 --> 22:29.760\nIt was tweeting and fleeting and scooping.\n\n22:29.760 --> 22:34.640\nDangerous, dangerous territory. Did you learn anything about Dan or about Harmontown throughout\n\n22:34.640 --> 22:39.200\nthat journey? Or was it just kind of a linear waste of time?\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:46.920\nI feel like he's revealed so much of himself in past podcasts, past tweets, past life that\n\n22:46.920 --> 22:50.760\nhe just like anything he said on tour didn't really surprise me. Like he could have been\n\n22:50.760 --> 22:54.560\ntalking about butts and cocks and dicks and whatever.\n\n22:54.560 --> 22:59.920\nWhen you take me out of the service.\n\n22:59.920 --> 23:05.040\nI mean, you could have ranted our race for half an hour and like wanted every person in\n\n23:05.040 --> 23:08.520\nthe audience to kill themselves because they felt bad, but I wasn't surprised that I wouldn't\n\n23:08.520 --> 23:09.520\nhave been surprised that happened.\n\n23:09.520 --> 23:12.280\nWhat was your, not in a bad, I'm like,\n\n23:12.280 --> 23:17.120\nWas there, was there, was there a real highlight or really low light in the, in any of the\n\n23:17.120 --> 23:18.640\nshows that kind of like surprised you?\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:21.640\nWell, you're talking to the person who has like an eight year old's memory here. Like\n\n23:21.640 --> 23:25.360\nI'm digging right now to remember things and stop going well.\n\n23:25.360 --> 23:27.520\nOkay. Why do you have an eight year old's memory?\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:30.680\nThat's a great question. I don't remember things I do two days ago and I should probably\n\n23:30.680 --> 23:31.680\nget checked out.\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:35.240\nOh, all right. Talk about cookies then.\n\n23:35.240 --> 23:37.720\nI was jealous of young people because I thought you remembered everything.\n\n23:37.720 --> 23:41.720\nNo, you, okay. I, I get surprised when you remember my name every time. Like I don't\n\n23:41.720 --> 23:45.520\nremember things people I meet. So thank you.\n\n23:45.520 --> 23:48.000\nWell, you're kind of a pain in the ass.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.840\nIt's a mnemonic device. Oh boy, there's Maddie.\n\n23:51.840 --> 23:53.160\nI don't show up every time.\n\n23:53.160 --> 23:54.160\nNo, no.\n\n23:54.160 --> 23:55.160\nMaybe.\n\n23:55.160 --> 23:56.160\nI'm not out. I don't come every time.\n\n23:56.160 --> 23:58.320\nAll right. Thank you. Thank you, Maddie. Thank you, Maddie.\n\n23:58.320 --> 24:00.320\nAll right. Thank you, Maddie.\n\n24:00.320 --> 24:02.320\nWe're almost there. We're getting there. We're digging.\n\n24:02.320 --> 24:08.160\nIt doesn't, it doesn't, you know, Jeff, the show is not about the show. There's no show.\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:11.360\nThe show, the show, it's, there's no, the show is about you.\n\n24:11.360 --> 24:13.600\nLet's get to the show.\n\n24:13.600 --> 24:17.880\nMaybe it's foolish of me to even think that there was supposed to be a purpose for it.\n\n24:17.880 --> 24:20.480\nThat there, that you should learn anything. You're such a story structure freak and we\n\n24:20.480 --> 24:24.960\nkept drawing these things like, we're at the refusal of a call now. Now we're at the meeting\n\n24:24.960 --> 24:29.560\nwith the goddess. Like we kept doing that, but then we return home. Do you feel that\n\n24:29.560 --> 24:34.120\nyou've created, that you've actually described the full circle story wise?\n\n24:34.120 --> 24:35.120\nNo.\n\n24:35.120 --> 24:39.520\nBecause I feel like that Harmontown at the tour is, if there's a story structure element\n\n24:39.520 --> 24:44.880\nto that, that this will be the first quarter or the first half of a larger story.\n\n24:44.880 --> 24:45.880\nOh, well.\n\n24:45.880 --> 24:48.880\nYou're right now coming home. This is the meeting with the goddess where you're back\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:53.320\nhome into your safety net and now the terrible shit happens. Or something really awesome\n\n24:53.320 --> 24:54.320\nhappens.\n\n24:54.320 --> 24:57.560\nWe get to reboot the show now. We get to decide what it's, what it's going to be about, you\n\n24:57.560 --> 24:58.560\nknow?\n\n24:58.560 --> 25:02.120\nWhat would you, what do you want? We can't, one thing's for certain. I think we, we want\n\n25:02.120 --> 25:03.520\nto connect with these people.\n\n25:03.520 --> 25:09.040\nYou fucked up my brain to merge with their brains. I want to feel what they feel.\n\n25:09.040 --> 25:10.040\nFor real?\n\n25:10.040 --> 25:16.920\nYeah. Okay. Let's do it. I feel like there's someone in the audience tonight that's recently\n\n25:16.920 --> 25:25.800\nwritten a book that will be released that needs to be plugged. He was an amazing entertainer.\n\n25:25.800 --> 25:33.360\nHe's part of Donald Glover's little, little YouTube troupe. Derek comedy. He's an old\n\n25:33.360 --> 25:39.640\nfriend. He looks like Jesus more and more every day. Please, I feel, I feel his pain.\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:42.520\nI feel his brain. Welcome DC Pearson.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:54.440\nThanks, Diane. How's it going?\n\n25:54.440 --> 26:00.200\nIt's going good. I mean, I don't know. You tell me, it feels like kind of, I was saying\n\n26:00.200 --> 26:04.680\nbackstage like, uh, oh, I feel really good cause I feel like, uh, we were out in the road\n\n26:04.680 --> 26:07.600\nand now I'm not worried at all. Like Pat Noswald's prediction was true. I'm not worried\n\n26:07.600 --> 26:10.960\nabout doing the show here anymore. And I think that could be a bad thing. I was saying in\n\n26:10.960 --> 26:16.520\nthe green room, right now I'm flirting with the idea that it's a bad thing that you didn't\n\n26:16.520 --> 26:21.800\nlearn anything that have become boring because I'm not driven by the anxiety of being a good\n\n26:21.800 --> 26:24.520\nor a bad show. So now I'm seeing it sitting here.\n\n26:24.520 --> 26:29.440\nYeah. You're the reason we don't see the character after the movie's over. Exactly. You're the\n\n26:29.440 --> 26:32.720\nreason the movie's over. Right. You know what I mean? Like, it's not like we just stick\n\n26:32.720 --> 26:37.720\naround after the credits and then he's still just like, yep, still happy. Yeah. You know,\n\n26:37.720 --> 26:41.640\nthe movie's over unless he joins the Avengers. Yeah. After the credits, maybe you join the\n\n26:41.640 --> 26:46.360\nAvengers, Diane. Uh, that's nice for you. Yeah. I guess, is there an Avengers for like\n\n26:46.360 --> 26:52.000\njust, just, just, just, just people with houses that like to take bubble baths? If there is,\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:57.200\nwe can go and buy it at this comic book store. We'll have it. If there is one, adventures\n\n26:57.200 --> 27:03.320\ncomes to watch. Right. Yeah. Uh, so you wrote a book. I did. It's called Crap Kingdom.\n\n27:03.320 --> 27:10.600\nI like our Beastie Boys. Uh, it's called Crap Kingdom. Yeah. And it's not out yet. It's\n\n27:10.600 --> 27:12.800\nnot quite out yet. It's not out. It's out. It's going to be out on March 7th, but the\n\n27:12.800 --> 27:16.320\nreason that I'm doing, I'm promoting it before it's actually out. So I'm trying to get people\n\n27:16.320 --> 27:20.080\nto pre-order it. So badly do I want them to pre-order it that if you pre-order it, which\n\n27:20.080 --> 27:23.560\nyou can do on Amazon, you can do it pals books, all these different places that sell books\n\n27:23.560 --> 27:28.440\nonline. Uh, and you send me the receipt at CrapKingdom at gmail.com. I will write your\n\n27:28.440 --> 27:35.000\nname into a custom rap song and or crap song. Interesting. Get us some overlap there. Uh,\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:39.560\nand you gave me an advanced copy and it, it has so many. It's, it's, it's filled with\n\n27:39.560 --> 27:45.800\npages and, uh, uh, Dan, Dan, what was your favorite part of the book? I, I, I just, I,\n\n27:45.800 --> 27:52.800\nlike, the binding, like, I love the concept of like, like, like, there's separate pages,\n\n27:52.800 --> 27:55.640\nbut all of them are together. I insisted on that. I was like, I know that most books\n\n27:55.640 --> 28:01.480\nare just bricks with scrawl on them, but I want individualized pages. Cause I feel like\n\n28:01.480 --> 28:08.400\nthat's where the medium's going. The elevator pitch is that it's a guy who's beckoned to\n\n28:08.400 --> 28:14.040\nbe the savior of a fantasy world. It's kind of a young adult novel. Uh, and it's, it's,\n\n28:14.040 --> 28:20.160\nit's a, it's a Jeff. Uh, it's about a guy who gets beckoned to a fantasy world to be\n\n28:20.160 --> 28:25.360\nits savior. And it sounds fascinating. Mr. Harmon, the world's, the world's kind of\n\n28:25.360 --> 28:29.040\ncrappy and, uh, he doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't take them up on it. It doesn't want\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:33.040\nto be part of the fantasy world. It's a novel. Yes. That's awesome. Thank you. That's, that's\n\n28:33.040 --> 28:36.280\nvery, I'm very impressed by that. That's very cool. I think more people should do that.\n\n28:36.280 --> 28:40.360\nI think everyone should do it. No, I don't think everybody should. Okay. I think novelists\n\n28:40.360 --> 28:43.760\nshould write novels. Okay. But people given a gift. So if you haven't already written\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:48.160\na novel, uh, you're not a novelist, so don't write a novel. But if you have already written\n\n28:48.160 --> 28:52.780\na novel, continue doing so. I mean, people that have to give for writing pros and for\n\n28:52.780 --> 28:55.720\nwriting. Oh, I see. You know, like, don't, don't, you don't think where there should\n\n28:55.720 --> 28:59.160\nbe like a weird freaky Friday thing where like I become a sushi chef and then he becomes\n\n28:59.160 --> 29:04.760\na novelist. I think that he probably be now should Jiro write a novel. That's my new novel.\n\n29:04.760 --> 29:11.560\nMy new novel is called, uh, called sushi writer. Is it true that they're called novels? Cause\n\n29:11.560 --> 29:15.840\nat one point it was like a weird new thing to do. These are novels. Holy shit. Look at\n\n29:15.840 --> 29:19.080\nthis thing. Books used to be epistolary. There were letters. Yeah, there were letters back\n\n29:19.080 --> 29:22.520\nand forth. But the idea of telling a story about a thing that happened to a person that\n\n29:22.520 --> 29:26.520\nwas, that was a very novel. Do you think that I learned that novel is just a lie? You know,\n\n29:26.520 --> 29:30.640\nI mean, it was a book that was ostensibly like, was it just like that, uh, what, not\n\n29:30.640 --> 29:35.720\n50 shades of gray? What's it called? The guy that was on Oprah, um, Stephen Frey or whatever.\n\n29:35.720 --> 29:39.160\nWhat's that? Yeah. James Frey. Yeah. That, that, well, like if he had been in medieval\n\n29:39.160 --> 29:42.560\ntimes, would he have been like the first novelist and he was like, it's just a lie, but we\n\n29:42.560 --> 29:50.920\ncan say I amazing. I'm amazing. They do talk a lot. Don't they, Dan? Yeah. Yeah. No, it's\n\n29:50.920 --> 29:54.600\na town meeting. Really. Honestly. If you go out to any of these fuckers, it's like a whole\n\n29:54.600 --> 30:03.960\nshow. What's your name? Sean. Just Jesus Christ. You handed him a mic. Hand it, handed it to\n\n30:03.960 --> 30:09.400\nhim or put it in his face like a, like a journalist. Like what's your name, sir? My name is Sean.\n\n30:09.400 --> 30:15.760\nI was just saying that like early defo novels, like, uh, it's reported that like the person\n\n30:15.760 --> 30:21.320\nlike, you know, rams and cruise. So sent in his journals and he's, I'm defo just, you\n\n30:21.320 --> 30:27.280\nknow, giving them to you. Right. He was passing it off as actual, actual history. Yeah. Isn't\n\n30:27.280 --> 30:37.040\nthat interesting, Jeff? And what's your name? Scott. See? Oh, just all just people. When\n\n30:37.040 --> 30:46.360\nwere you born? What year? 1989. That's crazy. What were you doing in 1989? I was going like,\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:52.720\noh, I'm afraid to tell my friends I'm not into this Batman movie as much as they are.\n\n30:52.720 --> 30:59.320\nI wouldn't get that tattoo if I were you. They'll probably change the logo. If I'm,\n\n30:59.320 --> 31:03.920\nif I'm them, I'm going to change that logo. It looks like my mom looked at that Batman\n\n31:03.920 --> 31:07.520\nlogo from the Tim Burton movie and she said, is that teeth? It looks like yellow. If you\n\n31:07.520 --> 31:11.320\nlook at the yellow parts, it looks like teeth. Yeah. Yeah. Like a little teeth monster is\n\n31:11.320 --> 31:16.800\ngoing to get you. I like that. That guy said 1989, but when he said 19, it sounded like\n\n31:16.800 --> 31:21.120\nit was going to be a much older year. You know what I mean? He's like 19. Like it sounded\n\n31:21.120 --> 31:26.440\nlike it was going to be 89 is an older year. It's like, it was like, yeah, back then the\n\n31:26.440 --> 31:35.080\nair was new to him. 89 was like the stone age. He's, he's an asshole with it. Old man.\n\n31:35.080 --> 31:43.040\nYeah. Uh, uh, uh, yeah. Everybody else all at the same time. What's your name? They all\n\n31:43.040 --> 31:53.000\nsaid Zach. How can everyone be named Zach? It's amazing. With one voice. Sorry. Well,\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:59.040\nthey're, uh, the, uh, electrocuting prisoners down the, uh, the, everyone's. Do you have\n\n31:59.040 --> 32:03.200\nHarmontown death row? Yeah. You forgot to make the call because you were doing the show.\n\n32:03.200 --> 32:11.000\nSo they didn't get the pardon. Yeah. I'm just waiting for that call from Mr. Harmon. I know\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:16.720\nit's going to come through. I learned law and prison. I put this packet together. I\n\n32:16.720 --> 32:22.480\nsent it to him. It's an airtight defensive. Why I wasn't there. He'll read it. I'm sorry.\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:27.800\nOh, Mallory, your pardon hasn't come through. Yeah. From my voice, you can tell my last\n\n32:27.800 --> 32:32.200\nname is Oh, Mallory. I was trying to soften up the racism.\n\n32:32.200 --> 32:47.400\nI was trying to stand off the edges. I'm part of a demographic often sentenced to death,\n\n32:47.400 --> 32:58.000\nbless my lucky charms. We can call each other leprechauns.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:15.720\nI was friends with a kid named Sean Malarkey in grade school. His last name was Malarkey.\n\n33:15.720 --> 33:21.640\nIt's crazy. I know I've said it before on Harmontown, but my teacher had a friend named\n\n33:21.640 --> 33:29.480\nPat Mawini. I told you about Jeremy Dick and Jeremy Dick. I told the story. Jerry, me\n\n33:29.480 --> 33:34.960\ndick. No, don't dissect that. His name was Jeremy Dick. That's no big deal. Jeremy Dick,\n\n33:34.960 --> 33:39.120\nbut rumor had it. His dad's name was Harry and his mom's name was Aima. Probably not.\n\n33:39.120 --> 33:43.280\nProbably not. Right. So, so then I ran into him. I was in grade school with him. I told\n\n33:43.280 --> 33:47.480\nthe story, right? On the podcast. It might be pre-podcast. I don't know. Oh, it is. Okay.\n\n33:47.480 --> 33:53.920\nAll right. Fuck you guys. All right. I ran into him in a kitchen. I was like, smoking\n\n33:53.920 --> 33:58.760\na joint with him. Like this kid that I knew in grade school. There's rumors. Jeremy Dick,\n\n33:58.760 --> 34:05.480\nyou know his dad's name is Harry and his mom's name is Aima. And I was like, that's not astronomically\n\n34:05.480 --> 34:10.200\npossible. Like that's not, that doesn't happen. You don't, you don't, you're not Harry Dick\n\n34:10.200 --> 34:13.160\nand you meet a woman and she says her name's Aima and you're like, let's get married. It\n\n34:13.160 --> 34:22.760\njust doesn't happen. Have you read my script? And then I ran into him and I was, I'm standing\n\n34:22.760 --> 34:27.520\nin a kitchen. I'm probably like, like, like, I don't know, 18, 19 years old. Let's say\n\n34:27.520 --> 34:30.800\n21 because I have a joint in my hand so that I don't, I don't want to get, I don't know\n\n34:30.800 --> 34:37.400\nif he can get sued or whatever. But, and I, and I, and I, and there's Jeremy Dick. This\n\n34:37.400 --> 34:42.680\nkid from, he's a grown man now. And I was passing the joint and I go, Hey man, I always\n\n34:42.680 --> 34:48.080\nwanted to ask you, was your, was your dad's name really Harry? And he said, yeah, yeah.\n\n34:48.080 --> 34:54.120\nAnd I, and I said, now, okay, but your mom's name wasn't Aima, was it? And he, and he said,\n\n34:54.120 --> 34:55.400\nmy mom's dead man.\n\n34:55.400 --> 34:58.520\nOh, so therefore she didn't have a name.\n\n34:58.520 --> 34:59.520\nYeah.\n\n34:59.520 --> 35:04.800\nAlso, did he ask you, is, hey man, is it legal to smoke weed when you're 21?\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:08.600\nBecause you've been spreading that around.\n\n35:08.600 --> 35:15.360\nYeah, I don't know. I don't know what eggshells I'm trying to walk on with, but it's, it's,\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:18.520\nit's not, it's not, it's not legality. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's what, what are you,\n\n35:18.520 --> 35:24.840\n19, Mavie? What are you, 18? Oh, Jesus. See, like, just don't do, do, do as I say, don't\n\n35:24.840 --> 35:29.040\ndo as I do, that I say that I do.\n\n35:29.040 --> 35:30.760\nYou say do drugs though.\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:38.560\nI, I say I did a lot of them and then I have a huge house. If you connect those dots,\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:41.680\nyou, you, that's your mistake that you've made.\n\n35:41.680 --> 35:45.480\nBut imagine how big his house could be if he didn't.\n\n35:45.480 --> 35:46.480\nExactly.\n\n35:46.480 --> 35:47.480\nExactly.\n\n35:47.480 --> 35:52.480\nI just can't get over the fact that we have Jesus and God on the same stage.\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:54.480\nThat's a lineup.\n\n35:54.480 --> 36:01.520\nYou've done great. I'm so sorry. I, I, I completely ignored you while everyone murdered you.\n\n36:01.520 --> 36:05.360\nYeah, it's cool. Man, I wanted to know Breakfast Club better in that moment so I could launch\n\n36:05.360 --> 36:08.840\ninto like the smoke up Johnny Monologue from Jesus's point of view.\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:13.680\nSee, this is what you get when you, when you, when you're in Gethsemane and, and you take\n\n36:13.680 --> 36:18.040\nthe cup.\n\n36:18.040 --> 36:19.040\nSorry I set you up for that.\n\n36:19.040 --> 36:25.040\nHe's showing, he's showing a hole in his palm instead of the, last supper club.\n\n36:25.040 --> 36:34.600\nThis show is great. This show is great.\n\n36:34.600 --> 36:35.600\nWe're fucking killing it, man.\n\n36:35.600 --> 36:39.080\nI know. And it's because I stopped being about me because I became God.\n\n36:39.080 --> 36:41.960\nThis show has never stopped being about you for a second.\n\n36:41.960 --> 36:45.880\nI achieved apotheosis. I stopped caring about the show. The mistake we made at the very\n\n36:45.880 --> 36:50.360\ntippy top of the show was focusing on me because I have nothing left to like, so, so bring\n\n36:50.360 --> 36:55.080\nup DC Pearson. Oh, nice. Now you're killing it. You're doing you a little riffy bits.\n\n36:55.080 --> 36:56.080\nYeah.\n\n36:56.080 --> 36:58.920\nYou're dropping bombs from a three point line over there.\n\n36:58.920 --> 37:00.240\nI'm fucking nailing it.\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:01.240\nThis is the show, Jeff.\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:02.240\nNow you fucked it again.\n\n37:02.240 --> 37:08.360\nDan, will there be, will there be a point where you will lay down the mantle of being\n\n37:08.360 --> 37:09.360\nDan Harmon?\n\n37:09.360 --> 37:13.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I'm grooming Spencer.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:14.000\nOkay.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.800\nAnd I, and I don't, don't, I don't mean in the, in the literal sense because I know\n\n37:17.800 --> 37:19.240\nthat is very impressive.\n\n37:19.240 --> 37:20.240\nYeah.\n\n37:20.240 --> 37:24.360\nThat would be, that would be a, a, a Sisyphean task.\n\n37:24.360 --> 37:27.360\nGrooming Spencer. That's a whole indie movie that you have to.\n\n37:27.360 --> 37:30.400\nGrooming Spencer was, that was a slam dance this year, right?\n\n37:30.400 --> 37:33.640\nI think, I think Spencer should have his own podcast where he sits in his red flannel shirt\n\n37:33.640 --> 37:38.280\nand like talks to, talks to friends and, and talks about what's going on. He's much smarter\n\n37:38.280 --> 37:41.760\nand, and much younger and has much more to offer.\n\n37:41.760 --> 37:51.760\nAnd also I, I ran into Spencer last night and I, I don't know if I've seen you since\n\n37:51.760 --> 37:56.280\nwe got back, maybe once Spencer, I don't know, but you seem like activated. You seem\n\n37:56.280 --> 37:59.680\nlike, like, like he came back like charged up by that tour.\n\n37:59.680 --> 38:04.360\nHe feels, he feels a little smiley, but not in an artificial way. Like I, I, I like seeing\n\n38:04.360 --> 38:07.600\nhim happy. He's kind of like, yeah, he feels a little more energized. He's not afraid to\n\n38:07.600 --> 38:12.880\nlook slouched down into a sedentary fucking glacial, like Spencer's a glacier. He's like\n\n38:12.880 --> 38:18.160\na force of nature. If he disagrees with you, then there's a river there where the disagreement\n\n38:18.160 --> 38:21.640\nhappened. Like you can't really argue with it because he doesn't disagree unless there's\n\n38:21.640 --> 38:24.840\nlike logic on his side and then you're fucked.\n\n38:24.840 --> 38:29.880\nBut, but, but, but just like, yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a little buoyancy that\n\n38:29.880 --> 38:39.400\nI'll take credit for. I think I changed Spencer as a God boy, but wait, so you're really turning\n\n38:39.400 --> 38:46.080\ninto a villain and I don't, I don't care. You got a shirt on with your picture on it.\n\n38:46.080 --> 38:55.640\nLike all the great villains do, Lex Luthor's line of Luthor t-shirts, Hannibal Lecter, visit\n\n38:55.640 --> 39:03.080\nmy cafe press Clarice, Hannibal Lecter in the first season, Jody Foster has like the\n\n39:03.080 --> 39:09.520\nicon with the actual mask. Like, even though he hasn't worn it yet in the movie, why, why\n\n39:09.520 --> 39:16.440\nare you wearing that weird shirt, Dr. Lecter? But it says, it says got kryptonite. Yeah,\n\n39:16.440 --> 39:21.640\nHannibal Lecter? Yeah, because he's a big villain fan. Oh, I see. I'm a, he's a villain's\n\n39:21.640 --> 39:28.120\nvillain. Yeah, he's a, he's a fan of Lex Luthor. Did you see Hannibal Rising? No. They fucking,\n\n39:28.120 --> 39:34.360\nthey made a prequel to this goddamn character, this beloved guy that eats people who's famous\n\n39:34.360 --> 39:41.240\nfor the famous images of him wearing this mask. And in the movie, they walk you down the road\n\n39:41.240 --> 39:47.840\nof why you could be a good person and sexy and decide to start eating people. And on\n\n39:47.840 --> 39:53.120\ntop of it all, he also like wears like a weird precursor to the mask in the movie. Doesn't\n\n39:53.120 --> 39:58.000\nmake sense at all. Like he, like he thinks, someone gives him like a, the Japanese call\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:02.480\nthis a cuckoo boo boo. And, and, and, and like he's wearing, it's, it looks like the thing\n\n40:02.480 --> 40:05.920\nfrom the airplane hanger. That's only a famous image because it's a famous image. It's not,\n\n40:05.920 --> 40:09.360\nit has nothing to do with his origin. Yeah, it's not like he was on the plane being like,\n\n40:09.360 --> 40:14.240\nI want to wear that. And they were like, all right, man. Now, I could get used to this.\n\n40:14.240 --> 40:21.200\nHow do I get one of those? You have to eat a lot of people. It is, it is, it is actually\n\n40:21.200 --> 40:24.840\nbad to the point of worth watching. I like that prequels aren't like how this person\n\n40:24.840 --> 40:28.520\nactually got to become who they are. It's just like, Hey, remember this? Remember this\n\n40:28.520 --> 40:32.680\nis a cool gift. Yeah. Now it's in a movie. But even worse, the prequels that are like\n\n40:32.680 --> 40:37.800\nall, you don't even get, remember this. All you get is anticipate this. Right. Like, like,\n\n40:37.800 --> 40:41.600\nlike, like, you know, you make a prequel to like, like, like, we're breakfast club and\n\n40:41.600 --> 40:45.000\nit's just like, you're just watching people like, like, like, you know, should I pierce\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:51.680\nmy ear? I think I will. And you're supposed to go, fuck yeah. Fuck you. Get with the breakfast\n\n40:51.680 --> 40:56.200\nclub. Should I get, should I get dantra? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're using the wrong\n\n40:56.200 --> 41:01.560\nshampoo, young lady. What am I watching? I feel like if you were to watch any, any great\n\n41:01.560 --> 41:05.800\nmovie, if you were to watch its prequel before you had seen the actual great movie that allowed\n\n41:05.800 --> 41:09.000\nthere to be a prequel in the first place, everything in that prequel, I don't know of\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.360\na prequel that doesn't do this, just completely licks the donut of what ends up being good\n\n41:13.360 --> 41:17.640\nabout these things. Like, Prometheus is just a giant feature length donut lick of alien.\n\n41:17.640 --> 41:21.520\nFuck you, Prometheus. It's just dudes. I don't care if you haven't seen it. Somebody\n\n41:21.520 --> 41:26.680\nsaid, fuck you. That's Damon Liddell off. Like, yeah, like, what? Yeah. I mean, seriously,\n\n41:26.680 --> 41:32.760\nyeah, that is the weird thing. Like, I really, he's, he's adorable. He's a Channel 101 fan.\n\n41:32.760 --> 41:37.800\nRight. But, but come on, I'm an alien fan. Like, like, like, you can't fuck. No amount\n\n41:37.800 --> 41:41.000\nof press releases is going to, you can't give me instructions to go into it. Don't watch\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:46.640\nthis wrong. You called it an alien prequel, you fuckers. Well, yeah. And the fact that\n\n41:46.640 --> 41:50.640\nthey're like every, remember every amazing, cool, iconic thing from the first 10 minutes\n\n41:50.640 --> 41:54.760\nof alien. You know how you've wondered for like 20 years, what's inside of that thing?\n\n41:54.760 --> 42:01.480\nThe cool thing is that I don't know. What if what was inside of it was dudes? Dudes and\n\n42:01.480 --> 42:09.600\ngoo. Dudes and goo. Dudes and goo. On the road this summer, dudes and goo. Solving crimes.\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:19.080\nThis looks like a great place to build a Nakatomi Plaza. Not a good movie. Idea.\n\n42:19.080 --> 42:29.160\nNow, these Indians are to rest in this burial ground, never to have a suburban home built\n\n42:29.160 --> 42:39.760\non it. If we're Craig T. Nelson, we'll someday live.\n\n42:39.760 --> 42:45.040\nI say, young one, you have done a very good job building the cemetery. Let's go have a\n\n42:45.040 --> 42:52.360\nbeer. Our work is done. And the young Craig T. Nelson gets the keys to the cemetery. I'll\n\n42:52.360 --> 42:58.200\ndo fine. All right, wait, I'm sorry. Craig T. Nelson, he was the hero in that movie.\n\n42:58.200 --> 43:02.280\nHe's so often the villain, I forgot. Fuck you guys. Edit it out. It's going to seem\n\n43:02.280 --> 43:07.400\nlike I'm a god. Also edit out all the parts where I say I'm a god. Because that makes\n\n43:07.400 --> 43:10.440\nme seem like I'm a god. How long until you're just walking around L.A. doing your normal\n\n43:10.440 --> 43:13.760\nbusiness and you just have an awkward interaction with like a barista or something like, edit\n\n43:13.760 --> 43:19.200\nthis out. Edit this out. Edit this out. I don't like this. I'm a god. I'm a god. I'm\n\n43:19.200 --> 43:25.040\na god. Edit it out. Edit it out. All right, well, thank you D.C. Pearson.\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:27.520\nThanks for having me. I appreciate it. Is there anything else you want to say about\n\n43:27.520 --> 43:30.480\nyour second book? Yeah, people should go to crappkingdom.com if they\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:33.840\nwant to buy the book. Please pre-order it. I'm trying to get on the New York Times best\n\n43:33.840 --> 43:36.720\nseller list. It's a good book. You'll enjoy it. And then I'll write your name into a rap\n\n43:36.720 --> 43:40.120\nsong. How great would that be? Why don't you write someone's name from here right now\n\n43:40.120 --> 43:47.720\ninto a rap song. Sweet. Let's do it. Maddie's? You got it. Yeah, do Maddie. Maddie. Maddie\n\n43:47.720 --> 43:54.120\nrap. Maddie. Yeah, Maddie. I gotta fucking put my hood up for this shit. Okay, get the\n\n43:54.120 --> 44:01.040\nhood on. Okay. He's putting his rap hood on. Rap hood's up. Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.\n\n44:01.040 --> 44:07.880\nJeff Davis doesn't really know about Maddie's. He seems to think that Hannibal is Lex Luthor.\n\n44:07.880 --> 44:13.080\nYeah, this thing, this show is the fucking truth, son. And that's why I rap and that's\n\n44:13.080 --> 44:18.600\nwhy I rhyme. And I did not have the right beat time at the beginning of this rap about Maddie.\n\n44:18.600 --> 44:23.240\nShe wants to talk about cookies. I will do so gladly. We can talk about Kebler's. Talk\n\n44:23.240 --> 44:30.960\nabout Entomans. Do they make cookies? I think they did. Yeah. If you buy my book, I will\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:50.240\nwrite the raps in advance. DC Pearson. Thank you, sir. Crab Kingdom. Yeah. Yeah, man. It's\n\n44:50.240 --> 44:55.160\non autopilot. I just bring cool people up and just let it rip. Yeah. How are we doing\n\n44:55.160 --> 44:57.720\non time, buddy? We're doing good. I think it might be time to bring up maybe somebody\n\n44:57.720 --> 45:02.800\nelse. Really? Yeah. And let's segue into playing D&D. Yeah. So let's bring up one\n\n45:02.800 --> 45:09.480\nof my funniest friends in the world with one of the most adorable accents, who is often\n\n45:09.480 --> 45:14.440\nhere lurking in the background, but who has never been on stage here, which is a crime.\n\n45:14.440 --> 45:17.240\nHe's never been on our show. Has he? I don't think he's ever been up here. No, no. Let's\n\n45:17.240 --> 45:34.960\nwelcome stage Kumeo Nanjiani, everybody. Hey, how's it going? I feel like there's a lot\n\n45:34.960 --> 45:41.920\nof pressure on my accent right now. It's pretty adorable. Is it? Yeah, yeah. I want to squeeze\n\n45:41.920 --> 45:47.960\nit's little accent cheek. It's called the 15 years out of Pakistan. Yeah, I like it.\n\n45:47.960 --> 45:54.480\n15 years. Makes me feel fancy. Oh, you guys were talking about, I always hate what they\n\n45:54.480 --> 45:59.400\ndo like a movie where it's like a kid version of somebody like there was a movie. I saw\n\n45:59.400 --> 46:01.960\nthe preview and it was about British people. I didn't know what it was. And then there's\n\n46:01.960 --> 46:09.960\none scene where the mom is like, come down for dinner, John Lennon. And then you find\n\n46:09.960 --> 46:14.720\nout it's about John Lennon. There's always like, or like in fucking the new Batman movie\n\n46:14.720 --> 46:19.280\nthat Joseph Gordon Levitt's name is Robin. That's his real name. That's the fucking worst\n\n46:19.280 --> 46:23.680\nthing. That is retarded with all due respect to my retarded sister, which means I can say\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:31.480\nretarded. Like, that is so retarded. That whole movie was unbelievable. That movie was\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:36.800\nlike watching a guy trying to tie his shoe with a stack of teacups on his head. And he's\n\n46:36.800 --> 46:41.560\nnot good at it. It's his first time. Yeah, yeah. Like, yeah, nothing. Like, like, you're\n\n46:41.560 --> 46:47.000\njust sitting there the whole time going, well, I could do that. What also is the end a dream\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:52.800\nsequence when he's actually in, because Michael Cain, they're in the same cafe that was in\n\n46:52.800 --> 46:58.960\nhis dream. That's a real dream that one day he'll be at a restaurant. Yeah, drinking\n\n46:58.960 --> 47:06.240\nFarnette Branque. Really? Yeah, your favorite drink, Jeff. Sweet. Farnette Branque. He shares\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:12.400\na dream with Christian Bale at one point and says, I have a dream that one day I'll be\n\n47:12.400 --> 47:16.800\nin a restaurant and you won't be Batman anymore. And you'll be eating an omelet and I'll be\n\n47:16.800 --> 47:23.680\nhaving a Farnette Branque. And you won't even acknowledge me. Why not? You'll be like,\n\n47:23.680 --> 47:29.240\nHoly shit, I'm not Batman anymore. Get over here. Where are the fucking on? What the fuck\n\n47:29.240 --> 47:34.800\nare you drinking? From your dream? Farnette Branque is on the house? Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n47:34.800 --> 47:40.880\nNot only were you my fucking confidant and guy that sewed me up when I lost fights to\n\n47:40.880 --> 47:46.300\nsupervillains, on top of all that, you were my fucking butler. Butler, that's already\n\n47:46.300 --> 47:51.560\nworth hanging out after we're retired. Why would you ignore her? Why? I want to see all\n\n47:51.560 --> 47:55.480\nthe scenes where they just go to random cafes. Like, all right, he's not at this one. Let's\n\n47:55.480 --> 48:02.720\nkeep going to the next one. We had to go to hundreds of cafes. And also, on top of it\n\n48:02.720 --> 48:10.480\nall, really, Alfred, dumb dream, stupid fantasy, dumb. He just seemed good while hunting.\n\n48:10.480 --> 48:16.840\nSo he was like, he himself knows that some men just want to see the world burn. He can't\n\n48:16.840 --> 48:24.160\ndrum up a better fantasy than hanging out at a cafe. He's a butler. Well, he didn't do\n\n48:24.160 --> 48:34.120\nit for me. The butler didn't do it. I don't know, a lot of ridiculous Alfred fans out\n\n48:34.120 --> 48:39.120\nin the audience, like, really? Alfred fans? Did you guys really love Dark Knight Rises?\n\n48:39.120 --> 48:47.200\nA couple people, you liked it? What's your name? Rebecca. Rebecca, you loved it? I did.\n\n48:47.200 --> 48:52.240\nI thought it was deep. You thought it was deep? That's very brave of you. Did you just say\n\n48:52.240 --> 48:58.640\nyou thought it was deep? Well, don't don't. Are you 14? I'm sorry. Let's walk a line\n\n48:58.640 --> 49:03.800\nbetween communicating with her and bullying her. That's very brave of her to like. Yeah,\n\n49:03.800 --> 49:09.000\nyeah, yeah. Rebecca, bad cop. Would you be willing to come up and talk about it a little\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:18.280\nbit? Yeah, Rebecca, everybody. Rebecca. Here, take this. Is that one? Here, you take this\n\n49:18.280 --> 49:26.840\nmic. Oh, wow. God just gave me a microphone. It's kind of my lifelong dream. So you thought,\n\n49:26.840 --> 49:30.880\nI haven't seen the film, so I cannot weigh in on this either way. I was too busy reading\n\n49:30.880 --> 49:45.040\nliterature. Well, that's how Batman started. Like many forms of literature, Batman, the\n\n49:45.040 --> 49:53.160\nDark Knight Rises, grappled with some themes. I feel like you haven't rehearsed this. No,\n\n49:53.160 --> 49:59.040\nit grappled with some themes that I thought were deep. So what themes did you like? Well,\n\n49:59.040 --> 50:07.360\nthe striving for true freedom, like true human freedom out of the shot, like de shackling\n\n50:07.360 --> 50:14.720\nourselves from tyranny, whether but the villains were espousing that theme. That's exactly\n\n50:14.720 --> 50:23.640\nright. Exactly, which is why I really thought it was like true revolution hasn't been really\n\n50:23.640 --> 50:30.680\ntried. Because every time humans have tried revolution, the people who are making the\n\n50:30.680 --> 50:41.320\nrevolution become the dictators. And so it's exploring those themes. How seductive the\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:47.880\nidea of, you know, let's anarchy. But I mean, you've seen Fight Club, right? So just watch\n\n50:47.880 --> 50:54.880\nFight Club again. No, but... But Fight Club doesn't have Batman in it. Fair enough. Every\n\n50:54.880 --> 51:02.640\nmovie would be better with Batman. Casablanca is great. But what if Batman showed up? Well,\n\n51:02.640 --> 51:11.560\nthat is true. That is absolutely true. Thank you, Rebecca. Well done. Thank you. I don't\n\n51:11.560 --> 51:15.880\nwant that heroism to go unnoticed. I mean, that's fucking rough, man. We're trained in\n\n51:15.880 --> 51:20.880\nthe society. If there's like a, what do you call it, a zeitgeist or a collective consensus\n\n51:20.880 --> 51:30.400\nthat's being emitted via groans and someone bothers to go, you know, I don't know. I get\n\n51:30.400 --> 51:33.960\nreally protective of those people because I'm like, God damn it. That is what happened\n\n51:33.960 --> 51:37.600\nto all of us on the playground. This is like a collection of people who all got picked\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:42.800\non on the playground. We were all on the business end of... There's probably some really handsome\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:49.040\nwell-built guy in the back that's like, fuck you. Like, I come to Harmontown for the fitness\n\n51:49.040 --> 52:00.360\ntips and now you're bullying me. That's collateral damage. You can stay here, Tad. Nerds are nerds\n\n52:00.360 --> 52:05.040\ntoo. You're welcome here. But anyways, whatever. I was just speaking, it was just so cool that\n\n52:05.040 --> 52:12.760\nsomebody would go like, I like Batman Rising. I insist on getting the title right. Is that\n\n52:12.760 --> 52:19.760\nit? Now's a good time, honey, to bring Spencer up to the stage so we have him.\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:29.360\nYeah, I didn't really clarify that. The reason Kumail is here is because Kumail like, like\n\n52:29.360 --> 52:33.080\nvery passionately, like, like, like, like, is it, does this throw you into the bus in\n\n52:33.080 --> 52:36.840\nany weird reverse way? Like, like, like, like Kumail is always like haunting the back.\n\n52:36.840 --> 52:41.080\nHe's the Phantom of Nerdmelt. You make it sound like I've been very desperate to come\n\n52:41.080 --> 52:47.840\nup here. No, no, no, no. Maybe it's my turn today. No, no, no, no, no. I'll go and dream\n\n52:47.840 --> 52:54.480\nof you in a cafe. He's a professional stand-up with a very funny act. He doesn't have to.\n\n52:54.480 --> 52:59.080\nHe doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't crave the spotlight. I'm saying, specifically,\n\n52:59.080 --> 53:02.640\nyou were very enamored when we started bringing Spencer up and playing D&D. No, I, I, I, I,\n\n53:02.640 --> 53:07.080\nfrom the very get-go, you were like, holy shit, what is this? What is this? I want, I want\n\n53:07.080 --> 53:12.200\nto do this. I've never played D&D and it's like completely in my wheelhouse. I just never\n\n53:12.200 --> 53:15.520\nplayed it. I mean, I've played like RPG video games themselves. You seem like you should\n\n53:15.520 --> 53:22.240\nhave played D&D. Yeah. That's not a compliment. No, it's not. No, no, it's not. We were at\n\n53:22.240 --> 53:25.960\nthe drawing room like, you know, a couple weeks before the Harmontown tour and you're\n\n53:25.960 --> 53:30.560\nlike, I really want to like kind of hang out with Spencer. I really want to play that game.\n\n53:30.560 --> 53:34.600\nLike, there was a fascination there. Which is the same as Spencer saying before he came\n\n53:34.600 --> 53:39.280\nto the first show that he came to. I feel like I should be playing D&D with Dan Harmon\n\n53:39.280 --> 53:44.440\nand then came to a show and I said, anyway, attention masters in the audience. I'm telling\n\n53:44.440 --> 53:49.680\nyou, if you don't write the show, God's writing it. That seems so. This means you're going\n\n53:49.680 --> 53:54.720\nto be great at D&D. I hope that seems just as plausible now as Alfred running into Batman\n\n53:54.720 --> 53:59.680\nat the cafe, right? But if God, if God is writing the show and you're God, the show is being\n\n53:59.680 --> 54:08.560\nwritten by me, by you, but like off the cuff. Okay. Who's who's made that noise? That's\n\n54:08.560 --> 54:14.120\nnot a weird noise. Yeah. What was that noise? It's not a theme music. Like there was like\n\n54:14.120 --> 54:20.840\nthat. As you're feeling the dumb, dumb, dumb. Uh, Spencer, how are you doing? I'm doing\n\n54:20.840 --> 54:31.680\nso good. I called you babe. I just called you babe. Did you catch that? I'm kind of\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:35.400\na babe. Actually, as I say that, I realized I'm wearing my eye, my eye D20 Spencer pin.\n\n54:35.400 --> 54:41.920\nMy eye heart Spencer. It's true. He is. It's a goodie. I bet Spencer does okay. What? I\n\n54:41.920 --> 54:52.880\nbet you do okay, right? No. See me after the show. He'll explain to you. I'll tell you\n\n54:52.880 --> 55:02.640\nwhy. I have a bulleted list. At the top is I make bulleted lists. Are you a list maker?\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:06.840\nOh yeah. It's awesome. It's like, cause if I don't have a list, you know, I'm just like\n\n55:06.840 --> 55:11.320\nI'm thinking of everything. I'm like, okay, I need new shoes at some point. But today\n\n55:11.320 --> 55:14.840\nI got to go to the bank and in a bit I have to do something and then there's someone I\n\n55:14.840 --> 55:18.120\nwant to talk to. But so if you have a little list, it's not swirling around your head. It's\n\n55:18.120 --> 55:23.400\njust there. Right. Then you can think. That terrifies me because I like, like, when do\n\n55:23.400 --> 55:27.680\nyou make the list? Before you go to bed at night? The second you think of a thing, write\n\n55:27.680 --> 55:32.040\nit down in a list of stuff you have to do. I want to, I want to be one of those people.\n\n55:32.040 --> 55:36.720\nI know like, and you can't do it with electronics. You have to do it analog style. You have to\n\n55:36.720 --> 55:42.920\nlike write it down. Okay. All right. And like, I mean, electronics are awesome. But I mean,\n\n55:42.920 --> 55:47.000\nfor writing a list, like you have to think I have a pencil in my pocket with which to\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:51.040\nwrite down. God dammit. I don't know. I don't know. I think this is actually the God baton\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:58.520\nbeing passed right now. Yeah. Well, no, yeah. Yeah. Spencer's Jesus and I've got and Jeff\n\n55:58.520 --> 56:09.440\nis a Ralph and I'm, I'm Muslim. I love Spencer like I love my little paper notepad. It's\n\n56:09.440 --> 56:14.200\nnice to just have the physical act of writing something down makes my brain remember it typing\n\n56:14.200 --> 56:18.680\nit in not so much. Jesus is in the Quran. Isn't he? Isn't he like a, doesn't he have a cameo\n\n56:18.680 --> 56:23.400\nor something? Isn't there like a, no, if we want to get into it, someone's like, yes.\n\n56:23.400 --> 56:36.520\nWho said that? Are you? She's an atheist. Okay. Were you ever not an atheist? Okay.\n\n56:36.520 --> 56:44.040\nYou've read the Quran just to be like a bullshit. Yeah. Jesus is in the Quran. The only difference\n\n56:44.040 --> 56:50.640\nis that he once he dies, he does not come back. And he is not the son of God, but he\n\n56:50.640 --> 56:55.280\nis a prophet, right? Which is, you know, like in Jesus Christ superstar, which is the best\n\n56:55.280 --> 56:59.200\ntelling of that myth in the fucking world, like it's awesome. Like it's a pretty heroic\n\n56:59.200 --> 57:03.880\nact to get fucking murdered and, and be cool with it. Like that's enough. I don't need\n\n57:03.880 --> 57:10.400\nto then see you at the grocery store the next day. I don't need magic tricks. Like heroism\n\n57:10.400 --> 57:15.480\nlike, like is as simple as being human and being like cool with people being the shit\n\n57:15.480 --> 57:21.200\nout of you. And there, and there were a lot of people that anyways, all right, fuck it.\n\n57:21.200 --> 57:27.640\nWill you raise Muslim? Yeah. Are you still practicing? Can I not answer that because\n\n57:27.640 --> 57:34.240\npeople will listen to it and we're not the most laid back people. Right. That's such\n\n57:34.240 --> 57:42.200\na bummer. Yeah, chill out Muslims. I mean, like, you know, people being bummed out about\n\n57:42.200 --> 57:48.240\nother people. It's very hard for me to say anybody to say anything about Islam that isn't\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:52.920\ncompletely agreeing with Islam is a very difficult thing, which is not to imply that that's what\n\n57:52.920 --> 58:00.080\nI would have said, right? As a possibly very good Muslim. Yeah, potentially perfect Muslim.\n\n58:00.080 --> 58:06.240\nPerfect Muslim. Camel, Joseph Campbell says like, like, like, like religion loses its function\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:10.200\nthe minute it becomes opaque. Like it's supposed to be like a stained glass window. You, you\n\n58:10.200 --> 58:14.360\ncan get as ornate as you want. You get you framing because you're you're drawing you're\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:18.800\ndrawing the audience's attention to a thing that's there that they never notice otherwise.\n\n58:18.800 --> 58:25.640\nSo yes, get festive, get crazy, get ceremonial, get ritualistic, make but but the moment it\n\n58:25.640 --> 58:30.160\nbecomes opaque and blocks the thing, the very thing that you're supposed to be drawing the\n\n58:30.160 --> 58:35.360\nattention to, which is this, this non corporal thing, this light that shines through it anyways.\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:42.920\nSo if you're making a religion out there, you know, try to try to keep one foot out.\n\n58:42.920 --> 58:47.640\nThat's the other. It's like the Hokey Pokey religion. Like, it's important to to kind\n\n58:47.640 --> 58:54.360\nof straddle, I think, the line between the Bible being a newspaper and, you know, and\n\n58:54.360 --> 58:58.320\nand and dragons and dragons. And that goes for atheists, too, by the way, like, like your\n\n58:58.320 --> 59:02.760\nBible is is science and it's which is a fucking great religion because it's a bunch of priests\n\n59:02.760 --> 59:07.160\nlike joining hands and looking for the unknown. But if you like the whole point is that there's\n\n59:07.160 --> 59:13.240\nsomething that's unknown. Sorry. Fuck. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Why are you sorry? So you said\n\n59:13.240 --> 59:16.680\nyou're going to get deep and when you know when you when you when you get there, you\n\n59:16.680 --> 59:20.040\nkept it until the city, you kept you kept talking about religion and politics, and you kept\n\n59:20.040 --> 59:23.760\ngetting deep and you kept apologizing for it. Because politics, the reason politics and\n\n59:23.760 --> 59:29.800\nreligion are party breakers is because it's you're not really talking about yourself because\n\n59:29.800 --> 59:33.880\nthe reason they're called politics and religion is because you're not actually expressing\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:40.320\nthe way that you feel. And the whole and just saw firsthand the result of like, like, like\n\n59:40.320 --> 59:45.720\nan individual being unable to like it's like there's political reasons. There's religious\n\n59:45.720 --> 59:51.920\nreasons why an individual can't say I'd like a ham sandwich. I'd like, I think the weather\n\n59:51.920 --> 59:57.880\nis nice today. This is how I feel about stealing. This is how I feel about capital punishment.\n\n59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.000\nAnd for that same reason, it's kind of a, you know, when you get in your pulpit, you're\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.040\nlike, it's there's a fine line between being honest and being dishonest. It's when you\n\n01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:13.120\nstart speaking for other people and like, like, like it's, I'm just, I was just saying\n\n01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.120\nsomething like, like, like Joseph Campbell, who I think is a is a was a really smart guy,\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.720\nlike said about religion, and he was super Catholic, but super smart, which too many\n\n01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:29.000\npeople think is a contradiction in terms. And it doesn't have to be like, like, like,\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.960\nlike, like religion, like, like, like can actually be like a smart person's tool to\n\n01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:40.440\ndeal with the cosmos. That that's a personal feeling that I'm sharing, not a, not a political\n\n01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.720\nor like, like, it's not a, it's not a, it's not a, it's not the equivalent of like being\n\n01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.800\nat a party and going like, this is that God wears a hat and he doesn't. I'm sharing that\n\n01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.080\nidea. It's not, it's not, you can, it doesn't, you don't have to, doesn't have to be true\n\n01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.880\nto you for you and I to get along. It doesn't, it's just an interesting thing to think about\n\n01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:07.520\nthat, that humankind like made these religions like, like, like we, our brains are capable\n\n01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.600\nof doing that, that, that, that, that is neither enough, something to take too seriously, because\n\n01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:19.360\nwe also make poop. And we learned to flush that the fuck down the toilet. And that was\n\n01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.640\na great day that, that doubled our lifespan as a species.\n\n01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.880\nAlso, you didn't have to look at shit, but, but, but it's also something to not like totally\n\n01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:35.360\ndisregard because when you look at your shit, if there's blood in it, you know, there's,\n\n01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:43.000\nthat's a clue. There's this. So human beings make things, you know, you make shit. That's,\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.640\nthat makes us different from leopards. I think that leopards alone, that's the only animal.\n\n01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.480\nIf you're a leopard and you're listening, I'm coming after you. Stop the fucking gold\n\n01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.560\nbrick and start making shit, leopards. Get off of that limb and do some shit, invent\n\n01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:06.000\na broom. Stop lightly displaying yourself on a, on a branch and waiting for a wounded\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.760\ngazelle. Where's your iPad? No, I mean, because Islam is definitely about rejecting the body\n\n01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:20.120\nand embracing the spirit. And I think that's one of the, if I were to speak my mind, I\n\n01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.000\nwould say that suppression of the body is a, it can be a big mistake and it can come\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.880\nout in very aggressive, violent. Yeah, yeah. It can also be a super cool thing. I stopped\n\n01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.800\njerking off and my sex life with Aaron has improved greatly.\n\n01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.440\nOh, so you've been having sex. Yeah. You just haven't been jerking off. Oh, yeah, yeah,\n\n01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:45.240\nyeah. Oh, if I didn't have a girlfriend, I wouldn't bother to experiment with not jerking\n\n01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.760\noff. That's ridiculous. If I didn't have a girlfriend, I would invent new ways to jerk\n\n01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.800\noff. I would be telling these people, there's a, if you take a hammock and a, and a rotisserie\n\n01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.640\ngrill. Yeah. How big is your house? Even a leopard, if you, if you couldn't fuck another\n\n01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.760\nleopard, he would, he would learn, he would invent new jerk off methods. So you're just,\n\n01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.680\nokay. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, yeah, it's a little less heroic than you made it sound at the\n\n01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.600\nbeginning. Yeah. You're constantly having sex and jerking off usually. Yes. When you're\n\n01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.880\nhaving sex, do you jerk off to finish during the sex? I don't think that counts as jerking\n\n01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.400\noff. No, sometimes I would. Yeah. Sometimes I would. And that's part of the thing. Like\n\n01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.840\nwhen you get into that thing, like your brain gets into like,\n\n01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.040\nEddie, leave the room. There's a, you know, I don't know. Yeah. I can't believe this started\n\n01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:43.520\nwith Joseph Campbell's views on religion. And that same exact thought, this is the same\n\n01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:51.680\nthought. Future cough when you finish sex. Oh yeah. Yeah. Sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.800\nI know. It's like, we're like the view without the order. Yeah. I like it. I, I think that\n\n01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.680\nstuff belongs in the same conversation. No, I think so too. I think so too. And you know,\n\n01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:08.400\nbecause yeah, we're all about suppression of sex, sexual drive and I truly yeah, I mean,\n\n01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.520\nwe live in a world even like appetites, food, everything. There's six billion people in the\n\n01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.800\nworld. So now at this point, if you started to lower your guard, there's a million predators\n\n01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.480\nthat would immediately do shady shit. Same thing with legalizing drugs, all this shit.\n\n01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.560\nBut that's the problem of the momentum that we've had. The truth is on a technical, you know,\n\n01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.200\nbasis, like the truth is, I think we've learned this and we all know this, we just can't, we\n\n01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.160\njust don't know how to put it in practice that, that, that, that the less inhibitions\n\n01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.200\nlike and the more self policing you allow, like the more that like people or you just\n\n01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.000\nacknowledge that it's a thing instead of just suppressing and not even, I mean, I never,\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nI literally never got the sex talk. I learned sex, what sex was from watching a porno and\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.440\nbeing like, this is very wrong. And I had a fever for three days. I really did. And nobody,\n\n01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.440\nthere's no sex education in Pakistan at all. Yeah, we've, we've talked about it over and\n\n01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.120\nover and over again in our society. We, it's, it's, it's, it's plain as day. We talk about\n\n01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.960\nit in history class how prohibition like gave rise to an entire organized crime kingdom\n\n01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.360\nof like, like, like terrible alcohol that make you blind if you drank it and like, like,\n\n01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.920\nyou make something. That's how we are with sex right now. We're in Pakistan having sex\n\n01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:32.200\nthat wouldn't make us blind. That shit is going on behind closed doors. I mean, I'll\n\n01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.200\nrepresent the West though and say we get a lot of senators and a lot of airplane stalls\n\n01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:44.760\ndoing a lot of weird airport stalls. Right. It's all of the bottom line is when the distance\n\n01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.760\nbetween what's going on in your head and what's coming out of your mouth, like, like, like,\n\n01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.400\nhow shameful is it? What are you thinking? That's so fucking bad that if you said it,\n\n01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.440\nsomething bad would happen to you. What is the bad thing that would happen to you? Would\n\n01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.640\nyou not be allowed to be a senator? Hey, maybe that means it's a shitty job. Maybe that means\n\n01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.280\nyou shouldn't be a fucking senator. Like, like, like, like, go like, like, like there's\n\n01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.960\nso much shit to do out there. Go dig a goddamn hole, put a flower at it. You can, you can\n\n01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:18.320\ndo that. Think all kinds of shit about octopi. I don't know. So listen to your parents tell\n\n01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.000\nyou you're supposed to be a senator. Mom, dad, I want to fuck an octopus. I want to fuck\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nit real bad. I want to fuck an octopus so bad. I want to feel all eight tendrils just\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.840\nwrapping me. I just want to fucking cum inside this fucking thing as cephalopod. And it's\n\n01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.600\nlike, I know I can't make it pregnant, but I just see him on TV and it's just fucking\n\n01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:48.280\nmy cock. It's hard as Gibraltar. I don't want to make the laws for Louisiana. I'm not\n\n01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.800\nfit to do it. Are you giving the job to a guy that doesn't want the job? It's civil\n\n01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.400\nservice. It's not royalty. Are you implying that he wasn't, he was in the stall, he was\n\n01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.000\nhoping an octopus would come in? That's the point of the glory hole. It could be anything\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.400\nyou want it to be. That's exactly right. Just, just, just bite down on pretend it's a beak.\n\n01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.200\nI always think fucking an octopus would be a tough way to go, man. Yeah. There's some\n\n01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.480\nshit inside there that you don't want fucking anything to do with. Well, I know but so much\n\n01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.560\nsuction cups, like all of the suction cups. That would be good. You haven't even thought\n\n01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.560\nabout this. Yeah, but the beak, I'm just, I, I go right to the beak. That thing is supposed\n\n01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.640\nto be like, like he just crackle fucking. Octopus, octopus hand job, like think about\n\n01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:34.360\nit. A million blowjobs wrapped around your dick at the same time. That is heaven. A\n\n01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:40.480\nmillion blowjobs wrapped around your dick. Yeah. That is very poetic. That's a new, I,\n\n01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:47.480\nI, I should, I should give credit where credit, that is the slogan for the new Dairy Queen\n\n01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:52.800\nshake. Also, Octopi have an ability to, like, to, to, like, fill any tiny little crevice\n\n01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.080\nlike they can, they can, yeah, they can, like, yeah. As long as they could go right up, right\n\n01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:02.640\nup your, right up your ass hole, get in there and just fucking rip the suction, your prostate,\n\n01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.880\nlet you have it. Oh, they'd be squirreling around in there. Yeah. They're all, yeah.\n\n01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.760\nThey can fit through any hole that's at least as big as their eyeball. So if your asshole\n\n01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:18.880\nis bigger than an octopus's eyeball, you're having a great day. Yeah, so, yeah, wait,\n\n01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:30.640\nwait, you, you, you go octopus shopping and you're like, uh, a smaller eye, please. Sir,\n\n01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.680\nsir, what are you intending to do with this? Oh, okay. There's like a trial room in the\n\n01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.560\nback that you have to try the octopus. Yeah, there's an ophthalmologist thinking put your\n\n01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.000\nchin on a thing and it's got little, measures your eyeball. Like, uh, we, uh, I think I\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.160\nknow exactly what you're looking for. So what's better, this or this?\n\n01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:54.960\nAll right. Somebody's, somebody's going to be the fun police. We got to, we, we, we,\n\n01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.320\nwe, we, we, let's play some D&D with our tricks, shall we? Yeah. Is Aaron here? Yeah, Aaron's\n\n01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:07.880\nuh, Erin McGathy to the stage. Erin McGathy. Does Aaron have a mic? Is there a mic for\n\n01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.200\nAaron? Do you have an extra mic? Emily's on the job. Okay. Emily Gordon. Hello, Aaron.\n\n01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:20.800\nFun show guys. Do you ever, you ever, you ever think of wearing more sweaters with like\n\n01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:34.080\nmultiple sleeves? Like, like, like six extra sleeves. Um, I don't think about that, but\n\n01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.200\nI do think about constructing like a really hard beak, like a tire on my head. It'd be\n\n01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.840\nlike a Bane mask. Uh, Emily, Camille's wife was just telling me backstage, you know, Camille's\n\n01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:52.400\nuh, weirdly obsessed with Octopus, with Octopi. Okay. Is that? The nature of my obsession\n\n01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.640\nis slightly different from the context that we're in. It starts with the Quran. I am\n\n01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:09.960\nobsessed. They, uh, they're like, uh, very, they're, uh, uh, actually, uh, uh, um, um,\n\n01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:17.280\nkind of a towel for fuck's sake. He's sweating. Give me eight towels. I, I, uh, they're actually\n\n01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:25.600\nhyper smart and they can learn to open jars and love. They, they can predict the, uh,\n\n01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.680\nthe elections. They can predict elections and seasons. And one, uh, scientist actually\n\n01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.040\nhad this, and you know, he had this octopus in his like aquarium, but it was open. It was\n\n01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.160\nlike his pet and he came in one day and the octopus was out of the aquarium and they can\n\n01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.520\nlearn to mimic humans. And wait, wait, wait, wait. No, they, it's wearing a lab coat. It's\n\n01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.680\non the way in the parking lot.\n\n01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:55.080\nIt's like the end of silence. Oh, wait, I'm just putting on a hat and going into Panama.\n\n01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:03.600\nHe was shoving another octopus up its ass. No, he came in and he saw the octopus like\n\n01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.240\njust flipping through a book, which at that point you just fucking killed yourself.\n\n01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.840\nSo is it like, like, like, like it knew how to use the book.\n\n01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:17.720\nIt had seen the scientists flipping pages and so it was just there like, oh, hey, uh,\n\n01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720\njust, uh,\n\n01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720\nThat is weird.\n\n01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.720\nNeeds more character development.\n\n01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:26.600\nI was, I was at an airport and there was a flight delay and there was a child with a,\n\n01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:32.200\nwith a mother and father and the child was probably, I'd say two and a half, three. And\n\n01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.520\nthere was a magazine, uh, and the kid was wandering around and bothering everybody and\n\n01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.040\nfound like a newsweek and put it on his lap and started running its finger across it like\n\n01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040\nan iPad.\n\n01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040\nYeah.\n\n01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.040\nAnd couldn't, couldn't master magazine technology.\n\n01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.280\nIt's a sub octopus human.\n\n01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.760\nYou get, sit there buddy.\n\n01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.760\nOh, sure.\n\n01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.040\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I, I, I was, I was, I was, I was running along, but I, but, but, but,\n\n01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.600\nbut the, the, the concept of intelligence, like, like, it's like, it's just nerve clusters.\n\n01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.680\nLike, like, like, like, we have these giant brains, which I'm a huge fan of. I am on our\n\n01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.520\nspecies side. I think that we need to decide right or wrong whether God made a mistake\n\n01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.000\nmaking us this way. Like these super intelligent monkeys. It was a fucking gamble. We've been,\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.240\nwe've been in the planet's crosshairs for, for so long. It's like tough titties that\n\n01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.840\nwere given a little back, uh, uh, you know, and we'll straighten up our aim. But it's\n\n01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.240\nlike, like, we're a hard species to keep alive because we're a fucking huge, like double\n\n01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.360\nzero bet on the roulette wheel of biological warfare. Like the idea of, of just flooding\n\n01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.680\nthis cranium with this folded over grotesque giant plate of spaghetti that has sentient\n\n01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.840\nthought and makes decisions and is conscious of its own fucking death. Like meanwhile ants\n\n01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.360\nare like, nah, well, we'll stick with what's working. And they'll probably beat us. Like,\n\n01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.680\nlike they will. They've been around for so long.\n\n01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680\nThey don't have depression.\n\n01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680\nRight.\n\n01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.920\nThey're not things. Like we look at them and you step on one ant and you go like that poor\n\n01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.080\nthing or I feel bad or I feel great cause I got fired today. But it's like the fucking\n\n01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.720\nant doesn't care that much. And yet it's part of this gigantic fucking incredibly sophisticated\n\n01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:13.680\norganism called an ant colony. That is the actual, that's the actual species is the colony.\n\n01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.760\nIt's not, it's not Mike, like the plumber. It's like, like the little, the little things\n\n01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.320\nyou're seeing. They're just like, anyways, I was like, like the idea of intelligence.\n\n01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.080\nAnd like, we were obsessed with the idea that, oh, of course you'd evolve towards that, but\n\n01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.560\nthis octopus knows how to pretend to read a book.\n\n01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.960\nWell, let's do some wishful thinking right now and let, let Kameo play some D and D for\n\n01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:32.960\npity's sake.\n\n01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960\nYeah.\n\n01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:34.960\nAre we Spencer?\n\n01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.160\nGet us up to date.\n\n01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.560\nSlowly he hands out his character sheets prematurely. Jeff hits the Spencer theme. Not knowing.\n\n01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:51.800\nDan does his impression of Spencer. He doesn't know whether Spencer likes it or not. He's\n\n01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.680\nbeen doing it a lot.\n\n01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.520\nSpencer finds it just fine before resuming his introduction.\n\n01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.720\nWhen we last met after almost spending an entire tour trapped within its fleshy confines\n\n01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:10.440\nour, our heroes had slain the mighty Infinifish. The party was flung out onto the ground of\n\n01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.960\na strange land. After pulling themselves up, the party surveyed the landscape. The surrounding\n\n01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.960\nplants and trees were tremendous emanating powerful and strange presences. The violet\n\n01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.960\nsky was full of orange balls of light bouncing and bobbing in the sky like blub, bubbles.\n\n01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.600\nThe Infinifish corpse lay in the strange forest strewn about the felled trees composing its\n\n01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.800\ndeathbed. Soon the party was accosted by a strange pair wielding axes who took the party\n\n01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.520\nto their camp after a tense introduction. Just then a misty fog rolled in, addling the\n\n01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.000\nminds of all parties involved and causing them to act strangely for a time.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.280\nYeah, that, that was fucked up.\n\n01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.560\nThat was, that was some Virginia Woolf shit, yeah.\n\n01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.080\nThe pair explained they had been searching for a rare legendary artifact known as the\n\n01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.640\nSoul of Growth, progenitor of all plant life and natural energy in the multi-verse. The\n\n01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:06.000\nmysterious entity roos rumored to be on twyla, the plane of angels forest. They fucked around\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.400\nfor a while. Then in a fit of progress, the barbarian fled south in hopes of finding the\n\n01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.680\nSoul of Growth through sheer coincidence. The rest, the rest of the ragtag group trailing\n\n01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680\nbehind.\n\n01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:24.960\nThank you Spencer, wow.\n\n01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.800\nI wanna ask a sidebar question about the inhabitants of the Infinifish that we had met and learned\n\n01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.280\nto relate to and are they all dead?\n\n01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.400\nWell okay, like imagine an infinitely long fish, right?\n\n01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.440\nNo problem.\n\n01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:47.440\nIf you were, if you exploded out of it at point A and they were, you know, you were farther\n\n01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.160\nalong than they were, they were spit out at some unknown point X if they survived. So\n\n01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.280\neven if they did, there would be no way of you guys really knowing you were pretty far\n\n01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280\ndown the fish.\n\n01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.480\nOh so it's like lost, like if we need them we'll find out that the tail section crashed\n\n01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480\nsomewhere else.\n\n01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.720\nOr you cared, you know, last episode you probably would have, you know, tried to look for them\n\n01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.400\nand maybe found them.\n\n01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.880\nI mean I'm just saying, they did what you want to do happens, you know.\n\n01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:19.800\nHey listen man, those two guys, they paid a thousand bucks to play D&D. I was so concerned\n\n01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800\nwith making them.\n\n01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.360\nIs this a thousand like actual dollars?\n\n01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360\nYeah.\n\n01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.160\nAnd they got up there and nothing happened. Aaron ultimately killed them and made up\n\n01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.360\nwith them like four times and it was really wild. Nobody knew what was going on.\n\n01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.200\nI wanted them to kill you but they didn't want to.\n\n01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.080\nWait, why did you want them to kill us? It would be a good prize.\n\n01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:46.360\nWell they only had one day. Also I met a horse.\n\n01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360\nYeah, Coco.\n\n01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.360\nHe's my horse, Coco.\n\n01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360\nYeah, you get a horse, yeah.\n\n01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360\nYeah.\n\n01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360\nKumele, I have a horse now.\n\n01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360\nWhat's the horse's name?\n\n01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360\nCoco.\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360\nYep.\n\n01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.720\nIs it like just a horse horse or like a talking horse?\n\n01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:08.240\nI mean, I can understand her. Is she just a horse? No. But technically yes, but technically\n\n01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.240\nyes.\n\n01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.720\nOkay, just so much more to you than a horse.\n\n01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720\nYes, yes.\n\n01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720\nGot it.\n\n01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720\nSo I was trying to leave this group, right?\n\n01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720\nYou guys, yeah.\n\n01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.320\nSo you struck off South and the team.\n\n01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.000\nIt surged the soul of growth.\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.680\nYeah, and you know, the team just kind of followed along because that seemed like a\n\n01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.680\ncool idea.\n\n01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.560\nWell, if I said that it was in a blackout drunk, what I really want to do is like root around\n\n01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.560\nand see if my concern is for the people that were in that fish, you know, like we're covered\n\n01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560\nin viscera.\n\n01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.480\nLike I'm going to root around a little bit and see if I can find them.\n\n01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.640\nLike you guys are, okay, so like in the fish, around the fish, or just in general anywhere\n\n01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640\non this forest?\n\n01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.280\nWell, we landed in a big pile of fish goo.\n\n01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.280\nTrue.\n\n01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280\nI'm looking for more fish wreckage.\n\n01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:57.080\nI'll take the outer perimeter, Coco and I will trot around the outer perimeter looking\n\n01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080\nfor people.\n\n01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.960\nOkay, so you could go either east or west.\n\n01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.120\nI go east.\n\n01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.120\nYou go east along the side of the fish.\n\n01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.440\nYou travel quite some way, but you feel that the fish goes on for infinity.\n\n01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.040\nIt's a long fish, Coco.\n\n01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.960\nYou see no split on the side of the fish.\n\n01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.680\nIf there was anyone spat out, it wasn't here.\n\n01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.680\nOkay.\n\n01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.680\nAll right.\n\n01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.280\nYou feel like it'd take several days to actually go through the whole length of this fish.\n\n01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280\nCan I ask a question?\n\n01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.000\nWhy are you guys looking for people who've fallen out of the fish?\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nThey didn't even.\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nThey just lived in it.\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nBut you're concerned, Dan, about these people.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nWhy are you guys looking for them?\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nHe's a compassionate soul.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nHe's a human being.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nWhat in the hell am I?\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nWhat kind of world is this?\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nAll right.\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nOkay.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nJust like concern for your humanity.\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nAll right.\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nGot it.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nI don't understand.\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:01.880\nSo, where are you heading now, Sharpie?\n\n01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.720\nYou're looking for people, but you didn't.\n\n01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.200\nWell, now I lost my friend.\n\n01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.360\nIt's true.\n\n01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.520\nI'm looking for the soul of growth.\n\n01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.480\nI'm on my way south, baby.\n\n01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.840\nYou head south.\n\n01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.400\nThe trees and get taller and thicker.\n\n01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.720\nThere doesn't really seem to be a path, but soon you come across a massive thicket of\n\n01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.360\ntrees that walls off any remaining progress.\n\n01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.000\nThe ground before you is littered with bones and bits of flesh and pieces of metal and\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.160\nlittle scraps of things as well as half-eating animals.\n\n01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.000\nI try to detect a trap around me.\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.400\nYou detect traps about you best to be careful.\n\n01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400\nOkay.\n\n01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400\nI stand perfectly still.\n\n01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400\nGood plan.\n\n01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:49.360\nIf you're rustling in the brush, someone makes it through the thick tangle of trees and the\n\n01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.880\nplain view.\n\n01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.480\nHe calls out, watch out for those traps.\n\n01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.760\nThey'll get you.\n\n01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:02.520\nThat's the introduction for a Kuhmels character who wanders on to frame.\n\n01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.000\nWho goes there?\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nFennett?\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.360\nFennett, if you want to change your name, I just write random things.\n\n01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.360\nFennett.\n\n01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.360\nYeah, like Fennett.\n\n01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360\nOkay.\n\n01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.360\nI'll change my name.\n\n01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360\nDo it.\n\n01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360\nImproved.\n\n01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360\nChris de Burghh.\n\n01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.360\nNice.\n\n01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.360\nChris de Burghh.\n\n01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360\nI wrote Lady in Red.\n\n01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.360\nOh, shit.\n\n01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360\nI like that.\n\n01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360\nIt's a great song.\n\n01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.360\nIt is a good song.\n\n01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360\nGod.\n\n01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.360\nWait, you wrote Lady in Red?\n\n01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360\nYeah, man.\n\n01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360\nI got it.\n\n01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360\nShit's been bad since then, though.\n\n01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360\nWho sang it, though?\n\n01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360\nWho sang Lady in Red?\n\n01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.360\nI sang it also.\n\n01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360\nYou sang it, too.\n\n01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.360\nThat's one of those guys that you never know who sang like that song.\n\n01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.360\nThat's great.\n\n01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360\nIt was me, Chris de Burghh.\n\n01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:50.360\nWhat are you doing in this thick forest surrounded by traps?\n\n01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.360\nShit got fucked, man.\n\n01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360\nThat was a big song.\n\n01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.360\nIt was really good.\n\n01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360\nI was like...\n\n01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:05.360\nBut you must have got all the royalties off that, right?\n\n01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360\nYeah.\n\n01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.360\nBut you know what happened was they started having proms themed around my song.\n\n01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.160\nNever sent me royalty checks for that.\n\n01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.800\nAnd I thought I could write that theme forever, so there was a Lady in Pink, which I'm sure\n\n01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800\nyou've never heard of.\n\n01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800\nNo.\n\n01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800\nSee, you can't go back to the well.\n\n01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.800\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800\nLady in yellow.\n\n01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.360\nThere was a dude in red, which...\n\n01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.360\nHave you ever heard of dudes in goo?\n\n01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.360\nNo, I've been here a long time.\n\n01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360\nWhat brings you out here?\n\n01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360\nWhat are you up to?\n\n01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.360\nWell, there's a lot of traps around.\n\n01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360\nAre they your traps?\n\n01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.360\nNo, I didn't set these traps.\n\n01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.360\nI wish I could afford traps.\n\n01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360\nDo you need some money?\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360\nAre you hungry?\n\n01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360\nWhat do you need, man?\n\n01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.360\nMoney would be great.\n\n01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.360\nI'd give them a couple small coins to get them to the day, Spencer.\n\n01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:59.360\nThe only trap I fell into was my own ineptitude with financial...\n\n01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.360\nWhy not the music industry, man?\n\n01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360\nIt's really wild.\n\n01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360\nIt's brutal.\n\n01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.360\nYeah.\n\n01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360\nCan I...\n\n01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.360\nI have a question about my spell, Detect Thoughts.\n\n01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.360\nAm I able to use that to find friends?\n\n01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360\nYou'd be able...\n\n01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.360\nOkay, so if someone was behind a wall thinking, like, you'd be able...\n\n01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.360\nI'd go, oh, that stands Thoughts.\n\n01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.360\nBut, like, it's not a huge range, so you'd be able to...\n\n01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.360\nAll mine's come to me or whatever.\n\n01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.360\nYou know what?\n\n01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.360\nCoco and I track down Sharpie and scoop him.\n\n01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360\nRejoining your compatriot.\n\n01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.360\nYou scoop him up into a horse.\n\n01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.360\nHey, I don't think finding these people that lived in the fish\n\n01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.360\ndoesn't seem to be a narratively profitable adventure.\n\n01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360\nI agree.\n\n01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.360\nBut I think that everybody noted what a great humanitarian you are.\n\n01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360\nThank you.\n\n01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360\nThat's honestly what's important.\n\n01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360\nMore important than the lives themselves, yeah.\n\n01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360\nAre there any animals around me, Spencer, that I can talk to?\n\n01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360\nI'm here.\n\n01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.360\nNo, no, no. I'm not an animal. I'm like little, like woodland creatures or anything.\n\n01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360\nI mean, you don't see any, right?\n\n01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360\nYou could, like, maybe do a call.\n\n01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.360\nI do a squirrel.\n\n01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.360\nSquirrel.\n\n01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360\nCall.\n\n01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360\nDo I have any...\n\n01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360\nI just...\n\n01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360\nYou think magic is dumb, if I recall correctly.\n\n01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360\nYeah.\n\n01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.360\nYou have some science items that are made with alchemy and whatnot,\n\n01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.360\nbut they're not so much magical.\n\n01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360\nYeah, so, Chris...\n\n01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.360\nCorpse.\n\n01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\n01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360\nI got a great new idea for a song.\n\n01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360\nOh, yeah?\n\n01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.360\nCorpse in red.\n\n01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360\nI'm just a known barbarian.\n\n01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.360\nI'm out for adventure and for profit,\n\n01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.360\nbut I really think you need to not keep going back to that same idea.\n\n01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360\nI don't know. It really worked great that one.\n\n01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360\nI know, but like, yeah, but like...\n\n01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360\nBut it's like, you know, like...\n\n01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360\nYou worked a song, right?\n\n01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360\nChubby Checker.\n\n01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360\nLady in red.\n\n01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360\nChubby Checker.\n\n01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.360\nShe's dancing with me.\n\n01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.360\nChubby Checker song.\n\n01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.360\nDoing the twist, right?\n\n01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.360\nYeah.\n\n01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.360\nThen he tried to rewrite the twist a thousand times and they all sucked.\n\n01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.360\nYou know, it's like, learn from Chubby Checker.\n\n01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.360\nLike, what's on your mind?\n\n01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360\nLike, what's...\n\n01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360\nWhat's some actual pain?\n\n01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:08.360\nI have an idea for a new song.\n\n01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.360\nIt's about...\n\n01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360\nIs it about being in a color?\n\n01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360\nIt's going to be about like, you meet someone and then it's like,\n\n01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360\ncall me maybe, you know?\n\n01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360\nOkay.\n\n01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.360\nSo that'll be the song.\n\n01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.360\nI like that.\n\n01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.360\nYeah.\n\n01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360\nIt's better than that.\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360\nYeah.\n\n01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.360\nOkay.\n\n01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.360\nThat is just to change subjects briefly.\n\n01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360\nI'm looking for the soul of growth.\n\n01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.360\nDo you know anything about that?\n\n01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360\nDo I?\n\n01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.360\nDo you want me to fill him in?\n\n01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.360\nYeah, what is the soul of growth?\n\n01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360\nDisess your character.\n\n01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.360\nYeah.\n\n01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360\nThe soul of growth is a rumored artifact that's, you know,\n\n01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360\nsupposed to be on Twyla.\n\n01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360\nThat's this plane we're on, you see.\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.360\nIt's rumored to be able to create life and birth even, you know,\n\n01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.360\nplanes and the magical plants and all sorts of crazy shit.\n\n01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.360\nLike, this whole forest used to just be the soul of growth\n\n01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360\nuntil it expanded.\n\n01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.360\nSo, it's a pretty big deal around here.\n\n01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.360\nSo, yeah, I've heard of it.\n\n01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.360\nWait, it's a pretty big deal around here.\n\n01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.360\nHave you ever been there?\n\n01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.360\nCould you show me the way?\n\n01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.360\nIf I...\n\n01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.360\nYou seem like you're a little down in your luck.\n\n01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.360\nI've got some...\n\n01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360\nI've got a sack of nuts.\n\n01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360\nI'll give you some nuts.\n\n01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.360\nNo, I'll give you some money.\n\n01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.360\nNo, it's like food, like actual nuts.\n\n01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.360\nI can forage for nuts.\n\n01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.360\nDo you have any, like, ham sandwiches?\n\n01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360\nDo I have any meat in my inventory?\n\n01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360\nYou should have some, like, foodstuffs.\n\n01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.360\nOkay, I...\n\n01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360\nI apply him with foodstuffs and say,\n\n01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360\nif you show me the way, I'll feed you.\n\n01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.360\nI'll make sure that you...\n\n01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.360\nWe'll maybe collaborate on some songs together,\n\n01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360\nand we'll go...\n\n01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360\nYou know what?\n\n01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360\nSoul of Growth sounds like a great place\n\n01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360\nto get your career back on track.\n\n01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.360\nOh, my God.\n\n01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.360\nThat does.\n\n01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360\nBecause that's who it needs growth.\n\n01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.360\nYeah.\n\n01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360\nMy career.\n\n01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360\nExactly.\n\n01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.360\nAll right.\n\n01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.360\nIf it can create a plane,\n\n01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.360\nit could certainly write us a new song.\n\n01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360\nIt needs to be a hit song.\n\n01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.360\nI've written hundreds of songs.\n\n01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.360\nOkay, but I just see, you know,\n\n01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360\nbecause I'm fronting you just money and food off the top,\n\n01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360\nI get 80% of your back end.\n\n01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360\nThat sounds like a good deal.\n\n01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360\nDo I actually know where it is?\n\n01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.360\nI mean, you are aware that it's in a...\n\n01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360\nIt's supposed to be in the shrine.\n\n01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.360\nTo the top.\n\n01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.360\nAll right, I'll tell you.\n\n01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.360\nOkay.\n\n01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.360\nSo we...\n\n01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360\nLeave me there.\n\n01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360\nConversing.\n\n01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360\nRiding on the back of Mulraine's horse Coco,\n\n01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.360\nher hair whipping into my face,\n\n01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.360\nthe horse's...\n\n01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.360\nI like it.\n\n01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.360\nRhythms gyrating my gyrations.\n\n01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.360\nI asked her to stop.\n\n01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.360\nI asked her to stop the horse for a moment.\n\n01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360\nMulraine stopped.\n\n01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.360\nIt's only been so long since you've turned into a woman.\n\n01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360\nBut we are in a different dimension.\n\n01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.360\nI feel like the rules don't apply.\n\n01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.360\nI want to make love to you.\n\n01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360\nRight now, in the dirt,\n\n01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360\nwell, this horse watches.\n\n01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.360\nI heard through the wind that you've been abstaining from\n\n01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360\npledging yourself.\n\n01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360\nFor you.\n\n01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.360\nAnd for my magic.\n\n01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:31.360\nIt actually adds a point of damage to my ray of frost.\n\n01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.360\nWell, yes.\n\n01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360\nLet's do it in the dirt.\n\n01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360\nAs long as we can do it underneath Coco,\n\n01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360\nunderneath her shade.\n\n01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360\nOkay.\n\n01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360\nI mean, it's a well-trained horse ray.\n\n01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.360\nIt's not going to step on me.\n\n01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360\nNo, no.\n\n01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360\nShe won't do anything.\n\n01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.360\nShe'll watch, but she won't move.\n\n01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360\nI make love to Mulraine's Sedana\n\n01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360\nunderneath her horse Coco.\n\n01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.360\nIt's pretty sensual.\n\n01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360\nCushy, cushy.\n\n01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360\nCushy, cushy.\n\n01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.360\nIs that good or bad?\n\n01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360\nYeah.\n\n01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360\nHe jerks off at the end to finish himself.\n\n01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360\nAs is commanded in the Koran.\n\n01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360\nI wiped the confetti off my stomach.\n\n01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.360\nThat's how good I am.\n\n01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.360\nJust a little bit of confetti falls from the heavens.\n\n01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.360\nOh, no, I thought it was coming out of the...\n\n01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.360\nOh.\n\n01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.360\nRip, rip, Taylor.\n\n01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.360\nSharpie, I know that your relationship with Quirk\n\n01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.360\nis very close.\n\n01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360\nWill this interfere?\n\n01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.360\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360\nHe'll figure it out.\n\n01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.360\nHe'll adapt.\n\n01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.360\nHis relationship with me is, you know,\n\n01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.360\none that doesn't involve things going into each other.\n\n01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.360\nI don't fully believe that, but I trust you.\n\n01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.360\nSo you stopped jerking off for three days\n\n01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360\nand you fuck Aaron and D&D?\n\n01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360\nVery romantic now.\n\n01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.360\nThis is so much sense.\n\n01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360\nUnder a horse.\n\n01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.360\nWhile that same horse was watching.\n\n01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.360\nDoesn't even make sense.\n\n01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.360\nBecause I have to assume that means it's their turn.\n\n01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360\nI mean, it's not like...\n\n01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.360\nWell, Sharpie, let's mount Coco\n\n01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.360\nand head to the soul explosion yard.\n\n01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.360\nWhat was it called?\n\n01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.360\nThe soul explosion yard.\n\n01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:46.360\nI don't think the soul explosion yard was your belly just now.\n\n01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:54.360\nCut to me, Quirk and Christopher just jerking off next to a tree.\n\n01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360\nOh, boy.\n\n01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360\nOh, God.\n\n01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.360\nThat was a good idea, Chris.\n\n01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360\nI'm not done yet, give me a second.\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360\nOkay, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.360\nSorry, I'm going to smoke one of my smoke sticks.\n\n01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360\nI got a new idea.\n\n01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.360\nOh, shit.\n\n01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.360\nLady in white.\n\n01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.360\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.360\nAgain, let's go to the soul of growth.\n\n01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.360\nYeah, okay, I know there's a temple.\n\n01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360\nOkay, we have to navigate through these traps.\n\n01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.360\nI use a...\n\n01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.360\nCan I detect the trap?\n\n01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.360\nWhat's the best way to navigate through these traps?\n\n01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.360\nYou can attempt to find a trap.\n\n01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:32.360\nOnce you see it, you can either avoid it or dismantle it somehow.\n\n01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.360\nOkay, how many traps lay ahead of me?\n\n01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.360\nWell, you don't know, so let's see how many you find.\n\n01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.360\nIs there anything I have that would help?\n\n01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:45.360\nYou are also adept at finding traps, so you could both sweep for traps.\n\n01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360\nLet's discover...\n\n01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.360\nWhat is your class or race, or what are you?\n\n01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.360\nHe's a human world.\n\n01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.360\nSinger-songwriter?\n\n01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360\nNo, I know that, Christopher.\n\n01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.360\nYou are very...\n\n01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360\nDid you ever...\n\n01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360\nLevel one with a bullet.\n\n01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.360\nHave you heard Lady in red?\n\n01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360\nIt was a huge song.\n\n01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360\nKids...\n\n01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360\nWhat is he?\n\n01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.360\nI'm a human thief with some...\n\n01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360\nYou got some items.\n\n01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360\nKind of like Batman.\n\n01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.360\nIs he currently surrounded by traps?\n\n01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360\nPresumably he knows how to get through these traps.\n\n01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360\nPresumably he does.\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.360\nI follow Christopher for traps.\n\n01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360\nYeah, I know where the traps are, right?\n\n01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.360\nI've been here.\n\n01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.360\nYou've been here.\n\n01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.360\nChristopher, again, all the food and gold you want.\n\n01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.360\nLet's get to the Soul of Growth, if you can lead the way.\n\n01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360\nI have no use for gold.\n\n01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360\nI've got gold records and stuff.\n\n01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360\nHow many gold records really do you have?\n\n01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360\nTwo, one.\n\n01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.360\nIt was this song.\n\n01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.360\nI promise you, if we get to the Soul of Growth,\n\n01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360\na new gold record, maybe even platinum.\n\n01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.360\nOkay, alright, well follow me.\n\n01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:04.360\nOkay.\n\n01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.360\nAlright, are we through?\n\n01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.360\nOkay, so do you guys want to join back up yet?\n\n01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.360\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.360\nOkay, we're going through the traps.\n\n01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.360\nAs you blaze your trails, a horse approaches.\n\n01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360\nOh!\n\n01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.360\nOh my god, Sharpie, Mulrainee, Chris de Burgh!\n\n01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.360\nHey!\n\n01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.360\nHe wrote Lady in Red.\n\n01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.360\nHave you guys heard Lady in Red?\n\n01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.360\nIt was a big song.\n\n01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.360\nI literally thought you were dead.\n\n01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.360\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.360\nI've just been lost for a while.\n\n01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.360\nSpiritually and also physically.\n\n01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.360\nMulrainee, you have some confetti in your hair.\n\n01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.360\nOh, let me just...\n\n01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.360\nI put it in a plastic bag and I put it in my pocket.\n\n01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360\nTom Lakers is right.\n\n01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.360\nIt was a Tom Lakers, it was a bad Tom Lakers joke.\n\n01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360\nSorry, everybody.\n\n01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.360\nI know where the Soul of Growth is.\n\n01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.360\nYou know?\n\n01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.360\nWe're going to follow Christopher, a famous singer-songwriter,\n\n01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360\nthrough these traps, because he knows the way.\n\n01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360\nI know the way.\n\n01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.360\nWe're going to go to the Soul of Growth.\n\n01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.360\nWe're going to get whatever we want and also...\n\n01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360\nHe's giving me food and gold.\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.360\nFood and gold, but I really want to get this guy's career back online.\n\n01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.360\nThat's great.\n\n01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.360\nIf you've got any ideas for songs, you know, I'm like a sponge right now.\n\n01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360\nHow about...\n\n01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.360\nCocoa and Brown.\n\n01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.360\nCocoa and Brown.\n\n01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360\nI think you've got to get off the color thing.\n\n01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.360\nI've been telling them this for like all day.\n\n01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.360\nIf you're going to detect traps, then why can't you...\n\n01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.360\nLike, look at the creative pitfalls.\n\n01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.360\nLike, all around you, you know?\n\n01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.360\nAnd just get out of the area, you know?\n\n01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360\nLike, sneak past all of it.\n\n01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360\nOr you're also...\n\n01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360\nYeah, no, I'm going to.\n\n01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360\nI know how to do the traps.\n\n01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.360\nThere's an actual guy who wrote Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\n\n01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.360\nWe'll never know his name, but he probably wrote a bunch of shitty songs.\n\n01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360\nJason Priestley.\n\n01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.360\nBut you're a thief, right?\n\n01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.360\nWhy don't we just like break into Tom Waits' house or something like that\n\n01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.360\nand steal some song ideas?\n\n01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360\nI don't think my voice is...\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360\nI point my horse towards Tom Waits' house.\n\n01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.360\nYour horse doesn't know.\n\n01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.360\nSo I feel like now that we have one,\n\n01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360\nwe've made a new friend, Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.360\nLet's go to...\n\n01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360\nWe're embarking towards the soul of growth.\n\n01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.360\nI think that's a good cliffhanger, right?\n\n01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nI mean, certainly chronologically, we...\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360\nYeah, I think we're running longer.\n\n01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360\nI think now Camille, we've got you on board here now.\n\n01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360\nYeah, you've got to come back next week now.\n\n01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360\nMay I say quickly?\n\n01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.360\nIn the back, we're selling these t-shirts that Dan is wearing.\n\n01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360\nWait, are we not in this world anymore?\n\n01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360\nThis is Coco speaking.\n\n01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360\nOh, t-shirts.\n\n01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360\nPads from D&D World.\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360\nWe have t-shirts in the back.\n\n01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360\nI don't know how many times we'll sell them again.\n\n01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.360\nThis might be the last time.\n\n01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360\nThey're $15 or two for $25.\n\n01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360\nOtherwise, they're online and they're more expensive.\n\n01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360\nBut yeah, come buy a t-shirt.\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360\nThat's all.\n\n01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360\nThey've got confetti on them.\n\n01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360\nFrom the tour.\n\n01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.360\nDon't worry, by confetti, we mean Dancecom.\n\n01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360\nAll right.\n\n01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360\nThank you, Aaron.\n\n01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360\nThank you, Camille, Nanjiani.\n\n01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360\nThank you, guys.\n\n01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.360\nThank you, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360\nYou can...\n\n01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360\nThat's exciting.\n\n01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.360\nWe have a new member of our party.\n\n01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360\nYeah, for the time being, anyway.\n\n01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360\nChris Berg.\n\n01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.360\nFinding out the...\n\n01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360\nthe octopus thing.\n\n01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360\nBut,
