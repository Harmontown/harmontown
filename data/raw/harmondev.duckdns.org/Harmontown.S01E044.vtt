WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.240
Oh, it's so nice to be back at Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater here in Hollywood, California.

00:23.240 --> 00:31.640
I've triumphant returned back to our cozy little nest in our loyal harmonians.

00:31.640 --> 00:40.240
We've been all over the country. I'm not sure what we learned, but I do know that it's very nice to be sitting here again with you people.

00:40.240 --> 01:04.240
Harmontown is finally back in session in Hollywood, California. Put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:04.240 --> 01:24.240
I may be wrapped out, I don't know. Fuck you guys that applauded. I'm a rap master. That's why I'm wrapped out, because I perfected the art, not because it was obnoxious and tiresome.

01:24.240 --> 01:47.240
It is really, really oddly comfortable to be back. It's really weird. We tried to do this shot, Neil, the guy doing the documentary, wanted to do this shot where I would walk down the sidewalk outside NerdMelt, walk through the door into an empty comic book store, just keep walking, and it would be perfectly timed with Jeff bringing me up.

01:47.240 --> 01:57.240
Did I fuck it up? I don't know. I don't know if you fucked it up. I have no idea. It's fucked up.

01:57.240 --> 02:00.240
Were you standing in the doorway for like 10 seconds?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.240
Should we try it again?

02:04.240 --> 02:12.240
Well, go back outside. Just yell at me, Neil. This is fucking bullshit.

02:12.240 --> 02:19.240
Yeah, welcome home.

02:19.240 --> 02:33.240
Oh, we're back everybody. Meltdown Congress in Hollywood, California. Harmontown is once again in session.

02:33.240 --> 02:48.240
Put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

02:48.240 --> 03:05.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I walked from the sidewalk to the back. It was seamless.

03:05.240 --> 03:11.240
Wow. Dan, where were you? We missed you. I was in the green room. You left for a while.

03:11.240 --> 03:18.240
Jeff, I do what I always do before a show. I went and stood outside of 7-Eleven.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.240
You climb up on top of the fire escape and stand there like Batman.

03:22.240 --> 03:29.240
I stare at my fist and talk about the darkness of the city. And then when the mood takes me, I clamber down and I just make a beeline.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.240
I just hope to God that you're starting the show at that particular time.

03:33.240 --> 03:42.240
How could you possibly have any idea that I'm starting the show? I'm just hoping that you hear the frequency of audience joy.

03:42.240 --> 03:48.240
The truth is, Jeff, there are parallel universes where you're in the middle of introducing the show and I just walk up and tell you to fuck off.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.240
I just interrupt you.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.240
So we just got lucky once again.

03:51.240 --> 03:57.240
Yeah, Harmontown is a show that is not written, therefore it is written by God.

03:57.240 --> 04:04.240
And he doesn't make mistakes. You don't punch him up.

04:04.240 --> 04:14.240
His draft is final, man. That's all you gotta do is do nothing at all and you are doing the work of a master.

04:14.240 --> 04:21.240
What if I get really serious about that and told you the good news?

04:21.240 --> 04:29.240
I am feeling very spiritual lately. I was going on the tour and also, I was a bad friend for not listening to it in the first place,

04:29.240 --> 04:34.240
but I've been really, really diving into Duncan Trussell lately. He is amazing.

04:34.240 --> 04:45.240
Every Lutheran bone in my body, every superstitious fiber of my being makes me want to knock on every piece of wood in the room and say,

04:45.240 --> 04:55.240
please, universe, this isn't how it sounds, but in all seriousness, there's no other way to express this.

04:55.240 --> 05:09.240
He makes testicular cancer sound fun. He's so fucking cool. You're just like, oh man, I could get cancer. That would be no problem.

05:09.240 --> 05:16.240
You almost want to get it, like listening to him because he's so fucking cool.

05:16.240 --> 05:23.240
I think he puts a very beautiful, heroic, funny face on it, but still, radiation is a giant bummer. You wouldn't last a minute.

05:23.240 --> 05:29.240
No, I wouldn't at all. He doesn't deny any of that stuff though. He doesn't say it's not a bummer.

05:29.240 --> 05:40.240
He's very emphatic about embracing also the pain of life and acknowledging it for pain. That's what's so fucking cool about him. God damn it, I want to make love to him.

05:40.240 --> 05:50.240
But let's do his podcast. It's great. He's a sister of Harmontown, a sister podcast.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.240
I'm going to get a drink. What do you want to talk about, Jeff?

05:53.240 --> 06:00.240
I actually do have some questions because we came back and we did this tour and there was an unanswered question.

06:00.240 --> 06:09.240
If you answered it one-on-one with the filmmakers, I wasn't there. There seemed to be the eternally unanswered question of what the point of it all was.

06:09.240 --> 06:17.240
You said that as you returned and you came back to LA at the big Egyptian theater show that you learned nothing.

06:17.240 --> 06:26.240
But I realized tonight in the green room, I actually finally figured it out. It's the dumbest thing in the world because it's right under your nose and it's sort of so generic.

06:26.240 --> 06:33.240
The entire time we were out there, we were doing these shows. We were doing performances. Shows can be good or bad.

06:33.240 --> 06:48.240
There was a good show. There was a bad show. The show's not going so good. You talked about Chevy Chase in that show. It was a season four premiere.

06:48.240 --> 07:04.240
Thinking about it as a performance beforehand, no matter how much you try to not think about it and not pre-write anything and stuff, then we went out on a bus that said, like, show's coming to town and went to Portland and went, hello, Portland, we're doing a show.

07:04.240 --> 07:12.240
I don't know why we're Southern when we do the show. It's because we're like this Wild West show. We're out there like, we're doing a show here. Now we're doing a show there.

07:12.240 --> 07:24.240
Now we're doing a show here and the whole time we were doing shows everywhere, we kept saying, both in our hearts and our brains and out loud with our mouths, we kept saying, at some point we're going to go back home.

07:24.240 --> 07:36.240
Now when we say home, we don't mean me and my underwear watching Die Hard 2. We mean like this. So if this is home, then this isn't a show anymore.

07:36.240 --> 07:54.240
And so the transformative thing, probably for the audience's lack of benefit, is that I don't give a shit anymore. Pat Noswalt was right. I came back. I was in the green room and I was like, the thought of it as a show did not hit my head.

07:54.240 --> 08:03.240
It's a tee-up for some critic from the audience to yell out, like, start thinking of it as a show now, please. $10, my friend, still green.

08:03.240 --> 08:11.240
It's better when you just, like, my favorite show was Salt Lake City where there was 62 people and we brought a Mormon chick up on stage and we talked about it. And it was like, it felt like this.

08:11.240 --> 08:19.240
That was the closest we had to Meltdown was this small little comedy club with iron girders here and there and it was a small little room, but you didn't need another person in there.

08:19.240 --> 08:32.240
And it really was like the most communicative and together. I like the show here because it's become this little revival tent and we start meeting people and like when we connect with that night's audience.

08:32.240 --> 08:40.240
And it's cool to go to Salt Lake City where, you know, you don't have any expectations like, fucking, we're gonna hit Salt Lake, baby, the city of lights.

08:40.240 --> 08:51.240
But that was my favorite one because that was the most like this. I think when you're not Wayne Brady, you're not gonna get up there and sing a big song and do a tab dance and that.

08:51.240 --> 08:57.240
Dan, it's time you fucking own the fact that you're never gonna be Wayne Brady, man.

08:57.240 --> 09:02.240
For those of you listening, my expression is deeply and sincerely hurt.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.240
Alright, well, let's find out if you are Wayne Brady, you know?

09:12.240 --> 09:15.240
Should I do an impression of the clumps?

09:15.240 --> 09:28.240
I saw him do that once.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.240
Now you're Wayne Brady. Yeah, you're gonna be Wayne Brady.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.240
I am Wayne Brady.

09:33.240 --> 09:46.240
Why are you hanging out with him?

09:46.240 --> 09:57.240
I don't hate hoes. I love them. And I love singing in different styles with accents.

09:57.240 --> 10:05.240
I'm not really familiar with his work.

10:05.240 --> 10:10.240
I saw him in the Chappelle thing. It was awesome.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.240
We'll edit all this out. That's my new mantra.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.240
No, that fucking stays.

10:16.240 --> 10:21.240
Anyways, let's get to the goods, man. Let's get to the confessional goods.

10:21.240 --> 10:25.240
Dig some shit out of me, Jeff. That's the thing that I'm going to town.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.240
Hi, Portland. Hey, Portland. I looked on Wikipedia.

10:29.240 --> 10:37.240
Your town has a tall building and a weather phenomenon called the Borealis Fagoris.

10:37.240 --> 10:41.240
Your sports team is the Cougars.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.240
Small talk, small talk. Jeff, small talk.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.240
Couldn't wait to get back here and get deep.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.240
Talk to me about my butt and my dick and stuff.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.240
But why couldn't you get deep with those people?

10:51.240 --> 10:54.240
I could. No, that was my mistake. That's not Portland's mistake.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.240
I'm just saying, going out there, that's what happened to me.

10:56.240 --> 11:00.240
I was like, oh, hi, Portland. Thanks for having me in your town, Portland.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.240
Oh, I love you, Portland. Oh, hi, Austin.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.240
Oh, would you like a mint?

11:05.240 --> 11:11.240
Austin, trivia fact, the cowboy hat was invented here.

11:11.240 --> 11:15.240
And then, oh, I fucked your mom in a cowboy hat.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.240
What do you think about that?

11:17.240 --> 11:20.240
Jeff, it's not real. I want to get real.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.240
I couldn't wait to get back here and get real.

11:23.240 --> 11:29.240
These are my 50 shades of gray seto masochistic partners.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.240
These are the safety pin nipples.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.240
These are the hot wax people.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.240
See, here's what I concerned, this behavior that you're showing right now

11:37.240 --> 11:42.240
was my concern towards the end that Harmontown was a very dangerous thing for you.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.240
Because you do this show, you go, I would talk about my Hemiroy,

11:45.240 --> 11:47.240
and I'm going to talk about fucking your mama, and like nothing I got hate.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.240
I dare you to not like me.

11:49.240 --> 11:54.280
not like me. And then after the show, everybody comes up and likes you and wants you to sign

11:54.280 --> 11:59.920
a thing and sign your image or sign your book or do this. And you find out possibly a very

11:59.920 --> 12:08.840
dangerous thing for you. The idea that you can't do something wrong, right? On the tour

12:08.840 --> 12:15.440
bus, you started to kind of hulk out a couple of times. It's called Harmontown. You called

12:15.440 --> 12:19.880
it Harmon Country. Yeah. And there's images of you everywhere. There's all these shirts

12:19.880 --> 12:25.560
and there's pins and there's books and there's just this giant narcissist jacuzzi that you

12:25.560 --> 12:32.960
just settle into. You just sit there like a definitely had the upper hand in fights

12:32.960 --> 12:46.200
with my girlfriend Harmontown. Read the sign. Population me. It's me. Well, my one prediction

12:46.200 --> 12:50.960
was right. You fuckers fought a lot on that trip. I mean, I think again, you might have

12:50.960 --> 12:54.000
maybe that's as much as you fight when I'm not with you all the time. I've never been

12:54.000 --> 12:58.800
with you almost all the time. The kind of day and night we were around each other quite

12:58.800 --> 13:06.000
a bit. But you guys, wow, we like to go at it. Sometimes on stage. Sometimes she's my

13:06.000 --> 13:12.360
tempestuous, fiery Irish muse. And now she it's a the thing that blew my mind. We were

13:12.360 --> 13:19.680
in Pittsburgh. I don't know if anybody heard that one. The ladies, the ladies left Pittsburgh.

13:19.680 --> 13:26.080
The guys are like, he was right in the middle of a fart joke. I'm surprised. I thought Pittsburgh

13:26.080 --> 13:31.240
set the set the woman's rights movement back about 75 years, because she came out and she

13:31.240 --> 13:34.440
had been crying about a bit that you had been doing about fucking a young girl. And it was

13:34.440 --> 13:39.400
totally a bit. And then she announced that you call her the C word. And then the show

13:39.400 --> 13:46.240
came to just a screech, just to a total stop. And then at the end of that, she said, So

13:46.240 --> 13:52.000
can I move in with you? And I was like, Wow, I thought I thought that was yeah, that made

13:52.000 --> 13:58.240
me not ask her to move in with me for like two extra weeks. But then you end you end

13:58.240 --> 14:04.200
the tour by asking her to move in with you. Yeah, that's two weeks. I was going to ask

14:04.200 --> 14:09.520
her any minute. And then she fucking said it. Like, you know, I can't say yes. When someone

14:09.520 --> 14:12.160
we were thinking the same thing at the same time, we're in love with each other, deal

14:12.160 --> 14:20.160
with it. We're soulmates. And Jeff, you're great. You're very cool. You're in your suit,

14:20.160 --> 14:24.080
you know, and you, you're, you're, you're, you have this, you have this, you have this

14:24.080 --> 14:29.120
armor against the world, you know, you're, you're the emotionless, like, even, even

14:29.120 --> 14:34.280
keel, even keel guy, you know, he's, he likes his front bronca and he's, he likes to watch

14:34.280 --> 14:39.520
the history channel. And every, every, every, every city we went to, he went to a bookstore

14:39.520 --> 14:48.160
and bought an obscure book and then went to a, went to a bar and read it. Like, I just,

14:48.160 --> 14:52.000
I know he sounds awesome. You're not allowed. You're not allowed to hate it.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Does he have a sister?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.560
You know, and you're fine. You're the master of your, of your, of your domain. Oh, speaking

15:00.560 --> 15:06.240
of which, I haven't jerked off in like three days for three days. Like, like, like it might

15:06.240 --> 15:10.480
be four now. Yeah. I made this decision. I went on Duncan Trussell's podcast. We talked

15:10.480 --> 15:13.840
about jerking off. And how did you connect that? We're talking about how awesome I am

15:13.840 --> 15:19.000
to master, master of, well, I heard the word master. He's not about your dick. No, no,

15:19.000 --> 15:25.920
no, no. He reads too many books. He doesn't watch Seinfeld. Master of my domain is a Seinfeld

15:25.920 --> 15:31.600
like line in reference to the episode where they all tried to not jerk off. But yeah,

15:31.600 --> 15:39.520
I, I, I, I'm, I'm four days into what the, what they call on Reddit, no FAP.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.560
The word FAP is a bummer. It is a bummer. It's a huge bummer. Don't say FAP. It's so

15:44.560 --> 15:50.440
it did not fucking say FAP over any circumstances. Don't type it. Don't read it. Don't fucking.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.640
Yeah. It is the worst. Like, like I was introduced to that word when we first started doing community

15:54.640 --> 15:58.760
and there was an interview with Alison Brie and the, in the onion or something. And then

15:58.760 --> 16:02.280
there was a comment section and there, there was like a comment that said like FAP, FAP,

16:02.280 --> 16:09.800
FAP, FAP, FAP, FAP. And I was like, what is that? Oh, it made me, it just made me,

16:09.800 --> 16:14.800
yeah. Imagine your Hawaiian shirt and your surgical gloves and your, just your, I can,

16:14.800 --> 16:21.360
I can, I can, I can. What did you just reveal about your software?

16:21.360 --> 16:27.160
That I've seen the movie. What was it called? The hardwired or whatever. Wow. 90s movie.

16:27.160 --> 16:32.920
Don't conjure up imagery for me. Don't, don't make me part of your world. No onomatopoeia

16:32.920 --> 16:38.640
in sexuality. Don't ask black people time travel questions. No onomatopoeia in sex.

16:38.640 --> 16:48.160
That's it. That's it. We got, we found our constitution. We did it. It took us a whole

16:48.160 --> 16:53.200
tour to figure that out. Go deep, Jeff. Come on. Get me, get, I want to reveal something.

16:53.200 --> 16:59.040
That's, that's what the show is. Come on. Hit me in the quick. I don't want to, I want

16:59.040 --> 17:05.720
to talk about something real. Okay. Do you watch the Grammys?

17:05.720 --> 17:15.960
Don't cry. Don't cry. I didn't.

17:15.960 --> 17:20.520
Fuck the Grammys too. Fuck it, fuck it up. Whatever.

17:20.520 --> 17:27.120
Well, I mean, I don't know, man. I, I, I really feel like, I don't know. I wanted to barber

17:27.120 --> 17:30.480
Walter, Walter's you tonight, but we have guests we want to bring up. But then I thought

17:30.480 --> 17:33.080
like, I'm not going, I'm not going because I don't even know what the angle would be.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.960
I, I really feel that there was an opportunity, not that you're going to go out there and

17:37.960 --> 17:40.880
you, you, you, you, not that you're Walt Whitman and you're going to go find that where you

17:40.880 --> 17:44.960
lived and what you lived for and shit, but you would come back with the disco like, oh,

17:44.960 --> 17:49.480
that's why, or this is what's important to me. This is what Harmontown is. This is what,

17:49.480 --> 17:54.880
I mean, we learned little details and stuff like that, but I feel like there was, there

17:54.880 --> 17:59.240
really is a reason you did it. There was, there was, there was some reason you stood

17:59.240 --> 18:03.520
after every show and met those people. There was something driving you to do that in the

18:03.520 --> 18:06.680
first place. That was more than, oh, it's a birthday present to myself. I think there

18:06.680 --> 18:12.200
really is a subconscious desire and drive there that I don't know that you even know

18:12.200 --> 18:13.200
what it is.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
No, I don't, Jeff. I don't.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.200
Are you being serious?

18:15.200 --> 18:18.520
No, I don't, I don't. That's something to do with connecting with people. And I think

18:18.520 --> 18:21.800
I was looking forward to getting back here because this is the place where people, like,

18:21.800 --> 18:25.080
like we would go to certain places where you couldn't hear the people, but they had listened

18:25.080 --> 18:29.560
to the podcast. So they know that if Maddie here in the front row, whose name I know, because

18:29.560 --> 18:32.480
you can see everybody in the audience and you can hear everybody in the audience, if

18:32.480 --> 18:36.000
she pipes up, if she goes like, that reminds me of pants.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.320
Then I go, I'm sorry, what the fuck are you talking about, Maddie? What are you, why did

18:40.320 --> 18:44.320
you say that? It reminds you of pants. And then she'll say like, well, cause I love pants

18:44.320 --> 18:48.440
and you just said Christmas and Christmas is good pants are good. Well, okay. Very good.

18:48.440 --> 18:54.440
So you want to come up here and talk about your fucking Christmas pants, Maddie?

18:54.440 --> 18:57.960
I wonder if anybody out here, I mean, this is a tough question. And I don't want Adam

18:57.960 --> 19:04.640
Goldberg to storm the stage when I ask this. I wonder if anybody, because there are, if,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.800
how many of you, and I'm not like just like asking for like a round of applause, but how

19:07.800 --> 19:11.400
many of you listen to all of them, like the, all the podcast? Don't raise your hands.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Oof.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.880
You have to clap. All right. So I wonder like maybe, maybe one of these people would have

19:16.880 --> 19:21.240
a better like overall perspective on what that actually was, if it was anything at all, if

19:21.240 --> 19:22.480
it succeeded at anything.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.360
You're really begging for Adam Goldberg to storm the stage.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.200
I certainly am not certain.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.040
Maddie, did you listen to all those shows?

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
Yeah.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.400
All right. Would you, would you like to come up and give us a little report?

19:33.400 --> 19:37.840
Hello, Maddie. Come on up on stage.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.720
Your mother list tonight, your mother's not here. She's all grown up.

19:41.720 --> 19:53.920
Okay. Maddie, Maddie is a young child that used to come to the show with her mother. That

19:53.920 --> 19:55.520
is now, now you're in college.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
I am.

19:56.520 --> 20:01.240
Everything's cool. All right. I feel less guilty now of saying the things I say in front

20:01.240 --> 20:02.240
of you.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.240
What are you studying in college?

20:03.240 --> 20:04.240
Looking into media studies.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.240
Who? Media studies?

20:05.240 --> 20:06.240
Yeah.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
Yeah.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
What's cool?

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
Occidental.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.240
Oh, great.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
Yeah.

20:11.240 --> 20:18.520
All right. So what's your, what's your take on the, what, what, what, the tour? Anything.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.520
Say it.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.680
I can handle anything now. I'm a master.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.680
You declared yourself God at the last show.

20:25.680 --> 20:31.000
And in this one, and, and every day forth, I am God.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.880
I think Maddie, sorry to interrupt, but I really think that you're in a dangerous psychological

20:36.880 --> 20:37.880
place right now.

20:37.880 --> 20:42.560
Or, or whatever the opposite of dangerous is. Safe?

20:42.560 --> 20:49.640
It doesn't feel safe. So I guess it's probably dangerous.

20:49.640 --> 20:53.520
I think you're closer to being Hans Gruber than John McClain now.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.520
Yeah. You know, you know, you know who else was in a dangerous psychological place?

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
Don't say Jesus.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
God.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.520
Okay.

21:00.520 --> 21:07.080
Because he was nothing at the beginning of everything and it bummed him out so much

21:07.080 --> 21:09.200
he had to explode into some things.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.240
Are you saying you're going to explode?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.560
I, he hasn't jerked off for three days.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.560
He's coming for you.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.400
Are you going to create a universe of jizz in this place?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
Jesus.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
She's, she, she, Maddie.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
Sorry.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
How much now, but she's still a kid.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
Okay.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.400
All right, Maddie. What's your take?

21:26.400 --> 21:33.400
Well, I think you definitely exceeded in becoming God in your own mind. I think, I think, I

21:33.400 --> 21:38.080
think the more, the more you met people and the more people were in the audience, you

21:38.080 --> 21:40.600
took on that God role and.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.080
What's that guy doing? What's that guy doing?

21:42.080 --> 21:43.080
Yeah.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.080
What are you doing?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.080
What are you doing, dude?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.080
What are you, what are you?

21:46.080 --> 21:47.080
He's typing on his phone.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.080
Are you tweeting his quotes?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
Well, no, what's he, are you, are you?

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
You're going to post a vine.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.200
Oh, okay. That's all right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to terrify you.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.200
Yes, you did. You did mean to.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.440
Do you have a hand like mine?

21:59.440 --> 22:03.280
But no, you do. You actually does. Okay. I'm not God.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.280
Not yet.

22:04.280 --> 22:09.160
But then, but then, but then when you found out that he was putting up a vine image, I

22:09.160 --> 22:11.760
got a gift of you doing something, you're like, oh, that's cool. Keep it up.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.760
Okay. Fine. Yeah. As long as it's not of Duncan Tressel. All right.

22:14.760 --> 22:20.560
Okay. Continue, Maddie. Sorry. I just, there was somebody that was not, you know.

22:20.560 --> 22:25.400
Not, not, not bowing, not scraping, not, not, not, not worshiping at the altar.

22:25.400 --> 22:29.760
It was tweeting and fleeting and scooping.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.640
Dangerous, dangerous territory. Did you learn anything about Dan or about Harmontown throughout

22:34.640 --> 22:39.200
that journey? Or was it just kind of a linear waste of time?

22:39.200 --> 22:46.920
I feel like he's revealed so much of himself in past podcasts, past tweets, past life that

22:46.920 --> 22:50.760
he just like anything he said on tour didn't really surprise me. Like he could have been

22:50.760 --> 22:54.560
talking about butts and cocks and dicks and whatever.

22:54.560 --> 22:59.920
When you take me out of the service.

22:59.920 --> 23:05.040
I mean, you could have ranted our race for half an hour and like wanted every person in

23:05.040 --> 23:08.520
the audience to kill themselves because they felt bad, but I wasn't surprised that I wouldn't

23:08.520 --> 23:09.520
have been surprised that happened.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.280
What was your, not in a bad, I'm like,

23:12.280 --> 23:17.120
Was there, was there, was there a real highlight or really low light in the, in any of the

23:17.120 --> 23:18.640
shows that kind of like surprised you?

23:18.640 --> 23:21.640
Well, you're talking to the person who has like an eight year old's memory here. Like

23:21.640 --> 23:25.360
I'm digging right now to remember things and stop going well.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.520
Okay. Why do you have an eight year old's memory?

23:27.520 --> 23:30.680
That's a great question. I don't remember things I do two days ago and I should probably

23:30.680 --> 23:31.680
get checked out.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.240
Oh, all right. Talk about cookies then.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.720
I was jealous of young people because I thought you remembered everything.

23:37.720 --> 23:41.720
No, you, okay. I, I get surprised when you remember my name every time. Like I don't

23:41.720 --> 23:45.520
remember things people I meet. So thank you.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.000
Well, you're kind of a pain in the ass.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.840
It's a mnemonic device. Oh boy, there's Maddie.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.160
I don't show up every time.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.160
No, no.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.160
Maybe.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.160
I'm not out. I don't come every time.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.320
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Maddie. Thank you, Maddie.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.320
All right. Thank you, Maddie.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.320
We're almost there. We're getting there. We're digging.

24:02.320 --> 24:08.160
It doesn't, it doesn't, you know, Jeff, the show is not about the show. There's no show.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.360
The show, the show, it's, there's no, the show is about you.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.600
Let's get to the show.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.880
Maybe it's foolish of me to even think that there was supposed to be a purpose for it.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.480
That there, that you should learn anything. You're such a story structure freak and we

24:20.480 --> 24:24.960
kept drawing these things like, we're at the refusal of a call now. Now we're at the meeting

24:24.960 --> 24:29.560
with the goddess. Like we kept doing that, but then we return home. Do you feel that

24:29.560 --> 24:34.120
you've created, that you've actually described the full circle story wise?

24:34.120 --> 24:35.120
No.

24:35.120 --> 24:39.520
Because I feel like that Harmontown at the tour is, if there's a story structure element

24:39.520 --> 24:44.880
to that, that this will be the first quarter or the first half of a larger story.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.880
Oh, well.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.880
You're right now coming home. This is the meeting with the goddess where you're back

24:48.880 --> 24:53.320
home into your safety net and now the terrible shit happens. Or something really awesome

24:53.320 --> 24:54.320
happens.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.560
We get to reboot the show now. We get to decide what it's, what it's going to be about, you

24:57.560 --> 24:58.560
know?

24:58.560 --> 25:02.120
What would you, what do you want? We can't, one thing's for certain. I think we, we want

25:02.120 --> 25:03.520
to connect with these people.

25:03.520 --> 25:09.040
You fucked up my brain to merge with their brains. I want to feel what they feel.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.040
For real?

25:10.040 --> 25:16.920
Yeah. Okay. Let's do it. I feel like there's someone in the audience tonight that's recently

25:16.920 --> 25:25.800
written a book that will be released that needs to be plugged. He was an amazing entertainer.

25:25.800 --> 25:33.360
He's part of Donald Glover's little, little YouTube troupe. Derek comedy. He's an old

25:33.360 --> 25:39.640
friend. He looks like Jesus more and more every day. Please, I feel, I feel his pain.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.520
I feel his brain. Welcome DC Pearson.

25:42.520 --> 25:54.440
Thanks, Diane. How's it going?

25:54.440 --> 26:00.200
It's going good. I mean, I don't know. You tell me, it feels like kind of, I was saying

26:00.200 --> 26:04.680
backstage like, uh, oh, I feel really good cause I feel like, uh, we were out in the road

26:04.680 --> 26:07.600
and now I'm not worried at all. Like Pat Noswald's prediction was true. I'm not worried

26:07.600 --> 26:10.960
about doing the show here anymore. And I think that could be a bad thing. I was saying in

26:10.960 --> 26:16.520
the green room, right now I'm flirting with the idea that it's a bad thing that you didn't

26:16.520 --> 26:21.800
learn anything that have become boring because I'm not driven by the anxiety of being a good

26:21.800 --> 26:24.520
or a bad show. So now I'm seeing it sitting here.

26:24.520 --> 26:29.440
Yeah. You're the reason we don't see the character after the movie's over. Exactly. You're the

26:29.440 --> 26:32.720
reason the movie's over. Right. You know what I mean? Like, it's not like we just stick

26:32.720 --> 26:37.720
around after the credits and then he's still just like, yep, still happy. Yeah. You know,

26:37.720 --> 26:41.640
the movie's over unless he joins the Avengers. Yeah. After the credits, maybe you join the

26:41.640 --> 26:46.360
Avengers, Diane. Uh, that's nice for you. Yeah. I guess, is there an Avengers for like

26:46.360 --> 26:52.000
just, just, just, just, just people with houses that like to take bubble baths? If there is,

26:52.000 --> 26:57.200
we can go and buy it at this comic book store. We'll have it. If there is one, adventures

26:57.200 --> 27:03.320
comes to watch. Right. Yeah. Uh, so you wrote a book. I did. It's called Crap Kingdom.

27:03.320 --> 27:10.600
I like our Beastie Boys. Uh, it's called Crap Kingdom. Yeah. And it's not out yet. It's

27:10.600 --> 27:12.800
not quite out yet. It's not out. It's out. It's going to be out on March 7th, but the

27:12.800 --> 27:16.320
reason that I'm doing, I'm promoting it before it's actually out. So I'm trying to get people

27:16.320 --> 27:20.080
to pre-order it. So badly do I want them to pre-order it that if you pre-order it, which

27:20.080 --> 27:23.560
you can do on Amazon, you can do it pals books, all these different places that sell books

27:23.560 --> 27:28.440
online. Uh, and you send me the receipt at CrapKingdom at gmail.com. I will write your

27:28.440 --> 27:35.000
name into a custom rap song and or crap song. Interesting. Get us some overlap there. Uh,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.560
and you gave me an advanced copy and it, it has so many. It's, it's, it's filled with

27:39.560 --> 27:45.800
pages and, uh, uh, Dan, Dan, what was your favorite part of the book? I, I, I just, I,

27:45.800 --> 27:52.800
like, the binding, like, I love the concept of like, like, like, there's separate pages,

27:52.800 --> 27:55.640
but all of them are together. I insisted on that. I was like, I know that most books

27:55.640 --> 28:01.480
are just bricks with scrawl on them, but I want individualized pages. Cause I feel like

28:01.480 --> 28:08.400
that's where the medium's going. The elevator pitch is that it's a guy who's beckoned to

28:08.400 --> 28:14.040
be the savior of a fantasy world. It's kind of a young adult novel. Uh, and it's, it's,

28:14.040 --> 28:20.160
it's a, it's a Jeff. Uh, it's about a guy who gets beckoned to a fantasy world to be

28:20.160 --> 28:25.360
its savior. And it sounds fascinating. Mr. Harmon, the world's, the world's kind of

28:25.360 --> 28:29.040
crappy and, uh, he doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't take them up on it. It doesn't want

28:29.040 --> 28:33.040
to be part of the fantasy world. It's a novel. Yes. That's awesome. Thank you. That's, that's

28:33.040 --> 28:36.280
very, I'm very impressed by that. That's very cool. I think more people should do that.

28:36.280 --> 28:40.360
I think everyone should do it. No, I don't think everybody should. Okay. I think novelists

28:40.360 --> 28:43.760
should write novels. Okay. But people given a gift. So if you haven't already written

28:43.760 --> 28:48.160
a novel, uh, you're not a novelist, so don't write a novel. But if you have already written

28:48.160 --> 28:52.780
a novel, continue doing so. I mean, people that have to give for writing pros and for

28:52.780 --> 28:55.720
writing. Oh, I see. You know, like, don't, don't, you don't think where there should

28:55.720 --> 28:59.160
be like a weird freaky Friday thing where like I become a sushi chef and then he becomes

28:59.160 --> 29:04.760
a novelist. I think that he probably be now should Jiro write a novel. That's my new novel.

29:04.760 --> 29:11.560
My new novel is called, uh, called sushi writer. Is it true that they're called novels? Cause

29:11.560 --> 29:15.840
at one point it was like a weird new thing to do. These are novels. Holy shit. Look at

29:15.840 --> 29:19.080
this thing. Books used to be epistolary. There were letters. Yeah, there were letters back

29:19.080 --> 29:22.520
and forth. But the idea of telling a story about a thing that happened to a person that

29:22.520 --> 29:26.520
was, that was a very novel. Do you think that I learned that novel is just a lie? You know,

29:26.520 --> 29:30.640
I mean, it was a book that was ostensibly like, was it just like that, uh, what, not

29:30.640 --> 29:35.720
50 shades of gray? What's it called? The guy that was on Oprah, um, Stephen Frey or whatever.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.160
What's that? Yeah. James Frey. Yeah. That, that, well, like if he had been in medieval

29:39.160 --> 29:42.560
times, would he have been like the first novelist and he was like, it's just a lie, but we

29:42.560 --> 29:50.920
can say I amazing. I'm amazing. They do talk a lot. Don't they, Dan? Yeah. Yeah. No, it's

29:50.920 --> 29:54.600
a town meeting. Really. Honestly. If you go out to any of these fuckers, it's like a whole

29:54.600 --> 30:03.960
show. What's your name? Sean. Just Jesus Christ. You handed him a mic. Hand it, handed it to

30:03.960 --> 30:09.400
him or put it in his face like a, like a journalist. Like what's your name, sir? My name is Sean.

30:09.400 --> 30:15.760
I was just saying that like early defo novels, like, uh, it's reported that like the person

30:15.760 --> 30:21.320
like, you know, rams and cruise. So sent in his journals and he's, I'm defo just, you

30:21.320 --> 30:27.280
know, giving them to you. Right. He was passing it off as actual, actual history. Yeah. Isn't

30:27.280 --> 30:37.040
that interesting, Jeff? And what's your name? Scott. See? Oh, just all just people. When

30:37.040 --> 30:46.360
were you born? What year? 1989. That's crazy. What were you doing in 1989? I was going like,

30:46.360 --> 30:52.720
oh, I'm afraid to tell my friends I'm not into this Batman movie as much as they are.

30:52.720 --> 30:59.320
I wouldn't get that tattoo if I were you. They'll probably change the logo. If I'm,

30:59.320 --> 31:03.920
if I'm them, I'm going to change that logo. It looks like my mom looked at that Batman

31:03.920 --> 31:07.520
logo from the Tim Burton movie and she said, is that teeth? It looks like yellow. If you

31:07.520 --> 31:11.320
look at the yellow parts, it looks like teeth. Yeah. Yeah. Like a little teeth monster is

31:11.320 --> 31:16.800
going to get you. I like that. That guy said 1989, but when he said 19, it sounded like

31:16.800 --> 31:21.120
it was going to be a much older year. You know what I mean? He's like 19. Like it sounded

31:21.120 --> 31:26.440
like it was going to be 89 is an older year. It's like, it was like, yeah, back then the

31:26.440 --> 31:35.080
air was new to him. 89 was like the stone age. He's, he's an asshole with it. Old man.

31:35.080 --> 31:43.040
Yeah. Uh, uh, uh, yeah. Everybody else all at the same time. What's your name? They all

31:43.040 --> 31:53.000
said Zach. How can everyone be named Zach? It's amazing. With one voice. Sorry. Well,

31:53.000 --> 31:59.040
they're, uh, the, uh, electrocuting prisoners down the, uh, the, everyone's. Do you have

31:59.040 --> 32:03.200
Harmontown death row? Yeah. You forgot to make the call because you were doing the show.

32:03.200 --> 32:11.000
So they didn't get the pardon. Yeah. I'm just waiting for that call from Mr. Harmon. I know

32:11.000 --> 32:16.720
it's going to come through. I learned law and prison. I put this packet together. I

32:16.720 --> 32:22.480
sent it to him. It's an airtight defensive. Why I wasn't there. He'll read it. I'm sorry.

32:22.480 --> 32:27.800
Oh, Mallory, your pardon hasn't come through. Yeah. From my voice, you can tell my last

32:27.800 --> 32:32.200
name is Oh, Mallory. I was trying to soften up the racism.

32:32.200 --> 32:47.400
I was trying to stand off the edges. I'm part of a demographic often sentenced to death,

32:47.400 --> 32:58.000
bless my lucky charms. We can call each other leprechauns.

32:58.000 --> 33:15.720
I was friends with a kid named Sean Malarkey in grade school. His last name was Malarkey.

33:15.720 --> 33:21.640
It's crazy. I know I've said it before on Harmontown, but my teacher had a friend named

33:21.640 --> 33:29.480
Pat Mawini. I told you about Jeremy Dick and Jeremy Dick. I told the story. Jerry, me

33:29.480 --> 33:34.960
dick. No, don't dissect that. His name was Jeremy Dick. That's no big deal. Jeremy Dick,

33:34.960 --> 33:39.120
but rumor had it. His dad's name was Harry and his mom's name was Aima. Probably not.

33:39.120 --> 33:43.280
Probably not. Right. So, so then I ran into him. I was in grade school with him. I told

33:43.280 --> 33:47.480
the story, right? On the podcast. It might be pre-podcast. I don't know. Oh, it is. Okay.

33:47.480 --> 33:53.920
All right. Fuck you guys. All right. I ran into him in a kitchen. I was like, smoking

33:53.920 --> 33:58.760
a joint with him. Like this kid that I knew in grade school. There's rumors. Jeremy Dick,

33:58.760 --> 34:05.480
you know his dad's name is Harry and his mom's name is Aima. And I was like, that's not astronomically

34:05.480 --> 34:10.200
possible. Like that's not, that doesn't happen. You don't, you don't, you're not Harry Dick

34:10.200 --> 34:13.160
and you meet a woman and she says her name's Aima and you're like, let's get married. It

34:13.160 --> 34:22.760
just doesn't happen. Have you read my script? And then I ran into him and I was, I'm standing

34:22.760 --> 34:27.520
in a kitchen. I'm probably like, like, like, I don't know, 18, 19 years old. Let's say

34:27.520 --> 34:30.800
21 because I have a joint in my hand so that I don't, I don't want to get, I don't know

34:30.800 --> 34:37.400
if he can get sued or whatever. But, and I, and I, and I, and there's Jeremy Dick. This

34:37.400 --> 34:42.680
kid from, he's a grown man now. And I was passing the joint and I go, Hey man, I always

34:42.680 --> 34:48.080
wanted to ask you, was your, was your dad's name really Harry? And he said, yeah, yeah.

34:48.080 --> 34:54.120
And I, and I said, now, okay, but your mom's name wasn't Aima, was it? And he, and he said,

34:54.120 --> 34:55.400
my mom's dead man.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.520
Oh, so therefore she didn't have a name.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.520
Yeah.

34:59.520 --> 35:04.800
Also, did he ask you, is, hey man, is it legal to smoke weed when you're 21?

35:04.800 --> 35:08.600
Because you've been spreading that around.

35:08.600 --> 35:15.360
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what eggshells I'm trying to walk on with, but it's, it's,

35:15.360 --> 35:18.520
it's not, it's not, it's not legality. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's what, what are you,

35:18.520 --> 35:24.840
19, Mavie? What are you, 18? Oh, Jesus. See, like, just don't do, do, do as I say, don't

35:24.840 --> 35:29.040
do as I do, that I say that I do.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.760
You say do drugs though.

35:30.760 --> 35:38.560
I, I say I did a lot of them and then I have a huge house. If you connect those dots,

35:38.560 --> 35:41.680
you, you, that's your mistake that you've made.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.480
But imagine how big his house could be if he didn't.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.480
Exactly.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.480
Exactly.

35:47.480 --> 35:52.480
I just can't get over the fact that we have Jesus and God on the same stage.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.480
That's a lineup.

35:54.480 --> 36:01.520
You've done great. I'm so sorry. I, I, I completely ignored you while everyone murdered you.

36:01.520 --> 36:05.360
Yeah, it's cool. Man, I wanted to know Breakfast Club better in that moment so I could launch

36:05.360 --> 36:08.840
into like the smoke up Johnny Monologue from Jesus's point of view.

36:08.840 --> 36:13.680
See, this is what you get when you, when you, when you're in Gethsemane and, and you take

36:13.680 --> 36:18.040
the cup.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.040
Sorry I set you up for that.

36:19.040 --> 36:25.040
He's showing, he's showing a hole in his palm instead of the, last supper club.

36:25.040 --> 36:34.600
This show is great. This show is great.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.600
We're fucking killing it, man.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.080
I know. And it's because I stopped being about me because I became God.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.960
This show has never stopped being about you for a second.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.880
I achieved apotheosis. I stopped caring about the show. The mistake we made at the very

36:45.880 --> 36:50.360
tippy top of the show was focusing on me because I have nothing left to like, so, so bring

36:50.360 --> 36:55.080
up DC Pearson. Oh, nice. Now you're killing it. You're doing you a little riffy bits.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
Yeah.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.920
You're dropping bombs from a three point line over there.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.240
I'm fucking nailing it.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.240
This is the show, Jeff.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.240
Now you fucked it again.

37:02.240 --> 37:08.360
Dan, will there be, will there be a point where you will lay down the mantle of being

37:08.360 --> 37:09.360
Dan Harmon?

37:09.360 --> 37:13.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I'm grooming Spencer.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Okay.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.800
And I, and I don't, don't, I don't mean in the, in the literal sense because I know

37:17.800 --> 37:19.240
that is very impressive.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.240
Yeah.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.360
That would be, that would be a, a, a Sisyphean task.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.360
Grooming Spencer. That's a whole indie movie that you have to.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.400
Grooming Spencer was, that was a slam dance this year, right?

37:30.400 --> 37:33.640
I think, I think Spencer should have his own podcast where he sits in his red flannel shirt

37:33.640 --> 37:38.280
and like talks to, talks to friends and, and talks about what's going on. He's much smarter

37:38.280 --> 37:41.760
and, and much younger and has much more to offer.

37:41.760 --> 37:51.760
And also I, I ran into Spencer last night and I, I don't know if I've seen you since

37:51.760 --> 37:56.280
we got back, maybe once Spencer, I don't know, but you seem like activated. You seem

37:56.280 --> 37:59.680
like, like, like he came back like charged up by that tour.

37:59.680 --> 38:04.360
He feels, he feels a little smiley, but not in an artificial way. Like I, I, I like seeing

38:04.360 --> 38:07.600
him happy. He's kind of like, yeah, he feels a little more energized. He's not afraid to

38:07.600 --> 38:12.880
look slouched down into a sedentary fucking glacial, like Spencer's a glacier. He's like

38:12.880 --> 38:18.160
a force of nature. If he disagrees with you, then there's a river there where the disagreement

38:18.160 --> 38:21.640
happened. Like you can't really argue with it because he doesn't disagree unless there's

38:21.640 --> 38:24.840
like logic on his side and then you're fucked.

38:24.840 --> 38:29.880
But, but, but, but just like, yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a little buoyancy that

38:29.880 --> 38:39.400
I'll take credit for. I think I changed Spencer as a God boy, but wait, so you're really turning

38:39.400 --> 38:46.080
into a villain and I don't, I don't care. You got a shirt on with your picture on it.

38:46.080 --> 38:55.640
Like all the great villains do, Lex Luthor's line of Luthor t-shirts, Hannibal Lecter, visit

38:55.640 --> 39:03.080
my cafe press Clarice, Hannibal Lecter in the first season, Jody Foster has like the

39:03.080 --> 39:09.520
icon with the actual mask. Like, even though he hasn't worn it yet in the movie, why, why

39:09.520 --> 39:16.440
are you wearing that weird shirt, Dr. Lecter? But it says, it says got kryptonite. Yeah,

39:16.440 --> 39:21.640
Hannibal Lecter? Yeah, because he's a big villain fan. Oh, I see. I'm a, he's a villain's

39:21.640 --> 39:28.120
villain. Yeah, he's a, he's a fan of Lex Luthor. Did you see Hannibal Rising? No. They fucking,

39:28.120 --> 39:34.360
they made a prequel to this goddamn character, this beloved guy that eats people who's famous

39:34.360 --> 39:41.240
for the famous images of him wearing this mask. And in the movie, they walk you down the road

39:41.240 --> 39:47.840
of why you could be a good person and sexy and decide to start eating people. And on

39:47.840 --> 39:53.120
top of it all, he also like wears like a weird precursor to the mask in the movie. Doesn't

39:53.120 --> 39:58.000
make sense at all. Like he, like he thinks, someone gives him like a, the Japanese call

39:58.000 --> 40:02.480
this a cuckoo boo boo. And, and, and, and like he's wearing, it's, it looks like the thing

40:02.480 --> 40:05.920
from the airplane hanger. That's only a famous image because it's a famous image. It's not,

40:05.920 --> 40:09.360
it has nothing to do with his origin. Yeah, it's not like he was on the plane being like,

40:09.360 --> 40:14.240
I want to wear that. And they were like, all right, man. Now, I could get used to this.

40:14.240 --> 40:21.200
How do I get one of those? You have to eat a lot of people. It is, it is, it is actually

40:21.200 --> 40:24.840
bad to the point of worth watching. I like that prequels aren't like how this person

40:24.840 --> 40:28.520
actually got to become who they are. It's just like, Hey, remember this? Remember this

40:28.520 --> 40:32.680
is a cool gift. Yeah. Now it's in a movie. But even worse, the prequels that are like

40:32.680 --> 40:37.800
all, you don't even get, remember this. All you get is anticipate this. Right. Like, like,

40:37.800 --> 40:41.600
like, like, you know, you make a prequel to like, like, like, we're breakfast club and

40:41.600 --> 40:45.000
it's just like, you're just watching people like, like, like, you know, should I pierce

40:45.000 --> 40:51.680
my ear? I think I will. And you're supposed to go, fuck yeah. Fuck you. Get with the breakfast

40:51.680 --> 40:56.200
club. Should I get, should I get dantra? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're using the wrong

40:56.200 --> 41:01.560
shampoo, young lady. What am I watching? I feel like if you were to watch any, any great

41:01.560 --> 41:05.800
movie, if you were to watch its prequel before you had seen the actual great movie that allowed

41:05.800 --> 41:09.000
there to be a prequel in the first place, everything in that prequel, I don't know of

41:09.000 --> 41:13.360
a prequel that doesn't do this, just completely licks the donut of what ends up being good

41:13.360 --> 41:17.640
about these things. Like, Prometheus is just a giant feature length donut lick of alien.

41:17.640 --> 41:21.520
Fuck you, Prometheus. It's just dudes. I don't care if you haven't seen it. Somebody

41:21.520 --> 41:26.680
said, fuck you. That's Damon Liddell off. Like, yeah, like, what? Yeah. I mean, seriously,

41:26.680 --> 41:32.760
yeah, that is the weird thing. Like, I really, he's, he's adorable. He's a Channel 101 fan.

41:32.760 --> 41:37.800
Right. But, but come on, I'm an alien fan. Like, like, like, you can't fuck. No amount

41:37.800 --> 41:41.000
of press releases is going to, you can't give me instructions to go into it. Don't watch

41:41.000 --> 41:46.640
this wrong. You called it an alien prequel, you fuckers. Well, yeah. And the fact that

41:46.640 --> 41:50.640
they're like every, remember every amazing, cool, iconic thing from the first 10 minutes

41:50.640 --> 41:54.760
of alien. You know how you've wondered for like 20 years, what's inside of that thing?

41:54.760 --> 42:01.480
The cool thing is that I don't know. What if what was inside of it was dudes? Dudes and

42:01.480 --> 42:09.600
goo. Dudes and goo. Dudes and goo. On the road this summer, dudes and goo. Solving crimes.

42:09.600 --> 42:19.080
This looks like a great place to build a Nakatomi Plaza. Not a good movie. Idea.

42:19.080 --> 42:29.160
Now, these Indians are to rest in this burial ground, never to have a suburban home built

42:29.160 --> 42:39.760
on it. If we're Craig T. Nelson, we'll someday live.

42:39.760 --> 42:45.040
I say, young one, you have done a very good job building the cemetery. Let's go have a

42:45.040 --> 42:52.360
beer. Our work is done. And the young Craig T. Nelson gets the keys to the cemetery. I'll

42:52.360 --> 42:58.200
do fine. All right, wait, I'm sorry. Craig T. Nelson, he was the hero in that movie.

42:58.200 --> 43:02.280
He's so often the villain, I forgot. Fuck you guys. Edit it out. It's going to seem

43:02.280 --> 43:07.400
like I'm a god. Also edit out all the parts where I say I'm a god. Because that makes

43:07.400 --> 43:10.440
me seem like I'm a god. How long until you're just walking around L.A. doing your normal

43:10.440 --> 43:13.760
business and you just have an awkward interaction with like a barista or something like, edit

43:13.760 --> 43:19.200
this out. Edit this out. Edit this out. I don't like this. I'm a god. I'm a god. I'm

43:19.200 --> 43:25.040
a god. Edit it out. Edit it out. All right, well, thank you D.C. Pearson.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.520
Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Is there anything else you want to say about

43:27.520 --> 43:30.480
your second book? Yeah, people should go to crappkingdom.com if they

43:30.480 --> 43:33.840
want to buy the book. Please pre-order it. I'm trying to get on the New York Times best

43:33.840 --> 43:36.720
seller list. It's a good book. You'll enjoy it. And then I'll write your name into a rap

43:36.720 --> 43:40.120
song. How great would that be? Why don't you write someone's name from here right now

43:40.120 --> 43:47.720
into a rap song. Sweet. Let's do it. Maddie's? You got it. Yeah, do Maddie. Maddie. Maddie

43:47.720 --> 43:54.120
rap. Maddie. Yeah, Maddie. I gotta fucking put my hood up for this shit. Okay, get the

43:54.120 --> 44:01.040
hood on. Okay. He's putting his rap hood on. Rap hood's up. Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

44:01.040 --> 44:07.880
Jeff Davis doesn't really know about Maddie's. He seems to think that Hannibal is Lex Luthor.

44:07.880 --> 44:13.080
Yeah, this thing, this show is the fucking truth, son. And that's why I rap and that's

44:13.080 --> 44:18.600
why I rhyme. And I did not have the right beat time at the beginning of this rap about Maddie.

44:18.600 --> 44:23.240
She wants to talk about cookies. I will do so gladly. We can talk about Kebler's. Talk

44:23.240 --> 44:30.960
about Entomans. Do they make cookies? I think they did. Yeah. If you buy my book, I will

44:30.960 --> 44:50.240
write the raps in advance. DC Pearson. Thank you, sir. Crab Kingdom. Yeah. Yeah, man. It's

44:50.240 --> 44:55.160
on autopilot. I just bring cool people up and just let it rip. Yeah. How are we doing

44:55.160 --> 44:57.720
on time, buddy? We're doing good. I think it might be time to bring up maybe somebody

44:57.720 --> 45:02.800
else. Really? Yeah. And let's segue into playing D&D. Yeah. So let's bring up one

45:02.800 --> 45:09.480
of my funniest friends in the world with one of the most adorable accents, who is often

45:09.480 --> 45:14.440
here lurking in the background, but who has never been on stage here, which is a crime.

45:14.440 --> 45:17.240
He's never been on our show. Has he? I don't think he's ever been up here. No, no. Let's

45:17.240 --> 45:34.960
welcome stage Kumeo Nanjiani, everybody. Hey, how's it going? I feel like there's a lot

45:34.960 --> 45:41.920
of pressure on my accent right now. It's pretty adorable. Is it? Yeah, yeah. I want to squeeze

45:41.920 --> 45:47.960
it's little accent cheek. It's called the 15 years out of Pakistan. Yeah, I like it.

45:47.960 --> 45:54.480
15 years. Makes me feel fancy. Oh, you guys were talking about, I always hate what they

45:54.480 --> 45:59.400
do like a movie where it's like a kid version of somebody like there was a movie. I saw

45:59.400 --> 46:01.960
the preview and it was about British people. I didn't know what it was. And then there's

46:01.960 --> 46:09.960
one scene where the mom is like, come down for dinner, John Lennon. And then you find

46:09.960 --> 46:14.720
out it's about John Lennon. There's always like, or like in fucking the new Batman movie

46:14.720 --> 46:19.280
that Joseph Gordon Levitt's name is Robin. That's his real name. That's the fucking worst

46:19.280 --> 46:23.680
thing. That is retarded with all due respect to my retarded sister, which means I can say

46:23.680 --> 46:31.480
retarded. Like, that is so retarded. That whole movie was unbelievable. That movie was

46:31.480 --> 46:36.800
like watching a guy trying to tie his shoe with a stack of teacups on his head. And he's

46:36.800 --> 46:41.560
not good at it. It's his first time. Yeah, yeah. Like, yeah, nothing. Like, like, you're

46:41.560 --> 46:47.000
just sitting there the whole time going, well, I could do that. What also is the end a dream

46:47.000 --> 46:52.800
sequence when he's actually in, because Michael Cain, they're in the same cafe that was in

46:52.800 --> 46:58.960
his dream. That's a real dream that one day he'll be at a restaurant. Yeah, drinking

46:58.960 --> 47:06.240
Farnette Branque. Really? Yeah, your favorite drink, Jeff. Sweet. Farnette Branque. He shares

47:06.240 --> 47:12.400
a dream with Christian Bale at one point and says, I have a dream that one day I'll be

47:12.400 --> 47:16.800
in a restaurant and you won't be Batman anymore. And you'll be eating an omelet and I'll be

47:16.800 --> 47:23.680
having a Farnette Branque. And you won't even acknowledge me. Why not? You'll be like,

47:23.680 --> 47:29.240
Holy shit, I'm not Batman anymore. Get over here. Where are the fucking on? What the fuck

47:29.240 --> 47:34.800
are you drinking? From your dream? Farnette Branque is on the house? Jesus fucking Christ.

47:34.800 --> 47:40.880
Not only were you my fucking confidant and guy that sewed me up when I lost fights to

47:40.880 --> 47:46.300
supervillains, on top of all that, you were my fucking butler. Butler, that's already

47:46.300 --> 47:51.560
worth hanging out after we're retired. Why would you ignore her? Why? I want to see all

47:51.560 --> 47:55.480
the scenes where they just go to random cafes. Like, all right, he's not at this one. Let's

47:55.480 --> 48:02.720
keep going to the next one. We had to go to hundreds of cafes. And also, on top of it

48:02.720 --> 48:10.480
all, really, Alfred, dumb dream, stupid fantasy, dumb. He just seemed good while hunting.

48:10.480 --> 48:16.840
So he was like, he himself knows that some men just want to see the world burn. He can't

48:16.840 --> 48:24.160
drum up a better fantasy than hanging out at a cafe. He's a butler. Well, he didn't do

48:24.160 --> 48:34.120
it for me. The butler didn't do it. I don't know, a lot of ridiculous Alfred fans out

48:34.120 --> 48:39.120
in the audience, like, really? Alfred fans? Did you guys really love Dark Knight Rises?

48:39.120 --> 48:47.200
A couple people, you liked it? What's your name? Rebecca. Rebecca, you loved it? I did.

48:47.200 --> 48:52.240
I thought it was deep. You thought it was deep? That's very brave of you. Did you just say

48:52.240 --> 48:58.640
you thought it was deep? Well, don't don't. Are you 14? I'm sorry. Let's walk a line

48:58.640 --> 49:03.800
between communicating with her and bullying her. That's very brave of her to like. Yeah,

49:03.800 --> 49:09.000
yeah, yeah. Rebecca, bad cop. Would you be willing to come up and talk about it a little

49:09.000 --> 49:18.280
bit? Yeah, Rebecca, everybody. Rebecca. Here, take this. Is that one? Here, you take this

49:18.280 --> 49:26.840
mic. Oh, wow. God just gave me a microphone. It's kind of my lifelong dream. So you thought,

49:26.840 --> 49:30.880
I haven't seen the film, so I cannot weigh in on this either way. I was too busy reading

49:30.880 --> 49:45.040
literature. Well, that's how Batman started. Like many forms of literature, Batman, the

49:45.040 --> 49:53.160
Dark Knight Rises, grappled with some themes. I feel like you haven't rehearsed this. No,

49:53.160 --> 49:59.040
it grappled with some themes that I thought were deep. So what themes did you like? Well,

49:59.040 --> 50:07.360
the striving for true freedom, like true human freedom out of the shot, like de shackling

50:07.360 --> 50:14.720
ourselves from tyranny, whether but the villains were espousing that theme. That's exactly

50:14.720 --> 50:23.640
right. Exactly, which is why I really thought it was like true revolution hasn't been really

50:23.640 --> 50:30.680
tried. Because every time humans have tried revolution, the people who are making the

50:30.680 --> 50:41.320
revolution become the dictators. And so it's exploring those themes. How seductive the

50:41.320 --> 50:47.880
idea of, you know, let's anarchy. But I mean, you've seen Fight Club, right? So just watch

50:47.880 --> 50:54.880
Fight Club again. No, but... But Fight Club doesn't have Batman in it. Fair enough. Every

50:54.880 --> 51:02.640
movie would be better with Batman. Casablanca is great. But what if Batman showed up? Well,

51:02.640 --> 51:11.560
that is true. That is absolutely true. Thank you, Rebecca. Well done. Thank you. I don't

51:11.560 --> 51:15.880
want that heroism to go unnoticed. I mean, that's fucking rough, man. We're trained in

51:15.880 --> 51:20.880
the society. If there's like a, what do you call it, a zeitgeist or a collective consensus

51:20.880 --> 51:30.400
that's being emitted via groans and someone bothers to go, you know, I don't know. I get

51:30.400 --> 51:33.960
really protective of those people because I'm like, God damn it. That is what happened

51:33.960 --> 51:37.600
to all of us on the playground. This is like a collection of people who all got picked

51:37.600 --> 51:42.800
on on the playground. We were all on the business end of... There's probably some really handsome

51:42.800 --> 51:49.040
well-built guy in the back that's like, fuck you. Like, I come to Harmontown for the fitness

51:49.040 --> 52:00.360
tips and now you're bullying me. That's collateral damage. You can stay here, Tad. Nerds are nerds

52:00.360 --> 52:05.040
too. You're welcome here. But anyways, whatever. I was just speaking, it was just so cool that

52:05.040 --> 52:12.760
somebody would go like, I like Batman Rising. I insist on getting the title right. Is that

52:12.760 --> 52:19.760
it? Now's a good time, honey, to bring Spencer up to the stage so we have him.

52:19.760 --> 52:29.360
Yeah, I didn't really clarify that. The reason Kumail is here is because Kumail like, like

52:29.360 --> 52:33.080
very passionately, like, like, like, like, is it, does this throw you into the bus in

52:33.080 --> 52:36.840
any weird reverse way? Like, like, like, like Kumail is always like haunting the back.

52:36.840 --> 52:41.080
He's the Phantom of Nerdmelt. You make it sound like I've been very desperate to come

52:41.080 --> 52:47.840
up here. No, no, no, no. Maybe it's my turn today. No, no, no, no, no. I'll go and dream

52:47.840 --> 52:54.480
of you in a cafe. He's a professional stand-up with a very funny act. He doesn't have to.

52:54.480 --> 52:59.080
He doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't crave the spotlight. I'm saying, specifically,

52:59.080 --> 53:02.640
you were very enamored when we started bringing Spencer up and playing D&D. No, I, I, I, I,

53:02.640 --> 53:07.080
from the very get-go, you were like, holy shit, what is this? What is this? I want, I want

53:07.080 --> 53:12.200
to do this. I've never played D&D and it's like completely in my wheelhouse. I just never

53:12.200 --> 53:15.520
played it. I mean, I've played like RPG video games themselves. You seem like you should

53:15.520 --> 53:22.240
have played D&D. Yeah. That's not a compliment. No, it's not. No, no, it's not. We were at

53:22.240 --> 53:25.960
the drawing room like, you know, a couple weeks before the Harmontown tour and you're

53:25.960 --> 53:30.560
like, I really want to like kind of hang out with Spencer. I really want to play that game.

53:30.560 --> 53:34.600
Like, there was a fascination there. Which is the same as Spencer saying before he came

53:34.600 --> 53:39.280
to the first show that he came to. I feel like I should be playing D&D with Dan Harmon

53:39.280 --> 53:44.440
and then came to a show and I said, anyway, attention masters in the audience. I'm telling

53:44.440 --> 53:49.680
you, if you don't write the show, God's writing it. That seems so. This means you're going

53:49.680 --> 53:54.720
to be great at D&D. I hope that seems just as plausible now as Alfred running into Batman

53:54.720 --> 53:59.680
at the cafe, right? But if God, if God is writing the show and you're God, the show is being

53:59.680 --> 54:08.560
written by me, by you, but like off the cuff. Okay. Who's who's made that noise? That's

54:08.560 --> 54:14.120
not a weird noise. Yeah. What was that noise? It's not a theme music. Like there was like

54:14.120 --> 54:20.840
that. As you're feeling the dumb, dumb, dumb. Uh, Spencer, how are you doing? I'm doing

54:20.840 --> 54:31.680
so good. I called you babe. I just called you babe. Did you catch that? I'm kind of

54:31.680 --> 54:35.400
a babe. Actually, as I say that, I realized I'm wearing my eye, my eye D20 Spencer pin.

54:35.400 --> 54:41.920
My eye heart Spencer. It's true. He is. It's a goodie. I bet Spencer does okay. What? I

54:41.920 --> 54:52.880
bet you do okay, right? No. See me after the show. He'll explain to you. I'll tell you

54:52.880 --> 55:02.640
why. I have a bulleted list. At the top is I make bulleted lists. Are you a list maker?

55:02.640 --> 55:06.840
Oh yeah. It's awesome. It's like, cause if I don't have a list, you know, I'm just like

55:06.840 --> 55:11.320
I'm thinking of everything. I'm like, okay, I need new shoes at some point. But today

55:11.320 --> 55:14.840
I got to go to the bank and in a bit I have to do something and then there's someone I

55:14.840 --> 55:18.120
want to talk to. But so if you have a little list, it's not swirling around your head. It's

55:18.120 --> 55:23.400
just there. Right. Then you can think. That terrifies me because I like, like, when do

55:23.400 --> 55:27.680
you make the list? Before you go to bed at night? The second you think of a thing, write

55:27.680 --> 55:32.040
it down in a list of stuff you have to do. I want to, I want to be one of those people.

55:32.040 --> 55:36.720
I know like, and you can't do it with electronics. You have to do it analog style. You have to

55:36.720 --> 55:42.920
like write it down. Okay. All right. And like, I mean, electronics are awesome. But I mean,

55:42.920 --> 55:47.000
for writing a list, like you have to think I have a pencil in my pocket with which to

55:47.000 --> 55:51.040
write down. God dammit. I don't know. I don't know. I think this is actually the God baton

55:51.040 --> 55:58.520
being passed right now. Yeah. Well, no, yeah. Yeah. Spencer's Jesus and I've got and Jeff

55:58.520 --> 56:09.440
is a Ralph and I'm, I'm Muslim. I love Spencer like I love my little paper notepad. It's

56:09.440 --> 56:14.200
nice to just have the physical act of writing something down makes my brain remember it typing

56:14.200 --> 56:18.680
it in not so much. Jesus is in the Quran. Isn't he? Isn't he like a, doesn't he have a cameo

56:18.680 --> 56:23.400
or something? Isn't there like a, no, if we want to get into it, someone's like, yes.

56:23.400 --> 56:36.520
Who said that? Are you? She's an atheist. Okay. Were you ever not an atheist? Okay.

56:36.520 --> 56:44.040
You've read the Quran just to be like a bullshit. Yeah. Jesus is in the Quran. The only difference

56:44.040 --> 56:50.640
is that he once he dies, he does not come back. And he is not the son of God, but he

56:50.640 --> 56:55.280
is a prophet, right? Which is, you know, like in Jesus Christ superstar, which is the best

56:55.280 --> 56:59.200
telling of that myth in the fucking world, like it's awesome. Like it's a pretty heroic

56:59.200 --> 57:03.880
act to get fucking murdered and, and be cool with it. Like that's enough. I don't need

57:03.880 --> 57:10.400
to then see you at the grocery store the next day. I don't need magic tricks. Like heroism

57:10.400 --> 57:15.480
like, like is as simple as being human and being like cool with people being the shit

57:15.480 --> 57:21.200
out of you. And there, and there were a lot of people that anyways, all right, fuck it.

57:21.200 --> 57:27.640
Will you raise Muslim? Yeah. Are you still practicing? Can I not answer that because

57:27.640 --> 57:34.240
people will listen to it and we're not the most laid back people. Right. That's such

57:34.240 --> 57:42.200
a bummer. Yeah, chill out Muslims. I mean, like, you know, people being bummed out about

57:42.200 --> 57:48.240
other people. It's very hard for me to say anybody to say anything about Islam that isn't

57:48.240 --> 57:52.920
completely agreeing with Islam is a very difficult thing, which is not to imply that that's what

57:52.920 --> 58:00.080
I would have said, right? As a possibly very good Muslim. Yeah, potentially perfect Muslim.

58:00.080 --> 58:06.240
Perfect Muslim. Camel, Joseph Campbell says like, like, like, like religion loses its function

58:06.240 --> 58:10.200
the minute it becomes opaque. Like it's supposed to be like a stained glass window. You, you

58:10.200 --> 58:14.360
can get as ornate as you want. You get you framing because you're you're drawing you're

58:14.360 --> 58:18.800
drawing the audience's attention to a thing that's there that they never notice otherwise.

58:18.800 --> 58:25.640
So yes, get festive, get crazy, get ceremonial, get ritualistic, make but but the moment it

58:25.640 --> 58:30.160
becomes opaque and blocks the thing, the very thing that you're supposed to be drawing the

58:30.160 --> 58:35.360
attention to, which is this, this non corporal thing, this light that shines through it anyways.

58:35.360 --> 58:42.920
So if you're making a religion out there, you know, try to try to keep one foot out.

58:42.920 --> 58:47.640
That's the other. It's like the Hokey Pokey religion. Like, it's important to to kind

58:47.640 --> 58:54.360
of straddle, I think, the line between the Bible being a newspaper and, you know, and

58:54.360 --> 58:58.320
and and dragons and dragons. And that goes for atheists, too, by the way, like, like your

58:58.320 --> 59:02.760
Bible is is science and it's which is a fucking great religion because it's a bunch of priests

59:02.760 --> 59:07.160
like joining hands and looking for the unknown. But if you like the whole point is that there's

59:07.160 --> 59:13.240
something that's unknown. Sorry. Fuck. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Why are you sorry? So you said

59:13.240 --> 59:16.680
you're going to get deep and when you know when you when you when you get there, you

59:16.680 --> 59:20.040
kept it until the city, you kept you kept talking about religion and politics, and you kept

59:20.040 --> 59:23.760
getting deep and you kept apologizing for it. Because politics, the reason politics and

59:23.760 --> 59:29.800
religion are party breakers is because it's you're not really talking about yourself because

59:29.800 --> 59:33.880
the reason they're called politics and religion is because you're not actually expressing

59:33.880 --> 59:40.320
the way that you feel. And the whole and just saw firsthand the result of like, like, like

59:40.320 --> 59:45.720
an individual being unable to like it's like there's political reasons. There's religious

59:45.720 --> 59:51.920
reasons why an individual can't say I'd like a ham sandwich. I'd like, I think the weather

59:51.920 --> 59:57.880
is nice today. This is how I feel about stealing. This is how I feel about capital punishment.

59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.000
And for that same reason, it's kind of a, you know, when you get in your pulpit, you're

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.040
like, it's there's a fine line between being honest and being dishonest. It's when you

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:13.120
start speaking for other people and like, like, like it's, I'm just, I was just saying

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.120
something like, like, like Joseph Campbell, who I think is a is a was a really smart guy,

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.720
like said about religion, and he was super Catholic, but super smart, which too many

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:29.000
people think is a contradiction in terms. And it doesn't have to be like, like, like,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.960
like, like religion, like, like, like can actually be like a smart person's tool to

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:40.440
deal with the cosmos. That that's a personal feeling that I'm sharing, not a, not a political

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.720
or like, like, it's not a, it's not a, it's not a, it's not the equivalent of like being

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.800
at a party and going like, this is that God wears a hat and he doesn't. I'm sharing that

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.080
idea. It's not, it's not, you can, it doesn't, you don't have to, doesn't have to be true

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.880
to you for you and I to get along. It doesn't, it's just an interesting thing to think about

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:07.520
that, that humankind like made these religions like, like, like we, our brains are capable

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.600
of doing that, that, that, that, that is neither enough, something to take too seriously, because

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:19.360
we also make poop. And we learned to flush that the fuck down the toilet. And that was

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.640
a great day that, that doubled our lifespan as a species.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.880
Also, you didn't have to look at shit, but, but, but it's also something to not like totally

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:35.360
disregard because when you look at your shit, if there's blood in it, you know, there's,

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:43.000
that's a clue. There's this. So human beings make things, you know, you make shit. That's,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.640
that makes us different from leopards. I think that leopards alone, that's the only animal.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.480
If you're a leopard and you're listening, I'm coming after you. Stop the fucking gold

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.560
brick and start making shit, leopards. Get off of that limb and do some shit, invent

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:06.000
a broom. Stop lightly displaying yourself on a, on a branch and waiting for a wounded

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.760
gazelle. Where's your iPad? No, I mean, because Islam is definitely about rejecting the body

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:20.120
and embracing the spirit. And I think that's one of the, if I were to speak my mind, I

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.000
would say that suppression of the body is a, it can be a big mistake and it can come

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.880
out in very aggressive, violent. Yeah, yeah. It can also be a super cool thing. I stopped

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.800
jerking off and my sex life with Aaron has improved greatly.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.440
Oh, so you've been having sex. Yeah. You just haven't been jerking off. Oh, yeah, yeah,

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:45.240
yeah. Oh, if I didn't have a girlfriend, I wouldn't bother to experiment with not jerking

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.760
off. That's ridiculous. If I didn't have a girlfriend, I would invent new ways to jerk

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.800
off. I would be telling these people, there's a, if you take a hammock and a, and a rotisserie

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.640
grill. Yeah. How big is your house? Even a leopard, if you, if you couldn't fuck another

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.760
leopard, he would, he would learn, he would invent new jerk off methods. So you're just,

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.680
okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, yeah, it's a little less heroic than you made it sound at the

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.600
beginning. Yeah. You're constantly having sex and jerking off usually. Yes. When you're

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.880
having sex, do you jerk off to finish during the sex? I don't think that counts as jerking

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.400
off. No, sometimes I would. Yeah. Sometimes I would. And that's part of the thing. Like

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.840
when you get into that thing, like your brain gets into like,

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:36.040
Eddie, leave the room. There's a, you know, I don't know. Yeah. I can't believe this started

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:43.520
with Joseph Campbell's views on religion. And that same exact thought, this is the same

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:51.680
thought. Future cough when you finish sex. Oh yeah. Yeah. Sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.800
I know. It's like, we're like the view without the order. Yeah. I like it. I, I think that

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.680
stuff belongs in the same conversation. No, I think so too. I think so too. And you know,

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:08.400
because yeah, we're all about suppression of sex, sexual drive and I truly yeah, I mean,

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.520
we live in a world even like appetites, food, everything. There's six billion people in the

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.800
world. So now at this point, if you started to lower your guard, there's a million predators

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.480
that would immediately do shady shit. Same thing with legalizing drugs, all this shit.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.560
But that's the problem of the momentum that we've had. The truth is on a technical, you know,

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.200
basis, like the truth is, I think we've learned this and we all know this, we just can't, we

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.160
just don't know how to put it in practice that, that, that, that the less inhibitions

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.200
like and the more self policing you allow, like the more that like people or you just

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.000
acknowledge that it's a thing instead of just suppressing and not even, I mean, I never,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I literally never got the sex talk. I learned sex, what sex was from watching a porno and

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.440
being like, this is very wrong. And I had a fever for three days. I really did. And nobody,

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.440
there's no sex education in Pakistan at all. Yeah, we've, we've talked about it over and

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.120
over and over again in our society. We, it's, it's, it's, it's plain as day. We talk about

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.960
it in history class how prohibition like gave rise to an entire organized crime kingdom

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.360
of like, like, like terrible alcohol that make you blind if you drank it and like, like,

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.920
you make something. That's how we are with sex right now. We're in Pakistan having sex

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:32.200
that wouldn't make us blind. That shit is going on behind closed doors. I mean, I'll

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.200
represent the West though and say we get a lot of senators and a lot of airplane stalls

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:44.760
doing a lot of weird airport stalls. Right. It's all of the bottom line is when the distance

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.760
between what's going on in your head and what's coming out of your mouth, like, like, like,

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.400
how shameful is it? What are you thinking? That's so fucking bad that if you said it,

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.440
something bad would happen to you. What is the bad thing that would happen to you? Would

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.640
you not be allowed to be a senator? Hey, maybe that means it's a shitty job. Maybe that means

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.280
you shouldn't be a fucking senator. Like, like, like, like, go like, like, like there's

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.960
so much shit to do out there. Go dig a goddamn hole, put a flower at it. You can, you can

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:18.320
do that. Think all kinds of shit about octopi. I don't know. So listen to your parents tell

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.000
you you're supposed to be a senator. Mom, dad, I want to fuck an octopus. I want to fuck

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
it real bad. I want to fuck an octopus so bad. I want to feel all eight tendrils just

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.840
wrapping me. I just want to fucking cum inside this fucking thing as cephalopod. And it's

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.600
like, I know I can't make it pregnant, but I just see him on TV and it's just fucking

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:48.280
my cock. It's hard as Gibraltar. I don't want to make the laws for Louisiana. I'm not

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.800
fit to do it. Are you giving the job to a guy that doesn't want the job? It's civil

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.400
service. It's not royalty. Are you implying that he wasn't, he was in the stall, he was

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.000
hoping an octopus would come in? That's the point of the glory hole. It could be anything

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.400
you want it to be. That's exactly right. Just, just, just bite down on pretend it's a beak.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.200
I always think fucking an octopus would be a tough way to go, man. Yeah. There's some

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.480
shit inside there that you don't want fucking anything to do with. Well, I know but so much

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.560
suction cups, like all of the suction cups. That would be good. You haven't even thought

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.560
about this. Yeah, but the beak, I'm just, I, I go right to the beak. That thing is supposed

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.640
to be like, like he just crackle fucking. Octopus, octopus hand job, like think about

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:34.360
it. A million blowjobs wrapped around your dick at the same time. That is heaven. A

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:40.480
million blowjobs wrapped around your dick. Yeah. That is very poetic. That's a new, I,

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:47.480
I, I should, I should give credit where credit, that is the slogan for the new Dairy Queen

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:52.800
shake. Also, Octopi have an ability to, like, to, to, like, fill any tiny little crevice

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.080
like they can, they can, yeah, they can, like, yeah. As long as they could go right up, right

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:02.640
up your, right up your ass hole, get in there and just fucking rip the suction, your prostate,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.880
let you have it. Oh, they'd be squirreling around in there. Yeah. They're all, yeah.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.760
They can fit through any hole that's at least as big as their eyeball. So if your asshole

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:18.880
is bigger than an octopus's eyeball, you're having a great day. Yeah, so, yeah, wait,

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:30.640
wait, you, you, you go octopus shopping and you're like, uh, a smaller eye, please. Sir,

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.680
sir, what are you intending to do with this? Oh, okay. There's like a trial room in the

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.560
back that you have to try the octopus. Yeah, there's an ophthalmologist thinking put your

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.000
chin on a thing and it's got little, measures your eyeball. Like, uh, we, uh, I think I

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.160
know exactly what you're looking for. So what's better, this or this?

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:54.960
All right. Somebody's, somebody's going to be the fun police. We got to, we, we, we,

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.320
we, we, we, let's play some D&D with our tricks, shall we? Yeah. Is Aaron here? Yeah, Aaron's

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:07.880
uh, Erin McGathy to the stage. Erin McGathy. Does Aaron have a mic? Is there a mic for

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.200
Aaron? Do you have an extra mic? Emily's on the job. Okay. Emily Gordon. Hello, Aaron.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:20.800
Fun show guys. Do you ever, you ever, you ever think of wearing more sweaters with like

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:34.080
multiple sleeves? Like, like, like six extra sleeves. Um, I don't think about that, but

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.200
I do think about constructing like a really hard beak, like a tire on my head. It'd be

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.840
like a Bane mask. Uh, Emily, Camille's wife was just telling me backstage, you know, Camille's

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:52.400
uh, weirdly obsessed with Octopus, with Octopi. Okay. Is that? The nature of my obsession

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.640
is slightly different from the context that we're in. It starts with the Quran. I am

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:09.960
obsessed. They, uh, they're like, uh, very, they're, uh, uh, actually, uh, uh, um, um,

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:17.280
kind of a towel for fuck's sake. He's sweating. Give me eight towels. I, I, uh, they're actually

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:25.600
hyper smart and they can learn to open jars and love. They, they can predict the, uh,

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.680
the elections. They can predict elections and seasons. And one, uh, scientist actually

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.040
had this, and you know, he had this octopus in his like aquarium, but it was open. It was

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.160
like his pet and he came in one day and the octopus was out of the aquarium and they can

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.520
learn to mimic humans. And wait, wait, wait, wait. No, they, it's wearing a lab coat. It's

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.680
on the way in the parking lot.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:55.080
It's like the end of silence. Oh, wait, I'm just putting on a hat and going into Panama.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:03.600
He was shoving another octopus up its ass. No, he came in and he saw the octopus like

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.240
just flipping through a book, which at that point you just fucking killed yourself.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.840
So is it like, like, like, like it knew how to use the book.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:17.720
It had seen the scientists flipping pages and so it was just there like, oh, hey, uh,

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720
just, uh,

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720
That is weird.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.720
Needs more character development.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:26.600
I was, I was at an airport and there was a flight delay and there was a child with a,

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:32.200
with a mother and father and the child was probably, I'd say two and a half, three. And

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.520
there was a magazine, uh, and the kid was wandering around and bothering everybody and

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.040
found like a newsweek and put it on his lap and started running its finger across it like

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040
an iPad.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040
Yeah.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.040
And couldn't, couldn't master magazine technology.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.280
It's a sub octopus human.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.760
You get, sit there buddy.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.760
Oh, sure.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, I, I was, I was, I was, I was running along, but I, but, but, but,

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.600
but the, the, the concept of intelligence, like, like, it's like, it's just nerve clusters.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.680
Like, like, like, like, we have these giant brains, which I'm a huge fan of. I am on our

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.520
species side. I think that we need to decide right or wrong whether God made a mistake

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.000
making us this way. Like these super intelligent monkeys. It was a fucking gamble. We've been,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.240
we've been in the planet's crosshairs for, for so long. It's like tough titties that

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.840
were given a little back, uh, uh, you know, and we'll straighten up our aim. But it's

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.240
like, like, we're a hard species to keep alive because we're a fucking huge, like double

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.360
zero bet on the roulette wheel of biological warfare. Like the idea of, of just flooding

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.680
this cranium with this folded over grotesque giant plate of spaghetti that has sentient

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.840
thought and makes decisions and is conscious of its own fucking death. Like meanwhile ants

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.360
are like, nah, well, we'll stick with what's working. And they'll probably beat us. Like,

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.680
like they will. They've been around for so long.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680
They don't have depression.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680
Right.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.920
They're not things. Like we look at them and you step on one ant and you go like that poor

01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.080
thing or I feel bad or I feel great cause I got fired today. But it's like the fucking

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.720
ant doesn't care that much. And yet it's part of this gigantic fucking incredibly sophisticated

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:13.680
organism called an ant colony. That is the actual, that's the actual species is the colony.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.760
It's not, it's not Mike, like the plumber. It's like, like the little, the little things

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.320
you're seeing. They're just like, anyways, I was like, like the idea of intelligence.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.080
And like, we were obsessed with the idea that, oh, of course you'd evolve towards that, but

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.560
this octopus knows how to pretend to read a book.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.960
Well, let's do some wishful thinking right now and let, let Kameo play some D and D for

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:32.960
pity's sake.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960
Yeah.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:34.960
Are we Spencer?

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.160
Get us up to date.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.560
Slowly he hands out his character sheets prematurely. Jeff hits the Spencer theme. Not knowing.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:51.800
Dan does his impression of Spencer. He doesn't know whether Spencer likes it or not. He's

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.680
been doing it a lot.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.520
Spencer finds it just fine before resuming his introduction.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.720
When we last met after almost spending an entire tour trapped within its fleshy confines

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:10.440
our, our heroes had slain the mighty Infinifish. The party was flung out onto the ground of

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.960
a strange land. After pulling themselves up, the party surveyed the landscape. The surrounding

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.960
plants and trees were tremendous emanating powerful and strange presences. The violet

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.960
sky was full of orange balls of light bouncing and bobbing in the sky like blub, bubbles.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.600
The Infinifish corpse lay in the strange forest strewn about the felled trees composing its

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.800
deathbed. Soon the party was accosted by a strange pair wielding axes who took the party

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.520
to their camp after a tense introduction. Just then a misty fog rolled in, addling the

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.000
minds of all parties involved and causing them to act strangely for a time.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.280
Yeah, that, that was fucked up.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.560
That was, that was some Virginia Woolf shit, yeah.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.080
The pair explained they had been searching for a rare legendary artifact known as the

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.640
Soul of Growth, progenitor of all plant life and natural energy in the multi-verse. The

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:06.000
mysterious entity roos rumored to be on twyla, the plane of angels forest. They fucked around

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.400
for a while. Then in a fit of progress, the barbarian fled south in hopes of finding the

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.680
Soul of Growth through sheer coincidence. The rest, the rest of the ragtag group trailing

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680
behind.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:24.960
Thank you Spencer, wow.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.800
I wanna ask a sidebar question about the inhabitants of the Infinifish that we had met and learned

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.280
to relate to and are they all dead?

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.400
Well okay, like imagine an infinitely long fish, right?

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.440
No problem.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:47.440
If you were, if you exploded out of it at point A and they were, you know, you were farther

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.160
along than they were, they were spit out at some unknown point X if they survived. So

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.280
even if they did, there would be no way of you guys really knowing you were pretty far

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280
down the fish.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.480
Oh so it's like lost, like if we need them we'll find out that the tail section crashed

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480
somewhere else.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.720
Or you cared, you know, last episode you probably would have, you know, tried to look for them

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.400
and maybe found them.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.880
I mean I'm just saying, they did what you want to do happens, you know.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:19.800
Hey listen man, those two guys, they paid a thousand bucks to play D&D. I was so concerned

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800
with making them.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.360
Is this a thousand like actual dollars?

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360
Yeah.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.160
And they got up there and nothing happened. Aaron ultimately killed them and made up

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.360
with them like four times and it was really wild. Nobody knew what was going on.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.200
I wanted them to kill you but they didn't want to.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.080
Wait, why did you want them to kill us? It would be a good prize.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:46.360
Well they only had one day. Also I met a horse.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360
Yeah, Coco.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.360
He's my horse, Coco.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Yeah, you get a horse, yeah.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360
Yeah.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360
Kumele, I have a horse now.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
What's the horse's name?

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
Coco.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
Yep.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.720
Is it like just a horse horse or like a talking horse?

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:08.240
I mean, I can understand her. Is she just a horse? No. But technically yes, but technically

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.240
yes.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.720
Okay, just so much more to you than a horse.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720
Yes, yes.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720
Got it.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720
So I was trying to leave this group, right?

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720
You guys, yeah.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.320
So you struck off South and the team.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.000
It surged the soul of growth.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.680
Yeah, and you know, the team just kind of followed along because that seemed like a

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.680
cool idea.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.560
Well, if I said that it was in a blackout drunk, what I really want to do is like root around

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.560
and see if my concern is for the people that were in that fish, you know, like we're covered

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560
in viscera.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.480
Like I'm going to root around a little bit and see if I can find them.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.640
Like you guys are, okay, so like in the fish, around the fish, or just in general anywhere

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640
on this forest?

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.280
Well, we landed in a big pile of fish goo.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.280
True.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280
I'm looking for more fish wreckage.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:57.080
I'll take the outer perimeter, Coco and I will trot around the outer perimeter looking

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080
for people.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.960
Okay, so you could go either east or west.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.120
I go east.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.120
You go east along the side of the fish.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.440
You travel quite some way, but you feel that the fish goes on for infinity.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.040
It's a long fish, Coco.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.960
You see no split on the side of the fish.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.680
If there was anyone spat out, it wasn't here.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.680
Okay.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.680
All right.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.280
You feel like it'd take several days to actually go through the whole length of this fish.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280
Can I ask a question?

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.000
Why are you guys looking for people who've fallen out of the fish?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
They didn't even.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
They just lived in it.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
But you're concerned, Dan, about these people.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Why are you guys looking for them?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
He's a compassionate soul.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
He's a human being.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Oh, okay.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
What in the hell am I?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
What kind of world is this?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
All right.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Okay.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Just like concern for your humanity.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
All right.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Got it.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I don't understand.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:01.880
So, where are you heading now, Sharpie?

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.720
You're looking for people, but you didn't.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.200
Well, now I lost my friend.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.360
It's true.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.520
I'm looking for the soul of growth.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.480
I'm on my way south, baby.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.840
You head south.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.400
The trees and get taller and thicker.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.720
There doesn't really seem to be a path, but soon you come across a massive thicket of

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.360
trees that walls off any remaining progress.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.000
The ground before you is littered with bones and bits of flesh and pieces of metal and

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.160
little scraps of things as well as half-eating animals.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.000
I try to detect a trap around me.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.400
You detect traps about you best to be careful.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400
Okay.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400
I stand perfectly still.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400
Good plan.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:49.360
If you're rustling in the brush, someone makes it through the thick tangle of trees and the

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.880
plain view.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.480
He calls out, watch out for those traps.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.760
They'll get you.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:02.520
That's the introduction for a Kuhmels character who wanders on to frame.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.000
Who goes there?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Fennett?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.360
Fennett, if you want to change your name, I just write random things.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.360
Fennett.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.360
Yeah, like Fennett.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360
Okay.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.360
I'll change my name.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360
Do it.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
Improved.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360
Chris de Burghh.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.360
Nice.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.360
Chris de Burghh.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360
I wrote Lady in Red.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.360
Oh, shit.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360
I like that.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360
It's a great song.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.360
It is a good song.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360
God.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.360
Wait, you wrote Lady in Red?

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360
Yeah, man.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360
I got it.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360
Shit's been bad since then, though.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360
Who sang it, though?

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360
Who sang Lady in Red?

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.360
I sang it also.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360
You sang it, too.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.360
That's one of those guys that you never know who sang like that song.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.360
That's great.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360
It was me, Chris de Burghh.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:50.360
What are you doing in this thick forest surrounded by traps?

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.360
Shit got fucked, man.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360
That was a big song.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.360
It was really good.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360
I was like...

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:05.360
But you must have got all the royalties off that, right?

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360
Yeah.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.360
But you know what happened was they started having proms themed around my song.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.160
Never sent me royalty checks for that.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.800
And I thought I could write that theme forever, so there was a Lady in Pink, which I'm sure

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800
you've never heard of.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800
No.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800
See, you can't go back to the well.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.800
Like, yeah.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800
Lady in yellow.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.360
There was a dude in red, which...

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.360
Have you ever heard of dudes in goo?

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.360
No, I've been here a long time.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360
Oh, yeah.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360
What brings you out here?

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360
What are you up to?

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.360
Well, there's a lot of traps around.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360
Are they your traps?

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.360
No, I didn't set these traps.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.360
I wish I could afford traps.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360
Do you need some money?

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360
Are you hungry?

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360
What do you need, man?

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.360
Money would be great.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.360
I'd give them a couple small coins to get them to the day, Spencer.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:59.360
The only trap I fell into was my own ineptitude with financial...

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.360
Why not the music industry, man?

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360
It's really wild.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360
It's brutal.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.360
Yeah.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360
Can I...

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.360
I have a question about my spell, Detect Thoughts.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.360
Am I able to use that to find friends?

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360
You'd be able...

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.360
Okay, so if someone was behind a wall thinking, like, you'd be able...

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.360
I'd go, oh, that stands Thoughts.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.360
But, like, it's not a huge range, so you'd be able to...

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.360
All mine's come to me or whatever.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.360
You know what?

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.360
Coco and I track down Sharpie and scoop him.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360
Rejoining your compatriot.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.360
You scoop him up into a horse.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.360
Hey, I don't think finding these people that lived in the fish

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.360
doesn't seem to be a narratively profitable adventure.

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360
I agree.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.360
But I think that everybody noted what a great humanitarian you are.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360
Thank you.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360
That's honestly what's important.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360
More important than the lives themselves, yeah.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360
Are there any animals around me, Spencer, that I can talk to?

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360
I'm here.

01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:00.360
No, no, no. I'm not an animal. I'm like little, like woodland creatures or anything.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360
I mean, you don't see any, right?

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360
You could, like, maybe do a call.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.360
I do a squirrel.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.360
Squirrel.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360
Call.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360
Do I have any...

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360
I just...

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360
You think magic is dumb, if I recall correctly.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360
Yeah.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.360
You have some science items that are made with alchemy and whatnot,

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.360
but they're not so much magical.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360
Yeah, so, Chris...

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.360
What's your name?

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.360
Corpse.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360
What do you do for a living?

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360
I got a great new idea for a song.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360
Oh, yeah?

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.360
Corpse in red.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.360
I'm just a known barbarian.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.360
I'm out for adventure and for profit,

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.360
but I really think you need to not keep going back to that same idea.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360
I don't know. It really worked great that one.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
I know, but like, yeah, but like...

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360
But it's like, you know, like...

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360
You worked a song, right?

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360
Chubby Checker.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360
Lady in red.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360
Chubby Checker.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.360
She's dancing with me.

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.360
Chubby Checker song.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.360
Doing the twist, right?

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.360
Yeah.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.360
Then he tried to rewrite the twist a thousand times and they all sucked.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.360
You know, it's like, learn from Chubby Checker.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.360
Like, what's on your mind?

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360
Like, what's...

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.360
What's some actual pain?

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:08.360
I have an idea for a new song.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.360
It's about...

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360
Is it about being in a color?

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360
It's going to be about like, you meet someone and then it's like,

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360
call me maybe, you know?

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360
Okay.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.360
So that'll be the song.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.360
I like that.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.360
Yeah.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360
It's better than that.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360
Yeah.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.360
Okay.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.360
That is just to change subjects briefly.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360
I'm looking for the soul of growth.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.360
Do you know anything about that?

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360
Do I?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.360
Do you want me to fill him in?

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.360
Yeah, what is the soul of growth?

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360
Disess your character.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.360
Yeah.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360
The soul of growth is a rumored artifact that's, you know,

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360
supposed to be on Twyla.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360
That's this plane we're on, you see.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.360
It's rumored to be able to create life and birth even, you know,

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.360
planes and the magical plants and all sorts of crazy shit.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.360
Like, this whole forest used to just be the soul of growth

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360
until it expanded.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.360
So, it's a pretty big deal around here.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.360
So, yeah, I've heard of it.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.360
Wait, it's a pretty big deal around here.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.360
Have you ever been there?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.360
Could you show me the way?

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.360
If I...

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.360
You seem like you're a little down in your luck.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.360
I've got some...

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360
I've got a sack of nuts.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360
I'll give you some nuts.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.360
No, I'll give you some money.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.360
No, it's like food, like actual nuts.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.360
I can forage for nuts.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.360
Do you have any, like, ham sandwiches?

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360
Do I have any meat in my inventory?

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360
You should have some, like, foodstuffs.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.360
Okay, I...

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360
I apply him with foodstuffs and say,

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360
if you show me the way, I'll feed you.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.360
I'll make sure that you...

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.360
We'll maybe collaborate on some songs together,

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360
and we'll go...

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360
You know what?

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360
Soul of Growth sounds like a great place

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360
to get your career back on track.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.360
Oh, my God.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.360
That does.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360
Because that's who it needs growth.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.360
Yeah.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360
My career.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360
Exactly.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.360
All right.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.360
If it can create a plane,

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.360
it could certainly write us a new song.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360
It needs to be a hit song.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.360
I've written hundreds of songs.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.360
Okay, but I just see, you know,

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360
because I'm fronting you just money and food off the top,

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360
I get 80% of your back end.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360
That sounds like a good deal.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360
Okay, cool.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360
Do I actually know where it is?

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.360
I mean, you are aware that it's in a...

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360
It's supposed to be in the shrine.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.360
Yeah.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.360
To the top.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.360
All right, I'll tell you.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.360
Okay.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.360
So we...

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360
Leave me there.

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360
Conversing.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360
Yeah, okay.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360
Riding on the back of Mulraine's horse Coco,

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.360
her hair whipping into my face,

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.360
the horse's...

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.360
I like it.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.360
Rhythms gyrating my gyrations.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.360
I asked her to stop.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.360
I asked her to stop the horse for a moment.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360
Mulraine stopped.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.360
Yeah.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.360
It's only been so long since you've turned into a woman.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360
But we are in a different dimension.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.360
I feel like the rules don't apply.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.360
I want to make love to you.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360
Right now, in the dirt,

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360
well, this horse watches.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.360
I heard through the wind that you've been abstaining from

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360
pledging yourself.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360
For you.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.360
And for my magic.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:31.360
It actually adds a point of damage to my ray of frost.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.360
Well, yes.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360
Let's do it in the dirt.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360
As long as we can do it underneath Coco,

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.360
underneath her shade.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360
Okay.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360
I mean, it's a well-trained horse ray.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.360
It's not going to step on me.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360
No, no.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360
She won't do anything.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.360
She'll watch, but she won't move.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360
I make love to Mulraine's Sedana

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360
underneath her horse Coco.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.360
It's pretty sensual.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360
Cushy, cushy.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360
Cushy, cushy.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.360
Is that good or bad?

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360
Yeah.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.360
He jerks off at the end to finish himself.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360
As is commanded in the Koran.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360
I wiped the confetti off my stomach.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.360
That's how good I am.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.360
Just a little bit of confetti falls from the heavens.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.360
Oh, no, I thought it was coming out of the...

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.360
Oh.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.360
Rip, rip, Taylor.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.360
Sharpie, I know that your relationship with Quirk

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.360
is very close.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360
Will this interfere?

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.360
It doesn't matter.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360
He'll figure it out.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.360
He'll adapt.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.360
His relationship with me is, you know,

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.360
one that doesn't involve things going into each other.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.360
I don't fully believe that, but I trust you.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.360
So you stopped jerking off for three days

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360
and you fuck Aaron and D&D?

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.360
Very romantic now.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.360
This is so much sense.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360
Under a horse.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.360
While that same horse was watching.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.360
Doesn't even make sense.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.360
Because I have to assume that means it's their turn.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360
I mean, it's not like...

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.360
Well, Sharpie, let's mount Coco

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.360
and head to the soul explosion yard.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.360
What was it called?

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.360
The soul explosion yard.

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:46.360
I don't think the soul explosion yard was your belly just now.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:54.360
Cut to me, Quirk and Christopher just jerking off next to a tree.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360
Oh, boy.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360
Oh, God.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.360
That was a good idea, Chris.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360
I'm not done yet, give me a second.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360
Okay, sorry, sorry.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.360
Sorry, I'm going to smoke one of my smoke sticks.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360
I got a new idea.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.360
Oh, shit.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.360
Lady in white.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.360
Okay, okay.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.360
Again, let's go to the soul of growth.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.360
Yeah, okay, I know there's a temple.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360
Okay, we have to navigate through these traps.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.360
I use a...

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.360
Can I detect the trap?

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.360
What's the best way to navigate through these traps?

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.360
You can attempt to find a trap.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:32.360
Once you see it, you can either avoid it or dismantle it somehow.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.360
Okay, how many traps lay ahead of me?

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.360
Well, you don't know, so let's see how many you find.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.360
Is there anything I have that would help?

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:45.360
You are also adept at finding traps, so you could both sweep for traps.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360
Let's discover...

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.360
What is your class or race, or what are you?

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.360
He's a human world.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.360
Singer-songwriter?

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360
No, I know that, Christopher.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.360
You are very...

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360
Did you ever...

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360
Level one with a bullet.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.360
Have you heard Lady in red?

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360
It was a huge song.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360
Kids...

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360
What is he?

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.360
I'm a human thief with some...

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360
You got some items.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360
Kind of like Batman.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.360
Is he currently surrounded by traps?

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360
Presumably he knows how to get through these traps.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360
Presumably he does.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.360
I follow Christopher for traps.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360
Yeah, I know where the traps are, right?

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.360
I've been here.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.360
You've been here.

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.360
Christopher, again, all the food and gold you want.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.360
Let's get to the Soul of Growth, if you can lead the way.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360
I have no use for gold.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360
I've got gold records and stuff.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
How many gold records really do you have?

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360
Two, one.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.360
It was this song.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.360
I promise you, if we get to the Soul of Growth,

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360
a new gold record, maybe even platinum.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.360
Okay, alright, well follow me.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:04.360
Okay.

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.360
Alright, are we through?

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.360
Okay, so do you guys want to join back up yet?

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.360
Yeah, sure.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.360
Okay, we're going through the traps.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.360
As you blaze your trails, a horse approaches.

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360
Oh!

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.360
Oh my god, Sharpie, Mulrainee, Chris de Burgh!

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.360
Hey!

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.360
He wrote Lady in Red.

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.360
Have you guys heard Lady in Red?

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.360
It was a big song.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.360
I literally thought you were dead.

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.360
No, no, no.

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.360
I've just been lost for a while.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.360
Spiritually and also physically.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.360
Mulrainee, you have some confetti in your hair.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.360
Oh, let me just...

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.360
I put it in a plastic bag and I put it in my pocket.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360
Tom Lakers is right.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.360
It was a Tom Lakers, it was a bad Tom Lakers joke.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360
Sorry, everybody.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.360
I know where the Soul of Growth is.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.360
You know?

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.360
We're going to follow Christopher, a famous singer-songwriter,

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360
through these traps, because he knows the way.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360
I know the way.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.360
We're going to go to the Soul of Growth.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.360
We're going to get whatever we want and also...

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360
He's giving me food and gold.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.360
Food and gold, but I really want to get this guy's career back online.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.360
That's great.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.360
If you've got any ideas for songs, you know, I'm like a sponge right now.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360
How about...

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.360
Cocoa and Brown.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.360
Cocoa and Brown.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360
I think you've got to get off the color thing.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.360
I've been telling them this for like all day.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.360
If you're going to detect traps, then why can't you...

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.360
Like, look at the creative pitfalls.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.360
Like, all around you, you know?

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.360
And just get out of the area, you know?

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360
Like, sneak past all of it.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360
Or you're also...

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360
Yeah, no, I'm going to.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360
I know how to do the traps.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.360
There's an actual guy who wrote Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.360
We'll never know his name, but he probably wrote a bunch of shitty songs.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360
Jason Priestley.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.360
But you're a thief, right?

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.360
Why don't we just like break into Tom Waits' house or something like that

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.360
and steal some song ideas?

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360
I don't think my voice is...

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360
I point my horse towards Tom Waits' house.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.360
Your horse doesn't know.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.360
So I feel like now that we have one,

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360
we've made a new friend, Chris de Burgh.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.360
Let's go to...

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360
We're embarking towards the soul of growth.

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.360
I think that's a good cliffhanger, right?

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360
I mean, certainly chronologically, we...

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360
Yeah, I think we're running longer.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360
I think now Camille, we've got you on board here now.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360
Yeah, you've got to come back next week now.

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360
May I say quickly?

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.360
In the back, we're selling these t-shirts that Dan is wearing.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360
Wait, are we not in this world anymore?

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360
This is Coco speaking.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360
Oh, t-shirts.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360
Pads from D&D World.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360
We have t-shirts in the back.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360
I don't know how many times we'll sell them again.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.360
This might be the last time.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360
They're $15 or two for $25.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360
Otherwise, they're online and they're more expensive.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360
But yeah, come buy a t-shirt.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360
That's all.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360
They've got confetti on them.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360
From the tour.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.360
Don't worry, by confetti, we mean Dancecom.

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360
All right.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360
Thank you, Aaron.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360
Thank you, Camille, Nanjiani.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360
Thank you, guys.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.360
Thank you, Erin McGathy.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.360
Thank you, Spencer.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360
You can...

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360
That's exciting.

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.360
We have a new member of our party.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360
Yeah, for the time being, anyway.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360
Chris Berg.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.360
Finding out the...

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360
the octopus thing.

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
But, Jeff, it really turned into a good show.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.360
It did.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360
Was there ever any doubt?

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360
No, there was. Yeah, when I was talking at the top of it.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360
About whether or not it was going to be a good show, blah, blah, blah.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360
Like, we could cut that out.

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360
That's sinew. That's tissue.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.360
I would say in the past, because of the early days of Nerdmelt shows,

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360
our best shows here, when you were really driven by

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360
anxiety and...

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.360
Now that I've become a godlike being,

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360
which we are going to embrace...

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360
Don't tell me what to embrace.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360
I'm not going to affect the

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360
visage of a guy who's nervous

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360
as someone who's become

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360
an impersonal cosmic force.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.360
What I'm going to do is evolve into somebody who runs

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360
a real show and has awesome guests

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360
and talks about interesting stuff.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360
Now, here's a good question.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360
Here's something I've not thought of until just now.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360
We, on the tour, kept ending with these songs,

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.360
these raps, these things that became kind of a...

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360
You know, we...

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360
We did it. We did it. We did it enough.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360
Now, how do you end the show now without that...

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.360
without that...

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360
go-to thing?

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.360
Two words, Jeff.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360
Two words.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360
Do you want me to hit the music?

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.360
I thought that was it.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.360
Now, I don't know how to end the show.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360
I don't know...

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
God doesn't know how to end your day.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360
You go to bed. That's what happens to you.

01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360
You close your eyes.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.360
God keeps the universe fucking

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360
like chugging.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360
We go to the drawing room. We have a drink.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.360
You know, if I got to do a rap

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.360
about being God,

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360
we'll see how it goes.

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.360
All right.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.360
I'm willing to roll those cosmic dice.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.360
Which style do you want?

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360
We've got enough time to see how a rap goes.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360
Or...

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360
God damn it.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.360
The rapping is so...

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
How about this?

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360
For the last time...

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360
This will be our last one,

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.360
because we have the cameras here,

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360
and we still have to use our non-licensed music.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360
Hopefully, it'll be the last time we have to use that same music

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.360
we've been using just to keep it non-licensed.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.360
We can go back to using the Metallica riffs.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.360
Let's just give this one more raw,

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.360
and this will be maybe a little cherry on top

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360
of the entire tour. Let's try this.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.360
I don't tend to do well when I actually need to.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360
Oh, this.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360
It always sounds like hot August night to me.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.360
It's so good to be back.

01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360
Good to be back here.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360
In Hollywood.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360
Octopuses.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.360
My soul is flowing into yours.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360
What kind of beer do you like?

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.360
Coors.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.360
If it's a different kind, it's okay.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:19.360
In Harmontown.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.360
I love all of you.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.360
I love dudes and goo.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.360
I love hats and shoes.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:33.360
In Harmontown.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360
And I learned to love all the people.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.360
Probably not going to rhyme anything with that,

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.360
but steeple.

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.360
Across the country of ours.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360
Cars.

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.360
Rhyming is done.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.360
Don't rhyme. Connect with the people.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.360
Look at the faces out here, Harmon.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.360
Look at the people.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360
Look at somebody that you don't know in the eye.

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.360
Pick somebody at random,

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.360
and look that person in the eye,

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360
and connect with this person.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.360
But for real.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.360
Don't rhyme car and far and steeple with people.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.360
I won't.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360
Hello.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360
What's your name?

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360
Martin.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360
You look a little bit like Eric Wehrheim.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.360
Yeah.

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360
You don't have to.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360
That was me getting in the way of us connecting.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360
Here's what you look like.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360
That's stupid.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.360
Martin, I love you.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360
Martin, I love you.

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360
We're the same person.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.360
We were born the same.

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.360
We're only pretending to be separate.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360
I don't have to rhyme.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360
I could just stand here and talk.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.360
I could just stand here and talk.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.360
Martin, you're a human being.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.360
So am I.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360
Martin.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.360
Oh shit, sorry, that was Martin.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360
I am an impersonal force

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.360
who tries to come in

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360
and make you not connect with people

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.360
to prove that connection is

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360
more difficult than it appears.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.360
Oh.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.360
Oh, I'm beating him.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.360
I'm beating him.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360
Now I'm free to connect.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360
I'm so free to connect

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360
with the world.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.360
Because we're in Harmontown.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.360
What's your name?

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Ben.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360
What's the problem?

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360
I'm having a fight with my sister.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.360
Is she older or younger?

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360
Older.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.360
Fuck her.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.360
She should know that she has a little brother.

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360
Her fucking job is to be kind of a junior parent.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.360
Fuck her.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360
What's her name?

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360
Fucking grow up.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360
You got a little brother.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360
It doesn't matter if he's 40.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360
He's your little brother.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360
Fucking Sarah.

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.360
Get your shit together.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360
What's your name?

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360
Dan.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.360
Awesome.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360
What's the problem?

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360
Work.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360
What do you do?

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360
I teach high school.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360
Someone has to.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.360
It's insane that

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.360
that's worthy of a pause now.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360
That's how people actually feel.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.360
Everyone is actually feeling that way.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.360
Hang in there.

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.360
What's your name?

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.360
I know you. You help with t-shirts.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.360
My name's Ryan.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.360
Thanks for helping with t-shirts.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360
Thanks for letting me in your house.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360
He was in the documentary

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.360
to help their room with t-shirts.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.360
Then the documentary crew left

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.360
and then you

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360
expressed a lot of gratitude

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.360
for being able to help Aaron with stuff.

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.360
You got kind of emotional.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.360
The documentary crew wasn't there to pick it up.

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360
The documentary crew is here.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360
I muster it up. Do it.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.360
Dance monkey.

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.360
Tell us how much you love being in Harmontown.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.360
I hope I can make friends with her someday.

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.360
I don't know.

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.360
Let's go to the drawing room afterwards.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.360
I'll buy you a drink for helping with t-shirts.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360
Alright.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360
Who's having the best day of their life?

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.360
Who's...

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360
What's your name?

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360
David.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360
Is there anything good that happened about today?

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.360
Detail-wise?

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.360
The second time I've ever actually been here

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.360
is seeing the show because my friends brought me.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360
I'm having a great time.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.360
The reason you're having a great time

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360
is because you came to my show.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.360
Hi.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360
Harmontown.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360
I'm a god.

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.360
I make clouds and dogs.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.360
I separated the sky from the earth.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.360
You're here because of me

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.360
and everything that you feel and do

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.360
is because a little guy

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.360
like me shot his cosmic

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.360
goo into the universe

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.360
and fertilized an infinite something.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.360
My name is Harmon.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.360
This is Harmontown.

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.360
Thank you for coming, everybody.

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.360
You're all gods.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.360
You are all also gods.

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:33.360
Kumail Nanjiani.
