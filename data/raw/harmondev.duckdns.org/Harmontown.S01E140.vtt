WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
The Hollywood, California, Meltdown, Comics, NerdMelt, Theater, Harmontown is now in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:25.000
Please welcome to the stage, please welcome to the stage, please welcome to the stage the

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
major of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Yeah, yeah, I put my hat on my hand. I took your mama too bad.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
I started wrapping her shoulders because she was tense. I said, mama you're tense. She said, tense rhymes with tense.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
I said, go in the back and sleep in the tents. There were two tents that she had to choose from.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
There was a wigwam on the side and she wasn't. Alright, okay, don't.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
It was a noble experiment. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I felt there was a chance that something magical was about to happen. Yeah, no, I over-thought it. I over-thought it.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I was like, wow, there's a lot of people, it's doing good on Netflix, that movie, I guess there's a lot of people,

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
maybe they think that the wrapping will be better in person. Sorry, I started, there's a feedback loop.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
I think the wrapping is just as good in person as just listening to it.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.000
Fuck you, Acknowledged. No, I would like to continue to experiment with the idea of me coming up with something to do.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Right. Like that. Okay. So don't give up on me. Do you want to start over? Should we start over?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
No, no, well, I mean... Is that too inorganic? How about this, go out and enter from the street. Walk out there.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
That's actually not about it. Go out the side door.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
Spend a moment, Dan, in the alley. Pretend like you're in Brooklyn or something. Pretend you're some hard-ass street.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Alright, Harmon has left the room. The door is shut. Okay, everybody, let's hide.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Alright.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Alright, everybody. Take two. Nerd Melt comics. Meltdown Theater. Hollywood, California.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
Shit's about to get real. Harmontown is once again put the same second time and the same night in session.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
Entering from a completely different door.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
From the alleyway. Not the cosy and comfortable green room, but the mean streets of the alley.

02:23.000 --> 02:39.000
To get up and need a drive. Man, Harmon. Money, drugs, got it, drugs, drugs. Money, drugs, Brooklyn, not drugs.

02:39.000 --> 02:50.000
I said, bitch, please, you're never gonna get in law school doing that. She took her hat down, pulled off her hat, and there was a little robot under her skin.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
He said, oh shit, you're moving in. You're gonna come inside and see what controls her. Oh shit, she's a giant robot.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
That was a little boy.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
That was 75% better than the first one. I think you harness something angry and wonderful.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
I turned into DMX out there, I think. Yeah, for me, that's what Brooklyn's about.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
I was like a dog, like a fighting dog. I wish we had four more rooms for you to enter from.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
Like if I came down on a cotton ball moon like Katy Perry, would I have a hit on my hands?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Can you enter out of the bathroom and try it again?

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
Do you think it's diminishing returns now? Yeah, probably. Also, you're wildly out of breath right now.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
I moved from, yeah, one of the secrets of the start of the show is that I'm right there off camera.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
In the show, I thought to minimize the exercise, but that was twice as far as I've walked for a long time.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
So I'm not gonna, I'm sorry, right away, just in case everybody panics and goes like, oh shit, I'm behind it.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
I don't want this major thing spoiled, but I just finished watching all of this Jinx thing with the Jinx guy.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
With our Bobby Durst? Yeah. Who, you know, that blinking thing, that is very Adam Goldberg.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Anybody who's actually talked to Adam Goldberg? Scott Robinson? What's your name out there?

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
John Robinson. I thought for sure that was there. I thought Adam Goldberg had a new identity.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
I was like, that is, I think how this starts. It's just association. He just starts going like, aren't we all pretzels?

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
And then it's like, who gives a shit? But yeah, that guy, if you've ever had a conversation.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Do you guys know what we're talking about, the Bob Durst? He possibly killed 19 people?

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
You should definitely check it out. It's not like, I mean, the serial thing was amazing and fun to take part in.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
After a while, the reason to take part in it was because you would be the only person that didn't know what anyone else was talking about.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
But this really is, even if you were on a desert island, by the time you get to the end, it really is quite, it's pretty incredible.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
It's like, the serial thing is kind of like, it's sort of like, the circumstances are the same at the end as at the beginning.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
Like, they're just reopening a confusing murder and you leave confused in serial.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
This is, you do not, it's fucking crazy, like the last five minutes are amazing.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
So that's all I'll say about the actual content. You don't have to worry about spoilers or anything.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
But I did, while we were watching, and I got into the strangest debate with Aaron, because they kept on, you know, like,

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
he was on trial at a certain point for murdering a guy and they thought it was a slam dunk case because he dismembered him.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And so, and it was like, and they kept, they kept stressing that.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
They're like, well, this is the, this is the body that he dismembered, so it's open and shut.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
And they kept going like, how, I don't understand what these, and Aaron and I got into this really not intense argument,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
but it was like, just really, we weren't seeing each other side of it.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
It was like, if I ever need or want to kill someone, let's say need.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
Like, I'm gonna do everything I can to do it right.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm gonna follow through. I assume.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Like, I would have decided that someone needed to die.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
So this would be a first degree premeditated murder we're talking about?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah, or even, I guess, if, yeah, well, yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Or if the shit went down, you went, fuck it, this guy has to go, bang,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
and now you gotta deal with the aftermath of that.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah, well, maybe that's the big clincher, is it's like, okay, this guy, but it's like, who, if you, yeah.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
Let's say it's the latter. Let's say that you had a reason to hide something so big, like another murder, for instance.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
And you told the guy too much, and he was like, I'm gonna blackmail you.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
And I'm like, well, please don't do that, because you might not like what happens.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And then he'd be like, are you threatening me?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And I'd be like, are you blackmailing me?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Are you gonna murder me?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Are you gonna blackmail me?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, let's say.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Because the last person didn't blackmail me.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
You know, so you're in trouble here.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
She was about to. She was about to blackmail me.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah, she was about to. Are you blackmailing me?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm about to.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Okay, so you're neck and neck with a dead person.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
All right. Hey, let's call the whole thing up.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I forget we ever, let's just go to Chili's, have lunch.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Okay, great. So here's the thing.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I will know if you're blackmailing me, if you say to me...

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Look, I'll just say this. I'll say this.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm a little, I'm behind in the rent.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
I could use 50,000, let's say 50,000 dollars fell out of the sky right now.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I would know exactly what to do with that.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
As opposed to walking down maybe to the local police department

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
and saying that your name is Dan Park.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Is that what you're gonna do? You're gonna talk to the police?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Okay, yes, I'm gonna do it.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Give me 50,000 dollars and it won't do it.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
All right.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I guess I'm, am I blackmailing you now? It's blackmail.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Let me get my checkbook.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Is it in the drawer with the gun?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't, I don't have a gun drawer.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I have a checkbook drawer.

08:22.000 --> 08:31.000
My gun is in it because it's a, it's something, it's another thing you use sometimes in an emergency.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh, shit.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Wait, wait, you, oh shit, the first one you missed is like when you got me.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Son of a bitch.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Should I ask for less money?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
All right, so now you got a dead guy on the floor of your apartment.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Bleeding all over the joint.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
You're dressed as a woman.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You've been going under a fake name.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Now you got some fucking fancy footwork to do.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Now what's, what's your first move?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I would, I would do what he did.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Go buy a bossa and start chopping fuckers up?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I think.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
Now, now, now, now Aaron's point is that no, no normal human being could get past that point.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
And my point is that, yeah, that's why so many people get caught.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Like the people that, like the people that get away with murder are the people that go that extra mile.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Post murder.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Like they do horrible things.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Like you've taken a human life and now that person is meat.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
And now, so that's why I'm confused as in the courtroom where they try to, they bring that out like,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
and then you know what he did?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
He tried, he tried to keep doing it.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
He tried to finish.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
He tried to get away with it.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
He took the head and he put it in a bowling bag and he threw it on the roof.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Not once, but twice.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
He missed the first time.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I was like, yeah, it's hard, he had a difficult time.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
He's trying to get away.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
He didn't walk in here.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
It wasn't, he tried, he killed the guy and he wanted to get away with it.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Right.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
I just said that whole group, because it's like, you're talking about a jury of people who are all supposed to sit there and think,

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
oh yeah, that is fucked up because if I killed someone and they're all running a simulation of them killing someone,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
it's like, you're already fucked up people.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, I wouldn't be able to do this or that, like tell me more about where your lines are,

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
like around the horrible primatological act of extinguishing another primate.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Like, oh, what are your pet peeves right after the life goes out of their eyes?

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
These people that kill someone normally, the neurotypical murderer,

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
the heteronormative mainstream murderer,

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
the 1%, not 99%, I don't know, okay, I want you to fire that.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
What do they do?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
They kill somebody kind of in a fit of a rage.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
They don't do it for any reason.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
And then they go, oh no, oh god, I can't believe I did that.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, what, so I'm supposed to make that person senator and send the other person to the electric chair?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
The other person is playing chess with life.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
Who's this crazy person that can kill their best friend because they're in a bad mood and then be like, whoops.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
That person has the hearts and minds of the jury.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Like, yeah, that's dangerous to me.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
The idea is we take it easy on people who confess to a crime as opposed to people who elaborately try to hide the fact.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, I don't know.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
It's like, what better way to keep getting away with murder than to never murder someone again?

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Isn't there a kind of self-policing to a successful murderer?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, apparently not.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
That's why we're so fascinated with this guy, though.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I think this guy is a little cuckoo pants.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Oh no, he's not even good at getting away with it or anything.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
What he's good at is having loads of money and having really good defense attorneys.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And that's the thing.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The prosecution absolutely screwed that one.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
The guy chopped somebody up into a hundred pieces and threw him in a trash bag and threw him in the water and he floated.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
You always hear these stories about this whole myth of, oh, these rich people are going to afford these rich lawyers.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
But it's not like they're Clarence Darrow doing these tricks.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
Whenever you see the real life incarnation of it, it's always just like the people who work for the prosecution are totally incompetent.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
You can't believe or understand what they're doing.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
The jury is totally confused.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
A rational, normal person with an IQ over 100 stands up and represents the killer and says,

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
guys, let's get down to brass tacks. Here's the rules. If you didn't find a head, you can't say.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
That's the rules, sorry.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
If you can't find a head, you're right.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
No, it's right there in the rules.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
And then everyone's like, you slick talking city lawyer.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
You dersewitch, you got him.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
You got him.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
No, you're fucking city employees.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
They're idiots.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
They're like these weird people.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
What was their name?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Marsha Clark, whoever, the OJ prosecution.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
They fucking blew it. They blew it.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And they had our Frank Kato on the stand.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
He didn't know anything and they made a big jump out of him and he was better for the defense.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
He ended up being worse for the prosecution because he didn't know anything.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
He told me the whole story.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I hung out with Kato the first time I met him.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I met him at the Playboy mansion.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
As one does.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And we hung out and then we went to Mel's Diner.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
Is it Mel's Diner? Maybe it was back when it was Ben Franks.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
We sat there and he told me the whole story.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
He told me the whole day of OJ knocks on his door and says, hey, Kato, if you're going to use the hot tub,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
you got to turn it off afterwards.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And Kato's like, I always turn it off.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Kato's really smart.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
He remembers everything.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
He sounds like a surfer kind of bimbo he did, but he's quite intelligent and super thoughtful.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And he's like, when I use it, I always turn it off.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
And I knew that I had.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And it was like, also, he never came down to the back house to speak to me.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So then he goes, OK, I'm sorry.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I thought I did.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
But next time you do that, you got to do that.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
But he looked kind of out of sorts and weird.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
So then he goes away.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And then a while later, he comes back and says, hey, do you have change for 100?

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
And at that point, Kato's like, I just feel like he just wanted to prove.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Looking back on it, he was just trying to prove I was here.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And he was like, no, I don't have change for 100.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
He's broke-ass Kato Kato living in the back house of his place because he's good with kids.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And Nicole Simpson loved Kato.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And he was great with the children.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
O.J. was never there.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
So O.J. also, he felt like was having him followed.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
Like Kato felt like he was pretty sure that he was being watched because he was super jealous of Nicole who was cheating on him.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
And then he said, no, I don't have change for 100.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
He's like, well, I want to go to McDonald's and get some food, which sounds like alibi, like establishing.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And Kato doesn't know this because he doesn't know a murder is about to happen or two murders.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And he goes, I'll just go with you.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm hungry, too.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
And O.J. goes, oh, oh, go, go, go, go, go.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Okay, okay, okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
And they go in the car and they order the food and he eats the food and he eats it in the drive, like the drive-thru.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
They order the food in the drive-thru and instantly eats his fillet of fish or a quarter pound or whatever he gets.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
At the drive-thru, which nobody has ever done.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
Nobody eats it before you leave the parking lot.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Guilty, sir.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
So he tells me the whole story and then a friend of his, he's good friends with Nicole.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
She nearly gets decapitated and his other guy, the waiter, wasn't it Ron Goldman, he gets murdered.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
So as he's telling the story at this diner at 4 a.m., a guy comes over to the table and goes,

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
hey, Kato, Kato, hey, yo, man, I have an old school OJ Simpson jersey signed by him.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
How much do you think that's worth?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
And Kato's like, I don't know, man.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, asshole.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
And the guy walked away, I go, you just told me about your friend being nearly decapitated.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And then some guy walks up and says, how much is an OJ thing and called you an asshole?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And he goes, it happens every day.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Once a day for 10 years.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
I remember back then, because people felt like he was just a party to this whole circus.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
So I remember back then him saying that people would drive by and yell stuff out the window.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
That was years after, but it was like they associated him with the...

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
All he was was a guy that happened to hear a thump on the wall.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
And he was around when it happened, didn't know anything, and they made him a hostile witness.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
He's the only guy I ever saw.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
Even Jack Black, with the time that I would be hanging out in public with Jack Black,

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
is probably the most famous guy I've ever been in public with at the height of their fame.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
And the height of people just strangers coming up to Jack and going, are you famous?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
And Jack would go, no, because if you don't, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And then I'm going, yeah, you are.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And then they're like, can I get a picture with you?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
And Jack going, half the time, okay, and half the time, no.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
But then in either case, they come up later and go, keep calm, screw the rock or whatever.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
They yell some shit at him.

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
And the Cato, the one time we were out, he was singing karaoke and people were just walking up,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
putting their arm around him.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
He was like a statue.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
And going like, taking a picture.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
And then walking away and looking at the phone and going, hilarious, like five feet away from him.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
And he's just like, playing with the Queen of Hearts.

17:20.000 --> 17:31.000
I guess I've become a piece of furniture in a cosmic game by God.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
In an incredibly unique situation, he was just a celebrity for being on Trowell.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Also, hilariously, had no idea what he was supposed to do, why he was even called as a witness.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
And then ended up, black people hated him, black people loved him, white people hated him, white people loved him.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
He was on every side of every coin.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
What's truly tragic about Cato is that he's one of the most likable people you'll ever fucking meet.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
You can't not like Cato Kalem, because he's such a sweetheart.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
And if you ever saw him around children, you'd be like, he's...

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
It sounds like you're talking about a terrier or something.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
But he is like a terrier.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
He has terrier-like energy, and he will entertain the world's children.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
He just runs around the pool all day long, and people are like, can you please just babysit my children for the whole time?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Well, now you got us worried again.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
It's not worrisome. He's not going to do anything bad.

18:29.000 --> 18:36.000
I know, we're just programmed. When we hear the word children, we all think about fucking them.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
So what's happened to us?

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
So what happened to you?

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
Hey, you ever not brush your teeth, and then you're like leaving, and then you're like, oh shit, I didn't brush my teeth.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
And then you just drink something gross, like coffee.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
Because you're like, well, my breath will be terrible, but then someone will think, oh, he drank coffee.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
It's food for thought.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Food for nightmares.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
It's like too far from the toothpaste. I'll just drink some gross coffee.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
I'll just double down on being disgusting.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Well, they won't go, yeah, because it's somehow worse if you have a bad breath.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
The bad part of your breath is your entrails.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I had a computer teacher in high school who was awesome.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
She was so great, but boy, the coffee and cigarette breath combined to make something just...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm really phobic about it.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
That's one of many reasons why I don't make eye contact when I'm talking to people.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
I try to look at the floor, because you get a blast of bad breath in your face.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And also, no one's going to tell you. You don't know if you have bad breath.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
No, why would you tell anybody?

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Every once in a while, it happens, I'm on the receiving end of it, and I always think that poor person,

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
because they don't know why I just became 10% more aloof, because it's not like anyone ever goes,

19:54.000 --> 20:04.000
you just smell it, and then you just pull spiritually back from the whole thing.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
You kind of keep your head in the same place, but you just hate them, and slowly they just feel...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And that person doesn't know.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Sometimes you talk to somebody who has clinically bad breath.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
People can have like, halitosis, they can have a bad thing.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Some people have that with their armpits, some people have that with their butts.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Everybody has that with their butts, by the way.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
So it's something to think about. Get off your high horse.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.000
Hashtag stinking is not a choice, and I will send $100 to the Red Cross.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
I was in Variety. I was on the cover of Variety with Joel McHale this last week.

20:45.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, a little dream come true. I got to mark this one off my non-hack version of a bucket list.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Was there a hilarious Variety headline with great abbreviations?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, it did say... I didn't get this for a really long time.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
It said, it was a picture of me and Joel, and then it says,

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
imperfect harmony...

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
What's not to get there?

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
Well, because the I and the M and imperfect were in red, and then the perfect was in white.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
That's needless.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
For a long time, it was like, oh, imperfect harmony would be a phrase.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
No one really...

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So they were trying to italicize the M.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, it was more like, imperfect harmony.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Building on that old chestnut, perfect harmony.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Okay, that's a musical term, but I mean, I don't know.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
But anyways, thank you for putting me on your cover.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
I have some notes.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm sure whoever wrote that headline will agree with me that that was not their finest hour.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
It sounds like a protracted meeting went on about that.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
I just have some 19-year-old kid that has to sit in this cubicle, and he's like, Dan Harmon.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
God, Dan it. Dan good time.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Don't just please the Harmon.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Michael's Navy Harmon?

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
Harmon, yeah. Irish Delight.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
There's a paragraph in it that says,

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
Dan Harmon finishes his breakfast of peanut butter filled pretzels

22:37.000 --> 22:46.000
before hopping on his Segway, which he purchased to conserve energy, dash his own.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
That's a good lead.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
I would continue reading that article.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
That's not the opener.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
That's how you start it. You start with that one.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
This is the things I have no right to complain about.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
If you write an article about me, here's the start of my complaint,

23:11.000 --> 23:20.000
it would seem that if you don't mention my fat gut, you get fined by some kind of press union or something.

23:20.000 --> 23:29.000
The last two, I was a Hollywood reporter, and it's his visible punch, his protruding punch, his pronounced punch,

23:29.000 --> 23:41.000
bulges from beneath his sweater as he slovenly sucks up a bowl of skittles with downing globs of frog meat.

23:41.000 --> 23:50.000
A timid slave clad Leia struggles against her chains as he gurgles his desires.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
A language only worms could understand.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
I know the battle of the sexes is over and the men won, and we don't have anything to complain about,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
but man, you just don't see that in articles about female showrunners.

24:06.000 --> 24:16.000
Just physical discoverer, calf muscles, could use some work, but you don't know how much hell you'd catch.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
They're talking about writers, not actors.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
That's what I'm saying. If we've described Shonda Rhimes in an article about her, do you know how much trouble you would get into

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
clinically scrutinizing her, giving a description of her?

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
I think that seems a bit harsh, but part of what's for sale, if someone's writing an article about you,

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
is the fact that you're willfully, you're just you, and part of that is a glass of fuck.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
It's what you see. Part of what's for sale here is what you're looking at, what you're picking on.

24:48.000 --> 24:59.000
Big fat nerd shit. The big shitty shit face waddles into the room with a shit coming out of his face.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
It's going to be another hard day in the writer's room.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
What do you think would have been different? Let's say, going back, same behavior, same attitudes towards authority.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
If I looked like Steve Levitan, would it be different about the article?

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
No, no, no.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Do you think you would still have been fired for the same behavior if you were, like, super sexy?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
No.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
You wouldn't have been fired?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Nope.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
You don't think so? Wouldn't have been more outrage if you...

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
I wouldn't have noticed it. If I took a shower every day and was passionate about my show, it wouldn't look like I was crazy.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
It would look like I was awesome.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
They'd be like, oh, I get it. He's like Zuckerman from college.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Zuckerman?

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
He was always mad into basketball, man.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
He fucking got up every day, took a shower, and got fucking aggro on the court.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
That's just, that's harming. He's like the Zuckerman.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
Don't people want to take down really good-looking people, too, that are in positions of power?

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Not the other good-looking people. That's all us ugly people, because we're looking at them on billboards.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I want to take those guys down.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Thanks, Jeff. Must have been hard for you to say.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
It was the easiest thing I've said all night.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Queer.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
You're good.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
So anyways, I deserved better.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
That's why you get fired. That's why you get fired.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
It's your strange homophobia, for no reason.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It's your rampant homophobia.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
Don't you want to talk about how to murder people with Spencer? Should we bring Spencer up?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Are you going to murder him?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
No, no, I want to...

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, you want to find out how to murder somebody else?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, yeah, like...

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
All right. Spencer Quittenden!

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Murder talk.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Murder talk with Spencer Quittenden.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Murder talk.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Murder talk with Spencer Quittenden.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Murder talk.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
It's time to talk how to kill a person with Spencer Quittenden.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Well, my dice got one side, my dice got two.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
See? Nope, nope.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, you sat down, right? I thought that was...

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I like to sit and rap.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Okay.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Yo!

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
I'm a sit-down rapper, and I'm here to say I'm not going to stand when I rap today.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm going to bend my knees and squat.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I'm a lazy rapper. That's what I got.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm a sit-down rapper, and I'm on the can, looking through the newspaper.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
As fast as I can.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Terrible.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Look at those headlines.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Look at the vice president up to his old tricks again.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Sit-down rapper's the worst rapper.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Sit-down rapper's terrible.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Remember when you came in, you were DMX,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
when you came from outside, the alleyway?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Yo, yo, no.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
I don't care what you want.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Lazy rapper.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Sit-down rapper don't care about your needs.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Sit-down rapper doesn't care about your needs.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
There's no such thing as a reason why you don't sit-down and rap.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
We've proven that name another sit-down rapper.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
No, no, no, no.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I don't do anything for anyone.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Sit-down rapper's concerned with the self.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Sit-down rapper rhymes self with shout.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Sit-down rapper doesn't give a shit.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Sit-down rapper's just living in it.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
I see a piece of cake.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I see a piece of cookie.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
I fucked your mama so hard, she wasn't looking.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
No, no. Say no, no.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
I had to come to an abrupt end.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
I think we've proved that it's harder to sit-down and rap.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
It's more easier.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
You know what, I think you get more out of your little rap baby dance.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
There's more energy in the little kicky-foot baby dance that you do.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
What do you think, Spencer?

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
I think there's definitely a lot more energy in your kicky-foot baby dance.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Spencer, have you given any thought to getting away with a perfect murder?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Oh, I think we all have, Jeff.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
The way you say that makes me think that you've thought about it just a little bit more.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
Of course, you have to fantasize about it only for academic reasons.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
It's like thinking about jumping out of windows.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's not like you're going to jump out of windows.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It's just you've got to think about it to know you're not going to do it.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I went through a whole phaser.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
I watched forensic files in all those shows for like a million years.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
I was unemployed, and I was on the Atkins diet,

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
and I would watch Colombo and Forensic Files and eat summer sausage and cheese

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
and just watch my bank account going from 12,000 to 11,000 to 10,000.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
There was this clock that Milwaukee at 12,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
like I thought I was going to move back to Milwaukee,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
and they'd be like, hey, you were born here so you could watch dishes here?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
No, that wouldn't have happened.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
So I was in denial, I was just watching a lot of Forensic Files,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
because I guess that's what happens when you're in a bad point in your career.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
You watch intervention and murder shows because you're like, man, that person's fucked.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
But what I learned from the Forensic Files thing is that basically,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
if you really want to murder people and just never get caught.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
You got to have a boat.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
You got to have a boat.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
You just have a boat that you own and a harbormaster that is asleep at the wheel.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Yeah, and maybe I'm sure these days like the security cameras at the docks,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
if they see you getting on a boat with someone that doesn't come back,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
that's probably a big part of it now.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Excuse my burping, but yeah.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
You burped a lot like Bob Durst burped when he was showing the handwriting.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
I'm sure there's a couple of people that I have to catch up,

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
and it's just such a, you don't want to deny I'm a morsel.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Thank you.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
You're welcome.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Aw, there's a couple.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
It's those little people I do this for.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Wait for the burping.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Teaser.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Teaser.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
If I mentioned before, I was reading it as a newsweek,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
like, I don't know, 15, 20 years ago.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
And on the page like four or six or eight of newsweeks,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
there's always like a bunch of quotes of the week.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
And it was a, if I'm repeating myself in the podcast and forgive me,

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
but it was a LAPD homicide detective,

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
and they'd found a body or two buried up in Angela's National Forest.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
That was like an unsolved crime or like a cold case or whatever.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
And a reporter asked the detective,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
this like seasoned, salty old homicide detective,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
he said, do you think there's a lot of bodies buried up here?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
And he said, please, if I asked every dead body out here to stand up,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
it would look like Venice Beach.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
He's like, this is where you go bury people.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
And one of the dead bodies would have a turban and roller skates.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
One of them would be spray-painted silver.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Woo! Woo! Woo!

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
One guy would have a sandcastle with a naked lady.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
The rest of them would be drawing the other half of them.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Spencer, would you, would you, would you, okay,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
so if you killed someone on accident.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Uh-huh.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
I just, I'm going to assume if any of us killed someone on accident,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
we wouldn't try to get away with it.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
We would turn ourselves in. It was an accident.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Describe the accident, like a crime of passion or you accidentally...

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
That's not an accident.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Like, you got angry and pushed somebody and they fell over,

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
hit their head on a table and cut themselves open and bled to death.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
The accident, or like, you hit them with a car by accident.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Like, you didn't see them and like...

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, I guess either of those cases.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I want to get, I want to, I want to know,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
I want to get us to a place where we killed somebody

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
and we want to try to get away with it.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Dan, this is conspiracy you're talking about.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
We want to all talk about killing somebody.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Let's pick a specific person.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
No, because obviously, you kind of bounce off of the thing.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
I mean, if I were somehow, you know,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
indirectly, like, responsible for someone's death,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I would immediately go, I would think to myself,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
well, one thing's for sure, doing anything other than the honest,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
confessional, like, immediate turn myself in thing

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
is just going to get me in trouble.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But I'm trying to think of like,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
if I'm really in a place where I'm like, fuck man,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I'm going to get away with this murder.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
If I cross the line, I know for me,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
because you watch these things, you watch these shows,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
and you watch people in interrogation rooms,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
I think you have to be a certain kind of crazy

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
to get away with lying about it.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You have to be so cold in some way

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
that I don't think I could actually get away with dissembling about it.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
I think that I would have to turn myself in

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
because I would never, ever get away with lying.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
And I'm a professional liar.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I'm an actor. That's all we do for a living.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I don't think I could pull it off.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I would never be able to.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
All that stuff, like the time and date stuff,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
like all the cops ask you where were you then

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
and where were you now, and all that stuff.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I can't even get that stuff straight, like, in reality.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
So I know if I killed somebody,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
then I'd have to create this timeline.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
That's the mistake, I think, right there. You don't do that.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
If your story's down pat, I think a regular human being

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
doesn't know what they had for dinner last night

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
and doesn't know where they were.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah, but you have to forget that you killed somebody.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
You have to, like, leave that out of your, like, natural pattern.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
There has to be this big block of, like,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
not knowing a bunch of stuff.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
So you have to fabricate stuff to fill that.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Okay, so you don't have a boat. You drive a Prius.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
It's hard to get somebody into the back of your Prius.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
A little of the city.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Yeah.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Spencer, you seem to have given us some idle thoughts.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
What do you think?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah, I mean, well, it all depends, right?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
What are you, is it a crime of passion?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Are you planning this?

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Do you have, like, a Rube Goldberg setup in your study?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Well, can we just say...

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Why don't you pick one?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Let's say it's second degree. It's not first degree.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's a second degree homicide.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Well, you've got to go, you know, you just do the old...

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
No, I read about recently

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
you could cook down a pack of cigarettes

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
into a nicotine paste,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
put it on a doorknob,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
and people touch it.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Nicotine goes into their bodies and kills them.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
What?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Try one of those, maybe.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I don't know.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
It was in an old, you know, military handbook, supposedly.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Kill someone with a pack of cigarettes.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I've heard it on forensic files or date lines

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
of people trying to nicotine poison people.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I never heard the doorknob.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
They probably read that thing.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's so volatile that you can touch it and it goes through your skin,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
and not much nicotine does you in?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, well, I mean, it's a lot of nicotine.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I mean, if you took all of the nicotine

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
in a pack of cigarettes at once,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
you'd be in bad shape.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
It's like, thank you for smoking, you know,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I'm asking about, like,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
just take my word for it.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
You're in a situation where

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
there's a body on the floor of your home

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
and you

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
turning yourself in,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
you've decided it's not an option.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Well, I'd hope there's no blood everywhere.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Well, I mean,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I'll leave it.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Let's say there's no blood.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
But there is a 200-pound human being.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
You just see he got a breaking bad that shit,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
you know, with the...

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
the plastic tub and the acid.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
You could get fucking acid, man.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
You could get acid a Home Depot.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
But then there's purchase...

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
there's records of these cameras.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Are you in Home Depot buying that shit?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
You know, you find a hobo...

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Hobo's talk, Spencer.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Hobos don't talk to nobody.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Well, hobos talk,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
but if you watch Empire,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
hobos only talk in cryptic, like, Egyptian riddles.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
They're like threshold guardians

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
for police.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
The one-eyed jack

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
crows at midnight.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Well, that's why it depends.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I mean, I'd hope if you were going to murder someone,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
you put in the due diligence to, you know,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
go cruising around parking lots

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
until you find parking lot without security cameras,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
and then you cruise around

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
and find a Home Depot without cameras,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
and then you go in and you use cash only

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
to buy muriatic acid.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I mean, we're talking about getting that way

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
with murder here. It's not just, oh, I killed someone.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Let me go find out the nearest Home Depot.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
No, but now we're talking about first degree.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
You thought about this before you killed the person.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
We're talking about, oh, shit, I got a dead body.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I haven't scouted out every

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
camera-less Home Depot.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Well, it's a bad move to just randomly kill someone.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Well, you guys are going back and forth, though.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
We finally got him to start talking

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
about how to get rid of the body.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Let's not distract him.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I want to know how to find a Home Depot

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
with no security cameras. This is where we start

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
to get into lawsuit territory.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
It's all for educational purposes.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Anyone acting on this is not

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
doing anything we condone.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Okay, that's out of the way.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I mean, you wouldn't be able to know.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
There's security cameras everywhere.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
You know, you say that, but when we were in Texas,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I was finding awfully lots of

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
areas with no security cameras.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
So I think it's doable.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I mean, maybe not in Cittiesburg,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Los Angeles.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Where are you going to go get muriatic acid

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
without a camera pointed right at your face

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
10 times? I mean, a lot of places.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I don't know. Ace Hardware

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
on High Street, for instance, maybe.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I don't know.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, so you're going to go acid in the tub.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Yeah, I mean, there's different ways to do it.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I mean, well, maybe

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
acid in the tub, or you do the little

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
like what the Mexican warlords are doing,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
where you just burn them in like gas

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
in an oil drum, you know,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
something like that.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
That's fucking cold, man.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Well, you've got to get away with it.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That's the whole point. If you're not going to do it,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
just go to the police.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
We're always talking, we're always worried about handguns.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
We're worried about nuclear power.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
We're worried about the environment.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
We're worried about all these things that we think are ticking down

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
to midnight.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Relatively,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
at some point, someone might

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
invent just like a

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
disintegration ray

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
that you can just point at shit

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
and make disappear.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
The entire justice system

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
is based on the fundamental

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
unspoken assumption that

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
you have to do certain things to cover up a crime.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
What if people

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
start to figure out, like something that gets invented

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
that's like, oh, this handy-dandy

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
little doozy doodle?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
It disintegrates matter.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It turns it back into atoms and

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
we're like, yay, garbage is going to go away.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
But then, meanwhile, it's like,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
yay, habeas corpus

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
is impossible.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
If you can trace a firearm,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
you should be able to trace the disintegration ray

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
way better.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You need some heavy bureaucracy.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I don't know, man.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I don't know if the founding fathers would have wanted that.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I think that

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
it's just pretty clear.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
We can't even clone people, though.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
If a disintegration ray shows up,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
you can believe there's going to be some moratoriums

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
or something.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Yeah, no. We're going to be alarmed about it,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
but I'm saying it's going to be a catastrophic thing.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
We've had firearms, which are basically

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
just like a

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
screwdriver that can

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
throw baby screwdrivers at something.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
It's like...

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
It's just a tool. It just happens to be

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
a very dangerous tool.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's designed to put

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
holes in people, which tends to kill them.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And that's a big deal,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
and that's been around for 300 or more years

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
and we're still trying to figure it out,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
but there was a day when that shit got invented.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
No, I take that back.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
There wasn't a day when that shit got invented,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
and it was back when we were pretty barbaric

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
as a people anyway.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
The first guns were just like

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
extra-fast arrows.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Why deal with the length of an arrow

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
when you can shorten it down to an arrowlet?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Now with smoke.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
But

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
next Wednesday, someone at MIT

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
could go, hey, I invented a wand

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
that you tap your dog with and it disappears.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Probably not. Probably not.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
It probably requires more

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
the difficulty that I'm thinking.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I think you can do the science, like the conservation of energy

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
and stuff like that. It would be hard to just eliminate something completely.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I mean, don't worry about that.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
That's not really...

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
That's all I worry about.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Oh, by the way, I got to meet

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
and be on stage with Professor Brian Cox,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
the Infinite Monkey Cage,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
a physicist from CERN,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
from the Large Hadron Collider.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
And we were talking, and I was telling him

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
my ghost stories and my 9-11 dream,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
and he proved

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
that ghosts can't exist

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
because of the second law of

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
thermodynamics, and that...

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Which is no ghosts.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
More or less.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And then that my dream,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
my one and only panic attack

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
at the exact moment

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
that the second plane hit

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
the building, was simply

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
a non-zero sum coincidence.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It was just simply like,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
he goes, how many dreams do you have a night?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
How many do you remember as it loads?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And he goes, it's statistically

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
inevitable that they resemble

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
things that happen.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
It's a number larger than zero.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
It's never a zero.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And in a way that made me feel like

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I was kind of liberating.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
What do you think about the end of the universe?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And he said it's just going to cool off

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and it's just going to hit a uniform, cool temperature

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and then that will be that.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
So there's a million versions of us.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
There's infinite versions of us,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
but there's only one version of this.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
There's only one version of what's happening right now.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And we get one shot at it,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and when it's over, that's the end of it.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And I thought that's kind of lovable.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's going to cool off into what?

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Into a cool room temperature.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
A cool room temperature.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Space will have a

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
very low cold temperature

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and that will be that.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Even black holes will die.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Everything will die.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I'm not going to die.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Your scientist friend forgot about one thing.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
The power of rock and roll.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Rock and roll.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Rock and roll.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Rock and roll is here to stay.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
That was so fucking rock, man.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
That was so rock it was rap.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
You can't cool that off.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
That doesn't matter how much entropy

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
there is in the universe.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
That's something my gut tells me.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Which speaks louder than a lot of voices.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
Just ask the press.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
His prodigious

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
fucking fat

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
inner tube of a gut

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
ripples as he

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
explains that

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
he's

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
the victim of...

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
You don't have the rippling kind of gut.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
You have that kind of ex-football coach.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Very firm.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
It would sound like a watermelon.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Give me a thump on mic.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Put it on mic.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
It's not a jiggler.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It's a thumper.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
It looks like a thumper.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Yeah, it's nice.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
It doesn't jiggle.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It just resonates like a tom-tom.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
It's like a sea otter.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
It's for breaking open clams.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Because I swim on my back.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I don't like to go into the pool,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
but when I do I like to float on my back.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
And then my belly

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
is just above water.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
It gets red.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Are you very buoyant when you're in the pool?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Are you super buoyant?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
My torso is buoyant.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
My legs sink. I can never do the full float thing.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Well, my legs kind of...

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
They bend at the knees down underneath me.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
But this baby...

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
It's like...

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
You know...

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
How many...

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I was trying to think of...

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
How many masonry blocks do you think I would have to tie to you

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
when I drop you

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
just off of Catalina Island?

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I don't know. Just one.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Oh, no, it's more than that, baby.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
It's more than that.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
You're a five-blocker all the way.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Let me make sure I didn't put

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
anything else in my pad.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
One more week.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I got one more week of this craziness.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I should be obviously working right now,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
but I made a commitment a long time ago

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
to keep doing this show, even if it ruins community.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
We're...

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
You're supposed to be shooting the finale tomorrow. There's no script.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
But luckily,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I'm so far behind schedule

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
that they do have a bunch of stuff they need to still shoot

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
in the last episode. So I'm like,

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
well, tomorrow, Schrab was tweeting at me.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
He started up with the... Is he directing it?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Yeah. So he's Schrabbing out.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
He tweeted at me.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
What's my episode about?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Like on Twitter to call me out.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
That's not Schrabbing. That's just a worried director.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
That's a professional thing.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
What am I shooting tomorrow morning?

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
If you delivered the script and then he was like,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
but what am I shooting tomorrow?

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
That'd be Schrabbing.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
What's the show called?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Has there been an episode

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
so far that was delivered on time yet?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Like, haven't you always been kind of under the...

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah, no. Not in terms of...

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
No, no.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I mean, in terms of giving it to Yahoo,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
so they could put it on the line.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Yeah, they've all been on time.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
But not like a table read.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
No, nothing has been on time since the beginning.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Nothing.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
We started on schedule

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
and then we did a table read of the first episode

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and everyone was like,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
yeah, that's great.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Here's our nine notes.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Pretty heavy duty notes

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
because I looked at the episode

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
and I was like, this is a piece of shit.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
That's why everyone has all these notes and this is garbage.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I spent the next three weeks

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
which are supposed to be spent doing the next three episodes,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
rewriting the first episode.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I really liked that episode. That was great.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And then you're just behind schedule forever.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
You're just behind schedule forever.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
What was the whole order? How many episodes?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
13.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
And so you're on the homestretch?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah, one more. Tomorrow is the first of the last five days.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And so you made an agreement with yourself

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
that you would do what in a week? Just be done.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
You would have it written?

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
No, he made an agreement that he'd let

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Harmontown ruin community.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I wasn't going to cancel shows at Meltdown

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
because I get it right.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
That's going to be the case every week

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
or whatever.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
This is two and a half hours out of you.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Yeah, exactly. You could spend this researching.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
How much Minecraft have you played this week?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
How many hours of Minecraft?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I pack it in where I can.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I don't know.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I don't know.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I don't know.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Ballpark it.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I can't ballpark it. I don't know.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
You just can't say because Yahoo is listening right now.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
No, it's not. I don't play it instead of working.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I play it whenever I possibly can.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
So I have no idea what that number is.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Like, I work...

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Whenever you possibly couldn't be working.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
What?

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Like, you're saying that

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
you're using some sort of free time

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
when you can't be working.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Yes, yes. So I send pages

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
down to the set and I'm like,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
okay, it's going to take like three hours to shoot that.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
So then I'm like,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
yeah, Minecraft.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
And then they're like, they're almost done shooting.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
What happens in the next scene?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And I'm like, oh, fuck.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Annie kisses Abba.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
That'll keep them going.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Minecraft!

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
You sure it's like Tootsie.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Yeah, but it's turning out fine.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
That's great. Tootsie's a good movie.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
No.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Tootsie's a good movie.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Tootsie's a good movie.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
It's one crazy hospital.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
No, it's not...

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
It's too hard and painful to explain.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
How are you holding up physically and mentally?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Look at me.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Mentally, I'm fine.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
How would variety describe your physical state?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
But it's one more week.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
You know, it was really nice.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
People liked the first two episodes.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
They tweeted nice things.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
So that lifted me up and made me extra nervous

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
about the rest of them.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
We could pull through.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
There's a couple in the middle.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
But then again, I thought this about the first two.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
There's still a couple in the middle.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm like, well, let's not pat ourselves

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
with the back just yet.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Because I don't remember what was going on.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
There was something about...

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
There's some episodes that are just like,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I did it on a chicken.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
It gets...

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
There's some shit

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
that happened in the middle

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
where I was trying to catch up

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
by going like, okay, just...

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
The line producers are like, yeah,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
but what do they shoot tomorrow?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I'm like, look, just calm down.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Give me a bullwhip and a chicken.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I tried to bluff them

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
and act like I have a plan.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
All I need is Annie and a bullwhip and a chicken

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
and a room painted blue.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It's a big deal, but it's not.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
That's very showbiz, man.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
This should be pretty good.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
If it's not, you know, fire me.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Are you going to follow through with that?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Camera takes.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Dan Harmon dares Yahoo to fire him.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
That woman that we met

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
with the spinal deterioration

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
in Austin, are you going to

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
put her in there?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I have put Annie in touch

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
with the wardrobe department.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
You put her physically in touch with them?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I go, yeah.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Twitterly in touch.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
The wardrobe supervisor has a Twitter account

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
and I hooked him up on there

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
and then I explained to the department

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
the situation, which is that

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Annie has to be dressed a certain way

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
for the finale.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And they don't care about that?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Yeah, they don't care.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I love it.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I don't care about the show.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
What's the bullwhip chicken episode about?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Can you spoil the bullwhip chicken scene for us?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
No, I was using placeholders.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Because if I said the real things, it would be like,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
really?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I can't say the real things.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Those are placeholders for actual things

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
that you made up as placeholders.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Well, kind of, yeah.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Yeah.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
You like improvisation

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
except you're not supposed to be.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Yeah, I'm not supposed to be making things up.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And then the thing that kills me

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
is that everyone underneath me who's like,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
well, if you would give me a script with two days' notice,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I'd be able to make the best

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
chicken for you.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Or the best bullwhip.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
But then they get it an hour

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
before we shoot and they're like, okay,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I guess I'll have

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
my cousin run out

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
and buy a shitty bullwhip

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
on Hollywood Boulevard.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I make them look bad.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
That's why I'm fired.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Fire myself.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Nobody left to fire me.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Harmon, you're fired.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
So do you feel like you owe it to us

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
or as a story structure person

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
to get fired a third time off a show?

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Yeah, but it should be me.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That's the third act. I fire myself.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Harmon, you're fired.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I'm fired? I quit.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
No, you're fired.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Turns out, that's the same thing.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Yeah.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Firing yourself is quitting.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Because we need somebody

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
who's got to be responsible.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
And I've come to terms with the fact

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
that I'm just too talented to do anything.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Do you foresee in the future

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
like you working for a big major network

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
and major corporation again?

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I foresee myself under a bridge

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
eating Aaron's leg.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Because I tricked her into

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
killing the weakest dog while I came up behind her

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
with a bowling pin

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
in Philadelphia

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
or somewhere where he read in the paper

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
has no taxes.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I'm picking crystal meth out of my beard

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
and making videos

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
about fucking Rupert Murdoch.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
If you want to know how I picture my future

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
follow

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Evie Quaid

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
on Twitter.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
How many followers are they up to?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It's got to be less than 400.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
That's amazing to me. No one else is interested in this.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
It really is.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I posted a link on the Twitter

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
and I was like, this is the most important thing

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
in the world right now.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
But this is Randy Quaid and his wife, right?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Yeah, they're fucking the dogs going off.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
It's pretty great.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
They continue to issue communiques and things like that.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
In Canada, Hillary Clinton took their passport.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
What do you call it?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
They're not ex-patriots.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
They're D-patriots or something.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
They're fugitives.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Yeah, they can't get back into America

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
and they're sitting there.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
It's a story that makes you...

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
I think incredibly in love

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
is just like the greatest love story in the world.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
They better be.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I feel like they do have a very healthy relationship

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
as relationships go.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I mean, I don't know

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
of making YouTube videos of having sex

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
with your wife wearing a mask

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
of Robert Murdoch

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
is necessarily a healthy relationship practice.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Unless you're both smiling

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
while you're doing it.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
He's not like, you're wearing it wrong

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
and she's not like, you're fucking me wrong.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
They're both on the same page.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
That's hard.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I'll take that over.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
If you're wearing a mask

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
while you're fucking,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
do you think you're smiling while you're wearing that?

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Or do you let the mask do the talking?

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
When I worked at Disneyland...

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I asked all the Goofies

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
all the Mickey's, all the Minis,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
all the chips and dales.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
People smile, you're smiling for a picture.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Are you smiling behind the mask?

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
No, you do that for the first couple of days.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
It takes days.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
When you hear a smile, we smile.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
At the end of the day, your face hurts,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
you're tired and you're hot and you're sweaty

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
and you're in pain and the nuts.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
There's nothing to smile about.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
After a while, this will not work for the podcast,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
but on camera, you ask any Goofy,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
if you ever meet anybody that's a costume character

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
at a major theme park,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
ask them what they look like when they're taking photos

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
and it's just...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
It's super,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
super joyless and sad.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I would like to think that she is smiling

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
while wearing the Rupert Murdoch mask.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Also, why is there a Rupert Murdoch mask?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Because it's my first question.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
You've got to watch this movie, man.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
They made it, clearly, out of some magazine.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Oh, it's not like they didn't get a nice latex.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I think they printed it.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Off the internet.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
It's a piece of paper with eyes cut out.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
There's a lot of stuff about it that if you want to let it,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
it will make you very sad.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
However,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
as a person who's going to couples therapy

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
and is in love with his wife

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and learning how the delicate art

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
of making a relationship work

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
between two people,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
these guys have been...

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
They've been a healthy couple

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
for like 20 years.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
This word, healthy, I don't think it follows.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I mean, just because they aren't mad at each other

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
doesn't make it a healthy relationship.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It's just...

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Well, that's true, but Bonnie and Clyde had fights

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
between bank robberies,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
but their bank robbery didn't make them unhealthy.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
If Bonnie and Clyde robbed your bank

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
as they were leaving...

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
You lost that guy.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
That was you, madam, or sir, or whatever that was.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
If Bonnie and Clyde robbed your bank...

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I think the bank robbery is the first sign of unhealthiness.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
How can we not make this differentiation here?

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
If a couple murders your dog

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
and they're both like,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
sweetie, get the tail.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
It's not healthy.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And then the cops go,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
could you describe the couple that murdered your dog?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I'd be like, well, they were very healthy.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Like, they got along.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
They were on the same team.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Some said they got along so well

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
that they murdered my dog.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Yeah, and I would want the cops to catch this couple.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I'd be like, I hope you give them the electric chair.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
And because I want you to catch them,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I want you to take this unique descriptor with you

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
so you recognize them at Grand Central Station.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
They get along great.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
They're very much in love.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Don't bother

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
wasting your time.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Wouldn't a healthy spouse

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
deter the other one from

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
killing a dog and robbing a bank?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I don't know.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
As a healthy

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
spouse or

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
significant other,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
you would want the person to not do things that would land you in jail?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Also, if Copernicus's wife had been like,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
why don't you stop redesigning

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
the solar system?

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Is that a healthy

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
relationship?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You're equating redesigning the solar system

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
with killing your dog?

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Yes, I am.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
People are cutting up bodies and all this stuff.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Again, I hate to beat a dead horse,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
but

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
or take the horse.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
But again,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
there's people in the courtroom that go like,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
and then you know what he did?

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
He took a saw

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and he cut the arm off

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
and then he cut the body open

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and he took the liver and he put it in a bag

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and I'm like, sounds like a doctor!

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I've been saying this for years!

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
These people need to be watched!

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
What are you saying?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
The suspect is not a doctor.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
The doctors are all suspects because they know how to cut people off.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I'm saying, as I've said before,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
the difference between a doctor and a serial killer

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
is a support system.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It's just money, that's it.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
But doctors don't cut up alive or

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
they don't kill a person.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Yes, they do! They totally don't cut up alive people.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I cut them, I got them!

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
A doctor doesn't go to Home Depot

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
and buy a bow saw.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
They don't have to!

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
They're supported, they're licensed.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
The guy, the murderer, wouldn't have done it

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
if he had a gun, but that's when the cops are like,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I can't believe he did that.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I'm like, man, what would you do if you weren't a cop

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
and you had to get rid of a body?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
A cop can just dump them off on the curb

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
and call his cop friend.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I got another one.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I'm Southern because I'm a cop.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
That's my cop character.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I wasn't going to weigh in exactly

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
where your lawyer character was from.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I'm just saying.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Little Jewish, little Jewish.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Wait, who was Jewish?

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
The lawyer was Jewish?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Your lawyer character, little...

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Little Jewish.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
He took the arm and he's like, okay, all right.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
This is a reason to do things to people.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
This is the way to treat a mother?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
All right, I'll cop to that.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Okay, I let the magma

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
of pre-existing anti-Semitism,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
of which we are all apart,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
you're more guilty than I am in that sense.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
And it seeped up into my lawyer,

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
my improvised lawyer character.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
He was a little Jewish.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
A little stereotypical Jewish.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You went a little Lucas on that one.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Little George Lucas.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
On my planet, there is much honor

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
and noodles

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
and no silverware.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Can you figure out

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
what I'm talking about?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
We are much diso...

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
9-Eleven!

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Did we come to a consensus on what we do?

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
The wish thing was stupid, right?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
9-Eleven song!

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
9-Eleven song?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
It's a song.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
It's a song?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So far, so good with the 9-Eleven song.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
You had Trent Reznor when I did it.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Oh, boy.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Let's do a 9-Eleven song,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and let's try this one.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Is this too on the nose?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Should I go a little weirder with it?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That sounds like an actual 9-Eleven song.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Oh, it's one of those dirge-type songs.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Hardy har har.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Alright. Okay, here we go.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Terrarism ain't no good.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yo, I just try to do mine

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I try to do me in mind

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
To the break of time

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I got the up to do

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
The diggle to the dawn

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Fucked your mama on the front lawn

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I look up in the air

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I see nations under attack

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yo, you gotta take that back

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
With just 250 million people

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Trying to cool it out

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You gotta get the hell out

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
El Cater

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
A shamer

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Good enough

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Thank you

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
This guy's really good

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Thank you

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I don't care what you think

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Thank you

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I've always had you back

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I know

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
He's a good person

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
9-Eleven

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Don't do it again

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It's not that funny

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's time to feel bad

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I want to know more about this

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
R&B singer guy

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Oh, baby

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Coming on strong

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
My name is Alexander

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Alexander

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Du-Flicky

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Alexander Du-Flicky and I

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Used to go to college back in 99

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We were on the same team

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Rowing, right?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Rowing, yeah

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Used to row down the river

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Beat those Harvard boats

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We beat Stanford too

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
What's Stanford there?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I think they're in California

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I don't know

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We were so far ahead

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
All I knew was I row

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I kept rowin' and I kept them all rowin'

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Put your paddles in the water

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Go as fast as you know when goin'

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Past the bell tower

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Oops, song ran out

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Sorry, that's good

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Thank you

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
So you met Alexander Du-Flicky

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
in the rowing team

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Was that an instant friendship?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Were you guys friends from the beginning?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
There was a lot of contention at first

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Because of course, just like best friends

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
did you ever see Monsters, Inc. too?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The way that they met

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
They were not good friends to begin with

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's the way you are

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
in the postquel

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
You better believe in the...

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Were you reunited with Alexander Du-Flicky?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Was he a successful R&B singer?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Or did you rescue him from obscurity?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
No, neither of us were

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
even hooked into the R&B scene

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But it's like my passion for rowing

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
as it started to

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
stop equating with

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
the ability

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
to outrow people

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
physically

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
What we noticed is that

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Alexander's ability to call me forward

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
bring the best out of me

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
spiritually, psychically

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It lent itself more to the

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
hip-hop scene than to rowing

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
where we were losing consistently

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
If you listen to my lyrics

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
what you'll find in my heart is that

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm not that good a rapper

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
that's not rowing a boat

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and Alexander's always been

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
good at telling me what to do

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and that I'm doing good

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
He's an encourager

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
What's it called? The coxswain?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
The coxswain?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Was he the coxswain?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Yeah, he was the coxswain

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
They call him the coxswain?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Swain?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Coxswain

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Coxswain

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's called coxswain

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Boatswain is both

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
a gun

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
a gun soul as a gunnel

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
They shorten things

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I'm surprised that you wouldn't know

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
all this rowing

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
terminology

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I was a scholarship student personally

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I was there trying to do my best

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
turned my family around

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
What was the school again? I'm sorry

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
This was University of Georgia

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
What was your major again?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Notre Dame

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
You majored in Notre Dame?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Yeah

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Because they have a pretty famous

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Notre Dame study of school there

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
at the University of Georgia

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
You learn all about it

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I couldn't get into Notre Dame originally

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and then this program came up and said

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
you could get a scholarship

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
My family, none of them ever went to school

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
so the pressure was on

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I had to do right, represent my family

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
we had dealt with in the street

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
had to turn it around

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Did you graduate knowing a lot about Notre Dame?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I dropped out eventually

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
the studies were more difficult

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
than rapping

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and rowing

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I was spending most of my time rowing

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and they asked me not to

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
study more about Notre Dame

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
but I was also

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
very focused on rowing

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and I said please let me focus on this

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and they said okay

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and I was like okay

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and then I started to get more interested in rapping

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
because the rowing was not working out

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Was there a big fall and that was you and Alexander

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
at some point?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You know we are

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Alexander Duflicki, I didn't realize that you were here

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
with us

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Every friendship has its ups and downs

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Yeah, but you know we do

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
alright

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It was one town

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
we went through a phase where we were living together

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
in the same apartment

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
one bedroom

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
we only had two plates for the macaroni

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
he would leave his

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
out, he leave his macaroni

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
plate out on the coffee table

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah, but you would too

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yeah, but two times two

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
don't make up for what you do

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
That's true

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You guys do seem to complement each other pretty well

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yeah, well you get through

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
something like that and it's like

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
you're good

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
in a healthy relationship with you guys

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Yeah, well you got married

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
No, that was my salvation

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
That mean my better half

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Don't want this to ever stop

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
We have the worst podcast

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Why are you here?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Why are there nine cameras?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Why are people allowed to spend money

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and buy us a script

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
It is terrible, it's awful

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's so irresponsible

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Or is it so responsible

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
that it seems irresponsible

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I don't want to be in another one

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I just keep thinking

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I keep watching it through Lance Bang's eyes

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
because he's here tonight and I brought his kids

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
and he's funny

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
and smart and interesting

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
and lives in Portland and stuff

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
and I can't imagine

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
him enjoying this

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
but I'm not fishing for

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
he probably left a long time ago

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
after I talked about it

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Who is this? I'm sorry, I don't know

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
He's just a friend of ours

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I would call him Comedy Royalty

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
He's a comedy director

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
He's done a lot of music video

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
work

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
All the people who you would be

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Lance Lee?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
He's probably shy also

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
even if he was here

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Did he come up to you?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Just chat for a second

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
He's an older soul than me

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Discretion is the better part of Valor

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I think

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
He's with his kids

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
in the comic book store explaining

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
to them why dismemberment

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
is not funny

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and they're like we know why it's not funny

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
we were in the same show you were

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
That point was made

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
very clear

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
He has wonderful kids

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
He has a very healthy relationship with them

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
a little brunch with them in Portland

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
He's out killing dogs and robbing banks

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It's one of those dads

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
one of those families that makes you want to have kids right away

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
because it's like they're perfectly cool

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and they're honest with their kids

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
nobody's like

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
that weird

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
toxin

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's not like the spoiled LA parents

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
you see where it's like the parent is the best friend

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
of the kid and it's not that either

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
when you witness

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
transparency in a family

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
it's always inspiring

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I could do this, I could try this

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
That's where the word parent comes from

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Parent from transparency

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
That's Latin

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Look it up

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Spencer

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Oh

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Speaking of horrible things

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Hey

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'll take it from here I guess

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
What's burning your crop

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Give us Spencer's

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Spencer

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
What's burning your boots lately

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
What's chappin' your hide

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
What's a B in your bonnet

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
A P in your blanket

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
A bat in my bill free

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Thank you

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Do you have a bugbear

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
that's currently haunting you right now?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
No

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
So I listen to NPR

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I think it's great, I think everyone should listen to NPR

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
But sometimes

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
you listen to these stories

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
and they try and put too cute of a button

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
on the end of their stories

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I can't think of any good examples

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
like

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I don't know

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
There'd be a story about

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
a goose who lost his sight

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
and they'd end the story with

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
No, it was about a goose

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and then they restored it's sight

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
because chemicals got thrown on it

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But then they'd be like

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But for one goose in Portland

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
he will have a gander

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I'm Nancy Klein

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
in PR news

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And it's like so many

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
they're trying so hard

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I can't think of any good ones

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That one's pretty hard to avoid

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
If you're writing that story

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
you have to

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
You listen to NPR and they're like

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Okay, that's NPR

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Thanks for your money

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It's public

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
We'll be right back

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
after a word from

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
these strangers

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
The John Q and James L. White Foundation

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Don't forget, but sometimes it's just

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
out and out

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
but they just make it sound NPR-ish

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
but it's like getting really close to

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Radio Lab is made possible

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
by some of money

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
by the Colgate Toothpaste

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
people

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Colgate Toothpaste is an interesting new way

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
of brushing your teeth

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
This is a commercial for a thing

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It's true

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
The public radio

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
failed in America

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
They had to cave

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
to corporate interests

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
There should be

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
a very small portion

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
of what we call a lot of

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
collective revenue

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
You could keep a lot of cool shit going

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
That's my feeling about that

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
In Britain, you know, the government pays

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
for all that shit

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
They have crazy awesome radio stations out there

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Other TV shows are kind of like

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Well, not all their TV shows

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
We fetishize British TV because we see

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
the really, really interesting cool shit

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
that breaks on our shores

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Talking to Brian Cox, I only saw the shows

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
to the physicists, Brian

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
We see Wonders of the Universe

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
But there's way better shows that don't air out here

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
We just don't get them

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Their TV sounds so much more interesting

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
if you're into science shows

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The flip side of it is

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
if you're going to admire anything about America

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
you've got to admire our commitment

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
to capitalism because

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
the money

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
drives so many interesting things

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Everything that's heightened is so heightened

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
because of money

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The idea that you could have a show like Cheers

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
The idea that television could be the cornerstone

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
of all culture, which is neither good nor bad

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
but is a thing

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
The idea of the television show lasting 10 years

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
and being a part of your life and your children's life

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
That is the opposite side of the coin

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
of like in Europe

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
When they started doing TV

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
they looked at it like a

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
kind of a civic thing

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
They looked at it the way we look at cable access

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
and they're like, you should...

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Okay, everybody take turns making a TV show

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
that has something to do with keeping England better

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
and there's still some kind of

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
there's still a little bit of that juice

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
behind their TV industry

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
whereas with us it's just like

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Fuck you, man

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
What am I talking about?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Stick your head up your ass more

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I got invited to go

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
to the LHC

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the Large Hadron Collider and go check it out

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
which I'm very excited about

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
They're turning it on soon

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
so I won't be able to see it while it's on

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I'm going to die

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That thing's going to make a dragon

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I sat there and said, explain to me

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I know a little bit about the Higgs Bosun

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
and what not like

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
like explaining the Higgs thing and he just

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
he broke it down for me and started talking

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
space-time and like explaining space-time to me

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and I have no idea what he was talking about

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
but it was fascinating and I felt very cool

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
and then he went outside and there were stars out

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
and I go, what's that?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I wish I could do his accent because he's very charming

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
kind of a soft Manchester accent

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and he's like, that's Jupiter

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I go, why don't planets twinkle?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and he explained why

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I was like, I'm going to make out with this guy

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
right now

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I'm going to start gazing with Professor Cox

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
because it's very good

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
he's so charming

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
you know

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I hit a guy on the show, one of the guests

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I played the theme song that Eric Eile had written

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and I got to play music on the live

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
like the radio broadcast

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
and one of the guests was

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
the cat that created Chichurama

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
his name I forget

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and he's into science

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and I won't remember if you say it

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
you won't remember Matt Crainig's name?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
no no

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
one of the producers on it I guess

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
someone said David X Cohen

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I won't remember his name

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
but he was very good and they were talking about

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
science stuff

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
they would make up science

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
and change science

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
it's a cartoon

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
we have to get to the planet, it's 500 light years away

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
you realize it's traveling the speed of light

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
it would still take 500 years to get to the guest

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
but we sped up the speed of light

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
and the crowd kind of chuckled

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
and then Brian Cox was like

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
no no that's wrong, you want to slow down the speed of light

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
the speed of light we're 30 miles an hour we could all get there

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and the crowd cheered

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
everybody goes

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
yeah fucking science

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I still doesn't make any sense to me

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I love that

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
if you want to see some science fiction

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
that really makes sense you should check out this

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
movie I just saw

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
called The Astronaut in the Bookcase

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
colon interstellar

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
it's based on a novel

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
The Astronaut in the Bookcase by Sapphire

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
it's like

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
it's a goodie

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
not the sequel to

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
2001

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
have I sat

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
through people in space

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Professor Cox said he liked it because the science was all right

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I'm sure it was, it seemed pretty right to me

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Jesus Christ man

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
not good, you didn't dig it

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I was not into it

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I've not seen it so I can't

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Spencer have you seen interstellar?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
No, is that that Christopher Nolan guy?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Dan doesn't seem to like his films

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
No I do, I do

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I'm actually confident enough to say

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
okay come on I'm letting that one over the plate

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
like

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
if Tarantino or the Coen brothers made a movie

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
that was like

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I think Christopher Nolan's talent and value

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
was dull or dreary

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
this is the story

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
we're finding out time and time again that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
who desperately needs

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
a quality screenplay to be placed in his hands

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
before he starts shooting

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
because otherwise it's going to be like

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
you're going to be watching something that's really beautiful

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
and you're going to

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
two hours through it be like

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
why?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Did you like her?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I loved her

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I just didn't want to

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
well that's a great, I mean if you read that script

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
you'd be like riveted the entire time you're reading the script

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
that's a sci-fi movie

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
if you read the script for interstellar you would not be a page turner

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
you would be like

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
it's 20 pages and he's still

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
what do you mean it looks

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
like a smeared bookcase

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
oh it's back to

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
oh he's the reason why

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
the watch?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
fuck you

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
dumb

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I mean I

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I imagine that would be astounding if when those

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
things were happening in the first two acts I wasn't constantly going

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
what?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
then it would be

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
amazing that it all came back to the thing

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
that made you go what the fuck

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
what?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
some guy will be walking down the street

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
man sure is hard living on earth

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and the apocalypse is all dry

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
gooboo gooboo gooboo

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
wow

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
what the hell?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
what was that?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
some kind of silver entity

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
just said gooboo gooboo gooboo

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and then flew into the sun

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
three hours later

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
whoa I'm changing

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
something

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
a gooboo gooboo gooboo gooboo

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
whoa there I am

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
that's me over there

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
a gooboo gooboo gooboo

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
oh I get it

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
oh wow

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
that's why the movie was

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
stupid

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
cause of me

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
bye

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
credits

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
it's the way that she used

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
let's bring out DeMorge Brown

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
to play some shadowruns shall we

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
DeMorge are you here?

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I heard the wrong goddamn song

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
DeMorge are you with us?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
oh yeah

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
DeMorge Brown

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
what's up DeMorge?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
how are you doing? I'm doing alright

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I like your green sleeves

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
you know

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I'm a Dartmouth guy so I wear Dartmouth green

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
how's your arsenal doing?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Arsenal won yesterday they did very well

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
not so good in the international stuff

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
but good in the international stuff

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
you guys are into March Madness

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
this is English soccer teams

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
DeMorge might be the biggest Arsenal fan

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I've ever met in my life

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I know a couple hard

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
what's the cat's name

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
it's kind of like a Filipino looking dude

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
it goes to the drawing room but he knows you

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
that's his name I can never remember

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
he knows you he loves Arsenal

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I'm scared right now

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
apparently he knows you quite well

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
but I can't think of his name

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
he's always standing over your shoulder

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
with a pair of scissors

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
and a marathon

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
number on a bloody

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
tank top

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and he's screaming something

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
a warning about something

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
but I can't and then

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I'll find out

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
what's on your mind

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
what's new in your life DeMorge

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
let's catch up with you for a moment

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
alright that was good

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
let's play shadow

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I don't want to say this though

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
is there a new trend in retail

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
that people have to greet you

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
if you're not looking at them

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
they have to say hi how are you sir

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
welcome thank you for being here

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I've heard that complaint

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
with increasing frequency

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I ignore people

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
like this is an alarming rate

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
now it's like three or four people

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I'll just go shopping for something

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I know what I'm looking for I know where it is

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I go in I go find it

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I'll walk in the door and there'll be this voice behind me

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
it's kind of like how are you doing sir

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
and I would turn around and look

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
but it's so faint that it's a

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I'm hearing more stories about confrontations

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
with these people because they're hired

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
and they do a certain thing

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and it's not just old people at a Walmart anymore

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
it's now it's like a 35 year old person

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
who's been told that they have a certain

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
activity log

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and they're starting to get aggressive

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Aaron told me

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I'm not joking either

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
and when I leave

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
why do you have to say be well sir

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
or some weird shit

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
but they're like

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
actually Aaron was telling me a slightly different story

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
because at that pet pet pet store

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
is it Petco?

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Pet Smart

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
there's people that they'll just

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
let wander around the aisles that are like

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
shilling a specific brand of cat food

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
or dog food

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
and those people like

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
they're really aggressive and weird

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
and like Aaron got stalked by one

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
oh and there was a container store lady

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
that Aaron had another story about this

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
obviously Aaron is the person of the couple

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
who goes out into the world

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and she brings these stories back

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
and in France or like here in Italy

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
people say bonjourno

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
everyone you pass says good day

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and in France, good day

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
everyone says bonjour, wherever you go

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
and it's just a thing, you say bonjour

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
and you walk into a store

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
you say bonjour to the person that works there

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
when you leave you say merci and that's it

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
but it's kind of rude to not do that

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
which is fine because that's just kind of par for the chorus

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
but I was in a hotel in San Antonio, Texas

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
where I wanted to kill people out of kindness

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
because it was like every 10 steps

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
you couldn't go 10 steps in that hotel

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
with every fucking person

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
bidding you good day and it's like that's too much

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
and most people don't want to talk to other people

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
yeah also like you said

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
if I'm looking forward, if I'm going places

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
like if it's eye contact

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
if it's eye contact and I see you

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
and we pass each other you go hey, howdy

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
fine, deal

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
but you keep hearing it over your shoulder

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
right Aaron, you cannot manufacture happiness

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
that's what I'm telling you

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I keep hitting the goddamn thing

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
well can I tell you two sad things before

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
we start Shadowrun

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
that are

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
like Aaron's not here, she's going to take care of Nigel

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
our grief dog

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
your grief dog?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
yeah

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
and then Curtis is not here

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
which is tied to

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
and I haven't even checked up on it

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
since he told me about it

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I asked him if he was coming to the show

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
last week we were in Austin

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
and he

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
was like I'm so

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
conflicted because it's like well why

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
create the awareness of something that you're

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
blissfully unaware of if you're unaware of it

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
but at the same time it almost feels

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
strange with our new friend he's like going

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
through this like dark dark thing

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
like we were talking to Curtis he hosts that show

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
with Bobby Carradine

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
and Bobby Carradine was just in this terrible

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
terrible car accident

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
the last I looked he's in

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
critical condition which I assumed

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I googled his name

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and unfortunately and I never

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
if I could have clicked an off button

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
an option I would not

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
have seen the car

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
you know

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I saw the car

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
that he crashed in

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and it can't possibly be

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
good

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
you might call it critical I think someone already

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
took care of that job

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
so Curtis is like

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
you know that's a good friend of his

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
and he was like he wanted to come

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
and hang out with us but his life is

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
like topsy-turvy like he's

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
going through a little we just met him

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
and just made good friends with him really fast

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
but it's just as he's going through this

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
like intensely dark

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
tunnel so I hope he comes back

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and on the off chance he's listening

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
our thoughts and prayers are with

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
you and your folks and

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
that's it I don't know

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I just wanted to say

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
is Bobby right?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
is he ever's father ever carried him?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I don't know

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
she's a friend

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
she's great too

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
very talented family

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
so random

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
it's like

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
whatever

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
good job Dan you did it

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
whatever you were saying

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
let's reach out to Curtis

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I don't know about you guys

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I fell in love with that guy

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
it was amazing

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
thank you

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
maybe that's why

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
it was enough for me to work with him on

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
acceptable TV that one morning

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
it was enough

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I was really taken with him at that point

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
because he was so professionally came in

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
and he was like

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
maybe that's why I brought it up is because

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I feel so much affection for the guy

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
and I felt like the audience did too

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
and I wanted them to know

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
that he actually

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
felt the exact same way

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
it wasn't like a bit

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
like it was with LeVar Burton

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
who just

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
shot through our world like a meteor

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and charmed us and

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
is apparently on to bigger and better things

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
but

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Curtis really really enjoys

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
his time here and wants to come back

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and stuff and is just going through

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
yeah he hugged me one time or a couple times actually

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
and it made me feel quite special

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
alright it's a rare person

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
2012 dude

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
that's a really good Curtis Arstow

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
wow

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
he didn't think so

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I think he did

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I think he did

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
well he said he didn't

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
alright Spencer do you want to

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
get us up to speed?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
so Aaron's not here

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and then we're shot so

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
is there a talent you want to recruit or

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
we could recruit a talent

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
should we get a mercy what's her name

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Mercy O'Donnell

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
what's your name right there in front

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
pardon Celia

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
welcome to the stage Celia is going to play Mercy O'Donnell

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
for us

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
you're breaking my heart

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
you're shaking my confidence

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
daily

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
oh Celia

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
go on to the next one

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I'm down on my knees

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I'm begging you please to go

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
he's begging you to come home he's done

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
thank you for loving the afternoon

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I was like go on to the next one

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
we're allowed to sing

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
almost an entire salmon and garfunkel song

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
but I have to play crap

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
unlicensed

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I sang another thing earlier

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I'm sure we'll get flagged on YouTube

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I'm counting on me being off-key

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I don't think their algorithm

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
bots will detect it

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Celia?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
you're from LA?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
what high school did you go to?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I went to Milken it was a Jewish high school

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
why did you say that was such a distaste?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I don't know

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
well her teachers are constantly singing about how they wanted to fuck her

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I'm in college now though

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I'm in Brown in Rhode Island

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
oh good for you

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
cognitive neuroscience

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
what does that mean

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
precisely?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
it's like between psych

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and like neuro

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
so you're not a neurologist

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
but you know about the neurology aspects

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
like the psychology

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
of knowing what the brain is doing

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
is it dream science?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
is it dream science?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
no it's more like

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
they go over memory

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and then what the actual neuro parts

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
of what neurons are doing

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
it almost sounds like you have an out

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
no matter what

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
if somebody comes to you with a problem

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
and you can go like that's cognitive

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
and then someone else comes here

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
and you're like that's just the way your brain is

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
real quick

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
what's the A genesis of the corpus callosum?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I don't know

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
the O genesis

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
the A genesis of the corpus callosum

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I don't know what A genesis is

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I know what the corpus callosum is

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
what's the corpus callosum?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
the part in your brain that separates the hemispheres

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
the A genesis means it never forms

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
you get like a lot of crazy

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
autistic

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
or like rain men

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
people that they sever the corpus callosum

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
for people with seizures

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
they have to sever the corpus callosum

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
because it helps their seizures

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
and you like

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
they get like those types of symptoms

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
alright you passed, silly everybody

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
alright Spencer

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
we have a very smart

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
gal up on stage right now

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
that guy that had that rod blow up

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
through his brain

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I saw that in a show about

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
he was like

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
the old west times or something

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
he had like a thing blow up through his

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Phineas cage

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and his

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I think they separated his left and right brain

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I don't know that's when they started learning about the left brain

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
he can pulse this from crossing over

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I know if you have a daughter

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
you and Erin want to name her Paloma

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
but if you have a boy can it please be Phineas

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Erin will ultimately

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
you know she can

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
or A genesis

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
A genesis

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I don't know if any of my kid A genesis

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
alright Spencer

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
get us up to speed please

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
alright

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
this Harmontown recap was written

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
oh brother

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
oh sorry oh god I'm sorry

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I thought that you were

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and by Warby Parker

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
no okay

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
last time on shadow run

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
wait who was it written by I'm sorry you were trying to give them credit

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I was trying

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
let's be safe

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
let's be safe and he sure wrote it

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
for the last one too

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
okay

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
last time on shadow run time

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Mercy O'Donnell and Jim Nightblade

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
through deception and cunning

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
had pinpointed Baldwin Brown

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
they found him sleeping in the basement

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
of his associate Jesse Yellowman

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
upon receiving a shocking awakening

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Brown and Yellowman activated their drone

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
which unleashed a rain of gunfire

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Mercy gracefully

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
dove out of the way as Nightblade shot down

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
the belligerent machine with practice ease

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
our heroes then attempted

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
to subdue the drug dealing duo

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
with some old fashioned grappling

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
at a critical moment Eve Liberty

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
barged in to save the day with a powerful

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
stun bolt to Yellowman's chest

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
the gang successfully apprehended

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Brown handed him over to the Johnson

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and received their well-earned payment

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
what will they do

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
with the 5,000 new yen a piece

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
what mission will they accept next

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
what does life hold

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
for our brave heroes find out

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
on an all-new Harmontown Shadow Run Time

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Thank you

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I love everybody forever

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
you're welcome

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
okay

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
so do you guys know what's happening

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
yeah we just successfully completed a thing

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
we just got paid

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
where are we physically standing right now

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
let's say you're back at Hank's last

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
stand the bar

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
this is where we met weird Dave

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
what was his name perfect Frank

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
what?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
what was our original new Darrell

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
no

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
all of those names were the best name

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
no

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
this is cool Dennis

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
cool Dennis

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
but he said

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
you know to meet with Teddy

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Teddy's your boy he's the fixer

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
so with my permission

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I don't want to control everything

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
but if we're cutting to a bar

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I wouldn't mind being the guy

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
that just finished breaking the billiard

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
ball

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
like on the cut

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
and then I continue my sentence

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
by going like

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I don't know something just doesn't add up

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I always wanted to be that guy

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
the billiard guy

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
every time someone does

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
a billiard shot in a bar I always think

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
oh man there's a new scene starting

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
now Nightblade

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I know that you suffer from severe alcoholism

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
you're not going to get fucked up again in case we need you are you

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I would say the odds are pretty good in that favor

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
because I say this

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I have a mild addiction too

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I go off in the corner and I meet my drug dealer

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
and I buy some Psyche

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
what's your drug dealer's name

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Ray Ray

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
are you explaining that to us

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
or are you saying an action that you're doing

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I don't mind telling you

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
it's kind of a mild recreational addiction

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
to this drug called Psyche

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
which kind of makes my intuition and logic go up

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
it's like mushrooms

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
but it's good for shamans and stuff

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
well uh

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
you're a young kid

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I don't think you should do that shit

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I could stop whenever I want

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
you know it's just

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
listen kid

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I drink to forget mistakes I made

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
when I was your age

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
you get a chance to not make them

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I take another shot I don't even know

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
if I'm solids or stripes

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
solids

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
did we get another assignment

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
from our person

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
because we just caught Balvin Brown

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
it's true I haven't yet

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Mercy why don't you go talk to Teddy our fixer

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
and make some more

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
some more new yin

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
did you say we haven't caught Balvin Brown

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
we haven't gotten a new

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
we haven't gotten one

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
hold on a second

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
don't you think

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
do you guys ever feel kind of bad

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
about stuff

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
we got that guy and

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
he didn't really do anything wrong

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I'm not that guy I shouldn't be playing that role

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I don't care

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
okay I don't care

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
nightblade how drunk are you

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I never mind I forgot

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I shouldn't care I don't care

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
look we broke a lot of eggs

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
back there we killed a few people

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
we certainly stunned a lot of people

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
with electricity

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
but I guess that's the life we've chosen

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I never feel good about it

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
going forward I'm going to start

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
taking strides to be non-lethal

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
any way that I can

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
just wondering on these streets

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
that I was looking to medicate themselves

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
to be

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
better than lifechip

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
is not going to be a Pandora's box

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I mean if it was just

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
a short mission I'm fine

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I don't need to make a bigger deal out of it

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
are you saying that this might come back to bite us in the ass

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'm just picking at it

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
like a kitten picks it up

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
not

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I'm never going to untie it

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'm just a thicker piece of thread

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
than usual

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm sorry I forgot

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I've said too much I'm alone

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I would say that it's in my estimation

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
that this is the way that we work

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
that it is all

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
life is a mission now

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
we're on the dark side

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
so there is nothing but short missions

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and long missions and the longer mission

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
is to stay alive

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I would say let him play with his balls

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
in the meantime I perhaps

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
some of this

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
went

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
and I will

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
purchase

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
indulge my own

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
active soft

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
addiction

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
and learn some new accents

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
other ways to be other things to do

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
we've kind of grown to love your

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
kind of Norwegian accent

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
but you did not even notice

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
that I changed and became

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
more precise with my accent

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
over time

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
what is it now?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
well now it is a skill soft

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
an active soft

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
because there was some problem before

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
people saying give the words Germanic

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
and Herzog-ish

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
so what I've done is I have

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
suspended over a bulb

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
and over a pool of water

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
listening to Vangelis

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
again but this time listening to

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
soil festivities

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
which I think is one of his best albums

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
learned a more

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
academic

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
by according to Hoyle

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Norwegian accent

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
one from Oslo

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
it sounds fantastic I love it

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I gotta say I really love hanging out with you guys

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
when we're not kicking ass

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
it's just fun to shoot pool and get high

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
and talk shit

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
a point taken though

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
before that

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
they don't call them picnic runs

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
you guys can I

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
can I tell you a little story about

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I had that stored up for a while

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
can I tell you

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
when I was a little girl and I was living out in the woods

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
with the Salish Indians because I had to flee

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
my family and live out there

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
and learn the shamanistic ways

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
there's a story that means a lot to me

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
that I think would probably help

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
maybe mean something to you guys too

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
it's a young

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
young Indian scout and he's walking around

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
and he sees a bear

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
and

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
the bear

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
is looking for salmon and he

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
the salmon keep jumping by him and the bear is like

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I can't catch any salmon

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
and the salmon keep jumping by him

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I can't catch any salmon

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
the young Indian scout walks up and says oh my god

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
a talking bear

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
it's a little Salish comedy for you

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
it's probably

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
probably get a new mission

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Mercy why don't you go talk to Teddy and see

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
if we got anything new on the burner

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Teddy we just got a lot of money from you

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
we'd like some more do you have any

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
do you have any hookups

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
yeah maybe

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I gotta tell you guys

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I've been watching your progress

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
you got on

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
security films

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
there's footage of you

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
people know you're out there

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
it's no good I tried to do what I can

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
to kind of clear your traces

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
you know don't worry about it

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
no need to pay me or anything but

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
you gotta watch out man you had police on your tail

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
this is how people die

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
this is how shouter runners get killed

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
what would it cost for you to

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
perhaps stumble across some sort of

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
mission for us

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
you know I don't know

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
all whatever

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I'll find

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I'll see what I can do

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
as soon as he finishes

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
speaking as if on cue

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
you see an older elvish man

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
scramble into the bar

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
the bar you're all in in fact

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
not just any bar

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
he's wearing a fine Italian suit

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
although it's wrinkled in must as is the man's

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
hair and he's clutching a pistol

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
he looks like he hasn't slept in days

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I would like to perhaps activate

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
at the same time my

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
ability to

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
with combat sense and also

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
to detect enemies to see if

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
this one is perhaps a problem

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
you use your skill to

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
detect enemies and I

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
say the horde guard and also to induce laughter

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I said the horde guard

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
you sounded really Norwegian right now

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
this is really good

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I thought at that point he sounded more like

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Anatolian than he's ever sounded

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm also the same person I was

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
when I started

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
he's insecure

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I've never had the home

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
so what's up with this

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
all this guy's got a pistol in his hand

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
he's waving a pistol around

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
he doesn't appear to be an enemy though

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
he's not an enemy

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
he's just a pal

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
waving around a pistol

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
perhaps the two of you

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
will continue to talk

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and I will keep an eye on this

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
intruder

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
maybe I better go talk to him

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
what do you do, what do you say

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
hey buddy

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I hold out my

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
hands in that way that will allow my Aries predator

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
to come out of my robot arm

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
and shoot him

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
but in the meantime I'm just like

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
just sexy and

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
cool

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
and friendly and I'm like

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
hey man, I remember having a night like this

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I solved it with a game of bill here

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
you can start the next scene

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I just want to cut to a new scene now

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
he's just like so anyways

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
you need a shadow

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000

my son jelly, I fell into

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
a bad way, the spagoolies

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
they're making me pay a protection fee

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
to keep the street gangs off of my hoop

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
but they raised the rates too high

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
and I couldn't pay

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
the spagoolies are holding my dear boy

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
jelly hostage until I pay up

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
and if I don't pay back in a week

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
they're gonna start reproducing that digits

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I can't offer you much

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
but I can give you $2,000

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
a piece and an eternal debt of gratitude

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
if you find my son

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I take it all back, this was an awesome podcast

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
$2,000 a piece, mercy, ask for more

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
$5,000

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
we got $5,000 last time

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I mean if I could pay

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
my son, I'd tell you gotta help me please

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
I don't know

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
is that a possibility you could pay more

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
than $2,000

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I really like your shoes

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I mean if that's what it takes

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I give you my shoes, they made

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
by my mama

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
and then one when we finish the job

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
you know that's very reasonable

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
she drives a hard bargain

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
we really are

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
it's like not good guys

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I mean come on, it's not brain surgery

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
oh wait it is

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
what do you say

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
so tell me more

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
about these spagullis

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
oh Arturo Spagulli

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
he's a big dick

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
he's running his mouth

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
but you can find him all over the place

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I bet if you talk to him he'll be able to find my son

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
but he's real stupid

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
wait wait Arturo Spagulli has your son

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
or he's

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I don't know if he has my son but I bet he knows someone who knows some

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
but you know the Spagullis

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
have got your son holding him ransom for ransom right now

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
oh yeah the Spagullis

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
so we're going to talk to one of the Spagullis

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
to get him back

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I'd recommend Arturo

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Arturo Spagulli, what's your connection with Arturo

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
what?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
what's your connection with Arturo

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
he's a big dick

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
what do you do again?

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
what's your name?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
my name's Ryan Dervish

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
and your son is named Jelly Dervish

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
yeah

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I'm a medicine man

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
what sort of medicine do you practice?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
the right kinds

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
do you have any active softs for sale?

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
is that kind of medicine?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I didn't quite hear that

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
do you have any active softs for sale?

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
that kind of medicine?

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
oh no I do not

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
hey can you heal me up a bit?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I've taken some stun damage lately over the last few hours

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
can you heal me up a bit?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
oh you know I got this

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
zip

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
zip

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
zip

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
he pulls

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
he pulls a patch out of his pants

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
and he gives it to you

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I put it on my

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
chest

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
you feel

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
it's like a thousand

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
coffees running through your veins

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
you're all back to Norman

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
back to Norman

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I'm good, I'm a little jinky

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
but I'm good

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
it's fun though no?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
sure you got a photograph of your kid?

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
oh yeah

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
let's have it

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
here it is, it's right off his Instagram

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
it's still around

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
you can't tell that's timeless

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I don't know who took him

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
but my best guess is that Arturo knows a thing or two

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
and look, if you end up putting some bodies in the ground

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
make it look like someone else did the job

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I'll pay some extra

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
to keep those shitheads off my back for a while

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
and to leave my name out of this

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
which is

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Ryan Dervish

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
find Arturo, find what he knows

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I feel like it's going to be easy to keep his name out of this

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I'm never going to remember it

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Mr. Dervish, as a fellow

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
elf and a fellow medicine woman

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
you got my word, we're going to get your son back

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
no questions asked

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
can I use my power to mind probe

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
just to make sure the landscape is as he describes it

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I'm feeling like

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
my mind's being probed right now

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
what's it going on?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
well it's just a sort of

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
what we call the normal vetting process

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
before we start

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
he starts screaming and you can read into his thoughts

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
it's very uncomfortable for him

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
but you see great shame in his business

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
you see his business has not been doing so well

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
he can't pay the mobs so much

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
it's really a tough time for this guy's life

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
and he's at his wit's end

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
he's just carrying a pistol around in public

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I feel bad now

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
so we let him off the hook and then I say

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
look, I apologize but we have to cover

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
our bottoms

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
that was an excruciating experience

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
use your own medicine

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
hmm, okay

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
doctor, use your own medicine

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
hordegaard, can you use

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
your tech sense and find out

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
to get a lead on Arturo Spaguli

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
well I have

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
contact, his name is Ritz

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
he's a mafia also contact

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
but anyway I could contact him

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
and possibly find some sort of

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
what he's got, what he knows

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
yeah, yeah, you could definitely

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
call up Ritz on his com link

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
that's what I'm trying to do

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
alright, beep boop boop

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
but I have AT&T

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
and so the connection is spotty

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
alright, you get him

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
this is Ritz

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
let's hordegaard here

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
just

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
one question

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
if you heard of Arturo

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
the big dick

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
or mafia also big dick

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
where we might find him

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
if he in fact exist

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
and if he possibly is

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
hording a child

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I don't know, there's a lot of

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
is he like egghead or he tries to draw his name into things a lot

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
like that's excellence

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
the brand is the brand sir

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
there's a lot of Arturo's

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
in the underworld

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
who you talking about?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Arturo Spaguli

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
what?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Spaguli

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
oh yeah I know Arturo Spaguli

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
why didn't you just say so

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
because I assumed we had a relationship

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
but I was of course wrong

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
for the last time

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I'm just saying there's at least seven or eight

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
big movers and shakers named Arturo

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
in the criminal underground

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
so to focus and to be precise

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
this Spaguli

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
have you information?

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
oh yeah, you know that guy

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
he loves his fast food

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
all those Spaguli's

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
they're not hot in all these

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
nice bars or Italian restaurants

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
they just keep it simple

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
they hang out at the burger tyrant

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
this burger tyrant

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
is simply a restaurant

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
where they hang out

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
or is it more of a secure compound

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
it's really just more of a chain restaurant

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
which burger tyrant is it?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
the one on Capitol Hill

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
or is it the one down on Pioneer Square

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
which one is it?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
oh it's on Guadalupe

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
on Guadalupe

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
