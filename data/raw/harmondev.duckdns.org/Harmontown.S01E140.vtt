{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nThe Hollywood, California, Meltdown, Comics, NerdMelt, Theater, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:25.000\nPlease welcome to the stage, please welcome to the stage, please welcome to the stage the\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:33.000\nmajor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Yeah, yeah, I put my hat on my hand. I took your mama too bad.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:40.000\nI started wrapping her shoulders because she was tense. I said, mama you're tense. She said, tense rhymes with tense.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:46.000\nI said, go in the back and sleep in the tents. There were two tents that she had to choose from.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:51.000\nThere was a wigwam on the side and she wasn't. Alright, okay, don't.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:56.000\nIt was a noble experiment. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:01.000\nI felt there was a chance that something magical was about to happen. Yeah, no, I over-thought it. I over-thought it.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nI was like, wow, there's a lot of people, it's doing good on Netflix, that movie, I guess there's a lot of people,\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:10.000\nmaybe they think that the wrapping will be better in person. Sorry, I started, there's a feedback loop.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:15.000\nI think the wrapping is just as good in person as just listening to it.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:24.000\nFuck you, Acknowledged. No, I would like to continue to experiment with the idea of me coming up with something to do.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:29.000\nRight. Like that. Okay. So don't give up on me. Do you want to start over? Should we start over?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nNo, no, well, I mean... Is that too inorganic? How about this, go out and enter from the street. Walk out there.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nThat's actually not about it. Go out the side door.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:46.000\nSpend a moment, Dan, in the alley. Pretend like you're in Brooklyn or something. Pretend you're some hard-ass street.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:51.000\nAlright, Harmon has left the room. The door is shut. Okay, everybody, let's hide.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nAlright.\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:01.000\nAlright, everybody. Take two. Nerd Melt comics. Meltdown Theater. Hollywood, California.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:07.000\nShit's about to get real. Harmontown is once again put the same second time and the same night in session.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:15.000\nEntering from a completely different door.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:23.000\nFrom the alleyway. Not the cosy and comfortable green room, but the mean streets of the alley.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:39.000\nTo get up and need a drive. Man, Harmon. Money, drugs, got it, drugs, drugs. Money, drugs, Brooklyn, not drugs.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:50.000\nI said, bitch, please, you're never gonna get in law school doing that. She took her hat down, pulled off her hat, and there was a little robot under her skin.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:59.000\nHe said, oh shit, you're moving in. You're gonna come inside and see what controls her. Oh shit, she's a giant robot.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nThat was a little boy.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:14.000\nThat was 75% better than the first one. I think you harness something angry and wonderful.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:23.000\nI turned into DMX out there, I think. Yeah, for me, that's what Brooklyn's about.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:29.000\nI was like a dog, like a fighting dog. I wish we had four more rooms for you to enter from.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:36.000\nLike if I came down on a cotton ball moon like Katy Perry, would I have a hit on my hands?\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nCan you enter out of the bathroom and try it again?\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:46.000\nDo you think it's diminishing returns now? Yeah, probably. Also, you're wildly out of breath right now.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:53.000\nI moved from, yeah, one of the secrets of the start of the show is that I'm right there off camera.\n\n03:53.000 --> 04:03.000\nIn the show, I thought to minimize the exercise, but that was twice as far as I've walked for a long time.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:09.000\nSo I'm not gonna, I'm sorry, right away, just in case everybody panics and goes like, oh shit, I'm behind it.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:16.000\nI don't want this major thing spoiled, but I just finished watching all of this Jinx thing with the Jinx guy.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:24.000\nWith our Bobby Durst? Yeah. Who, you know, that blinking thing, that is very Adam Goldberg.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:31.000\nAnybody who's actually talked to Adam Goldberg? Scott Robinson? What's your name out there?\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:38.000\nJohn Robinson. I thought for sure that was there. I thought Adam Goldberg had a new identity.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:45.000\nI was like, that is, I think how this starts. It's just association. He just starts going like, aren't we all pretzels?\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:52.000\nAnd then it's like, who gives a shit? But yeah, that guy, if you've ever had a conversation.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nDo you guys know what we're talking about, the Bob Durst? He possibly killed 19 people?\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:03.000\nYou should definitely check it out. It's not like, I mean, the serial thing was amazing and fun to take part in.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:08.000\nAfter a while, the reason to take part in it was because you would be the only person that didn't know what anyone else was talking about.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:15.000\nBut this really is, even if you were on a desert island, by the time you get to the end, it really is quite, it's pretty incredible.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:22.000\nIt's like, the serial thing is kind of like, it's sort of like, the circumstances are the same at the end as at the beginning.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:28.000\nLike, they're just reopening a confusing murder and you leave confused in serial.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:34.000\nThis is, you do not, it's fucking crazy, like the last five minutes are amazing.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nSo that's all I'll say about the actual content. You don't have to worry about spoilers or anything.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:46.000\nBut I did, while we were watching, and I got into the strangest debate with Aaron, because they kept on, you know, like,\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:54.000\nhe was on trial at a certain point for murdering a guy and they thought it was a slam dunk case because he dismembered him.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nAnd so, and it was like, and they kept, they kept stressing that.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nThey're like, well, this is the, this is the body that he dismembered, so it's open and shut.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nAnd they kept going like, how, I don't understand what these, and Aaron and I got into this really not intense argument,\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nbut it was like, just really, we weren't seeing each other side of it.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:17.000\nIt was like, if I ever need or want to kill someone, let's say need.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:24.000\nLike, I'm gonna do everything I can to do it right.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:30.000\nI'm gonna follow through. I assume.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nLike, I would have decided that someone needed to die.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nSo this would be a first degree premeditated murder we're talking about?\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nYeah, or even, I guess, if, yeah, well, yeah.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nOr if the shit went down, you went, fuck it, this guy has to go, bang,\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nand now you gotta deal with the aftermath of that.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:53.000\nYeah, well, maybe that's the big clincher, is it's like, okay, this guy, but it's like, who, if you, yeah.\n\n06:53.000 --> 07:01.000\nLet's say it's the latter. Let's say that you had a reason to hide something so big, like another murder, for instance.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:07.000\nAnd you told the guy too much, and he was like, I'm gonna blackmail you.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:11.000\nAnd I'm like, well, please don't do that, because you might not like what happens.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nAnd then he'd be like, are you threatening me?\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nAnd I'd be like, are you blackmailing me?\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nAre you gonna murder me?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nAre you gonna blackmail me?\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nWell, let's say.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nBecause the last person didn't blackmail me.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nYou know, so you're in trouble here.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nShe was about to. She was about to blackmail me.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nYeah, she was about to. Are you blackmailing me?\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nI'm about to.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nOkay, so you're neck and neck with a dead person.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nAll right. Hey, let's call the whole thing up.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nI forget we ever, let's just go to Chili's, have lunch.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nOkay, great. So here's the thing.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nI will know if you're blackmailing me, if you say to me...\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nLook, I'll just say this. I'll say this.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nI'm a little, I'm behind in the rent.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nI could use 50,000, let's say 50,000 dollars fell out of the sky right now.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nI would know exactly what to do with that.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:01.000\nAs opposed to walking down maybe to the local police department\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nand saying that your name is Dan Park.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nIs that what you're gonna do? You're gonna talk to the police?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nOkay, yes, I'm gonna do it.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nGive me 50,000 dollars and it won't do it.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nAll right.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nI guess I'm, am I blackmailing you now? It's blackmail.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nLet me get my checkbook.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nIs it in the drawer with the gun?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nI don't, I don't have a gun drawer.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nI have a checkbook drawer.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:31.000\nMy gun is in it because it's a, it's something, it's another thing you use sometimes in an emergency.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nOh, shit.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nWait, wait, you, oh shit, the first one you missed is like when you got me.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nSon of a bitch.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nShould I ask for less money?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nAll right, so now you got a dead guy on the floor of your apartment.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nBleeding all over the joint.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nYou're dressed as a woman.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nYou've been going under a fake name.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nNow you got some fucking fancy footwork to do.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nYeah.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nNow what's, what's your first move?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nI would, I would do what he did.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nGo buy a bossa and start chopping fuckers up?\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nI think.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:10.000\nNow, now, now, now Aaron's point is that no, no normal human being could get past that point.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nAnd my point is that, yeah, that's why so many people get caught.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:20.000\nLike the people that, like the people that get away with murder are the people that go that extra mile.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nPost murder.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nLike they do horrible things.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nLike you've taken a human life and now that person is meat.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:32.000\nAnd now, so that's why I'm confused as in the courtroom where they try to, they bring that out like,\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nand then you know what he did?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nHe tried, he tried to keep doing it.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nHe tried to finish.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nHe tried to get away with it.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nYeah.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:44.000\nHe took the head and he put it in a bowling bag and he threw it on the roof.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nNot once, but twice.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nHe missed the first time.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nI was like, yeah, it's hard, he had a difficult time.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nHe's trying to get away.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nHe didn't walk in here.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:57.000\nIt wasn't, he tried, he killed the guy and he wanted to get away with it.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nRight.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:04.000\nI just said that whole group, because it's like, you're talking about a jury of people who are all supposed to sit there and think,\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:10.000\noh yeah, that is fucked up because if I killed someone and they're all running a simulation of them killing someone,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nit's like, you're already fucked up people.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:17.000\nOh, I wouldn't be able to do this or that, like tell me more about where your lines are,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:23.000\nlike around the horrible primatological act of extinguishing another primate.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:28.000\nLike, oh, what are your pet peeves right after the life goes out of their eyes?\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:34.000\nThese people that kill someone normally, the neurotypical murderer,\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:39.000\nthe heteronormative mainstream murderer,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:46.000\nthe 1%, not 99%, I don't know, okay, I want you to fire that.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nWhat do they do?\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nThey kill somebody kind of in a fit of a rage.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nThey don't do it for any reason.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nAnd then they go, oh no, oh god, I can't believe I did that.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nWell, what, so I'm supposed to make that person senator and send the other person to the electric chair?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nThe other person is playing chess with life.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:10.000\nWho's this crazy person that can kill their best friend because they're in a bad mood and then be like, whoops.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nThat person has the hearts and minds of the jury.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nLike, yeah, that's dangerous to me.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:22.000\nThe idea is we take it easy on people who confess to a crime as opposed to people who elaborately try to hide the fact.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:27.000\nIt's like, what better way to keep getting away with murder than to never murder someone again?\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:32.000\nIsn't there a kind of self-policing to a successful murderer?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nWell, apparently not.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nThat's why we're so fascinated with this guy, though.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nI think this guy is a little cuckoo pants.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nOh no, he's not even good at getting away with it or anything.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:46.000\nWhat he's good at is having loads of money and having really good defense attorneys.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nAnd that's the thing.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nThe prosecution absolutely screwed that one.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:56.000\nThe guy chopped somebody up into a hundred pieces and threw him in a trash bag and threw him in the water and he floated.\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:02.000\nYou always hear these stories about this whole myth of, oh, these rich people are going to afford these rich lawyers.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nBut it's not like they're Clarence Darrow doing these tricks.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:10.000\nWhenever you see the real life incarnation of it, it's always just like the people who work for the prosecution are totally incompetent.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nYou can't believe or understand what they're doing.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nThe jury is totally confused.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nA rational, normal person with an IQ over 100 stands up and represents the killer and says,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:27.000\nguys, let's get down to brass tacks. Here's the rules. If you didn't find a head, you can't say.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nThat's the rules, sorry.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nIf you can't find a head, you're right.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nNo, it's right there in the rules.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nAnd then everyone's like, you slick talking city lawyer.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nYou dersewitch, you got him.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nYou got him.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nNo, you're fucking city employees.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nThey're idiots.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nThey're like these weird people.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nWhat was their name?\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nMarsha Clark, whoever, the OJ prosecution.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nThey fucking blew it. They blew it.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nAnd they had our Frank Kato on the stand.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nHe didn't know anything and they made a big jump out of him and he was better for the defense.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:00.000\nHe ended up being worse for the prosecution because he didn't know anything.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nHe told me the whole story.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nI hung out with Kato the first time I met him.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nI met him at the Playboy mansion.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nAs one does.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nAnd we hung out and then we went to Mel's Diner.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:17.000\nIs it Mel's Diner? Maybe it was back when it was Ben Franks.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nWe sat there and he told me the whole story.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:27.000\nHe told me the whole day of OJ knocks on his door and says, hey, Kato, if you're going to use the hot tub,\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nyou got to turn it off afterwards.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nAnd Kato's like, I always turn it off.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nKato's really smart.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nHe remembers everything.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:40.000\nHe sounds like a surfer kind of bimbo he did, but he's quite intelligent and super thoughtful.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nAnd he's like, when I use it, I always turn it off.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nAnd I knew that I had.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nAnd it was like, also, he never came down to the back house to speak to me.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nSo then he goes, OK, I'm sorry.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nI thought I did.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nBut next time you do that, you got to do that.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nBut he looked kind of out of sorts and weird.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nSo then he goes away.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nAnd then a while later, he comes back and says, hey, do you have change for 100?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nAnd at that point, Kato's like, I just feel like he just wanted to prove.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nLooking back on it, he was just trying to prove I was here.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nAnd he was like, no, I don't have change for 100.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:15.000\nHe's broke-ass Kato Kato living in the back house of his place because he's good with kids.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nAnd Nicole Simpson loved Kato.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nAnd he was great with the children.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nO.J. was never there.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nSo O.J. also, he felt like was having him followed.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:31.000\nLike Kato felt like he was pretty sure that he was being watched because he was super jealous of Nicole who was cheating on him.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:36.000\nAnd then he said, no, I don't have change for 100.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:41.000\nHe's like, well, I want to go to McDonald's and get some food, which sounds like alibi, like establishing.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nAnd Kato doesn't know this because he doesn't know a murder is about to happen or two murders.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nAnd he goes, I'll just go with you.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nI'm hungry, too.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:54.000\nAnd O.J. goes, oh, oh, go, go, go, go, go.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nOkay, okay, okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd they go in the car and they order the food and he eats the food and he eats it in the drive, like the drive-thru.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:05.000\nThey order the food in the drive-thru and instantly eats his fillet of fish or a quarter pound or whatever he gets.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nAt the drive-thru, which nobody has ever done.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:15.000\nNobody eats it before you leave the parking lot.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nGuilty, sir.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:24.000\nSo he tells me the whole story and then a friend of his, he's good friends with Nicole.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:29.000\nShe nearly gets decapitated and his other guy, the waiter, wasn't it Ron Goldman, he gets murdered.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:34.000\nSo as he's telling the story at this diner at 4 a.m., a guy comes over to the table and goes,\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:40.000\nhey, Kato, Kato, hey, yo, man, I have an old school OJ Simpson jersey signed by him.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nHow much do you think that's worth?\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nAnd Kato's like, I don't know, man.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, asshole.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd the guy walked away, I go, you just told me about your friend being nearly decapitated.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.000\nAnd then some guy walks up and says, how much is an OJ thing and called you an asshole?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nAnd he goes, it happens every day.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nOnce a day for 10 years.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nI remember back then, because people felt like he was just a party to this whole circus.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:10.000\nSo I remember back then him saying that people would drive by and yell stuff out the window.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nThat was years after, but it was like they associated him with the...\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nAll he was was a guy that happened to hear a thump on the wall.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:21.000\nAnd he was around when it happened, didn't know anything, and they made him a hostile witness.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nHe's the only guy I ever saw.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:28.000\nEven Jack Black, with the time that I would be hanging out in public with Jack Black,\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:34.000\nis probably the most famous guy I've ever been in public with at the height of their fame.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd the height of people just strangers coming up to Jack and going, are you famous?\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nAnd Jack would go, no, because if you don't, yeah.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nAnd then I'm going, yeah, you are.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd then they're like, can I get a picture with you?\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nAnd Jack going, half the time, okay, and half the time, no.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nBut then in either case, they come up later and go, keep calm, screw the rock or whatever.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nThey yell some shit at him.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:05.000\nAnd the Cato, the one time we were out, he was singing karaoke and people were just walking up,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nputting their arm around him.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nHe was like a statue.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nAnd going like, taking a picture.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:17.000\nAnd then walking away and looking at the phone and going, hilarious, like five feet away from him.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nAnd he's just like, playing with the Queen of Hearts.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:31.000\nI guess I've become a piece of furniture in a cosmic game by God.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:36.000\nIn an incredibly unique situation, he was just a celebrity for being on Trowell.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:41.000\nAlso, hilariously, had no idea what he was supposed to do, why he was even called as a witness.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd then ended up, black people hated him, black people loved him, white people hated him, white people loved him.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:51.000\nHe was on every side of every coin.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:57.000\nWhat's truly tragic about Cato is that he's one of the most likable people you'll ever fucking meet.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.000\nYou can't not like Cato Kalem, because he's such a sweetheart.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:07.000\nAnd if you ever saw him around children, you'd be like, he's...\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:11.000\nIt sounds like you're talking about a terrier or something.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nBut he is like a terrier.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:17.000\nHe has terrier-like energy, and he will entertain the world's children.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:23.000\nHe just runs around the pool all day long, and people are like, can you please just babysit my children for the whole time?\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\nWell, now you got us worried again.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nIt's not worrisome. He's not going to do anything bad.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:36.000\nI know, we're just programmed. When we hear the word children, we all think about fucking them.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nSo what's happened to us?\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:43.000\nSo what happened to you?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:49.000\nHey, you ever not brush your teeth, and then you're like leaving, and then you're like, oh shit, I didn't brush my teeth.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\nAnd then you just drink something gross, like coffee.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:58.000\nBecause you're like, well, my breath will be terrible, but then someone will think, oh, he drank coffee.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:02.000\nIt's food for thought.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nFood for nightmares.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:09.000\nIt's like too far from the toothpaste. I'll just drink some gross coffee.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:12.000\nI'll just double down on being disgusting.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:16.000\nWell, they won't go, yeah, because it's somehow worse if you have a bad breath.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:22.000\nThe bad part of your breath is your entrails.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nI had a computer teacher in high school who was awesome.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:29.000\nShe was so great, but boy, the coffee and cigarette breath combined to make something just...\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nI'm really phobic about it.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:35.000\nThat's one of many reasons why I don't make eye contact when I'm talking to people.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:41.000\nI try to look at the floor, because you get a blast of bad breath in your face.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd also, no one's going to tell you. You don't know if you have bad breath.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nNo, why would you tell anybody?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:49.000\nEvery once in a while, it happens, I'm on the receiving end of it, and I always think that poor person,\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:54.000\nbecause they don't know why I just became 10% more aloof, because it's not like anyone ever goes,\n\n19:54.000 --> 20:04.000\nyou just smell it, and then you just pull spiritually back from the whole thing.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:10.000\nYou kind of keep your head in the same place, but you just hate them, and slowly they just feel...\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nAnd that person doesn't know.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nSometimes you talk to somebody who has clinically bad breath.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:19.000\nPeople can have like, halitosis, they can have a bad thing.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:23.000\nSome people have that with their armpits, some people have that with their butts.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:27.000\nEverybody has that with their butts, by the way.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:32.000\nSo it's something to think about. Get off your high horse.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:39.000\nHashtag stinking is not a choice, and I will send $100 to the Red Cross.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:45.000\nI was in Variety. I was on the cover of Variety with Joel McHale this last week.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:54.000\nYeah, a little dream come true. I got to mark this one off my non-hack version of a bucket list.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nWas there a hilarious Variety headline with great abbreviations?\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nWell, it did say... I didn't get this for a really long time.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nIt said, it was a picture of me and Joel, and then it says,\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:11.000\nimperfect harmony...\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nWhat's not to get there?\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:19.000\nWell, because the I and the M and imperfect were in red, and then the perfect was in white.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nThat's needless.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:27.000\nFor a long time, it was like, oh, imperfect harmony would be a phrase.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nNo one really...\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nSo they were trying to italicize the M.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:36.000\nYeah, it was more like, imperfect harmony.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:40.000\nBuilding on that old chestnut, perfect harmony.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:45.000\nOkay, that's a musical term, but I mean, I don't know.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:49.000\nBut anyways, thank you for putting me on your cover.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:55.000\nI have some notes.\n\n21:55.000 --> 22:00.000\nI'm sure whoever wrote that headline will agree with me that that was not their finest hour.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:04.000\nIt sounds like a protracted meeting went on about that.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:10.000\nI just have some 19-year-old kid that has to sit in this cubicle, and he's like, Dan Harmon.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:15.000\nGod, Dan it. Dan good time.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nDon't just please the Harmon.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nMichael's Navy Harmon?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:27.000\nHarmon, yeah. Irish Delight.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:30.000\nThere's a paragraph in it that says,\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:37.000\nDan Harmon finishes his breakfast of peanut butter filled pretzels\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:46.000\nbefore hopping on his Segway, which he purchased to conserve energy, dash his own.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nThat's a good lead.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nI would continue reading that article.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:55.000\nThat's not the opener.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:59.000\nThat's how you start it. You start with that one.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:04.000\nThis is the things I have no right to complain about.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:11.000\nIf you write an article about me, here's the start of my complaint,\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:20.000\nit would seem that if you don't mention my fat gut, you get fined by some kind of press union or something.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:29.000\nThe last two, I was a Hollywood reporter, and it's his visible punch, his protruding punch, his pronounced punch,\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:41.000\nbulges from beneath his sweater as he slovenly sucks up a bowl of skittles with downing globs of frog meat.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:50.000\nA timid slave clad Leia struggles against her chains as he gurgles his desires.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:57.000\nA language only worms could understand.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:02.000\nI know the battle of the sexes is over and the men won, and we don't have anything to complain about,\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:06.000\nbut man, you just don't see that in articles about female showrunners.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:16.000\nJust physical discoverer, calf muscles, could use some work, but you don't know how much hell you'd catch.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nThey're talking about writers, not actors.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:24.000\nThat's what I'm saying. If we've described Shonda Rhimes in an article about her, do you know how much trouble you would get into\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:30.000\nclinically scrutinizing her, giving a description of her?\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:36.000\nI think that seems a bit harsh, but part of what's for sale, if someone's writing an article about you,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:43.000\nis the fact that you're willfully, you're just you, and part of that is a glass of fuck.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:48.000\nIt's what you see. Part of what's for sale here is what you're looking at, what you're picking on.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:59.000\nBig fat nerd shit. The big shitty shit face waddles into the room with a shit coming out of his face.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:03.000\nIt's going to be another hard day in the writer's room.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:08.000\nWhat do you think would have been different? Let's say, going back, same behavior, same attitudes towards authority.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nIf I looked like Steve Levitan, would it be different about the article?\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:18.000\nDo you think you would still have been fired for the same behavior if you were, like, super sexy?\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nNo.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nYou wouldn't have been fired?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nNope.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nYou don't think so? Wouldn't have been more outrage if you...\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:31.000\nI wouldn't have noticed it. If I took a shower every day and was passionate about my show, it wouldn't look like I was crazy.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:34.000\nIt would look like I was awesome.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:39.000\nThey'd be like, oh, I get it. He's like Zuckerman from college.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nZuckerman?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nHe was always mad into basketball, man.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nHe fucking got up every day, took a shower, and got fucking aggro on the court.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:52.000\nThat's just, that's harming. He's like the Zuckerman.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:57.000\nDon't people want to take down really good-looking people, too, that are in positions of power?\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:01.000\nNot the other good-looking people. That's all us ugly people, because we're looking at them on billboards.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nI want to take those guys down.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nThanks, Jeff.

We're going to be alarmed about it,\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nbut I'm saying it's going to be a catastrophic thing.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nWe've had firearms, which are basically\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\njust like a\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nscrewdriver that can\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nthrow baby screwdrivers at something.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nIt's like...\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nIt's just a tool. It just happens to be\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\na very dangerous tool.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nIt's designed to put\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nholes in people, which tends to kill them.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nAnd that's a big deal,\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nand that's been around for 300 or more years\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nand we're still trying to figure it out,\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nbut there was a day when that shit got invented.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nNo, I take that back.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nThere wasn't a day when that shit got invented,\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nand it was back when we were pretty barbaric\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nas a people anyway.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nThe first guns were just like\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nextra-fast arrows.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nWhy deal with the length of an arrow\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nwhen you can shorten it down to an arrowlet?\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nNow with smoke.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nBut\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nnext Wednesday, someone at MIT\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\ncould go, hey, I invented a wand\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nthat you tap your dog with and it disappears.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nProbably not. Probably not.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nIt probably requires more\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nthe difficulty that I'm thinking.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nI think you can do the science, like the conservation of energy\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nand stuff like that. It would be hard to just eliminate something completely.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nI mean, don't worry about that.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nThat's not really...\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nThat's all I worry about.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nOh, by the way, I got to meet\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nand be on stage with Professor Brian Cox,\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nthe Infinite Monkey Cage,\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\na physicist from CERN,\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nfrom the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nAnd we were talking, and I was telling him\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nmy ghost stories and my 9-11 dream,\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nand he proved\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nthat ghosts can't exist\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nbecause of the second law of\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nthermodynamics, and that...\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nWhich is no ghosts.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nMore or less.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nAnd then that my dream,\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nmy one and only panic attack\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nat the exact moment\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nthat the second plane hit\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nthe building, was simply\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\na non-zero sum coincidence.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nIt was just simply like,\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nhe goes, how many dreams do you have a night?\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nHow many do you remember as it loads?\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nAnd he goes, it's statistically\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\ninevitable that they resemble\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nthings that happen.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nIt's a number larger than zero.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nIt's never a zero.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nAnd in a way that made me feel like\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nI was kind of liberating.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nWhat do you think about the end of the universe?\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nAnd he said it's just going to cool off\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nand it's just going to hit a uniform, cool temperature\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nand then that will be that.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nSo there's a million versions of us.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nThere's infinite versions of us,\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nbut there's only one version of this.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nThere's only one version of what's happening right now.\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nAnd we get one shot at it,\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nand when it's over, that's the end of it.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nAnd I thought that's kind of lovable.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nIt's going to cool off into what?\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nInto a cool room temperature.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nA cool room temperature.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nSpace will have a\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nvery low cold temperature\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nand that will be that.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nEven black holes will die.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nEverything will die.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nI'm not going to die.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nYour scientist friend forgot about one thing.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nThe power of rock and roll.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nRock and roll.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nRock and roll.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nYeah.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nRock and roll is here to stay.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:37.000\nYeah.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nYeah.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nThat was so fucking rock, man.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nThat was so rock it was rap.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nYou can't cool that off.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nThat doesn't matter how much entropy\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nthere is in the universe.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nThat's something my gut tells me.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nWhich speaks louder than a lot of voices.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:03.000\nJust ask the press.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nHis prodigious\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nfucking fat\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\ninner tube of a gut\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nripples as he\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nexplains that\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nhe's\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nthe victim of...\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nYou don't have the rippling kind of gut.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nYou have that kind of ex-football coach.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nVery firm.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nIt would sound like a watermelon.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nGive me a thump on mic.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nPut it on mic.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nIt's not a jiggler.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nIt's a thumper.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nIt looks like a thumper.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nYeah, it's nice.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nIt doesn't jiggle.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nIt just resonates like a tom-tom.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nIt's like a sea otter.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nIt's for breaking open clams.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nBecause I swim on my back.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nI don't like to go into the pool,\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nbut when I do I like to float on my back.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nAnd then my belly\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nis just above water.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nIt gets red.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nAre you very buoyant when you're in the pool?\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nAre you super buoyant?\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nMy torso is buoyant.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nMy legs sink. I can never do the full float thing.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nWell, my legs kind of...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nThey bend at the knees down underneath me.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nBut this baby...\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nIt's like...\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nYou know...\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nHow many...\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nI was trying to think of...\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nHow many masonry blocks do you think I would have to tie to you\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nwhen I drop you\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\njust off of Catalina Island?\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nI don't know. Just one.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nOh, no, it's more than that, baby.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nIt's more than that.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nYou're a five-blocker all the way.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nLet me make sure I didn't put\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nanything else in my pad.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nOne more week.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nI got one more week of this craziness.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nI should be obviously working right now,\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nbut I made a commitment a long time ago\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nto keep doing this show, even if it ruins community.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nWe're...\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nYou're supposed to be shooting the finale tomorrow. There's no script.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nBut luckily,\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nI'm so far behind schedule\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nthat they do have a bunch of stuff they need to still shoot\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nin the last episode. So I'm like,\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nwell, tomorrow, Schrab was tweeting at me.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nHe started up with the... Is he directing it?\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nYeah. So he's Schrabbing out.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nHe tweeted at me.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nWhat's my episode about?\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nLike on Twitter to call me out.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nThat's not Schrabbing. That's just a worried director.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nThat's a professional thing.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nWhat am I shooting tomorrow morning?\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nIf you delivered the script and then he was like,\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nbut what am I shooting tomorrow?\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nThat'd be Schrabbing.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nWhat's the show called?\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nHas there been an episode\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nso far that was delivered on time yet?\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nLike, haven't you always been kind of under the...\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nYeah, no. Not in terms of...\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nNo, no.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nI mean, in terms of giving it to Yahoo,\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nso they could put it on the line.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nYeah, they've all been on time.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nBut not like a table read.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nNo, nothing has been on time since the beginning.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nNothing.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nWe started on schedule\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nand then we did a table read of the first episode\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nand everyone was like,\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nyeah, that's great.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nHere's our nine notes.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nPretty heavy duty notes\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nbecause I looked at the episode\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nand I was like, this is a piece of shit.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nThat's why everyone has all these notes and this is garbage.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nI spent the next three weeks\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nwhich are supposed to be spent doing the next three episodes,\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nrewriting the first episode.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nI really liked that episode. That was great.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nYeah.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nAnd then you're just behind schedule forever.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nYou're just behind schedule forever.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nWhat was the whole order? How many episodes?\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\n13.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nAnd so you're on the homestretch?\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nYeah, one more. Tomorrow is the first of the last five days.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nAnd so you made an agreement with yourself\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nthat you would do what in a week? Just be done.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nYou would have it written?\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nNo, he made an agreement that he'd let\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nHarmontown ruin community.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nI wasn't going to cancel shows at Meltdown\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nbecause I get it right.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nThat's going to be the case every week\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nor whatever.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nThis is two and a half hours out of you.\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nYeah, exactly. You could spend this researching.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nHow much Minecraft have you played this week?\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nHow many hours of Minecraft?\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nI pack it in where I can.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nI don't know.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nI don't know.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nBallpark it.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nI can't ballpark it. I don't know.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nYou just can't say because Yahoo is listening right now.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nNo, it's not. I don't play it instead of working.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nI play it whenever I possibly can.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nSo I have no idea what that number is.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nLike, I work...\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nWhenever you possibly couldn't be working.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nWhat?\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nLike, you're saying that\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nyou're using some sort of free time\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nwhen you can't be working.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nYes, yes. So I send pages\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\ndown to the set and I'm like,\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nokay, it's going to take like three hours to shoot that.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nSo then I'm like,\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nyeah, Minecraft.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nAnd then they're like, they're almost done shooting.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nWhat happens in the next scene?\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, fuck.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nAnnie kisses Abba.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nThat'll keep them going.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nMinecraft!\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nYou sure it's like Tootsie.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nYeah, but it's turning out fine.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nThat's great. Tootsie's a good movie.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nNo.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nTootsie's a good movie.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nTootsie's a good movie.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nIt's one crazy hospital.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nNo, it's not...\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nIt's too hard and painful to explain.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nHow are you holding up physically and mentally?\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nLook at me.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nMentally, I'm fine.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nHow would variety describe your physical state?\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nBut it's one more week.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nYou know, it was really nice.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nPeople liked the first two episodes.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nThey tweeted nice things.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nSo that lifted me up and made me extra nervous\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nabout the rest of them.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:45.000\nWe could pull through.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nThere's a couple in the middle.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nBut then again, I thought this about the first two.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nThere's still a couple in the middle.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nI'm like, well, let's not pat ourselves\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nwith the back just yet.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nBecause I don't remember what was going on.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nThere was something about...\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nThere's some episodes that are just like,\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nI did it on a chicken.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nIt gets...\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nThere's some shit\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nthat happened in the middle\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nwhere I was trying to catch up\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nby going like, okay, just...\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nThe line producers are like, yeah,\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nbut what do they shoot tomorrow?\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nI'm like, look, just calm down.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nGive me a bullwhip and a chicken.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nI tried to bluff them\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nand act like I have a plan.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nAll I need is Annie and a bullwhip and a chicken\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nand a room painted blue.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nIt's a big deal, but it's not.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nThat's very showbiz, man.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nThis should be pretty good.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nIf it's not, you know, fire me.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nAre you going to follow through with that?\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nCamera takes.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nDan Harmon dares Yahoo to fire him.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nThat woman that we met\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nwith the spinal deterioration\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nin Austin, are you going to\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nput her in there?\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nI have put Annie in touch\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nwith the wardrobe department.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nYou put her physically in touch with them?\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nI go, yeah.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nTwitterly in touch.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nThe wardrobe supervisor has a Twitter account\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nand I hooked him up on there\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nand then I explained to the department\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nthe situation, which is that\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nAnnie has to be dressed a certain way\n\n50:21.000 -->

50:31.000\nI don't care about the show.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nWhat's the bullwhip chicken episode about?\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nCan you spoil the bullwhip chicken scene for us?\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nNo, I was using placeholders.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nBecause if I said the real things, it would be like,\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nreally?\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nI can't say the real things.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nThose are placeholders for actual things\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nthat you made up as placeholders.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nWell, kind of,

supposed to be making things up.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nAnd then the thing that kills me\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nis that everyone underneath me who's like,\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nwell,

54:53.000\nsuper joyless and sad.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nI would like to think that she is smiling\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nwhile wearing the Rupert Murdoch mask.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nAlso, why is there a Rupert Murdoch mask?\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nBecause it's my first question.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nYou've got to watch this movie, man.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nThey made it, clearly, out of some magazine.\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nOh, it's not like they didn't get a nice latex.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nI think they printed it.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nOff the internet.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nIt's a piece of paper with eyes cut out.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nThere's a lot of stuff about it that if you want to let it,\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nit will make you very sad.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nHowever,\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nas a person who's going to couples therapy\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nand is in love with his wife\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nand learning how the delicate art\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nof making a relationship work\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nbetween two people,\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nthese guys have been...\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nThey've been a healthy couple\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nfor like 20 years.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nThis word, healthy, I don't think it follows.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nI mean, just because they aren't mad at each other\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\ndoesn't make it a healthy relationship.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nIt's just...\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nWell, that's true, but Bonnie and Clyde had fights\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nbetween bank robberies,\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nbut their bank robbery didn't make them unhealthy.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nIf Bonnie and Clyde robbed your bank\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nas they were leaving...\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nYou lost that guy.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nThat was you, madam, or sir, or whatever that was.\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nIf Bonnie and Clyde robbed your bank...\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nI think the bank robbery is the first sign of unhealthiness.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nYeah, that's what I'm thinking.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nHow can we not make this differentiation here?\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nIf a couple murders your dog\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nand they're both like,\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nsweetie, get the tail.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nIt's not healthy.\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nAnd then the cops go,\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\ncould you describe the couple that murdered your dog?\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nI'd be like, well, they were very healthy.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nLike, they got along.\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nThey were on the same team.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nSome said they got along so well\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nthat they murdered my dog.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nYeah, and I would want the cops to catch this couple.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nI'd be like, I hope you give them the electric chair.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nAnd because I want you to catch them,\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nI want you to take this unique descriptor with you\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nso you recognize them at Grand Central Station.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nThey get along great.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nThey're very much in love.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nDon't bother\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nwasting your time.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nWouldn't a healthy spouse\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\ndeter the other one from\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nkilling a dog and robbing a bank?\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nI don't know.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nAs a healthy\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nspouse or\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nsignificant other,\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nyou would want the person to not do things that would land you in jail?\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nAlso, if Copernicus's wife had been like,\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nwhy don't you stop redesigning\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nthe solar system?\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nIs that a healthy\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nrelationship?\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nYou're equating redesigning the solar system\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nwith killing your dog?\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nYes, I am.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nPeople are cutting up bodies and all this stuff.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nAgain, I hate to beat a dead horse,\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nbut\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nor take the horse.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nBut again,\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nthere's people in the courtroom that go like,\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nand then you know what he did?\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nHe took a saw\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nand he cut the arm off\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nand then he cut the body open\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nand he took the liver and he put it in a bag\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nand I'm like, sounds like a doctor!\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nI've been saying this for years!\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nThese people need to be watched!\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nWhat are you saying?\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nThe suspect is not a doctor.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nThe doctors are all suspects because they know how to cut people off.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nI'm
