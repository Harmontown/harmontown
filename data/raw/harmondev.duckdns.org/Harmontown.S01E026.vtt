{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.000\nHello Atlanta! Georgia, how are you all? I hope you're well. I know I am.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:34.000\nOh, you did it! You came to the right place, ladies and gentlemen, please.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:40.000\nHarmon Town is now in session. Put your hands together for the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:46.000\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:50.000\nGod bless you.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:57.000\nGod bless your railroads. God bless your, your, your airlines.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:02.000\nGod bless Coca-Cola. God bless AT&T Mobility.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nWe are, we are in a, we are in an, what's called an Alpha City, Jeff.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:11.000\nWe're in a center of world commerce at Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:20.000\nThis is a, this is a gigantic, like, global, it's, it's, it's been the nexus of, of American civilization and, and beyond.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:22.000\nI'm not being, it sounds like I'm being sarcastic, doesn't it?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:28.000\nIf I were from here and someone started saying that, I'd go, what's this, a setup for like, he's going to take a piss on our faces?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nNo, I, I, I've been Wikipediaing you today.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:41.000\nAs I do each city we go through, I do a little bit of research and I, I was stricken by the history and the, the fucking human pain and the, and triumph.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:43.000\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nYou should laugh. We're in a comedy club.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:54.000\nI'm, I'm happy. I say somebody makes you laugh, but truly, like, what, it's a beautiful, beautiful, we're, we're, it's, it's the most historical city in the country.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:56.000\nI'm going to say that right now.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nI'm not, I'm not an expert.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:00.000\nWhat are you basing that on?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nWell, you know, you'd have to go like, well, what about Virginia, Dan? What about Washington DC?\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:09.000\nFuck politicians. This is a, the, the, the politics is not history. History is blood and humanity.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:20.000\nThis play, Atlanta, like, out of, probably out of any city we'll be to on this tour, maybe out of any city in the country, certainly paid the price for the civil war conflict.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nLike just sat here and got destroyed.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nLike, like, like, like was just in the crossfire because it was at the center of all these railroads.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nIt was a strategic location for military operations.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nSo, you know, this guy, General Sherman, sounds like kind of a dick move.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:42.000\nJust, just because it was on its way to Savannah, right?\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nIt's just decided Atlanta should be burnt literally to the ground.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nEvery scrap of it, except for hospitals and churches, quote, Wikipedia.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:59.000\nSo that everyone can sit and go, dear God and, or heal my leg, my house is gone and everything.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:03.000\nBut, but it goes beyond that because I think this is really, really, really interesting.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nLike, like, I don't know where we'll go.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:10.000\nAnd I'm not, I'm not a historian, certainly not a civil war historian, but just reading about that.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nI'm going, okay, so I bet this place got it the worst out of that whole conflict.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nI bet the suffering was the worst here.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nLike the biggest battles took place around here.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nThe crossfire was the worst here.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nThe place was burnt to the ground by, by, what's that?\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nIs this a rival for who got it worse?\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nOr is that, or is that like a wounded knee, like a Atlanta thing?\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nOkay, well, you know what?\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:35.000\nYes, I'm, yes, thank you.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nI'm not.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nKen Burns, everybody.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nKen Burns is here.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nHey, I don't come to where you animate photos and tell you which keyframes to set.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nI'm not, I'm not discouraging you calling something out.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nI'm just, I'm just making sure you're maybe agreeing with me or disagreeing with me.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nIf you're disagreeing with me, shut up for a second.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nOkay, but, but, but if you're agreeing with me, hallelujah.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:09.000\nBut, but, but, but I thought the thing I was stricken by reading about it was, okay, so it just, the place was just raised by this, by this horrible bloody conflict.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:17.000\nAnd then the first to bounce back like gigantically and, and, and, and just became like the center of commerce again.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nIt's like constantly being punished for being this nexus of civilization.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:29.000\nAnd then also because it is a nexus of civilization, like not having the option of being, you know, fucked up.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:36.000\nLike you look at like Flint, Michigan and you go, oh shit, you know, we had an auto plant here and then it closed down.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nThat's why you're being raped right now.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:48.000\nWe're, we're, we're in a city that was ordered to burnt down by a federal empire and then popped right back up again.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:59.000\nAnd like a game of whack-a-mole and became not only, not only, you know, not only a commercial empire, but, but also like at the forefront of the new south of progression.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nAnd they, they, they coined this phrase, I don't know where it came from.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nIt was your, uh, Willie B. Hartzfield, what was that his name?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nAnd there's your, your mayor from the forties to the sixties to the fifties when all that shit was going down.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nAtlanta was this like pocket of fuck this shit.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:19.000\nLike, like let's, let's, let's make some money and build our houses and like, like do this stuff.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nAnd the phrase too busy to hate got adopted.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nThat's sort of a slogan here.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:32.000\nI don't know if it's how much bullshit it is, but I caught my breath a little bit when I read that too busy to hate, too busy to hate.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nThey got too much shit to do.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:45.000\nThere's too much reality happening here for them to engage in the idea that, that if you're a black person or white person or if you, you know, whatever you're, wherever you're leaning, it's, it's, there's too much shit to get done.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nToo many railroads happening, too many planes coming in.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:55.000\nThey got places to go, too much cargo to offload, you know, too much Coke to make, too much AT&T to mobilize.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nUm, and now, and now they're also a media empire as well as a lot of stuff being shot here.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:09.000\nIt's, it's, it's a little, and it's not, you know, there's no, there's no White House here and there's no, uh, it's, uh, but it's, it's, it's the cleavage of our country.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nIt's, it's just, it's like down deep, just take a sharpie pen and put it right in there.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nYou mean, you mean like the Rockies and the Appalachians would be like the titties?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nYeah, I didn't think that hard about it.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:28.000\nI, I was just trying to think of what, what it is, I didn't want to say vagina because that's like, it's, it's the womb.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:36.000\nIt's the, it's the, it's a, it's a deep, dark, painful, joyful, creative vessel.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nYou were really busy on the internet in that bus ride today, man.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nNo, it's just the hotel lobby.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nI went down, I had a kettle one and I pulled up Wikipedia and I said, what is Atlanta?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nAnd I just, I'm in love.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nWe were in Texas, you probably heard me blowing them when we were, when we passed through.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:55.000\nBut I'm not, I'm not, I didn't say, oh, Texas is great for any reasons I'd say Atlanta's great.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nLike, like, like Texas, and I also didn't give a shit about Austin.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nI was like, Texas, we're in Texas.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nLet's talk about my infatuation with Texas.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nAnd the cool thing is we get to spend some time here.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nActually, we were doing an early show because we have to get out of here because Bob Goldway's coming in and, and then.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nIt was awesome.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nBut we get to, we actually get to spend the, the evening and the night here and not have to get up.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nLike I'm not getting on the bus at the crack of dawn or at four AM or whatever.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nYeah, yeah, I probably have to write some scripts though.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nI think I, I think it's like, I think Fox and CBS.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nDo you have to write while you're on the road?\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nI have to write right now.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nI have to, yeah, I, I should have a laptop out and going, fade in.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nNatalie's, she's hot, but she's smart.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nI'm feeling like very vulnerable over here because in the club tonight, I normally have a little iPad.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:47.000\nI have a little iPad and I play music and I put rap beats on so Dan can rap about fucking your mama.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nAnd, and believe me, it's going to happen tonight.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nAs sure as the South will rise again.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nNo mama will be unfucked in this country.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nAnd frankly, he will not give a damn.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnd also, my iPad is up there in the booth and Dustin Marshall, our podcast recorders.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nI'm going to have to call out audibles, like a sideline coach.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd I'm going to go like, beat number two.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nSo you're accustomed to a little more control.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nAnd I thought that I'm traveling with Jeff and I'm getting to know him.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nI've been friends with him for over 10 years.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nYou know, we've never been through this experience together.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:30.000\nAnd I, I really noticed a tangible difference today because I, I got off the bus and I went to my hotel room.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nLike, like Jeff, he can't wear this suit all the time.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nLike there are moments when he's like wearing just a sweater.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nBut he just looks like this.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nAnd those are his vulnerable moments.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nThis is how he sleeps, wearing what I'm wearing.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:49.000\nFor the podcast listeners, I'm dressed like Jerry Mathers in 1990.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nLike when he, when they were maybe doing fucking around with a new Leave It To Beaver show.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\nI, I, I, I'm like a J crew, kind of, kind of, kind of casual.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nI don't know that I've ever seen you in that.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nThis is how Jeff cuts his vegetables and dressed like me and sleeps.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd so we rolled to the town of Jeff was wearing his little sweater.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nAnd he's like, we came to the venue to do the soundcheck.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nAnd I know that I know this look in his eyes.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nLike he's just focused in the, opens the door and he's just walking around.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nI was like, Jeff's, Jeff's being snooty.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nLike no one getting his way.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nLet him, let him, what's, what's, what's happening.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nNot snooty because I don't think anyone interacted with you.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nBut I could, I cut you a wide path when I see a certain look on your face.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd I was like, I think, what is it?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nWhat is it? And then, and then I figured out, oh, he doesn't, he's not in his suit.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nHe needs to go back and get in his suit.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:36.000\nHere's a soundcheck.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:37.000\nI needed to shave.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nYou know, I'm of the, I'm of the feeling that like, I like Frank Sinatra, like,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nhe had rules that when you want, when you go on stage, you shave and you wear a suit.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nSo I, I, I, I'm the opposite.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nWe rolled into the hotel and I was, I was like, I'm going to go have a drink and then we'll go to the venue.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nAnd Aaron said, you have to change your clothes.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nYou, you stink.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nYou, you look gross.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nYou look gross. Your pants are from a different era of, of, of body weight.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nYou look like you have a load in your, in your pants.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nI go, you just, just she brought all this nice clothes, just changed.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nAnd I said, I want to have a drink.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nAnd I actually really said, and I wasn't being ironic.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nI said, do you understand that I'm a baby?\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnd she, and she went, yes, I do.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nI'm changing you.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:28.000\nAnd she made me put on this seafoam sweater and this, these navy blue pants and I feel great and all this stuff.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nBut I mean, meanwhile, in a different hotel room, you're going, my clothes give me my power.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nSo we're, we're opposites there.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nI would have come out here in a diaper and I would have just pooped.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nAnd I, I, if no one else had said anything, I wouldn't have known it was a bad thing.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nI mean, it's obviously there's a live crowd before a podcast.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'm surprised you don't just come out in a, in a bathrobe because like, didn't you?\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nI should, you used to show up at Paramount for community in a bathrobe, didn't you?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:53.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nYou used to show up at work in pajamas.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:01.000\nLike you were like one of those, who's the crazy brothers that made the matrix and the guy started just dressing like a crazy.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:02.000\nYeah.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nYeah, I was kind of like a lazy, non-gender Wachowski brother.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nI'm just looking at my Evernote notepad here.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nMy armpit smelled worse in Louisiana.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nI wanted you guys to know that.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nI don't know if that's to your credit, but I felt like it was.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nLike I felt like the humidity level there.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nLike I was something, but I don't think I could ever live in anywhere in Louisiana.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:27.000\nI, I, I caught a little bit of that walking past you and I was like, it was like kind of weird.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nIt was like a Coachella Burning Man kind of like, it's got to be a humidity thing.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nLike there's certain chemicals in my armpits that don't evaporate in Louisiana quick enough.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nSo you're going to get a certain combination there.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nThat drug enforcement checkpoint.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nThis is a created, what were we driving from Texas to Louisiana?\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nAnd there was this sign that said, drug enforcement checkpoint half mile.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nSo everyone freaks out cause shocker, we've got weed in the bus.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nThere's a reason we're not flying.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nLike if we wanted to have to deal, what the fuck?\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nA fucking America for God's sake.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nBy the way, the irony is I haven't smoked any yet, but I'm just like, I'm going on a tour bus.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:10.000\nI'm taking my weed that I have, I have a prescription for.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nI get a lot of anxiety and I live in the great state of California.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:20.000\nAnd I, and if you're out there and you want to ruin our life, go ahead and follow us and pull us over and ruin our life.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nBut, but, um, I, there's a drug enforcement checkpoint.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:25.000\nOh, what's that?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nWe go and zip the pockets and rezip them.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd what are we supposed to do?\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nAlright, everyone hold your weed and wait until there's flashing lights and then we'll all flush it together and all this stuff.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nAnd then nothing happens and nothing keeps happening.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nAnd somebody gets on the internet and looks it up.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nThey put these signs up, they're like tricks.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nBecause obviously nothing could be more unconstitutional than a drug enforcement checkpoint.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:53.000\nBut they put the signs up and anyone who gets off on the next exit, they follow.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nIt's like hipster profiling.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nLike they figured out a new way to detect.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nI think also they're looking for people that are ditching stuff out the window.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nI feel like that, that just maybe is some enterprising drug addict who just put that sign up.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:12.000\nI mean, everybody's like, I need it, got it, need it, got it.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nYeah, well my, my, I stayed in a handicapped room in Louisiana.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nThis was weird.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nThere's, there's physically challenged people.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nThose walls were thin.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:28.000\nWe had, we keep getting adjacent rooms and I keep learning like a little bit about your like, you know, diurnal patterns and things like that.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nDan and Erin checked in right next to me in the wall was razor thin.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nTissue paper thin.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nAnd I, and the first thing I hear them doing is Dan just going,\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nI was like, and we opened up a little doors.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nWe had the doors that opened up and like, are you, are you seeing Jurassic Park in there?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nYeah. Because it feels like, like when you get off a tour bus you're like, you know.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:57.080\nYou're like, you know, it's very constrictive and like you say everywhere you go like there doesn't need to be dinosaurs there for it to\n\n13:57.080 --> 13:59.080\nFeel majestic\n\n14:08.200 --> 14:14.840\nI don't know I feel John Williams II when I get off of a vehicle and I feel like I'm looking at a\n\n14:15.720 --> 14:17.720\nbrontosaurus\n\n14:17.720 --> 14:23.960\nHandicap it said a handicap room and then there was a button. I don't know if I hope there's somebody in the room that is\n\n14:24.520 --> 14:29.960\nPhysically, I don't know what the latest phrase is but physically challenged that knows what it means when you have a\n\n14:30.920 --> 14:36.520\nHandicap room and there's a like a doorbell button outside the hotel room and it says press it hold for five seconds\n\n14:36.520 --> 14:39.320\nWhat happens then can handicap people just rob me like?\n\n14:39.960 --> 14:44.680\nLook if you if you they don't need a key, they're not that special\n\n14:44.680 --> 14:48.440\nThey don't get to just rob. They're like a handrail in your shower with a special no\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:53.480\nThere was nothing the only thing and this is on them not me. I'm like the air conditioner didn't work\n\n14:54.920 --> 14:57.960\nSo the joke becomes obvious like oh, it's a handicap room\n\n15:00.040 --> 15:04.760\nThat's not my fault that they that they did that this guy's getting up to leave because\n\n15:06.600 --> 15:08.600\nHe's walking at least well\n\n15:10.200 --> 15:13.960\nHe's walking to his his crutches and he's gonna throw one at me\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:19.720\nI I know it's here. Nothing again. Obviously. I'm nothing but an advocate of of anyone that\n\n15:20.360 --> 15:23.960\nWants to feel special about anything. Should we bring Spencer up here to have oh, yeah\n\n15:23.960 --> 15:27.480\nYeah, let's get Spencer up because we're our time we gotta we gotta do a bullet train Harmontown\n\n15:27.480 --> 15:31.480\nFor those of you who do not know Spencer. He's our dungeon master extraordinaire. Welcome dungeon master\n\n15:32.120 --> 15:34.120\nSpencer\n\n15:35.320 --> 15:37.320\nHe has his own musical theme\n\n15:37.320 --> 15:43.240\nHow's it going oh Mike Mike Mike, how's it going?\n\n15:46.120 --> 15:50.120\nWe can't get a mic stand for Spencer. He's got to roll dice and I don't need a mic stand\n\n15:50.200 --> 15:54.280\nOh, he can use mine. I'll go I'll go I'll go El Fresco. I guess I need a mic stand\n\n15:58.200 --> 16:03.800\nSo Spencer, how have you been enjoying your trip so far? I've been enjoying my trip so far\n\n16:03.800 --> 16:12.120\nHe's very good. I doubt there's anyone here who doesn't listen to the podcast but\n\n16:13.080 --> 16:18.120\nAnd I don't think there's anything we can do to make you enjoy the show if you're if you've if you've stumbled in here going\n\n16:18.920 --> 16:20.920\nI want to see some comedy\n\n16:21.480 --> 16:23.400\nBut just to\n\n16:23.400 --> 16:25.800\nRefresh you Spencer is our dungeon master from\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:30.440\nWe asked if there was a dungeon master in the audience in Los Angeles his hand shot up\n\n16:30.440 --> 16:34.200\nAnd a friendship was born and now he's on the tour bus with us\n\n16:34.200 --> 16:39.400\nAnd we're learning all kinds of things about him and the other shoes not dropping you keep you keep waiting to find out that he\n\n16:40.040 --> 16:43.800\nYou know always like hangs his underwear at his\n\n16:44.680 --> 16:49.160\nI'm a little worried because I sleep like a like a beautiful little angel baby on those tour buses\n\n16:49.160 --> 16:53.000\nAnd I think everyone else has too but every time I come out to the to the front area\n\n16:53.000 --> 17:01.880\nYou're you're wide awake. You're having trouble sleeping on that button. Yeah, and every time you're sleeping. I'm just standing there\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.360\nA lot of the documentary footage is going to be night vision of you\n\n17:08.840 --> 17:10.840\nJust a spencer cam\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:14.920\nSleep\n\n17:15.560 --> 17:17.080\nThat's right Jeff\n\n17:17.080 --> 17:22.600\nNo, we had a lovely little moment that was documented. I believe in some sort of uh video footage and uh\n\n17:22.600 --> 17:26.920\nIn some pictures where he taught me how to play. He actually took me through my character sheet\n\n17:26.920 --> 17:32.680\nWhich I've never really bothered to learn about and for his trouble. I told I taught him a few chords on the ukulele. Yeah, it's beautiful\n\n17:32.680 --> 17:34.680\nIt's great. What's happening? It's great\n\n17:35.400 --> 17:37.960\nIt's a lot like the city of Atlanta this relationship\n\n17:38.840 --> 17:42.600\nIt just keeps building itself up and then randomly being burnt down by things\n\n17:42.600 --> 17:52.200\nI did I tell you Jeff that again in uh 1917 Atlanta was just caught fire just out of sense memory. Uh,\n\n17:52.760 --> 17:54.760\nIt's just a sad city that just\n\n17:55.480 --> 17:57.480\nWe should be burnt\n\n17:57.720 --> 18:01.800\nAnd they just burnt to the ground again and they built it up again. What were the circumstances of that?\n\n18:01.800 --> 18:03.800\nI died. I thought someone someone dropped up\n\n18:06.760 --> 18:10.440\nAll right, that's it we should we should we should journey there\n\n18:10.440 --> 18:17.160\nUm, we also here's the most progressive thing about Atlanta their first race riot 1906\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nNow that's thinking ahead\n\n18:21.400 --> 18:23.560\nThat's some that's a way before it was cool. Yeah\n\n18:24.760 --> 18:28.360\nI mean, you don't even need to have a race riot back that it was like you could just have races\n\n18:28.440 --> 18:32.920\nIt's just being oppressed and stuff and they had a full-blown riot 1906 like a bunch of people died\n\n18:32.920 --> 18:38.440\nThis is this is a this is the this is a future city. They're always they're always looking down the road\n\n18:38.440 --> 18:44.040\nUm, I think it's the longest you've gone on a Harmontown show without fucking somebody's mother.

barbarians could hold up\n\n38:48.360 --> 38:50.360\nagainst the dark's fleet.\n\n38:50.360 --> 38:51.360\nAlright, yeah.\n\n38:51.360 --> 38:53.360\nBecause of the limited microphones,\n\n38:53.360 --> 38:57.360\nwe should have Erin McGathy come up and play her character\n\n38:57.360 --> 39:00.360\nreally quickly and then make up a reasonable leave.\n\n39:00.360 --> 39:04.360\nIs Erin here?\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:05.360\nErin?\n\n39:05.360 --> 39:06.360\nCome on on, Erin McGathy.\n\n39:06.360 --> 39:13.360\nErin is selling merchandise.\n\n39:13.360 --> 39:17.360\nShe didn't knit them or anything.\n\n39:17.360 --> 39:19.360\nShe had all the T-shirts.\n\n39:19.360 --> 39:21.360\nShe's been the merchandise czar for the whole thing\n\n39:21.360 --> 39:23.360\nand is like, merchandise maven.\n\n39:23.360 --> 39:26.360\nShare a mic with me.\n\n39:26.360 --> 39:27.360\nSure.\n\n39:27.360 --> 39:29.360\nI'll probably be out there afterwards.\n\n39:29.360 --> 39:31.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n39:31.360 --> 39:32.360\nEven though it's illegal.\n\n39:32.360 --> 39:34.360\nSo if you're a cop or your friend is a cop,\n\n39:34.360 --> 39:36.360\ntry to give us 20 minutes,\n\n39:36.360 --> 39:38.360\nbecause if you buy something, we'll sign it out there,\n\n39:38.360 --> 39:41.360\nlike out those doors and you can buy shit out there too.\n\n39:41.360 --> 39:42.360\nBut we're kind of cramped here\n\n39:42.360 --> 39:46.360\nand trying to do everything we can for everyone.\n\n39:46.360 --> 39:49.360\nJust don't burn your city anymore.\n\n39:49.360 --> 39:51.360\nJust calm down.\n\n39:51.360 --> 39:52.360\nAlright, so...\n\n39:52.360 --> 39:54.360\nSo we're heading west toward the butchalot encampment.\n\n39:54.360 --> 39:56.360\nHeaded west?\n\n39:56.360 --> 39:58.360\nYes.\n\n39:58.360 --> 40:00.360\nHow long a journey is this?\n\n40:00.360 --> 40:01.360\nWho knows?\n\n40:01.360 --> 40:03.360\nPerhaps days, perhaps hours,\n\n40:03.360 --> 40:07.360\nperhaps, you know, a certain amount of time.\n\n40:07.360 --> 40:09.360\nOther than that.\n\n40:09.360 --> 40:11.360\nI say we move as quickly as possible\n\n40:11.360 --> 40:14.360\nbecause your father's in danger, Sharpie.\n\n40:14.360 --> 40:16.360\nThat reminds me, gentlemen,\n\n40:16.360 --> 40:21.360\nI have something to do in a different area.\n\n40:21.360 --> 40:23.360\nI may be trying to find a belt\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:25.360\nto turn me back into a woman,\n\n40:25.360 --> 40:29.360\nbut I did reveal in our last installment\n\n40:29.360 --> 40:31.360\nthat I might have feelings for Sharpie.\n\n40:31.360 --> 40:32.360\nI'm embarrassed.\n\n40:32.360 --> 40:33.360\nPlease try to forget what I said,\n\n40:33.360 --> 40:35.360\nbut I must depart.\n\n40:35.360 --> 40:38.360\nSo you're a man and you want to turn into a woman\n\n40:38.360 --> 40:41.360\nso you can be with a guy that you love.\n\n40:41.360 --> 40:43.360\nHa-ha, adventure!\n\n40:44.360 --> 40:46.360\nAlright, Erin McGathy.\n\n40:49.360 --> 40:51.360\nWait, we can do that?\n\n40:51.360 --> 40:53.360\nWe can just tell her to leave?\n\n40:53.360 --> 40:55.360\nThere's not a lot of mics up here.\n\n40:55.360 --> 40:57.360\nJeff's eyes just lit up.\n\n40:58.360 --> 41:01.360\nYou make your way back through the hilly butts expanse.\n\n41:01.360 --> 41:05.360\nYou hurry in the hopes of making it to camp in time.\n\n41:05.360 --> 41:07.360\nAs you get closer, you can hear the screams\n\n41:07.360 --> 41:09.360\nand shouts of pitched battle.\n\n41:09.360 --> 41:12.360\nThe war cries of barbarians.\n\n41:12.360 --> 41:13.360\nSorry.\n\n41:13.360 --> 41:15.360\nReaching the crest of a foothill.\n\n41:15.360 --> 41:16.360\nI can't do both things.\n\n41:16.360 --> 41:18.360\nYou can see Yellow Camp.\n\n41:18.360 --> 41:20.360\nThe grand yellow tent is splattered with blood.\n\n41:20.360 --> 41:24.360\nA massive pit near the camp seems to be the locus of the warring forces.\n\n41:24.360 --> 41:27.360\nCorpses of gnolls and humans lie strewn across the ground\n\n41:27.360 --> 41:29.360\nand you can see destroyed cylinder constructs\n\n41:29.360 --> 41:32.360\nripped to shreds and lying in piles of metal cylinders.\n\n41:32.360 --> 41:36.360\nYou can see a massive line of at least 60 cylinders\n\n41:36.360 --> 41:40.360\npushing back the barbarians towards the rim of this massive pit.\n\n41:40.360 --> 41:41.360\nPit!\n\n41:41.360 --> 41:44.360\nYou recall this excavation site from before\n\n41:44.360 --> 41:47.360\nwhen they discussed they were digging for something.\n\n41:47.360 --> 41:50.360\nSo there's a bunch of those cylinders that we fought\n\n41:50.360 --> 41:53.360\nand they're pushing the barbarians towards the pit.\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:55.360\nI get so confused.\n\n41:55.360 --> 41:56.360\nI know, man.\n\n41:56.360 --> 41:57.360\nI get so confused.\n\n41:57.360 --> 42:00.360\nSomebody on Twitter or Instagram told me\n\n42:00.360 --> 42:03.360\nthat maybe my flaming dagger is one of the shards, possibly.\n\n42:03.360 --> 42:05.360\nI saw that conversation.\n\n42:05.360 --> 42:08.360\nAre we been neglecting a shard the whole time?\n\n42:08.360 --> 42:09.360\nWhy don't we just do a quick check?\n\n42:09.360 --> 42:10.360\nShard check!\n\n42:11.360 --> 42:13.360\nThere's no such thing as that.\n\n42:13.360 --> 42:16.360\nWe take his emerald dagger and hold it near our shards\n\n42:16.360 --> 42:19.360\nto see if there's some kind of similarity.\n\n42:20.360 --> 42:22.360\nJust to make some guy on Twitter happy.\n\n42:22.360 --> 42:24.360\nLike I said, I recently rented Temple of Doom\n\n42:24.360 --> 42:27.360\nand they hold the rocks together, they glow, so...\n\n42:27.360 --> 42:29.360\nWe hold our shards together.\n\n42:29.360 --> 42:30.360\nNothing happens.\n\n42:30.360 --> 42:31.360\nShit.\n\n42:31.360 --> 42:32.360\nAll right.\n\n42:32.360 --> 42:33.360\nWell, you hear that out there, Twitter guy?\n\n42:33.360 --> 42:34.360\nYeah.\n\n42:34.360 --> 42:35.360\nFuck you!\n\n42:35.360 --> 42:36.360\nIn your theories.\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:40.360\nWhat do you have to say about that guy on Twitter, Skeleton Crotch?\n\n42:40.360 --> 42:41.360\nGhost fart.\n\n42:42.360 --> 42:43.360\nAll right.\n\n42:43.360 --> 42:45.360\nSo, you're looking at a fight.\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:47.360\nYeah, we're looking at a big fight.\n\n42:47.360 --> 42:48.360\nThen apparently...\n\n42:48.360 --> 42:51.360\nI mean, it was hard to kill three cylinders,\n\n42:51.360 --> 42:53.360\nbut there's a big line of them now.\n\n42:53.360 --> 42:54.360\nYeah.\n\n42:54.360 --> 42:55.360\nDo I see my dad?\n\n42:55.360 --> 42:56.360\nYou don't.\n\n42:56.360 --> 42:57.360\nYou grow worried.\n\n43:00.360 --> 43:01.360\nYou're just standing.\n\n43:02.360 --> 43:04.360\nI'm stumped, man, people.\n\n43:04.360 --> 43:05.360\nI'm stumped.\n\n43:05.360 --> 43:06.360\nI'm stumped.\n\n43:06.360 --> 43:07.360\nI'm stumped.\n\n43:07.360 --> 43:08.360\nI'm stumped.\n\n43:08.360 --> 43:10.360\nI'm stumped, man, people are dying.\n\n43:10.360 --> 43:12.360\nBy the way, if anybody out there is a D&D fan\n\n43:12.360 --> 43:13.360\nwho knows what to do\n\n43:13.360 --> 43:15.360\nand has any advice, please help us out.\n\n43:15.360 --> 43:16.360\nMake a perception check.\n\n43:19.360 --> 43:20.360\nWas that Ken Burns?\n\n43:22.360 --> 43:23.360\nKen-\n\n43:23.360 --> 43:24.360\nKen-\n\n43:24.360 -->

charge towards the fight, plumes of jet black smoke\n\n44:10.520 --> 44:12.600\nplummet to the ground, waylaying you.\n\n44:12.600 --> 44:14.960\nAnd they quickly coalesce into physical forms.\n\n44:14.960 --> 44:17.880\nTwo small mounds of yellowed flesh stand before you.\n\n44:17.880 --> 44:19.760\nThe creatures have humanoid heads and scrawny,\n\n44:19.760 --> 44:21.840\nclomped limbs, but lack legs.\n\n44:21.840 --> 44:24.000\nYou recognize these as the very lowest beasts\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.080\nof the hell, the pits of hell.\n\n44:26.080 --> 44:27.360\nWhat's this beast called?\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:28.200\nYou don't know.\n\n44:28.200 --> 44:29.560\nOh.\n\n44:29.560 --> 44:31.520\nYou just see them sometimes.\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:33.120\nAre they blocking my way to the pits?\n\n44:33.120 --> 44:34.120\nThey're blocking your way.\n\n44:34.120 --> 44:36.320\nThey slither towards you menacingly.\n\n44:36.320 --> 44:38.080\nI, uh, power attack.\n\n44:38.080 --> 44:40.760\nAll right, uh, three, one to three.\n\n44:40.760 --> 44:41.240\nPick one.\n\n44:41.240 --> 44:42.400\nOne, two, three.\n\n44:42.400 --> 44:44.360\nThree?\n\n44:44.360 --> 44:45.680\nNice, you got a critical hit.\n\n44:45.680 --> 44:47.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n44:47.640 --> 44:49.680\nI'm not even, I'm not even getting the wool damage.\n\n44:52.920 --> 44:56.240\nYou slice through the lemur just as easily as it were butter.\n\n44:56.240 --> 44:57.680\nIt dissolves into black smoke.\n\n44:57.680 --> 44:58.120\nThank you.\n\n44:58.120 --> 45:00.440\nI interrupt the cosmos to remind you to tip will,\n\n45:00.440 --> 45:07.360\nwho's, uh, who's, uh, serving you back there.\n\n45:07.360 --> 45:10.200\nOh, this is, this guy just came up and poured his booze.\n\n45:10.200 --> 45:11.440\nThis is fantastic.\n\n45:11.440 --> 45:12.160\nI know, but yeah.\n\n45:12.160 --> 45:12.680\nThank you, Will.\n\n45:12.680 --> 45:15.480\nThat'll be all.\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:17.200\nThe other demon approaches Sharpie.\n\n45:17.200 --> 45:20.720\nHe swings a vicious claw, but you managed to dodge.\n\n45:20.720 --> 45:22.360\nOh, so today's my lucky day so far.\n\n45:22.360 --> 45:23.280\nYeah, all right.\n\n45:23.280 --> 45:25.480\nThose hellish creatures were created by the cylinders?\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:26.040\nYou don't know.\n\n45:26.040 --> 45:27.680\nThey just came from the sky.\n\n45:27.680 --> 45:30.800\nIs it, is it possible to take my small friend and throw him\n\n45:30.800 --> 45:31.840\nonto one of the cylinders?\n\n45:31.840 --> 45:34.760\nLike maybe you could ride on one and see, like, maybe it'll,\n\n45:34.760 --> 45:36.360\nmaybe it'll go, go back to the cylinder.\n\n45:36.360 --> 45:39.120\nIt's really insensitive, man.\n\n45:39.120 --> 45:41.360\nWhat's your strength?\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:45.000\nIt says, um, a million now.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:48.240\nNine, oh.\n\n45:48.240 --> 45:51.560\nBut he's small.\n\n45:51.560 --> 45:54.400\nYou managed to throw him a good 12 feet.\n\n45:54.400 --> 45:56.600\nWhoa.\n\n45:56.600 --> 45:59.160\nHe doesn't land atop a cylinder, but he does hit it\n\n45:59.160 --> 45:59.760\nin the side.\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:01.480\nYou can try and cling on if you'd like.\n\n46:01.480 --> 46:04.640\nI, I, I, I cling to a cylinder.\n\n46:04.640 --> 46:06.000\nJeff, what's your climb check?\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:07.440\nYou know climb on the skills?\n\n46:07.440 --> 46:08.960\nClimb on the skills.\n\n46:08.960 --> 46:09.680\nWe talked about it.\n\n46:09.680 --> 46:10.880\nClimb on the skills.\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:11.480\nHold up.\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:12.760\nClimb is, I have a nine.\n\n46:12.760 --> 46:14.080\nAwesome.\n\n46:14.080 --> 46:14.720\nOh, nice.\n\n46:14.720 --> 46:18.520\nYou cling to the cylinder.\n\n46:18.520 --> 46:21.960\nWriting the cylinder, it goes to the pit.\n\n46:21.960 --> 46:22.440\nOh.\n\n46:22.440 --> 46:24.600\nJust, now you can ride it back to the cylinder factory\n\n46:24.600 --> 46:27.040\nand, I don't know, from what I know of movies,\n\n46:27.040 --> 46:28.240\nlike, it'll take you to some.\n\n46:28.240 --> 46:29.760\nWhy am I, why am I riding one of these cylinders?\n\n46:29.760 --> 46:32.240\nBecause you're just thrown onto one.\n\n46:32.240 --> 46:35.880\nAre we, are we, we're still friends, right?\n\n46:35.880 --> 46:38.320\nYou're not so sure anymore.\n\n46:38.320 --> 46:39.320\nIs it gnome tossing?\n\n46:39.320 --> 46:42.440\nIt's considered highly, like, highly, like, not PC.\n\n46:42.440 --> 46:43.280\nI'm a little drunk.\n\n46:43.280 --> 46:43.780\nOK.\n\n46:43.780 --> 46:44.640\nSharpie.\n\n46:44.640 --> 46:47.080\nYou can see the largest ship of the fleet\n\n46:47.080 --> 46:49.520\nfloating directly above the pit.\n\n46:49.520 --> 46:51.880\nThe cylindrical constructs float into the air\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:53.520\nand avoid the barbarians.\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:56.560\nThey spin in a great torrent before descending into the pit.\n\n46:56.560 --> 46:57.800\nJeff, you're with these cylinders.\n\n46:57.800 --> 46:58.840\nYou're going into the pit.\n\n46:58.840 --> 46:59.640\nTerrific.\n\n46:59.640 --> 47:01.800\nAs they lift out of the pit, you can see,\n\n47:01.800 --> 47:03.480\nthey seem to be floating something.\n\n47:03.480 --> 47:06.880\nIt's a large, dark, humanoid shape, a golem,\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:09.800\nbut larger than any golem you've ever seen.\n\n47:09.800 --> 47:12.880\nIt looks like it can easily level a city, such as Atlanta.\n\n47:17.160 --> 47:19.720\nIt's the flying ship fires off a mass of harpoons,\n\n47:19.720 --> 47:22.120\nstriking the golem squarely in the chest.\n\n47:22.120 --> 47:24.600\nYou hear the grinding of gears as the golem is slowly\n\n47:24.600 --> 47:26.520\nbeing reeled in by the ship.\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:29.960\nThe cylindrical army starts to drift back towards the ship\n\n47:29.960 --> 47:32.000\nwith Jeff Abroad.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.400\nYou can, like, try and jump off.\n\n47:33.400 --> 47:34.480\nCan I grab a cylinder?\n\n47:34.480 --> 47:35.920\nYeah.\n\n47:35.920 --> 47:38.240\nYou aren't as good as jumping as you are throwing midgets,\n\n47:38.240 --> 47:39.920\nbut let's see.\n\n47:39.920 --> 47:40.600\nNah, you can't.\n\n47:40.600 --> 47:41.600\nSorry.\n\n47:41.600 --> 47:43.680\nI jump off while the getting's good.\n\n47:43.680 --> 47:44.760\nAll right.\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:46.640\nYou jump off a good 30 feet.\n\n47:46.640 --> 47:47.880\nLet's see if you can tumble.\n\n47:47.880 --> 47:49.840\nI don't want to be sucked on the ship with a golem.\n\n47:49.840 --> 47:50.920\nThat's how you begin.\n\n47:50.920 --> 47:51.920\nI mean, that's an adventure.\n\n47:51.920 --> 47:52.800\nOh, yeah?\n\n47:52.800 --> 47:54.800\nAre you going to leave you behind?\n\n47:54.800 --> 47:55.960\nWell, we'll be split up.\n\n47:55.960 --> 47:57.960\nIt's a fun movie.\n\n47:57.960 --> 47:58.480\nThat's like.\n\n47:58.480 --> 48:00.600\nA plot and B plot.\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:04.120\nShould I stay aboard the thing or whatever you want, ma'am?\n\n48:04.120 --> 48:05.120\nStay?\n\n48:05.120 --> 48:05.880\nAll right.\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:09.160\nI latch onto that cylinder.\n\n48:09.160 --> 48:10.080\nStar Wars, man.\n\n48:10.080 --> 48:10.960\nYeah, yeah.\n\n48:10.960 --> 48:14.240\nThe cylindrical army files into the great ship.\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:14.960\nSee you later.\n\n48:14.960 --> 48:19.160\nI hope you knew what you were doing.\n\n48:19.160 --> 48:21.160\nYou're all alone now, hot shot.\n\n48:24.160 --> 48:28.760\nI can't text Mulraine, right?\n\n48:28.760 --> 48:30.760\nThat doesn't exist yet.\n\n48:30.760 --> 48:32.760\nSo the cylinders are going up into the ship and.\n\n48:32.760 --> 48:33.760\nYeah.\n\n48:33.760 --> 48:34.760\nThat seems like a good.\n\n48:34.760 --> 48:35.760\nThis is a cliffhanger moment.\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:37.760\nGood spot to stop in a show that has to be kind of.\n\n48:37.760 --> 48:41.760\nWhat will happen?\n\n48:41.760 --> 48:45.760\nWhat will happen?\n\n48:45.760 --> 48:49.760\nYeah, Spencer, your dungeon master.\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:51.760\nIf I can make a request.\n\n48:51.760 --> 48:55.760\nI hate to put our fans and followers to work, but I would\n\n48:55.760 --> 48:57.760\nlove to see some artwork about what just happened there with\n\n48:57.760 --> 49:01.760\nthe ship and the golem with the harpoon and me holding onto\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:02.760\na big thermos.\n\n49:02.760 --> 49:04.760\nThis is going to a thing.\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:06.760\nIt's not the first cylinder you've clung to.\n\n49:06.760 --> 49:12.760\nGager.\n\n49:12.760 --> 49:17.760\nBy the power of homophobia.\n\n49:17.760 --> 49:25.760\nI have the cheapness form of making fun of people for the\n\n49:25.760 --> 49:29.760\nway they were born.\n\n49:29.760 --> 49:31.760\nKenesaw Mountain like that.\n\n49:31.760 --> 49:33.760\nHe's very erudite.\n\n49:33.760 --> 49:35.760\nI have a picture going back to his apartment and there's a lot\n\n49:35.760 --> 49:41.760\nof wood shelves and.\n\n49:41.760 --> 49:44.760\nHey, angry, angry.\n\n49:44.760 --> 49:45.760\nCome up here.\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:46.760\nGet up here.\n\n49:46.760 --> 49:47.760\nI want some advice.\n\n49:47.760 --> 49:48.760\nLet's meet.\n\n49:48.760 --> 49:49.760\nLet's meet.\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:51.760\nFamous documentarian.\n\n49:51.760 --> 49:54.760\nWhat is your actual name, sir?\n\n49:54.760 --> 49:56.760\nIt is Nathaniel Mets.\n\n49:56.760 --> 49:57.760\nNathaniel Mets.\n\n49:57.760 --> 49:59.760\nYes, I would expect nothing less.\n\n49:59.760 --> 50:00.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n50:00.760 --> 50:03.760\nAre you starting to notice a similarity of archetypes from\n\n50:03.760 --> 50:05.760\nthese guys who are in Phoenix, but he looks a lot like\n\n50:05.760 --> 50:06.760\nTyler Dandy.\n\n50:06.760 --> 50:07.760\nYeah, there was a cat.\n\n50:07.760 --> 50:10.760\nYeah, there's kind of like a.\n\n50:10.760 --> 50:11.760\nThere's a big.\n\n50:11.760 --> 50:14.760\nThere's an Andy Dick ice tray that.\n\n50:14.760 --> 50:16.760\nThere's a little bit.\n\n50:16.760 --> 50:18.760\nThere's a variation, but it's not.\n\n50:18.760 --> 50:19.760\nThere's a.\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:20.760\nI'm Andy Dick now.\n\n50:20.760 --> 50:25.760\nYou're the more clean cut intellectual.\n\n50:25.760 --> 50:26.760\nThank you.\n\n50:26.760 --> 50:27.760\nThank you.\n\n50:27.760 --> 50:29.760\nI never was in biodome with Polly Shore, right?\n\n50:29.760 --> 50:30.760\nNo, no.\n\n50:30.760 --> 50:31.760\nNothing we know of.\n\n50:31.760 --> 50:33.760\nYou seem like a very well educated man.\n\n50:33.760 --> 50:35.760\nDo you have a degree in something?\n\n50:35.760 --> 50:38.760\nWell, the guy I work with is a very Civil War buff,\n\n50:38.760 --> 50:40.760\nbut you'll you pick up a few things.\n\n50:40.760 --> 50:42.760\nYeah, so you don't have a degree in anything.\n\n50:42.760 --> 50:44.760\nNo, I dropped out of college.\n\n50:44.760 --> 50:46.760\nYeah, what college you go to?\n\n50:46.760 --> 50:49.760\nI went to the University of Georgia at first three years later.\n\n50:49.760 --> 50:55.760\nI transferred to in Atlanta, Georgia State University.\n\n50:55.760 --> 51:00.760\nYeah, the lesser known Panthers.\n\n51:00.760 --> 51:01.760\nOh shit.\n\n51:01.760 --> 51:04.760\nI forgot the Falcons had some kind of crazy game out there.\n\n51:04.760 --> 51:05.760\nYeah, they fucking did.\n\n51:05.760 --> 51:09.760\nI wasn't going to bring it up because I don't I don't think of you as a sports fan and probably\n\n51:09.760 --> 51:10.760\nmost of us.\n\n51:10.760 --> 51:11.760\nI'm not a sports fan nor am I.\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:12.760\nBut that game was insane.\n\n51:12.760 --> 51:15.760\nIt was almost as if they it was kind of an Atlanta moment.\n\n51:15.760 --> 51:19.760\nThey were they were it was all being taken from them and they rose back up.\n\n51:19.760 --> 51:21.760\nWe rose like the south, baby.\n\n51:21.760 --> 51:22.760\nYeah, this is.\n\n51:22.760 --> 51:24.760\nOh, is that what the flag say rise up?\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:25.760\nOh boy.\n\n51:25.760 --> 51:26.760\nWow.\n\n51:26.760 --> 51:28.760\nYou guys really hanging on to that shit.\n\n51:28.760 --> 51:29.760\nThey should.\n\n51:29.760 --> 51:31.760\nI guess I would too.\n\n51:31.760 --> 51:35.760\nI mean, it's I said earlier on our last one in Austin that my name is Jeff Davis and so\n\n51:35.760 --> 51:36.760\nit's a very southern name.\n\n51:36.760 --> 51:40.760\nAnd so I get free stuff from racist store clerks.\n\n51:40.760 --> 51:43.760\nI don't know if I believe that story.\n\n51:43.760 --> 51:44.760\nIt's absolutely true, man.\n\n51:44.760 --> 51:45.760\nIt is absolutely true.\n\n51:45.760 --> 51:48.760\nAnd then the cab driver when I was telling him about the racist guy that gave me the beer\n\n51:48.760 --> 51:51.760\nturned off the meter when I said my name and he wouldn't charge me for it.\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:53.760\nBut it's just a common name.\n\n51:53.760 --> 51:55.760\nIt might as well be like John Jones or something.\n\n51:55.760 --> 51:57.760\nAnd I wonder how Bobby Lee would do here.\n\n51:57.760 --> 52:00.760\nI think Robert E. Lee probably do really good.\n\n52:00.760 --> 52:02.760\nThese funyons are on me.\n\n52:02.760 --> 52:05.760\nBobby Lee.\n\n52:05.760 --> 52:07.760\nAll right, Nathaniel.\n\n52:07.760 --> 52:11.760\nI always bristle when I meet a Nathaniel because I feel like my name is some kind of working\n\n52:11.760 --> 52:13.760\nman's Nathaniel.\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:14.760\nWe're rare though.\n\n52:14.760 --> 52:16.760\nYou got Nathaniel Hawthorne and that's about it.\n\n52:16.760 --> 52:18.760\nYeah, it's like an elitist Daniel.\n\n52:18.760 --> 52:19.760\nI don't know.\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:21.760\nYou never you never were a Nate to your always Nathaniel.\n\n52:21.760 --> 52:25.760\nWell, to people, you know better you are Nate because they get tired of the extra two\n\n52:25.760 --> 52:27.760\nsyllables.\n\n52:27.760 --> 52:30.760\nWhat's the most important thing to take away historically from Atlanta?\n\n52:30.760 --> 52:34.760\nLike what I've made some ham-handed efforts to try to personalize the city in terms of\n\n52:34.760 --> 52:36.760\nreading about its history and Wikipedia.\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:37.760\nBut you've been here.\n\n52:37.760 --> 52:38.760\nYou have a history buff friend.\n\n52:38.760 --> 52:39.760\nYou have no degree.\n\n52:39.760 --> 52:41.760\nYou dropped out of college.\n\n52:41.760 --> 52:44.760\nYou're not afraid to pop off.\n\n52:44.760 --> 52:47.760\nI've heard you're not afraid of politics yourself.\n\n52:47.760 --> 52:49.760\nI don't know anything about them.\n\n52:49.760 --> 52:52.760\nSo it's easy to it's easy to not be afraid of things you don't understand.\n\n52:52.760 --> 52:56.760\nBut I mean, I don't know.\n\n52:56.760 --> 53:00.760\nIs there anything that I haven't considered about Atlanta that you would like the podcast\n\n53:00.760 --> 53:01.760\nlisteners to know?\n\n53:01.760 --> 53:02.760\nWe're drifting through here.\n\n53:02.760 --> 53:03.760\nI don't know.\n\n53:03.760 --> 53:04.760\nWhat's my point?\n\n53:04.760 --> 53:05.760\nI don't know.\n\n53:05.760 --> 53:10.760\nThe most important thing to know about Atlanta is we are an independent people that love\n\n53:10.760 --> 53:13.760\nour liberty and we love our southern heritage.\n\n53:13.760 --> 53:21.760\nNo, apparently we have the Yankees, you know, Atlanteans in the house.\n\n53:21.760 --> 53:25.760\nWhat did you say?\n\n53:25.760 --> 53:28.760\nAre you speaking for yourself?\n\n53:28.760 --> 53:30.760\nBring her up on stage.\n\n53:30.760 --> 53:34.760\nI think there's probably a lot of self-loathing that is required to happen here.\n\n53:34.760 --> 53:39.760\nIt's probably the most progressive of the, you know, I don't know.\n\n53:39.760 --> 53:40.760\nIt's kind of complicated.\n\n53:40.760 --> 53:44.760\nIt feels like one of those things you're not even allowed to talk about as a northerner\n\n53:44.760 --> 53:45.760\npassing through.\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:52.760\nIt's like you guys really own the whole conflict in a way that just, it's not you guys.\n\n53:52.760 --> 53:55.760\nYou eat at McDonald's.\n\n53:55.760 --> 53:58.760\nIs there a lot of racism still kind of visible?\n\n53:58.760 --> 54:02.760\nNo, no, there are not.\n\n54:02.760 --> 54:07.760\nDid I see the guy in the sweater vest?\n\n54:07.760 --> 54:09.760\nNo racism that I've ever seen in Atlanta.\n\n54:09.760 --> 54:14.760\nYou probably have, no, no.\n\n54:14.760 --> 54:16.760\nAre you cheering?\n\n54:16.760 --> 54:18.760\nThey're kind of rooting.\n\n54:18.760 --> 54:21.760\nSo there really is like the noticeable racism.\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:23.760\nLike what form does it take?\n\n54:23.760 --> 54:24.760\nWhat do you see?\n\n54:24.760 --> 54:25.760\nIt's against the whites.\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:26.760\nIt's against the whites?\n\n54:26.760 --> 54:27.760\nThank you.\n\n54:27.760 --> 54:29.760\nOh boy.\n\n54:29.760 --> 54:36.760\nSo you're saying they call that the much maligned reverse racism kind of thing?\n\n54:36.760 --> 54:37.760\nNo.\n\n54:37.760 --> 54:40.760\nNow we've torn this audience in pieces.\n\n54:40.760 --> 54:43.760\nI don't think that guy was speaking for their, that's what I'm saying.\n\n54:43.760 --> 54:44.760\nIt's complicated.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:49.760\nI think there's people that feel obligated to go fuck the whole thing.\n\n54:49.760 --> 54:50.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n54:50.760 --> 54:51.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n54:51.760 --> 54:52.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n54:52.760 --> 54:54.760\nIt's like if you went to some neighborhood in Germany and you were making jokes about,\n\n54:54.760 --> 54:56.760\nlike it's like a joke to other people.\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:58.760\nBut then they're like, no, fuck that.\n\n54:58.760 --> 54:59.760\nGod damn it.\n\n54:59.760 --> 55:00.760\nYou don't understand.\n\n55:00.760 --> 55:02.760\nI was raised taking that shit seriously.\n\n55:02.760 --> 55:08.760\nAnd it's like, it's implagued with the scars of it on either side.\n\n55:08.760 --> 55:12.760\nBut Nathaniel seems to think that it's completely, it's done.\n\n55:12.760 --> 55:13.760\nIt's all over.\n\n55:13.760 --> 55:14.760\nWell, yeah.\n\n55:14.760 --> 55:17.760\nI think the beautiful thing about Atlanta, it's from what I've read, is that you actually\n\n55:17.760 --> 55:19.760\ncan find pockets where you couldn't believe that.\n\n55:19.760 --> 55:24.760\nBecause I'm telling you, maybe, I don't know, Wikipedia was in the business of bullshitting\n\n55:24.760 --> 55:25.760\neverybody.\n\n55:25.760 --> 55:26.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n55:26.760 --> 55:32.760\nBut it was, this was the mecca of like the kind of the historical black college movement.\n\n55:32.760 --> 55:38.760\nLike the civil rights kind of like were happening here before they were supposed to be happening\n\n55:38.760 --> 55:39.760\nall around them.\n\n55:39.760 --> 55:43.760\nAnd you know, there were people in different places cracking eggs in people's heads because\n\n55:43.760 --> 55:45.760\nthey were sitting in the wrong counter and all this shit.\n\n55:45.760 --> 55:49.760\nAnd it was like, Atlanta was trying to get its shit together while trying to maintain\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:50.760\nits identity.\n\n55:50.760 --> 55:54.760\nIt's got to be a very complicated place to have lived back then.\n\n55:54.760 --> 55:57.760\nI don't know what my point is.\n\n55:57.760 --> 55:58.760\nFert!\n\n55:58.760 --> 55:59.760\nFert!\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:00.760\nFert Break!\n\n56:00.760 --> 56:03.760\nI have no idea.\n\n56:03.760 --> 56:06.760\nWhat would be interesting would be to sit down and smoke a joint with somebody that lived\n\n56:06.760 --> 56:08.760\nhere and just like hear the whole thing.\n\n56:08.760 --> 56:10.760\nAnd then you'd only be getting like one percent of the whole story.\n\n56:10.760 --> 56:12.760\nWhy don't we all, why don't we all just pick a place.\n\n56:12.760 --> 56:13.760\nLet's all go smoke a joint.\n\n56:13.760 --> 56:14.760\nI'll go hang out afterwards.\n\n56:14.760 --> 56:16.760\nWe'll get high and we'll talk about race.\n\n56:16.760 --> 56:20.760\nYeah, way to go.\n\n56:20.760 --> 56:21.760\nHarmontown.\n\n56:21.760 --> 56:24.760\nThere should be, there should be a section of Harmontown where we colonize the moon.\n\n56:24.760 --> 56:28.760\nThere would just be a burrow where you can only talk about race.\n\n56:28.760 --> 56:29.760\nRace town.\n\n56:29.760 --> 56:32.760\nIt'll just be called the racial historical district.\n\n56:32.760 --> 56:35.760\nAll the shops have to have a racial theme.\n\n56:35.760 --> 56:39.760\nThey could be racist, they could be anti-racist, but it's just like everything.\n\n56:39.760 --> 56:43.760\nAnd that way it will reduce consciousness of race to like a gimmick.\n\n56:43.760 --> 56:46.760\nLike, so it'll be like, hey, it's the race parade.\n\n56:46.760 --> 56:47.760\nYeah.\n\n56:47.760 --> 56:50.760\nAnd it'll come through the other, but then, you know, the other sections will be, no,\n\n56:50.760 --> 56:52.760\nwe're too busy to hate.\n\n56:52.760 --> 56:54.760\nWhich is, uh, all right.\n\n56:54.760 --> 56:56.760\nSo Nathaniel, what the fuck?\n\n56:56.760 --> 57:02.760\nNo, hey, I only made a scene tonight because I would just want, this is Dan fucking Harmon.\n\n57:02.760 --> 57:08.760\nAnd I have been paying attention to this man and Jeff Davis for six years with laser farts.\n\n57:08.760 --> 57:11.760\nYou don't even deserve to be in this war.\n\n57:11.760 --> 57:17.760\nI, I can't tell you the, how important these two men are to my comedy life.\n\n57:17.760 --> 57:18.760\nYeah.\n\n57:18.760 --> 57:21.760\nHe's not a bad person for loving me.\n\n57:21.760 --> 57:24.760\nSometimes, sometimes he just loved me.\n\n57:24.760 --> 57:25.760\nYeah.\n\n57:25.760 --> 57:31.760\nHey, I've seen this Dan Harmon talk about how, how lonesome he is and how fat and obsessive\n\n57:31.760 --> 57:32.760\nhe is about himself.\n\n57:32.760 --> 57:34.760\nWhich makes me a God and a hero.\n\n57:34.760 --> 57:35.760\nThank you.\n\n57:35.760 --> 57:36.760\nYeah.\n\n57:36.760 --> 57:39.760\nBut you are looking more spelt than I've ever seen you.\n\n57:39.760 --> 57:41.760\nYou are a.\n\n57:41.760 --> 57:42.760\nI'm fat.\n\n57:42.760 --> 57:43.760\nNo.\n\n57:43.760 --> 57:45.760\nYeah.\n\n57:45.760 --> 57:49.760\nYou are a wonderful human being.\n\n57:49.760 --> 57:53.760\nOh, Atlanta.\n\n57:53.760 --> 57:59.760\nI have seen next to myself, this is the most naked man I've ever seen in my life.\n\n57:59.760 --> 58:01.760\nI have seen his ass.\n\n58:01.760 --> 58:04.760\nI've seen his pubis and the links.\n\n58:04.760 --> 58:05.760\nHis pubis?\n\n58:05.760 --> 58:06.760\nYeah.\n\n58:06.760 --> 58:07.760\nPubis.\n\n58:07.760 --> 58:08.760\nThat's right.\n\n58:08.760 --> 58:12.760\nThis educated individual has said pubis on the Harmontown.\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:13.760\nAll right.\n\n58:13.760 --> 58:15.760\nDan, show me pubis.\n\n58:15.760 --> 58:18.760\nYou know Atlanta used to be called Terminus.\n\n58:18.760 --> 58:19.760\nThat was its first name.\n\n58:19.760 --> 58:20.760\nYeah.\n\n58:20.760 --> 58:22.760\nWho was at the intersection of a bunch of railroads.\n\n58:22.760 --> 58:23.760\nThe signal is the film based on.\n\n58:23.760 --> 58:26.760\nIt's kind of like pubis.\n\n58:26.760 --> 58:28.760\nI'm going to exit myself.\n\n58:28.760 --> 58:29.760\nAll right.\n\n58:29.760 --> 58:30.760\nThank you.\n\n58:30.760 --> 58:31.760\nNice.\n\n58:31.760 --> 58:32.760\nYeah.\n\n58:32.760 --> 58:33.760\nThat's the Atlanta spirit.\n\n58:33.760 --> 58:34.760\nYeah.\n\n58:34.760 --> 58:35.760\nThat's called Southern hospitality.\n\n58:35.760 --> 58:36.760\nNone of that Adam Goldberg.\n\n58:36.760 --> 58:37.760\nI'm not leaving kind of shit.\n\n58:37.760 --> 58:38.760\nThank you.\n\n58:38.760 --> 58:39.760\nLet's thank Nathaniel.\n\n58:39.760 --> 58:40.760\nNathaniel Mets.\n\n58:40.760 --> 58:41.760\nYeah.\n\n58:41.760 --> 58:42.760\nI'm on Facebook.\n\n58:42.760 --> 58:43.760\nThere's two different ones, but not.\n\n58:43.760 --> 58:46.760\nDan, I feel like we might have missed an opportunity for you and Nathaniel to wrap together.\n\n58:46.760 --> 58:48.760\nI think it's certainly worth a try.\n\n58:48.760 --> 58:49.760\nYeah.\n\n58:49.760 --> 58:51.760\nNathaniel, you up for the challenge?\n\n58:51.760 --> 58:52.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n58:52.760 --> 58:57.760\nDustin, let's try one of the second new wrap off the email.\n\n58:57.760 --> 58:58.760\nIf you don't mind.\n\n58:58.760 --> 59:00.760\nWell, when do we bring our Rihanna's up?\n\n59:00.760 --> 59:02.760\nWe'll bring them up in a bit.\n\n59:02.760 --> 59:03.760\nOr do you want to do that?\n\n59:03.760 --> 59:04.760\nWell, I don't know.\n\n59:04.760 --> 59:06.760\nI don't know what time it is or what we're dealing with.\n\n59:06.760 --> 59:07.760\nWe're under an umbrella.\n\n59:07.760 --> 59:09.760\nThis is you guys.\n\n59:09.760 --> 59:10.760\nYeah.\n\n59:10.760 --> 59:11.760\nI like this.\n\n59:11.760 --> 59:12.760\nYo.\n\n59:12.760 --> 59:13.760\nYo.\n\n59:13.760 --> 59:14.760\nYo.\n\n59:14.760 --> 59:15.760\nYo.\n\n59:15.760 --> 59:16.760\nYo.\n\n59:16.760 --> 59:17.760\nYo.\n\n59:17.760 --> 59:18.760\nYo.\n\n59:18.760 --> 59:19.760\nYo.\n\n59:19.760 --> 59:20.760\nYo.\n\n59:20.760 --> 59:21.760\nYo.\n\n59:21.760 --> 59:25.760\nThank you for coming, my new friend.\n\n59:25.760 --> 59:29.760\nI like to see you at the railroad's end here in Atlanta, deep in the south.\n\n59:29.760 --> 59:32.760\nI fucked your mama in her pussy in her mouth.\n\n59:32.760 --> 59:34.760\nI like to do things to her deep.\n\n59:34.760 --> 59:36.760\nI like to fuck your mama.\n\n59:36.760 --> 59:37.760\nShe's for keeps.\n\n59:37.760 --> 59:38.760\nI fucked her ass.\n\n59:38.760 --> 59:39.760\nI fucked her face.\n\n59:39.760 --> 59:42.760\nI fucked your mama regardless of her race.\n\n59:42.760 --> 59:44.760\nDan Hormann, how dare you.\n\n59:44.760 --> 59:46.760\nYou are such an undue.\n\n59:46.760 --> 59:51.760\nHow dare you come in my face and wrap about my mama in her place.\n\n59:51.760 --> 59:59.760\nYou need to go back to community and tell Chevy Chase to fuck off that stupid bitch.\n\n59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.760\nThis invitation, that bitch.\n\n01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760\nYo.\n\n01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:16.760\nDidn't come here by plane or car, but good to see you've lowered the bar of rapping.\n\n01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.760\nYou're now incredible.\n\n01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.760\nNow anything I do makes you seem like Jay-Z.\n\n01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.760\nI don't even have to rhyme.\n\n01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.760\nI just have to take it easy.\n\n01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760\nJay-Z rhymes with easy.\n\n01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.760\nI'm Nathaniel.\n\n01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.760\nI'm Nathaniel.\n\n01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.760\nI'm Dan Hormann.\n\n01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760\nI'm not from LA.\n\n01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760\nI'm originally from Minneapolis.\n\n01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760\nOh.\n\n01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760\nNow I move.\n\n01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760\nNo.\n\n01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760\nI move to LA.\n\n01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760\nExposure is the best 101 show.\n\n01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.760\nHow dare they cancel it so quickly.\n\n01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.760\nYou are the greatest man that I've ever known in my life.\n\n01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.760\nD&D isn't pathfinder.\n\n01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.760\nWe need to go.\n\n01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760\nBe a netminder.\n\n01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.760\nThe NHL just came to town.\n\n01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760\nThey left.\n\n01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760\nThis is terrible.\n\n01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.760\nOh.\n\n01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.760\nHe fucking Chris Rocked it.\n\n01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760\nChris Rock might have dropped it.\n\n01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760\nWow.\n\n01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.760\nProbably the least earned mic drop in the history.\n\n01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760\nOr the most.\n\n01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760\nOr the most.\n\n01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.760\nI've done some that were pretty unearned.\n\n01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:33.760\nI think the only less earned one was just a guy working in inventory at the microphone store.\n\n01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.760\nThat was absolutely...\n\n01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.760\nLet's tear this place apart.\n\n01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.760\nThat was pretty special.\n\n01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.760\nWe came on a little after five.\n\n01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.760\nWe're pushing our envelope.\n\n01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.760\nWe got a little bit of time on it.\n\n01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.760\nI think we should because I'm very excited.\n\n01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.760\nThere's a couple of towns we're going to on this tour that I love and we're not going to get to spend any time in.\n\n01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.760\nWe actually have a full evening because we're doing an early show.\n\n01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:20.760\nLet's all find me after the show and let's pick the best place to go eat and get fucked up.\n\n01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760\nWithout breaking into a big place.\n\n01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.760\nWe're all going to take our shirts off, you guys.\n\n01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.760\nThe easiest thing would be to determine now that everyone's listening.\n\n01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:35.760\nIs there a consensus on where we should go?\n\n01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760\nI knew that was going to happen.\n\n01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.760\nWe're going on to the Titty Bar. We have a winner.\n\n01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760\nWait, what?\n\n01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.760\nI think it's like the Jumbo's Clown Room of Atlanta.\n\n01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.760\nIt's a Titty Bar.\n\n01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.760\nWe're old women.\n\n01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.760\nReally?\n\n01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.760\nIt's where strippers go to die.\n\n01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.760\nI think strippers just get up in the morning to die.\n\n01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.760\nThey don't need to go to the Temple of Doom or anything like that.\n\n01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.760\nThis bring her out, gentlemen. She's got seven minutes to live.\n\n01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.760\nShe's chosen a vocation unapproved by society and yet profited on.\n\n01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.760\nShe's on two bottles of Perkiset. Let's get her out.\n\n01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.760\nShe's a victim of institutionalized sexism. Put your hands together for millennia.\n\n01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.760\nMoussela!\n\n01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760\nMoussela.\n\n01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760\nWhat was yours?\n\n01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.760\nMillennia.\n\n01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.760\nMillennia!\n\n01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.760\nShe's a thousand tonight.\n\n01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.760\nMake her feel special.\n\n01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.760\nHer tits are underfoot.\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.760\nOne of the 10% of the strippers to live past her bra size.\n\n01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.760\nStupid. Edit it out.\n\n01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.760\nTrying to connect dots, an idiot.\n\n01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.760\nSeriously, where are we going? We're not going to a Titty Bar.\n\n01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.760\nSome place where there's room for everybody to be...\n\n01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.760\nI shouldn't have put it to the room. We'll never agree.\n\n01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.760\nOh, there's something. You're saying the vortex.\n\n01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760\nWe should just stay here. It's easy, right?\n\n01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760\nWe can't all get in someone's truck.\n\n01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.760\nWe'll certainly do that until people want me to sign stuff, not to be presumptuous.\n\n01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760\nI don't think anyone wants anything signed.\n\n01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760\nI'm from Wisconsin.\n\n01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.760\nBut if you buy anything, I think we'll scoot out that door.\n\n01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.760\nAnd then maybe we'll hang out and have some drinks and we'll hang out.\n\n01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.760\nStupid.\n\n01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.760\nAlright, so now...\n\n01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760\nLet's get the girls back up on stage.\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760\nLet's get Rihanna and Ditto back up here.\n\n01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760\nDianna?

It's so cool.\n\n01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.760\nWell, the community audience was always like,\n\n01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760\nyou get on YouTube and everybody that watched...\n\n01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760\nThere was only two million people that watched it,\n\n01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.760\nbut all of them were better editors than everybody that watched everything else.\n\n01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.760\nPretty interesting.\n\n01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:03.760\nI think I'm doomed to be a lightning rod for a bunch of geniuses.\n\n01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:10.760\nSo I'm going to do my farewell Atlanta rap,\n\n01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.760\nand it's going to be fucking intense.\n\n01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760\nWhat'd you say?\n\n01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.760\nSHarmontown.\n\n01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.760\nEvery time I try to work a suggestion into it, I just...\n\n01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.760\nYou're hamstringing yourself by putting too much stuff on you.\n\n01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.760\nJust speak from the heart, man.\n\n01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.760\nI got to just spit my fire, man.\n\n01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.760\nBackstage in the green room, there's a list of rules of comedy by Bill Hicks,\n\n01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.760\nthe great late comic.\n\n01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.760\nWas he from here?\n\n01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.760\nNo, he's from Texas.\n\n01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.760\nAnd one of them was just like really just like,\n\n01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.760\njust like close your eyes and say something and let it all rip.\n\n01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.760\nBut I broke the first rule on it, or the one he really goes off on.\n\n01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760\nThe first thing I said is, how y'all doing?\n\n01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760\nAnd he hates when people do that.\n\n01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.760\nAnd then Spencer came out and he said, how y'all doing?\n\n01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.760\nAnd that's like when someone doesn't have an opening line,\n\n01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.760\nI broke that rule right off the bat.\n\n01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.760\nSo, you know, I'd say just...\n\n01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.760\nHe'd forgive you, huh?\n\n01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.760\nHe'd forgive you.\n\n01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760\nYeah, he probably would, yeah.\n\n01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760\nHe's

01:06:19.760\nI really like reveal something, even if it's not funny,\n\n01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.760\nbut then it's just sharing the, you know, like the whatever's going on.\n\n01:06:25.760 -->
