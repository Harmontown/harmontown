00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello Atlanta! Georgia, how are you all? I hope you're well. I know I am.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh, you did it! You came to the right place, ladies and gentlemen, please.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Harmon Town is now in session. Put your hands together for the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon!

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
God bless you.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
God bless your railroads. God bless your, your, your airlines.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
God bless Coca-Cola. God bless AT&T Mobility.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
We are, we are in a, we are in an, what's called an Alpha City, Jeff.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
We're in a center of world commerce at Atlanta, Georgia.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
This is a, this is a gigantic, like, global, it's, it's, it's been the nexus of, of American civilization and, and beyond.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm not being, it sounds like I'm being sarcastic, doesn't it?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
If I were from here and someone started saying that, I'd go, what's this, a setup for like, he's going to take a piss on our faces?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
No, I, I, I've been Wikipediaing you today.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
As I do each city we go through, I do a little bit of research and I, I was stricken by the history and the, the fucking human pain and the, and triumph.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It's not funny.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
You should laugh. We're in a comedy club.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm, I'm happy. I say somebody makes you laugh, but truly, like, what, it's a beautiful, beautiful, we're, we're, it's, it's the most historical city in the country.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm going to say that right now.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm not, I'm not an expert.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
What are you basing that on?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, you know, you'd have to go like, well, what about Virginia, Dan? What about Washington DC?

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Fuck politicians. This is a, the, the, the politics is not history. History is blood and humanity.

02:09.000 --> 02:20.000
This play, Atlanta, like, out of, probably out of any city we'll be to on this tour, maybe out of any city in the country, certainly paid the price for the civil war conflict.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Like just sat here and got destroyed.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Like, like, like, like was just in the crossfire because it was at the center of all these railroads.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It was a strategic location for military operations.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
So, you know, this guy, General Sherman, sounds like kind of a dick move.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Just, just because it was on its way to Savannah, right?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
It's just decided Atlanta should be burnt literally to the ground.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Every scrap of it, except for hospitals and churches, quote, Wikipedia.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
So that everyone can sit and go, dear God and, or heal my leg, my house is gone and everything.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
But, but it goes beyond that because I think this is really, really, really interesting.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Like, like, I don't know where we'll go.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And I'm not, I'm not a historian, certainly not a civil war historian, but just reading about that.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm going, okay, so I bet this place got it the worst out of that whole conflict.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I bet the suffering was the worst here.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Like the biggest battles took place around here.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
The crossfire was the worst here.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
The place was burnt to the ground by, by, what's that?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Is this a rival for who got it worse?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Or is that, or is that like a wounded knee, like a Atlanta thing?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Okay, well, you know what?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yes, I'm, yes, thank you.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm not.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Ken Burns, everybody.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Ken Burns is here.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Hey, I don't come to where you animate photos and tell you which keyframes to set.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm not, I'm not discouraging you calling something out.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm just, I'm just making sure you're maybe agreeing with me or disagreeing with me.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
If you're disagreeing with me, shut up for a second.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Okay, but, but, but if you're agreeing with me, hallelujah.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
But, but, but, but I thought the thing I was stricken by reading about it was, okay, so it just, the place was just raised by this, by this horrible bloody conflict.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
And then the first to bounce back like gigantically and, and, and, and just became like the center of commerce again.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
It's like constantly being punished for being this nexus of civilization.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
And then also because it is a nexus of civilization, like not having the option of being, you know, fucked up.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Like you look at like Flint, Michigan and you go, oh shit, you know, we had an auto plant here and then it closed down.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That's why you're being raped right now.

04:39.000 --> 04:48.000
We're, we're, we're in a city that was ordered to burnt down by a federal empire and then popped right back up again.

04:48.000 --> 04:59.000
And like a game of whack-a-mole and became not only, not only, you know, not only a commercial empire, but, but also like at the forefront of the new south of progression.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And they, they, they coined this phrase, I don't know where it came from.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
It was your, uh, Willie B. Hartzfield, what was that his name?

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
And there's your, your mayor from the forties to the sixties to the fifties when all that shit was going down.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Atlanta was this like pocket of fuck this shit.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Like, like let's, let's, let's make some money and build our houses and like, like do this stuff.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And the phrase too busy to hate got adopted.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
That's sort of a slogan here.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
I don't know if it's how much bullshit it is, but I caught my breath a little bit when I read that too busy to hate, too busy to hate.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
They got too much shit to do.

05:34.000 --> 05:45.000
There's too much reality happening here for them to engage in the idea that, that if you're a black person or white person or if you, you know, whatever you're, wherever you're leaning, it's, it's, there's too much shit to get done.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Too many railroads happening, too many planes coming in.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
They got places to go, too much cargo to offload, you know, too much Coke to make, too much AT&T to mobilize.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Um, and now, and now they're also a media empire as well as a lot of stuff being shot here.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
It's, it's, it's a little, and it's not, you know, there's no, there's no White House here and there's no, uh, it's, uh, but it's, it's, it's the cleavage of our country.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
It's, it's just, it's like down deep, just take a sharpie pen and put it right in there.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
You mean, you mean like the Rockies and the Appalachians would be like the titties?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, I didn't think that hard about it.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
I, I was just trying to think of what, what it is, I didn't want to say vagina because that's like, it's, it's the womb.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
It's the, it's the, it's a, it's a deep, dark, painful, joyful, creative vessel.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You were really busy on the internet in that bus ride today, man.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
No, it's just the hotel lobby.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I went down, I had a kettle one and I pulled up Wikipedia and I said, what is Atlanta?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
And I just, I'm in love.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
We were in Texas, you probably heard me blowing them when we were, when we passed through.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
But I'm not, I'm not, I didn't say, oh, Texas is great for any reasons I'd say Atlanta's great.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Like, like, like Texas, and I also didn't give a shit about Austin.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I was like, Texas, we're in Texas.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Let's talk about my infatuation with Texas.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And the cool thing is we get to spend some time here.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Actually, we were doing an early show because we have to get out of here because Bob Goldway's coming in and, and then.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
It was awesome.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
But we get to, we actually get to spend the, the evening and the night here and not have to get up.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Like I'm not getting on the bus at the crack of dawn or at four AM or whatever.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
That's awesome.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah, yeah, I probably have to write some scripts though.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I think I, I think it's like, I think Fox and CBS.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Do you have to write while you're on the road?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I have to write right now.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I have to, yeah, I, I should have a laptop out and going, fade in.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Natalie's, she's hot, but she's smart.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm feeling like very vulnerable over here because in the club tonight, I normally have a little iPad.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
I have a little iPad and I play music and I put rap beats on so Dan can rap about fucking your mama.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
And, and believe me, it's going to happen tonight.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
As sure as the South will rise again.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
No mama will be unfucked in this country.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And frankly, he will not give a damn.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
And also, my iPad is up there in the booth and Dustin Marshall, our podcast recorders.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm going to have to call out audibles, like a sideline coach.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And I'm going to go like, beat number two.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
So you're accustomed to a little more control.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And I thought that I'm traveling with Jeff and I'm getting to know him.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I've been friends with him for over 10 years.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
You know, we've never been through this experience together.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
And I, I really noticed a tangible difference today because I, I got off the bus and I went to my hotel room.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Like, like Jeff, he can't wear this suit all the time.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Like there are moments when he's like wearing just a sweater.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
But he just looks like this.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And those are his vulnerable moments.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
This is how he sleeps, wearing what I'm wearing.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
For the podcast listeners, I'm dressed like Jerry Mathers in 1990.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Like when he, when they were maybe doing fucking around with a new Leave It To Beaver show.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I, I, I, I'm like a J crew, kind of, kind of, kind of casual.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't know that I've ever seen you in that.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
This is how Jeff cuts his vegetables and dressed like me and sleeps.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And so we rolled to the town of Jeff was wearing his little sweater.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
And he's like, we came to the venue to do the soundcheck.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
And I know that I know this look in his eyes.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Like he's just focused in the, opens the door and he's just walking around.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I was like, Jeff's, Jeff's being snooty.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Like no one getting his way.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Let him, let him, what's, what's, what's happening.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Not snooty because I don't think anyone interacted with you.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
But I could, I cut you a wide path when I see a certain look on your face.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And I was like, I think, what is it?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
What is it? And then, and then I figured out, oh, he doesn't, he's not in his suit.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
He needs to go back and get in his suit.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.000
Here's a soundcheck.

09:37.000 --> 09:37.000
I needed to shave.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
You know, I'm of the, I'm of the feeling that like, I like Frank Sinatra, like,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
he had rules that when you want, when you go on stage, you shave and you wear a suit.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
So I, I, I, I'm the opposite.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
We rolled into the hotel and I was, I was like, I'm going to go have a drink and then we'll go to the venue.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
And Aaron said, you have to change your clothes.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
You, you stink.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You, you look gross.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
You look gross. Your pants are from a different era of, of, of body weight.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
You look like you have a load in your, in your pants.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I go, you just, just she brought all this nice clothes, just changed.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
And I said, I want to have a drink.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
And I actually really said, and I wasn't being ironic.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I said, do you understand that I'm a baby?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
And she, and she went, yes, I do.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm changing you.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
And she made me put on this seafoam sweater and this, these navy blue pants and I feel great and all this stuff.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
But I mean, meanwhile, in a different hotel room, you're going, my clothes give me my power.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So we're, we're opposites there.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I would have come out here in a diaper and I would have just pooped.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And I, I, if no one else had said anything, I wouldn't have known it was a bad thing.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I mean, it's obviously there's a live crowd before a podcast.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm surprised you don't just come out in a, in a bathrobe because like, didn't you?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I should, you used to show up at Paramount for community in a bathrobe, didn't you?

10:53.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
You used to show up at work in pajamas.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Like you were like one of those, who's the crazy brothers that made the matrix and the guy started just dressing like a crazy.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, I was kind of like a lazy, non-gender Wachowski brother.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I'm just looking at my Evernote notepad here.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
My armpit smelled worse in Louisiana.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I wanted you guys to know that.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't know if that's to your credit, but I felt like it was.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Like I felt like the humidity level there.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Like I was something, but I don't think I could ever live in anywhere in Louisiana.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I, I, I caught a little bit of that walking past you and I was like, it was like kind of weird.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
It was like a Coachella Burning Man kind of like, it's got to be a humidity thing.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Like there's certain chemicals in my armpits that don't evaporate in Louisiana quick enough.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
So you're going to get a certain combination there.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
That drug enforcement checkpoint.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
What the fuck?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
This is a created, what were we driving from Texas to Louisiana?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
And there was this sign that said, drug enforcement checkpoint half mile.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
So everyone freaks out cause shocker, we've got weed in the bus.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
There's a reason we're not flying.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Like if we wanted to have to deal, what the fuck?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
A fucking America for God's sake.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
By the way, the irony is I haven't smoked any yet, but I'm just like, I'm going on a tour bus.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm taking my weed that I have, I have a prescription for.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
I get a lot of anxiety and I live in the great state of California.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And I, and if you're out there and you want to ruin our life, go ahead and follow us and pull us over and ruin our life.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But, but, um, I, there's a drug enforcement checkpoint.

12:25.000 --> 12:25.000
Oh, what's that?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
We go and zip the pockets and rezip them.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
And what are we supposed to do?

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Alright, everyone hold your weed and wait until there's flashing lights and then we'll all flush it together and all this stuff.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And then nothing happens and nothing keeps happening.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
And somebody gets on the internet and looks it up.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
They put these signs up, they're like tricks.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Because obviously nothing could be more unconstitutional than a drug enforcement checkpoint.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
But they put the signs up and anyone who gets off on the next exit, they follow.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's like hipster profiling.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Like they figured out a new way to detect.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I think also they're looking for people that are ditching stuff out the window.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I feel like that, that just maybe is some enterprising drug addict who just put that sign up.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
I mean, everybody's like, I need it, got it, need it, got it.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah, well my, my, I stayed in a handicapped room in Louisiana.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
This was weird.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
There's, there's physically challenged people.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Those walls were thin.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
We had, we keep getting adjacent rooms and I keep learning like a little bit about your like, you know, diurnal patterns and things like that.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Dan and Erin checked in right next to me in the wall was razor thin.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Tissue paper thin.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And I, and the first thing I hear them doing is Dan just going,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I was like, and we opened up a little doors.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
We had the doors that opened up and like, are you, are you seeing Jurassic Park in there?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah. Because it feels like, like when you get off a tour bus you're like, you know.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.080
You're like, you know, it's very constrictive and like you say everywhere you go like there doesn't need to be dinosaurs there for it to

13:57.080 --> 13:59.080
Feel majestic

14:08.200 --> 14:14.840
I don't know I feel John Williams II when I get off of a vehicle and I feel like I'm looking at a

14:15.720 --> 14:17.720
brontosaurus

14:17.720 --> 14:23.960
Handicap it said a handicap room and then there was a button. I don't know if I hope there's somebody in the room that is

14:24.520 --> 14:29.960
Physically, I don't know what the latest phrase is but physically challenged that knows what it means when you have a

14:30.920 --> 14:36.520
Handicap room and there's a like a doorbell button outside the hotel room and it says press it hold for five seconds

14:36.520 --> 14:39.320
What happens then can handicap people just rob me like?

14:39.960 --> 14:44.680
Look if you if you they don't need a key, they're not that special

14:44.680 --> 14:48.440
They don't get to just rob. They're like a handrail in your shower with a special no

14:48.440 --> 14:53.480
There was nothing the only thing and this is on them not me. I'm like the air conditioner didn't work

14:54.920 --> 14:57.960
So the joke becomes obvious like oh, it's a handicap room

15:00.040 --> 15:04.760
That's not my fault that they that they did that this guy's getting up to leave because

15:06.600 --> 15:08.600
He's walking at least well

15:10.200 --> 15:13.960
He's walking to his his crutches and he's gonna throw one at me

15:13.960 --> 15:19.720
I I know it's here. Nothing again. Obviously. I'm nothing but an advocate of of anyone that

15:20.360 --> 15:23.960
Wants to feel special about anything. Should we bring Spencer up here to have oh, yeah

15:23.960 --> 15:27.480
Yeah, let's get Spencer up because we're our time we gotta we gotta do a bullet train Harmontown

15:27.480 --> 15:31.480
For those of you who do not know Spencer. He's our dungeon master extraordinaire. Welcome dungeon master

15:32.120 --> 15:34.120
Spencer

15:35.320 --> 15:37.320
He has his own musical theme

15:37.320 --> 15:43.240
How's it going oh Mike Mike Mike, how's it going?

15:46.120 --> 15:50.120
We can't get a mic stand for Spencer. He's got to roll dice and I don't need a mic stand

15:50.200 --> 15:54.280
Oh, he can use mine. I'll go I'll go I'll go El Fresco. I guess I need a mic stand

15:58.200 --> 16:03.800
So Spencer, how have you been enjoying your trip so far? I've been enjoying my trip so far

16:03.800 --> 16:12.120
He's very good. I doubt there's anyone here who doesn't listen to the podcast but

16:13.080 --> 16:18.120
And I don't think there's anything we can do to make you enjoy the show if you're if you've if you've stumbled in here going

16:18.920 --> 16:20.920
I want to see some comedy

16:21.480 --> 16:23.400
But just to

16:23.400 --> 16:25.800
Refresh you Spencer is our dungeon master from

16:26.520 --> 16:30.440
We asked if there was a dungeon master in the audience in Los Angeles his hand shot up

16:30.440 --> 16:34.200
And a friendship was born and now he's on the tour bus with us

16:34.200 --> 16:39.400
And we're learning all kinds of things about him and the other shoes not dropping you keep you keep waiting to find out that he

16:40.040 --> 16:43.800
You know always like hangs his underwear at his

16:44.680 --> 16:49.160
I'm a little worried because I sleep like a like a beautiful little angel baby on those tour buses

16:49.160 --> 16:53.000
And I think everyone else has too but every time I come out to the to the front area

16:53.000 --> 17:01.880
You're you're wide awake. You're having trouble sleeping on that button. Yeah, and every time you're sleeping. I'm just standing there

17:03.000 --> 17:06.360
A lot of the documentary footage is going to be night vision of you

17:08.840 --> 17:10.840
Just a spencer cam

17:12.920 --> 17:14.920
Sleep

17:15.560 --> 17:17.080
That's right Jeff

17:17.080 --> 17:22.600
No, we had a lovely little moment that was documented. I believe in some sort of uh video footage and uh

17:22.600 --> 17:26.920
In some pictures where he taught me how to play. He actually took me through my character sheet

17:26.920 --> 17:32.680
Which I've never really bothered to learn about and for his trouble. I told I taught him a few chords on the ukulele. Yeah, it's beautiful

17:32.680 --> 17:34.680
It's great. What's happening? It's great

17:35.400 --> 17:37.960
It's a lot like the city of Atlanta this relationship

17:38.840 --> 17:42.600
It just keeps building itself up and then randomly being burnt down by things

17:42.600 --> 17:52.200
I did I tell you Jeff that again in uh 1917 Atlanta was just caught fire just out of sense memory. Uh,

17:52.760 --> 17:54.760
It's just a sad city that just

17:55.480 --> 17:57.480
We should be burnt

17:57.720 --> 18:01.800
And they just burnt to the ground again and they built it up again. What were the circumstances of that?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
I died. I thought someone someone dropped up

18:06.760 --> 18:10.440
All right, that's it we should we should we should journey there

18:10.440 --> 18:17.160
Um, we also here's the most progressive thing about Atlanta their first race riot 1906

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Now that's thinking ahead

18:21.400 --> 18:23.560
That's some that's a way before it was cool. Yeah

18:24.760 --> 18:28.360
I mean, you don't even need to have a race riot back that it was like you could just have races

18:28.440 --> 18:32.920
It's just being oppressed and stuff and they had a full-blown riot 1906 like a bunch of people died

18:32.920 --> 18:38.440
This is this is a this is the this is a future city. They're always they're always looking down the road

18:38.440 --> 18:44.040
Um, I think it's the longest you've gone on a Harmontown show without fucking somebody's mother. I don't want to force it, but uh

18:46.760 --> 18:52.840
Fuck fuck okay general Sherman's my name. Okay. All right. Yeah, we have we have we have a couple new beats. Dustin. Let's tell you what

18:54.120 --> 18:56.760
You what? Oh good. Oh, you know the chorus

18:57.560 --> 18:59.000
What's your name?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Deanna, okay. We'll bring you up in a bit deanna

19:01.160 --> 19:04.920
Oh, yeah, uh, that's a very fantastic. Let's bring her up now because we're gonna do a reader's digest

19:04.920 --> 19:09.160
We're we're should we shouldn't we take this?

19:09.320 --> 19:13.640
I could just uh, she could share my mic. Oh my god. Oh because because oh, okay

19:15.720 --> 19:18.200
All right, he just brings out a giant banana

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
There's a pencil

19:22.600 --> 19:25.640
This is a great room by the way, I'm sure I'm sure some of you come here all the time

19:25.640 --> 19:29.080
This is obviously like a comedy mecca. Yeah, it's cool. I like it a lot. It's really cool

19:29.080 --> 19:35.400
People are seem very proud of being here. I got a lot of cities do Austin's very proud of being Austin

19:35.400 --> 19:39.560
But like like people I know that are from Atlanta like they they're really proud to be from here

19:39.560 --> 19:42.680
Then that they should be I I tell it's it's it's it's

19:43.800 --> 19:47.160
I mean on paper. It's not I haven't watched around and touched any of the fountains, but

19:48.200 --> 19:52.200
From what I've read they should be all right. Dustin pick one of the new we got two new beats for you

19:52.360 --> 19:54.360
Are

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
Uh

19:57.080 --> 19:59.080
Yeah, you're gonna need the handicap room

20:00.920 --> 20:02.920
Yeah, do you like that one?

20:03.320 --> 20:08.520
Well, it doesn't all right. Well, this is just a warm-up. We won't use the ante yet. No, this is fucking Sherman's mama

20:08.760 --> 20:12.920
Oh, okay. Did you like that beat? Do you want to try the other one too? I don't know. Well, I don't like general Sherman

20:12.920 --> 20:15.640
So fuck, you know, let's let's let's give him a shitty beat

20:17.560 --> 20:20.520
Yo yo yo yo yo

20:21.560 --> 20:23.560
Yo yo yo

20:23.560 --> 20:31.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm general Sherman from the union army. My butt is full of peanut butter. It's swarmy

20:32.200 --> 20:36.920
I don't like my mom. I fuck her. I'm a big doodoo head. I'm a asshole

20:37.800 --> 20:41.640
I belong to a machine an empire that does what it pleases to me

20:42.760 --> 20:46.760
Stupid I'm trying to get historical. I'm general Sherman. I'm retarded coal

20:48.120 --> 20:50.120
Wait, I thought you were I thought you were

20:50.120 --> 20:53.560
Just general general Sherman wrote that rap badly

20:54.680 --> 20:56.680
He doesn't know what he's doing

20:57.160 --> 21:00.120
Hey, he's just he just burns shit down when he when it's in the way

21:01.080 --> 21:05.880
He's an asshole. Oh, so that wasn't you fucking Sherman's mom. That was sure. That wasn't me fucking up a rap either

21:05.960 --> 21:14.040
That was that was that was that was I did that artistically like like like that was a meta commentary on what Sherman's rap would be like

21:14.040 --> 21:21.400
It would be a disaster. He it would be uncoordinated and brutal and and and and the word retarded would be in it

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
Because he's an insensitive fucking

21:24.520 --> 21:30.840
Like loud like like like like decking himself in in metals. He didn't earn. He got a butt full of peanut butter

21:32.040 --> 21:34.040
He's swarmy swarmy

21:35.160 --> 21:38.280
I assume there's like ants are coming because of the peanut butter. I don't know

21:38.280 --> 21:44.840
Well, all I know is fuck you general Sherman. Where was he from? Is it a town we're going to on the tour?

21:45.400 --> 21:47.400
I don't know Ken Burns from Pittsburgh

21:48.760 --> 21:51.720
Huh, does it anyone know where we're Sherman from?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.520
Yeah

21:54.520 --> 21:56.520
We just know he's not from Chutes Tooth Mountain

22:00.360 --> 22:02.360
Tennessee Mountain

22:03.160 --> 22:05.160
Tennessee, Tennessee

22:05.160 --> 22:10.040
It's right on the Tennessee Arkansas border. What was it Kenesaw?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.840
Kenesaw what happened there? What happened?

22:20.280 --> 22:21.880
Oh

22:21.880 --> 22:26.680
And you just like a brewing rocks and the bullets were faster because it was downhill

22:26.680 --> 22:32.680
You guys should just should have just stayed on the mountain

22:40.200 --> 22:44.680
I bet yeah, I'm from Los Angeles. Like we didn't get a whole lot of civil war history stuff in our

22:45.400 --> 22:48.200
No, it's just like uh Frank Sinatra date rape someone there

22:50.600 --> 22:53.560
There's the the battle of the four doors to Dan

22:53.560 --> 23:00.520
She wanted to get out he kept she she kept saying no but not quite no and then back then it didn't work and it's like

23:00.760 --> 23:03.320
Yeah, you know and then Sammy said something but then

23:04.280 --> 23:09.560
Uh, yeah, not a lot of history there just a lot of a lot a lot a lot of disney disney disney uh

23:12.440 --> 23:14.440
Places where disney ate

23:14.840 --> 23:16.840
Edit it out. All right

23:17.160 --> 23:22.360
Uh, well, we're over here. Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, uh, what are we looking at time-wise?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.360
Why is it going to...

23:23.360 --> 23:25.360
Four, thirty-six.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.360
Five, thirty-six.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.360
Five, thirty-six.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.360
He's not the time master.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.360
Six, thirty-six.

23:32.360 --> 23:37.360
Spencer, could you be the voice of the skeleton crotch above me?

23:37.360 --> 23:40.360
Every time I go to the skeleton crotch,

23:40.360 --> 23:42.360
for those of you listening in podcast land,

23:42.360 --> 23:46.360
one of the cool things about the room is that there is a full human skeleton

23:46.360 --> 23:55.360
poised the crow-style above my head with its pelvis directly above my scalp.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.360
I'm about to take a calcified shit all over you.

23:58.360 --> 24:02.360
What do you think about tonight's gig, skeleton crotch?

24:02.360 --> 24:07.360
You look like you're dying, and I'm dead.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.360
I'm getting heckled by the skeleton crotch.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.360
He's jealous of your flesh.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
Yeah, it's five thirty-seven.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.360
Alright, alright.

24:18.360 --> 24:24.360
So, like, anything else to talk about that I haven't already looked up on my phone?

24:24.360 --> 24:26.360
I tried to...

24:26.360 --> 24:29.360
We got our angry bus driver, we got the drug enforcement,

24:29.360 --> 24:31.360
we got my armpit Simone Worson Louisiana.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.360
We have to get our bus driver on the stage at some point.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.360
I want to start creating a constitution for Harmontown.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.360
There's a discussion of this on the Harmontown Forum,

24:39.360 --> 24:48.360
and I think that it has to be based on the rule that everybody gets to do whatever they want,

24:48.360 --> 24:50.360
which I think is kind of a...

24:50.360 --> 24:56.360
It could theoretically end there because the only exception of that would be if you doing whatever you want

24:56.360 --> 24:59.360
gets in the way of someone else doing whatever they want.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.360
So, for instance, if I want to punch you in the face,

25:02.360 --> 25:07.360
but you don't want to get punched in the face, then we have a complication there.

25:07.360 --> 25:12.360
So, then that's where my brain kind of locks up because I'm not a politician and I don't really...

25:12.360 --> 25:14.360
We have to...

25:14.360 --> 25:16.360
Fight to the death?

25:16.360 --> 25:18.360
Any time there's a conflict.

25:18.360 --> 25:23.360
Tina Turner from Thunderdom is in the back of the river.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.360
But if he didn't want to get punched in the face,

25:25.360 --> 25:28.360
then all I have to do is come up to him, punch him in the face,

25:28.360 --> 25:32.360
and then he goes, I didn't want that, and I go, well, fight to the death.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.360
That doesn't seem like a nerd's paradise.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.360
That seems like my middle school.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.360
It seems like exactly how that worked.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.360
There has to be some kind of...

25:41.360 --> 25:42.360
We'll figure it out.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.360
We don't have to figure out here in Atlanta,

25:44.360 --> 25:46.360
although I can't think of a better place to figure it out.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.360
This is a society that...

25:49.360 --> 25:51.360
We were in a place called Phoenix,

25:51.360 --> 25:53.360
but this is literally a...

25:53.360 --> 25:55.360
Not literally.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.360
This is truly like if there was a city that should be called Phoenix,

25:58.360 --> 26:01.360
like, come on, it keeps burning down and they keep...

26:01.360 --> 26:05.360
So last time was 1907? Or 17?

26:05.360 --> 26:06.360
17.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.360
So you guys are due?

26:08.360 --> 26:10.360
Over two.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.360
You guys are late. You're late on a burn down.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.360
Not funny to them. Not funny to them.

26:15.360 --> 26:18.360
Lots of grandparents died.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.360
The Sherman thing is still pretty fresh, too.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
It's an open wound here.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.360
Well...

26:24.360 --> 26:25.360
Yeah.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.360
Yeah, and also, it's like the Civil War.

26:27.360 --> 26:32.360
It's like, well, if you're... I'm sure there's a lot of complicated feelings about it

26:32.360 --> 26:35.360
because if you live down this way,

26:35.360 --> 26:38.360
way down south of the Chattahoochee,

26:41.360 --> 26:44.360
it gets politically hotter than a Hoochee-Coochee.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.360
Rap beat.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.360
Rap beat number two.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.360
Rap beat.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.360
Yo, Southern Rap.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.360
It's a hotbed of political intrigue.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.360
I fucked your mama like her name was Cheryl T.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.360
I fucked her in a bed on TV.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.360
I fucked your mama with the face of my knee.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
I went like this. I went like that.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.360
I put on my coat. I chipped my hat.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.360
I said, madam, Southern hospitality.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.360
That fucked your mama. That's reality.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.360
I walked out the door. I said, fuck it.

27:20.360 --> 27:23.360
I fucked your mama. I put her in a bucket.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.360
I took the bucket. I threw it to the moon.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.360
I said, so long, bitch. Maybe I'll see you soon.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.360
Then I went back up there and saw her again.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.360
I fucked your mama eight times. Then fucked her ten.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.360
I talked...

27:38.360 --> 27:40.360
Atlanta. Atlanta.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
I fucked your mama.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.360
Glass of Fanta.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.360
Coca-Cola. A-T-N-T.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.360
Railroad Town.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
Race Riots.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.360
Railroad Town.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.360
Home Depot.

28:04.360 --> 28:05.360
Home Depot.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.360
Home Depot.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.360
Home Depot.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.360
Home Depot.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.360
Home Depot. Delta Airlines.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.360
Delta, Delta Airlines.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.360
UPS. UPS.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
I'm not rhyming. I'm just...

28:23.360 --> 28:25.360
Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.360
Yeah.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.360
I mean, I've never been prouder.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.360
Not only is that just good stuff.

28:35.360 --> 28:38.360
It's just top grade entertainment, what you just did right there.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.360
I just have to put myself in the shoes of somebody

28:40.360 --> 28:43.360
that's only heard this on the podcast.

28:43.360 --> 28:47.360
Not having seen you do it in a little seafoam green sweater.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.360
In your little J-Crew pants.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.360
Do your little bit toddler dance.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.360
You really are a baby.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.360
You sing about Pee-Pee's and Poo-Poo's.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.360
And my desire to fuck your mama

29:03.360 --> 29:06.360
was really just a desire to get back inside the womb.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.360
That's the last thing you did was be inside a pussy.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.360
But that's what humanity is trying to do.

29:12.360 --> 29:15.360
You saw 2001, it ends with the...

29:15.360 --> 29:18.360
I never got that, although I saw it when I was like...

29:18.360 --> 29:20.360
No, it's like man is evolving, you know?

29:20.360 --> 29:22.360
Then we create robots, robots turn on us,

29:22.360 --> 29:24.360
but then we become something different.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.360
We become a space baby.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.360
The monolith represents the kind of like plot points

29:30.360 --> 29:33.360
of civil humanity, like the apes are...

29:33.360 --> 29:35.360
They touch it and then one of them figures out,

29:35.360 --> 29:37.360
oh, I can use this femur bone to beat another ape.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.360
And then it throws it in the air, it becomes a space station.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.360
Because everything that happened in between is meaningless.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.360
It's all just beating each other with femur bones.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.360
And then we're on the space station, it's as far as we get.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.360
And then machines gain sentience and start murdering

29:50.360 --> 29:53.360
with their femur bone, i.e. airlock doors.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.360
And we move on and we become...

29:59.360 --> 30:01.360
You know, it's a thankless job being sentient.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.360
It continues.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.360
I'm getting applause from the...

30:05.360 --> 30:07.360
From Kennesaw Mountain guy.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.360
Ken Burns signed off on that synomphus.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.360
He loves Kubrick.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.360
He loves Kubrick.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.360
So you like Kennesaw and Kubrick?

30:16.360 --> 30:21.360
Kennesaw and Kubrick and a flip-flop margarita.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.360
I'm Jimmy Buffett, hanging out.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.360
Pleased to meet you, senorita.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.360
What do you think about Jimmy Buffett?

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
I don't know.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.360
Yeah, he makes my fucking skin fall.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.360
I know his flip-flops are too fragile.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.360
Oh yeah, because he's stepping on a pop-top.

30:38.360 --> 30:43.360
Yeah, if you can't step on a pop-top and blow it out of a flip-flop, you're an asshole.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.360
You're gonna get better flip-flops and don't burden the listener.

30:46.360 --> 30:51.360
I've got a problem about the plot point that the big crisis is that he's lost a salt shaker.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.360
Because they're everywhere.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.360
You can get salt.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.360
He's lazy, he's hanging out.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.360
This isn't ancient Greece.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.360
We have to carry Brian in a sack.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.360
It was the 70s we were hanging out, right?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.360
Yeah, he blows.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.360
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.360
I don't think you're gonna find a lot of people sticking up for Jimmy Buffett.

31:09.360 --> 31:15.360
I think the only voice you'll hear sticking up for Jimmy Buffett is like a laminated menu.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.360
It won't be a human being, it'll just be a menu.

31:19.360 --> 31:27.360
Like a fictional guy named MJ McFunn and Hannah.

31:27.360 --> 31:32.360
Do you think we could use our country rift to see if you could try to outdo a Jimmy Buffett lyric?

31:32.360 --> 31:34.360
Just off the top of your head?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.360
I can do anything here. I'm in Atlanta.

31:37.360 --> 31:49.360
This is the city that invented rebirth.

31:49.360 --> 31:54.360
Well, I'm proud to be from a city where your mama has big titties.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.360
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.360
That's all right.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.360
I can't say city.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.360
I'm sorry.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.360
Let's start it one more time.

32:04.360 --> 32:10.360
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do a song about the history of Atlanta.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.360
He's taking out his giant phone.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.360
Well choo-choo, railroad town.

32:20.360 --> 32:28.360
Atlanta's going down in the heart of the south where the freight trains come through.

32:28.360 --> 32:32.360
And I'll tell you one thing, brother.

32:32.360 --> 32:38.360
I'd rather have another Northern Army come on through.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.360
Did I wrap through with through?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.360
I can't, I can't write that.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.360
Sorry, Ryan Scheme was all fucked up.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.360
I take back the Jimmy Buffett comics.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.360
I'm not a country, country guy.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.360
And I don't think Jimmy Buffett is either.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.360
And we're wasting their time.

32:51.360 --> 32:54.360
And Bobcat Goldthwaite is outside the door going like...

32:54.360 --> 32:56.360
I don't, I don't understand.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.360
I have to do a mic check.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.360
Deanna was it?

32:59.360 --> 33:01.360
You wanna come join us on stage?

33:01.360 --> 33:03.360
Yeah, Deanna.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.360
Rubbermaid!

33:11.360 --> 33:13.360
That's Lou on the left.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.360
That's another corporate headquarters that's, yeah.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.360
Rubbermaid.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.360
Fuck Nike.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.360
Fuck Nike.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.360
Is Nike here?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.360
Oh Adidas.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.360
Adult swims here.

33:27.360 --> 33:31.360
My friends from Adult Swim.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.360
My good friend, Ted Turner, who I hang out with all the time.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.360
Started a media empire here.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
And the home star runner guys are here.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.360
Oh yeah, yeah, the Chapman brothers.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.360
You guys...

33:43.360 --> 33:45.360
Hello Deanna, do you have a microphone?

33:45.360 --> 33:47.360
Spencer, Spencer, will you share?

33:47.360 --> 33:49.360
Thank you, Spencer.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
Well now we're just...

33:51.360 --> 33:56.360
Cuddle up with Spencer over there, Deanna.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.360
How do you say we practice one and then we play a little DVD?

33:59.360 --> 34:01.360
For those of you who haven't been listening, we've been podcasting daily

34:01.360 --> 34:03.360
and we've kind of put a little theme song together

34:03.360 --> 34:05.360
that we're, you know, kind of, you know...

34:05.360 --> 34:06.360
We're building it.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.360
...growing as we go from town to town.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.360
We have a chorus that's come on down to Harmontown.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.360
Turn your frown upside down.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.360
P is yellow, poop is brown.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.360
Come on down to Harmontown.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.360
Dustin, would you play for us?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.360
We'll get one out of the way that way because we need it.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.360
And then we'll, yeah, we'll play a little DVD and then we'll...

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
Oh yeah.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.360
Okay.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.360
Yeah, it's happening, Spencer.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.360
It's happening.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.360
Deanna, you're going to wake up tonight with a night vision,

34:36.360 --> 34:39.360
Spencer, looming over your bed.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.360
All right, take it away, Deanna.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.360
See what you know here. See if you got it.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.360
Come on down to Harmontown.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.360
Turn that frown upside down.

34:48.360 --> 34:51.360
P is yellow, poop is brown.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.360
So come on down to Harmontown.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.360
Yo, placeholder rap.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.360
I'm just practicing this.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.360
It doesn't matter if it's crap,

35:00.360 --> 35:02.360
but usually a high quality rapper.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
I do all kinds of things.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.360
You wouldn't believe it.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.360
Rapper, rapper.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.360
I'm rapping some more.

35:09.360 --> 35:10.360
More placeholders.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.360
It doesn't matter what I do.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.360
Just rapping.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.360
I'll do a good one later.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.360
Phoning it in because Q and U.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.360
Come on down to Harmontown.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.360
I don't even know if you're in that frown upside down.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.360
P is yellow, poop is brown.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.360
So come on down to Harmontown.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.360
We got that. We got that. Cool.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.360
That's Deanna, everybody.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.360
Fantastic.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.360
So far, we've found a sexy young lady,

35:39.360 --> 35:41.360
every city, to come up and be our ditto

35:41.360 --> 35:44.360
to our ersatz Eminem.

35:44.360 --> 35:48.360
Is there anybody that got overlooked?

35:48.360 --> 35:51.360
We have room on one mic for probably

35:51.360 --> 35:53.360
two vocal champions.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.360
Is it a guy?

35:55.360 --> 35:57.360
He's pointing at his girlfriend.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.360
Come on on the stage. Get up here.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.360
What's your name?

36:03.360 --> 36:06.360
Jackie? Are you drunk?

36:06.360 --> 36:08.360
You almost took a spill there.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
It's a tough stare.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.360
You got crazy Herman Masters on.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.360
Don't lash out.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.360
Those people had their city burnt twice.

36:16.360 --> 36:19.360
Yeah, because everyone's fucked up.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.360
That's been hard for me.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.360
Jackie, was it? Hello, Jackie. Nice to have you here.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.360
Alright.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.360
Jackie, what's your deal?

36:29.360 --> 36:31.360
Jackie, are you born and raised in Atlanta?

36:31.360 --> 36:33.360
I was, am.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.360
You were an am. And what do you do?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.360
I'm a musician.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.360
Really? What do you play?

36:38.360 --> 36:39.360
Piano.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.360
I often have a piano on stage.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.360
Everywhere we go, our crowd is much more intelligent

36:43.360 --> 36:49.360
than your average Bobby Lee crowd, I would say.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.360
So we do want to say, if you're listening in Nashville

36:51.360 --> 36:53.360
when we come there, hey, bring your guitar.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.360
Bring your bugle. Bring an upright piano.

36:55.360 --> 37:00.360
Bring your little electronic piano.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.360
Let's have a drum circle in Nashville.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.360
Alright, so now we brought her all the way up from the back.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.360
We still have to play D&D.

37:09.360 --> 37:13.360
Well, maybe, Spencer, can we have a Greek chorus?

37:13.360 --> 37:15.360
Is it hard to edit?

37:15.360 --> 37:17.360
Yeah.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.360
Alright, now, I'll do the awkward thing.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.360
What was your name?

37:20.360 --> 37:21.360
Jackie.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.360
Okay, Jackie, when we finish playing D&D,

37:23.360 --> 37:25.360
can you come back up and could you and Deanna

37:25.360 --> 37:32.360
like relax and have an Atlanta gimlet?

37:32.360 --> 37:35.360
I'm saying sit down.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.360
I'm sorry.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.360
So that you're not standing up here when we're playing D&D.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.360
We're making up the show as we go.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.360
Thank you, Jackie and Deanna.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.360
We'll bring you up in a second.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.360
We'll bring you back up in a while.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.360
Careful.

37:47.360 --> 37:53.360
What we lack in coordination, we make up for in spirit.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.360
And courtesy. We're very polite about that.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.360
Alright, so Spencer, if you would, keep us up to date

37:58.360 --> 38:00.360
on where we are on our campaign.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.360
When we last met, our heroes had just finished

38:03.360 --> 38:05.360
destroying a grip of constructs in what they discovered

38:05.360 --> 38:08.360
to be a long destroyed ruins of a town.

38:08.360 --> 38:11.360
Mulraine was out of sorts and excused himself.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.360
It was just then that Sharpie tripped over an old chart book.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.360
Within the covers of the book, Mulraine's dark past

38:17.360 --> 38:18.360
opened before them.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.360
Once a female and a mother of five,

38:20.360 --> 38:22.360
the arranger awoke to discover her children

38:22.360 --> 38:23.360
perish in a blaze.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.360
Her mind broken, she sought out a nude identity.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.360
Happening upon a cursed belt of gender switching,

38:28.360 --> 38:30.360
the grief-stricken Mulraine took on a new,

38:30.360 --> 38:34.360
more masculine role and buried his past with his children.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.360
Needless to say, Sharpie and Quark were a bit surprised,

38:37.360 --> 38:40.360
but being victims of xenophobia as well,

38:40.360 --> 38:43.360
decided to accept their strange friend's stranger past.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.360
The group headed west towards the barbarian encampment,

38:46.360 --> 38:48.360
hoping that Mango's barbarians could hold up

38:48.360 --> 38:50.360
against the dark's fleet.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.360
Alright, yeah.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.360
Because of the limited microphones,

38:53.360 --> 38:57.360
we should have Erin McGathy come up and play her character

38:57.360 --> 39:00.360
really quickly and then make up a reasonable leave.

39:00.360 --> 39:04.360
Is Erin here?

39:04.360 --> 39:05.360
Erin?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.360
Come on on, Erin McGathy.

39:06.360 --> 39:13.360
Erin is selling merchandise.

39:13.360 --> 39:17.360
She didn't knit them or anything.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.360
She had all the T-shirts.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.360
She's been the merchandise czar for the whole thing

39:21.360 --> 39:23.360
and is like, merchandise maven.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.360
Share a mic with me.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.360
Sure.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.360
I'll probably be out there afterwards.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.360
Even though it's illegal.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.360
So if you're a cop or your friend is a cop,

39:34.360 --> 39:36.360
try to give us 20 minutes,

39:36.360 --> 39:38.360
because if you buy something, we'll sign it out there,

39:38.360 --> 39:41.360
like out those doors and you can buy shit out there too.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.360
But we're kind of cramped here

39:42.360 --> 39:46.360
and trying to do everything we can for everyone.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.360
Just don't burn your city anymore.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.360
Just calm down.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.360
Alright, so...

39:52.360 --> 39:54.360
So we're heading west toward the butchalot encampment.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.360
Headed west?

39:56.360 --> 39:58.360
Yes.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.360
How long a journey is this?

40:00.360 --> 40:01.360
Who knows?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.360
Perhaps days, perhaps hours,

40:03.360 --> 40:07.360
perhaps, you know, a certain amount of time.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.360
Other than that.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.360
I say we move as quickly as possible

40:11.360 --> 40:14.360
because your father's in danger, Sharpie.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.360
That reminds me, gentlemen,

40:16.360 --> 40:21.360
I have something to do in a different area.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.360
I may be trying to find a belt

40:23.360 --> 40:25.360
to turn me back into a woman,

40:25.360 --> 40:29.360
but I did reveal in our last installment

40:29.360 --> 40:31.360
that I might have feelings for Sharpie.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.360
I'm embarrassed.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.360
Please try to forget what I said,

40:33.360 --> 40:35.360
but I must depart.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.360
So you're a man and you want to turn into a woman

40:38.360 --> 40:41.360
so you can be with a guy that you love.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.360
Ha-ha, adventure!

40:44.360 --> 40:46.360
Alright, Erin McGathy.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.360
Wait, we can do that?

40:51.360 --> 40:53.360
We can just tell her to leave?

40:53.360 --> 40:55.360
There's not a lot of mics up here.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.360
Jeff's eyes just lit up.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.360
You make your way back through the hilly butts expanse.

41:01.360 --> 41:05.360
You hurry in the hopes of making it to camp in time.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.360
As you get closer, you can hear the screams

41:07.360 --> 41:09.360
and shouts of pitched battle.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.360
The war cries of barbarians.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.360
Sorry.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.360
Reaching the crest of a foothill.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.360
I can't do both things.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.360
You can see Yellow Camp.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.360
The grand yellow tent is splattered with blood.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.360
A massive pit near the camp seems to be the locus of the warring forces.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.360
Corpses of gnolls and humans lie strewn across the ground

41:27.360 --> 41:29.360
and you can see destroyed cylinder constructs

41:29.360 --> 41:32.360
ripped to shreds and lying in piles of metal cylinders.

41:32.360 --> 41:36.360
You can see a massive line of at least 60 cylinders

41:36.360 --> 41:40.360
pushing back the barbarians towards the rim of this massive pit.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.360
Pit!

41:41.360 --> 41:44.360
You recall this excavation site from before

41:44.360 --> 41:47.360
when they discussed they were digging for something.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.360
So there's a bunch of those cylinders that we fought

41:50.360 --> 41:53.360
and they're pushing the barbarians towards the pit.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.360
I get so confused.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.360
I know, man.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.360
I get so confused.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.360
Somebody on Twitter or Instagram told me

42:00.360 --> 42:03.360
that maybe my flaming dagger is one of the shards, possibly.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.360
I saw that conversation.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.360
Are we been neglecting a shard the whole time?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.360
Why don't we just do a quick check?

42:09.360 --> 42:10.360
Shard check!

42:11.360 --> 42:13.360
There's no such thing as that.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.360
We take his emerald dagger and hold it near our shards

42:16.360 --> 42:19.360
to see if there's some kind of similarity.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.360
Just to make some guy on Twitter happy.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.360
Like I said, I recently rented Temple of Doom

42:24.360 --> 42:27.360
and they hold the rocks together, they glow, so...

42:27.360 --> 42:29.360
We hold our shards together.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.360
Nothing happens.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.360
Shit.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.360
All right.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.360
Well, you hear that out there, Twitter guy?

42:33.360 --> 42:34.360
Yeah.

42:34.360 --> 42:35.360
Fuck you!

42:35.360 --> 42:36.360
In your theories.

42:37.360 --> 42:40.360
What do you have to say about that guy on Twitter, Skeleton Crotch?

42:40.360 --> 42:41.360
Ghost fart.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.360
All right.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.360
So, you're looking at a fight.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.360
Yeah, we're looking at a big fight.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.360
Then apparently...

42:48.360 --> 42:51.360
I mean, it was hard to kill three cylinders,

42:51.360 --> 42:53.360
but there's a big line of them now.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.360
Yeah.

42:54.360 --> 42:55.360
Do I see my dad?

42:55.360 --> 42:56.360
You don't.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.360
You grow worried.

43:00.360 --> 43:01.360
You're just standing.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.360
I'm stumped, man, people.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.360
I'm stumped.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
I'm stumped.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.360
I'm stumped.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.360
I'm stumped.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.360
I'm stumped, man, people are dying.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.360
By the way, if anybody out there is a D&D fan

43:12.360 --> 43:13.360
who knows what to do

43:13.360 --> 43:15.360
and has any advice, please help us out.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.360
Make a perception check.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.360
Was that Ken Burns?

43:22.360 --> 43:23.360
Ken-

43:23.360 --> 43:24.360
Ken-

43:24.360 --> 43:25.360
Ken-

43:25.360 --> 43:26.360
Ken-

43:26.360 --> 43:27.360
Ken-

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
Ken-

43:28.360 --> 43:29.360
Ken-

43:29.360 --> 43:30.360
Ken-

43:30.360 --> 43:31.360
Ken-

43:31.360 --> 43:32.360
Ken-

43:32.360 --> 43:33.360
Ken-

43:33.360 --> 43:34.360
Ken-

43:34.360 --> 43:35.360
Ken-

43:35.360 --> 43:36.360
Ken-

43:36.360 --> 43:37.360
Ken-

43:37.360 --> 43:39.360
Ken-

43:39.360 --> 43:40.360
Ken-

43:40.360 --> 43:41.360
Ken-

43:41.360 --> 43:42.360
Ken-

43:42.360 --> 43:43.360
Ken-

43:43.360 --> 43:44.360
Ken-

43:44.360 --> 43:45.360
Ken-

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
Ken-

43:46.360 --> 43:47.360
Ken-

43:47.360 --> 43:48.360
Ken-

43:48.360 --> 43:50.360
Ken-

43:50.360 --> 43:51.360
Ken-

43:51.360 --> 43:52.360
Ken-

43:52.360 --> 43:53.360
Ken-

43:53.360 --> 43:54.360
Ken-

43:54.360 --> 43:55.360
Ken-

43:55.360 --> 43:56.360
Ken-

43:56.360 --> 43:57.360
Ken-

43:57.360 --> 43:58.360
Ken-

43:58.360 --> 43:59.360
Ken-

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
Ken-

44:00.360 --> 44:01.360
Ken-

44:01.360 --> 44:02.360
Ken-

44:02.360 --> 44:03.360
Ken-

44:03.360 --> 44:04.360
Ken-

44:04.360 --> 44:05.360
Ken-

44:05.360 --> 44:06.360
Ken-

44:06.360 --> 44:07.520
I run towards the pit.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.520
As you charge towards the fight, plumes of jet black smoke

44:10.520 --> 44:12.600
plummet to the ground, waylaying you.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.960
And they quickly coalesce into physical forms.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.880
Two small mounds of yellowed flesh stand before you.

44:17.880 --> 44:19.760
The creatures have humanoid heads and scrawny,

44:19.760 --> 44:21.840
clomped limbs, but lack legs.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.000
You recognize these as the very lowest beasts

44:24.000 --> 44:26.080
of the hell, the pits of hell.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.360
What's this beast called?

44:27.360 --> 44:28.200
You don't know.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.560
Oh.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.520
You just see them sometimes.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.120
Are they blocking my way to the pits?

44:33.120 --> 44:34.120
They're blocking your way.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.320
They slither towards you menacingly.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.080
I, uh, power attack.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.760
All right, uh, three, one to three.

44:40.760 --> 44:41.240
Pick one.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.400
One, two, three.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.360
Three?

44:44.360 --> 44:45.680
Nice, you got a critical hit.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.640
Oh, yeah.

44:47.640 --> 44:49.680
I'm not even, I'm not even getting the wool damage.

44:52.920 --> 44:56.240
You slice through the lemur just as easily as it were butter.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.680
It dissolves into black smoke.

44:57.680 --> 44:58.120
Thank you.

44:58.120 --> 45:00.440
I interrupt the cosmos to remind you to tip will,

45:00.440 --> 45:07.360
who's, uh, who's, uh, serving you back there.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.200
Oh, this is, this guy just came up and poured his booze.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.440
This is fantastic.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.160
I know, but yeah.

45:12.160 --> 45:12.680
Thank you, Will.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.480
That'll be all.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.200
The other demon approaches Sharpie.

45:17.200 --> 45:20.720
He swings a vicious claw, but you managed to dodge.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.360
Oh, so today's my lucky day so far.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.280
Yeah, all right.

45:23.280 --> 45:25.480
Those hellish creatures were created by the cylinders?

45:25.480 --> 45:26.040
You don't know.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.680
They just came from the sky.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.800
Is it, is it possible to take my small friend and throw him

45:30.800 --> 45:31.840
onto one of the cylinders?

45:31.840 --> 45:34.760
Like maybe you could ride on one and see, like, maybe it'll,

45:34.760 --> 45:36.360
maybe it'll go, go back to the cylinder.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.120
It's really insensitive, man.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.360
What's your strength?

45:41.360 --> 45:45.000
It says, um, a million now.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.240
Nine, oh.

45:48.240 --> 45:51.560
But he's small.

45:51.560 --> 45:54.400
You managed to throw him a good 12 feet.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.600
Whoa.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.160
He doesn't land atop a cylinder, but he does hit it

45:59.160 --> 45:59.760
in the side.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.480
You can try and cling on if you'd like.

46:01.480 --> 46:04.640
I, I, I, I cling to a cylinder.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.000
Jeff, what's your climb check?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.440
You know climb on the skills?

46:07.440 --> 46:08.960
Climb on the skills.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.680
We talked about it.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.880
Climb on the skills.

46:10.880 --> 46:11.480
Hold up.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.760
Climb is, I have a nine.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.080
Awesome.

46:14.080 --> 46:14.720
Oh, nice.

46:14.720 --> 46:18.520
You cling to the cylinder.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.960
Writing the cylinder, it goes to the pit.

46:21.960 --> 46:22.440
Oh.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.600
Just, now you can ride it back to the cylinder factory

46:24.600 --> 46:27.040
and, I don't know, from what I know of movies,

46:27.040 --> 46:28.240
like, it'll take you to some.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.760
Why am I, why am I riding one of these cylinders?

46:29.760 --> 46:32.240
Because you're just thrown onto one.

46:32.240 --> 46:35.880
Are we, are we, we're still friends, right?

46:35.880 --> 46:38.320
You're not so sure anymore.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.320
Is it gnome tossing?

46:39.320 --> 46:42.440
It's considered highly, like, highly, like, not PC.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.280
I'm a little drunk.

46:43.280 --> 46:43.780
OK.

46:43.780 --> 46:44.640
Sharpie.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.080
You can see the largest ship of the fleet

46:47.080 --> 46:49.520
floating directly above the pit.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.880
The cylindrical constructs float into the air

46:51.880 --> 46:53.520
and avoid the barbarians.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.560
They spin in a great torrent before descending into the pit.

46:56.560 --> 46:57.800
Jeff, you're with these cylinders.

46:57.800 --> 46:58.840
You're going into the pit.

46:58.840 --> 46:59.640
Terrific.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.800
As they lift out of the pit, you can see,

47:01.800 --> 47:03.480
they seem to be floating something.

47:03.480 --> 47:06.880
It's a large, dark, humanoid shape, a golem,

47:06.880 --> 47:09.800
but larger than any golem you've ever seen.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.880
It looks like it can easily level a city, such as Atlanta.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.720
It's the flying ship fires off a mass of harpoons,

47:19.720 --> 47:22.120
striking the golem squarely in the chest.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.600
You hear the grinding of gears as the golem is slowly

47:24.600 --> 47:26.520
being reeled in by the ship.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.960
The cylindrical army starts to drift back towards the ship

47:29.960 --> 47:32.000
with Jeff Abroad.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.400
You can, like, try and jump off.

47:33.400 --> 47:34.480
Can I grab a cylinder?

47:34.480 --> 47:35.920
Yeah.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.240
You aren't as good as jumping as you are throwing midgets,

47:38.240 --> 47:39.920
but let's see.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.600
Nah, you can't.

47:40.600 --> 47:41.600
Sorry.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.680
I jump off while the getting's good.

47:43.680 --> 47:44.760
All right.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.640
You jump off a good 30 feet.

47:46.640 --> 47:47.880
Let's see if you can tumble.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.840
I don't want to be sucked on the ship with a golem.

47:49.840 --> 47:50.920
That's how you begin.

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
I mean, that's an adventure.

47:51.920 --> 47:52.800
Oh, yeah?

47:52.800 --> 47:54.800
Are you going to leave you behind?

47:54.800 --> 47:55.960
Well, we'll be split up.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.960
It's a fun movie.

47:57.960 --> 47:58.480
That's like.

47:58.480 --> 48:00.600
A plot and B plot.

48:00.600 --> 48:04.120
Should I stay aboard the thing or whatever you want, ma'am?

48:04.120 --> 48:05.120
Stay?

48:05.120 --> 48:05.880
All right.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.160
I latch onto that cylinder.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.080
Star Wars, man.

48:10.080 --> 48:10.960
Yeah, yeah.

48:10.960 --> 48:14.240
The cylindrical army files into the great ship.

48:14.240 --> 48:14.960
See you later.

48:14.960 --> 48:19.160
I hope you knew what you were doing.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.160
You're all alone now, hot shot.

48:24.160 --> 48:28.760
I can't text Mulraine, right?

48:28.760 --> 48:30.760
That doesn't exist yet.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.760
So the cylinders are going up into the ship and.

48:32.760 --> 48:33.760
Yeah.

48:33.760 --> 48:34.760
That seems like a good.

48:34.760 --> 48:35.760
This is a cliffhanger moment.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.760
Good spot to stop in a show that has to be kind of.

48:37.760 --> 48:41.760
What will happen?

48:41.760 --> 48:45.760
What will happen?

48:45.760 --> 48:49.760
Yeah, Spencer, your dungeon master.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.760
If I can make a request.

48:51.760 --> 48:55.760
I hate to put our fans and followers to work, but I would

48:55.760 --> 48:57.760
love to see some artwork about what just happened there with

48:57.760 --> 49:01.760
the ship and the golem with the harpoon and me holding onto

49:01.760 --> 49:02.760
a big thermos.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.760
This is going to a thing.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.760
It's not the first cylinder you've clung to.

49:06.760 --> 49:12.760
Gager.

49:12.760 --> 49:17.760
By the power of homophobia.

49:17.760 --> 49:25.760
I have the cheapness form of making fun of people for the

49:25.760 --> 49:29.760
way they were born.

49:29.760 --> 49:31.760
Kenesaw Mountain like that.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.760
He's very erudite.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.760
I have a picture going back to his apartment and there's a lot

49:35.760 --> 49:41.760
of wood shelves and.

49:41.760 --> 49:44.760
Hey, angry, angry.

49:44.760 --> 49:45.760
Come up here.

49:45.760 --> 49:46.760
Get up here.

49:46.760 --> 49:47.760
I want some advice.

49:47.760 --> 49:48.760
Let's meet.

49:48.760 --> 49:49.760
Let's meet.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.760
Famous documentarian.

49:51.760 --> 49:54.760
What is your actual name, sir?

49:54.760 --> 49:56.760
It is Nathaniel Mets.

49:56.760 --> 49:57.760
Nathaniel Mets.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.760
Yes, I would expect nothing less.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
Absolutely.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.760
Are you starting to notice a similarity of archetypes from

50:03.760 --> 50:05.760
these guys who are in Phoenix, but he looks a lot like

50:05.760 --> 50:06.760
Tyler Dandy.

50:06.760 --> 50:07.760
Yeah, there was a cat.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.760
Yeah, there's kind of like a.

50:10.760 --> 50:11.760
There's a big.

50:11.760 --> 50:14.760
There's an Andy Dick ice tray that.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.760
There's a little bit.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.760
There's a variation, but it's not.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
There's a.

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
I'm Andy Dick now.

50:20.760 --> 50:25.760
You're the more clean cut intellectual.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.760
Thank you.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.760
Thank you.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.760
I never was in biodome with Polly Shore, right?

50:29.760 --> 50:30.760
No, no.

50:30.760 --> 50:31.760
Nothing we know of.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.760
You seem like a very well educated man.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.760
Do you have a degree in something?

50:35.760 --> 50:38.760
Well, the guy I work with is a very Civil War buff,

50:38.760 --> 50:40.760
but you'll you pick up a few things.

50:40.760 --> 50:42.760
Yeah, so you don't have a degree in anything.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.760
No, I dropped out of college.

50:44.760 --> 50:46.760
Yeah, what college you go to?

50:46.760 --> 50:49.760
I went to the University of Georgia at first three years later.

50:49.760 --> 50:55.760
I transferred to in Atlanta, Georgia State University.

50:55.760 --> 51:00.760
Yeah, the lesser known Panthers.

51:00.760 --> 51:01.760
Oh shit.

51:01.760 --> 51:04.760
I forgot the Falcons had some kind of crazy game out there.

51:04.760 --> 51:05.760
Yeah, they fucking did.

51:05.760 --> 51:09.760
I wasn't going to bring it up because I don't I don't think of you as a sports fan and probably

51:09.760 --> 51:10.760
most of us.

51:10.760 --> 51:11.760
I'm not a sports fan nor am I.

51:11.760 --> 51:12.760
But that game was insane.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.760
It was almost as if they it was kind of an Atlanta moment.

51:15.760 --> 51:19.760
They were they were it was all being taken from them and they rose back up.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.760
We rose like the south, baby.

51:21.760 --> 51:22.760
Yeah, this is.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.760
Oh, is that what the flag say rise up?

51:24.760 --> 51:25.760
Oh boy.

51:25.760 --> 51:26.760
Wow.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.760
You guys really hanging on to that shit.

51:28.760 --> 51:29.760
They should.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.760
I guess I would too.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.760
I mean, it's I said earlier on our last one in Austin that my name is Jeff Davis and so

51:35.760 --> 51:36.760
it's a very southern name.

51:36.760 --> 51:40.760
And so I get free stuff from racist store clerks.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.760
I don't know if I believe that story.

51:43.760 --> 51:44.760
It's absolutely true, man.

51:44.760 --> 51:45.760
It is absolutely true.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.760
And then the cab driver when I was telling him about the racist guy that gave me the beer

51:48.760 --> 51:51.760
turned off the meter when I said my name and he wouldn't charge me for it.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.760
But it's just a common name.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
It might as well be like John Jones or something.

51:55.760 --> 51:57.760
And I wonder how Bobby Lee would do here.

51:57.760 --> 52:00.760
I think Robert E. Lee probably do really good.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.760
These funyons are on me.

52:02.760 --> 52:05.760
Bobby Lee.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.760
All right, Nathaniel.

52:07.760 --> 52:11.760
I always bristle when I meet a Nathaniel because I feel like my name is some kind of working

52:11.760 --> 52:13.760
man's Nathaniel.

52:13.760 --> 52:14.760
We're rare though.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.760
You got Nathaniel Hawthorne and that's about it.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.760
Yeah, it's like an elitist Daniel.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.760
I don't know.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.760
You never you never were a Nate to your always Nathaniel.

52:21.760 --> 52:25.760
Well, to people, you know better you are Nate because they get tired of the extra two

52:25.760 --> 52:27.760
syllables.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.760
What's the most important thing to take away historically from Atlanta?

52:30.760 --> 52:34.760
Like what I've made some ham-handed efforts to try to personalize the city in terms of

52:34.760 --> 52:36.760
reading about its history and Wikipedia.

52:36.760 --> 52:37.760
But you've been here.

52:37.760 --> 52:38.760
You have a history buff friend.

52:38.760 --> 52:39.760
You have no degree.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.760
You dropped out of college.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.760
You're not afraid to pop off.

52:44.760 --> 52:47.760
I've heard you're not afraid of politics yourself.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.760
I don't know anything about them.

52:49.760 --> 52:52.760
So it's easy to it's easy to not be afraid of things you don't understand.

52:52.760 --> 52:56.760
But I mean, I don't know.

52:56.760 --> 53:00.760
Is there anything that I haven't considered about Atlanta that you would like the podcast

53:00.760 --> 53:01.760
listeners to know?

53:01.760 --> 53:02.760
We're drifting through here.

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
I don't know.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.760
What's my point?

53:04.760 --> 53:05.760
I don't know.

53:05.760 --> 53:10.760
The most important thing to know about Atlanta is we are an independent people that love

53:10.760 --> 53:13.760
our liberty and we love our southern heritage.

53:13.760 --> 53:21.760
No, apparently we have the Yankees, you know, Atlanteans in the house.

53:21.760 --> 53:25.760
What did you say?

53:25.760 --> 53:28.760
Are you speaking for yourself?

53:28.760 --> 53:30.760
Bring her up on stage.

53:30.760 --> 53:34.760
I think there's probably a lot of self-loathing that is required to happen here.

53:34.760 --> 53:39.760
It's probably the most progressive of the, you know, I don't know.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
It's kind of complicated.

53:40.760 --> 53:44.760
It feels like one of those things you're not even allowed to talk about as a northerner

53:44.760 --> 53:45.760
passing through.

53:45.760 --> 53:52.760
It's like you guys really own the whole conflict in a way that just, it's not you guys.

53:52.760 --> 53:55.760
You eat at McDonald's.

53:55.760 --> 53:58.760
Is there a lot of racism still kind of visible?

53:58.760 --> 54:02.760
No, no, there are not.

54:02.760 --> 54:07.760
Did I see the guy in the sweater vest?

54:07.760 --> 54:09.760
No racism that I've ever seen in Atlanta.

54:09.760 --> 54:14.760
You probably have, no, no.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.760
Are you cheering?

54:16.760 --> 54:18.760
They're kind of rooting.

54:18.760 --> 54:21.760
So there really is like the noticeable racism.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.760
Like what form does it take?

54:23.760 --> 54:24.760
What do you see?

54:24.760 --> 54:25.760
It's against the whites.

54:25.760 --> 54:26.760
It's against the whites?

54:26.760 --> 54:27.760
Thank you.

54:27.760 --> 54:29.760
Oh boy.

54:29.760 --> 54:36.760
So you're saying they call that the much maligned reverse racism kind of thing?

54:36.760 --> 54:37.760
No.

54:37.760 --> 54:40.760
Now we've torn this audience in pieces.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.760
I don't think that guy was speaking for their, that's what I'm saying.

54:43.760 --> 54:44.760
It's complicated.

54:44.760 --> 54:49.760
I think there's people that feel obligated to go fuck the whole thing.

54:49.760 --> 54:50.760
I'm sorry.

54:50.760 --> 54:51.760
I'm sorry.

54:51.760 --> 54:52.760
I'm sorry.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.760
It's like if you went to some neighborhood in Germany and you were making jokes about,

54:54.760 --> 54:56.760
like it's like a joke to other people.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.760
But then they're like, no, fuck that.

54:58.760 --> 54:59.760
God damn it.

54:59.760 --> 55:00.760
You don't understand.

55:00.760 --> 55:02.760
I was raised taking that shit seriously.

55:02.760 --> 55:08.760
And it's like, it's implagued with the scars of it on either side.

55:08.760 --> 55:12.760
But Nathaniel seems to think that it's completely, it's done.

55:12.760 --> 55:13.760
It's all over.

55:13.760 --> 55:14.760
Well, yeah.

55:14.760 --> 55:17.760
I think the beautiful thing about Atlanta, it's from what I've read, is that you actually

55:17.760 --> 55:19.760
can find pockets where you couldn't believe that.

55:19.760 --> 55:24.760
Because I'm telling you, maybe, I don't know, Wikipedia was in the business of bullshitting

55:24.760 --> 55:25.760
everybody.

55:25.760 --> 55:26.760
Absolutely.

55:26.760 --> 55:32.760
But it was, this was the mecca of like the kind of the historical black college movement.

55:32.760 --> 55:38.760
Like the civil rights kind of like were happening here before they were supposed to be happening

55:38.760 --> 55:39.760
all around them.

55:39.760 --> 55:43.760
And you know, there were people in different places cracking eggs in people's heads because

55:43.760 --> 55:45.760
they were sitting in the wrong counter and all this shit.

55:45.760 --> 55:49.760
And it was like, Atlanta was trying to get its shit together while trying to maintain

55:49.760 --> 55:50.760
its identity.

55:50.760 --> 55:54.760
It's got to be a very complicated place to have lived back then.

55:54.760 --> 55:57.760
I don't know what my point is.

55:57.760 --> 55:58.760
Fert!

55:58.760 --> 55:59.760
Fert!

55:59.760 --> 56:00.760
Fert Break!

56:00.760 --> 56:03.760
I have no idea.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.760
What would be interesting would be to sit down and smoke a joint with somebody that lived

56:06.760 --> 56:08.760
here and just like hear the whole thing.

56:08.760 --> 56:10.760
And then you'd only be getting like one percent of the whole story.

56:10.760 --> 56:12.760
Why don't we all, why don't we all just pick a place.

56:12.760 --> 56:13.760
Let's all go smoke a joint.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.760
I'll go hang out afterwards.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.760
We'll get high and we'll talk about race.

56:16.760 --> 56:20.760
Yeah, way to go.

56:20.760 --> 56:21.760
Harmontown.

56:21.760 --> 56:24.760
There should be, there should be a section of Harmontown where we colonize the moon.

56:24.760 --> 56:28.760
There would just be a burrow where you can only talk about race.

56:28.760 --> 56:29.760
Race town.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.760
It'll just be called the racial historical district.

56:32.760 --> 56:35.760
All the shops have to have a racial theme.

56:35.760 --> 56:39.760
They could be racist, they could be anti-racist, but it's just like everything.

56:39.760 --> 56:43.760
And that way it will reduce consciousness of race to like a gimmick.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.760
Like, so it'll be like, hey, it's the race parade.

56:46.760 --> 56:47.760
Yeah.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.760
And it'll come through the other, but then, you know, the other sections will be, no,

56:50.760 --> 56:52.760
we're too busy to hate.

56:52.760 --> 56:54.760
Which is, uh, all right.

56:54.760 --> 56:56.760
So Nathaniel, what the fuck?

56:56.760 --> 57:02.760
No, hey, I only made a scene tonight because I would just want, this is Dan fucking Harmon.

57:02.760 --> 57:08.760
And I have been paying attention to this man and Jeff Davis for six years with laser farts.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.760
You don't even deserve to be in this war.

57:11.760 --> 57:17.760
I, I can't tell you the, how important these two men are to my comedy life.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.760
Yeah.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.760
He's not a bad person for loving me.

57:21.760 --> 57:24.760
Sometimes, sometimes he just loved me.

57:24.760 --> 57:25.760
Yeah.

57:25.760 --> 57:31.760
Hey, I've seen this Dan Harmon talk about how, how lonesome he is and how fat and obsessive

57:31.760 --> 57:32.760
he is about himself.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.760
Which makes me a God and a hero.

57:34.760 --> 57:35.760
Thank you.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.760
Yeah.

57:36.760 --> 57:39.760
But you are looking more spelt than I've ever seen you.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.760
You are a.

57:41.760 --> 57:42.760
I'm fat.

57:42.760 --> 57:43.760
No.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.760
Yeah.

57:45.760 --> 57:49.760
You are a wonderful human being.

57:49.760 --> 57:53.760
Oh, Atlanta.

57:53.760 --> 57:59.760
I have seen next to myself, this is the most naked man I've ever seen in my life.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.760
I have seen his ass.

58:01.760 --> 58:04.760
I've seen his pubis and the links.

58:04.760 --> 58:05.760
His pubis?

58:05.760 --> 58:06.760
Yeah.

58:06.760 --> 58:07.760
Pubis.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.760
That's right.

58:08.760 --> 58:12.760
This educated individual has said pubis on the Harmontown.

58:12.760 --> 58:13.760
All right.

58:13.760 --> 58:15.760
Dan, show me pubis.

58:15.760 --> 58:18.760
You know Atlanta used to be called Terminus.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.760
That was its first name.

58:19.760 --> 58:20.760
Yeah.

58:20.760 --> 58:22.760
Who was at the intersection of a bunch of railroads.

58:22.760 --> 58:23.760
The signal is the film based on.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.760
It's kind of like pubis.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.760
I'm going to exit myself.

58:28.760 --> 58:29.760
All right.

58:29.760 --> 58:30.760
Thank you.

58:30.760 --> 58:31.760
Nice.

58:31.760 --> 58:32.760
Yeah.

58:32.760 --> 58:33.760
That's the Atlanta spirit.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.760
Yeah.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
That's called Southern hospitality.

58:35.760 --> 58:36.760
None of that Adam Goldberg.

58:36.760 --> 58:37.760
I'm not leaving kind of shit.

58:37.760 --> 58:38.760
Thank you.

58:38.760 --> 58:39.760
Let's thank Nathaniel.

58:39.760 --> 58:40.760
Nathaniel Mets.

58:40.760 --> 58:41.760
Yeah.

58:41.760 --> 58:42.760
I'm on Facebook.

58:42.760 --> 58:43.760
There's two different ones, but not.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.760
Dan, I feel like we might have missed an opportunity for you and Nathaniel to wrap together.

58:46.760 --> 58:48.760
I think it's certainly worth a try.

58:48.760 --> 58:49.760
Yeah.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.760
Nathaniel, you up for the challenge?

58:51.760 --> 58:52.760
Absolutely.

58:52.760 --> 58:57.760
Dustin, let's try one of the second new wrap off the email.

58:57.760 --> 58:58.760
If you don't mind.

58:58.760 --> 59:00.760
Well, when do we bring our Rihanna's up?

59:00.760 --> 59:02.760
We'll bring them up in a bit.

59:02.760 --> 59:03.760
Or do you want to do that?

59:03.760 --> 59:04.760
Well, I don't know.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.760
I don't know what time it is or what we're dealing with.

59:06.760 --> 59:07.760
We're under an umbrella.

59:07.760 --> 59:09.760
This is you guys.

59:09.760 --> 59:10.760
Yeah.

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
I like this.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.760
Yo.

59:12.760 --> 59:13.760
Yo.

59:13.760 --> 59:14.760
Yo.

59:14.760 --> 59:15.760
Yo.

59:15.760 --> 59:16.760
Yo.

59:16.760 --> 59:17.760
Yo.

59:17.760 --> 59:18.760
Yo.

59:18.760 --> 59:19.760
Yo.

59:19.760 --> 59:20.760
Yo.

59:20.760 --> 59:21.760
Yo.

59:21.760 --> 59:25.760
Thank you for coming, my new friend.

59:25.760 --> 59:29.760
I like to see you at the railroad's end here in Atlanta, deep in the south.

59:29.760 --> 59:32.760
I fucked your mama in her pussy in her mouth.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.760
I like to do things to her deep.

59:34.760 --> 59:36.760
I like to fuck your mama.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.760
She's for keeps.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.760
I fucked her ass.

59:38.760 --> 59:39.760
I fucked her face.

59:39.760 --> 59:42.760
I fucked your mama regardless of her race.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.760
Dan Hormann, how dare you.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.760
You are such an undue.

59:46.760 --> 59:51.760
How dare you come in my face and wrap about my mama in her place.

59:51.760 --> 59:59.760
You need to go back to community and tell Chevy Chase to fuck off that stupid bitch.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.760
This invitation, that bitch.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760
Yo.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:16.760
Didn't come here by plane or car, but good to see you've lowered the bar of rapping.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.760
You're now incredible.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.760
Now anything I do makes you seem like Jay-Z.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.760
I don't even have to rhyme.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.760
I just have to take it easy.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760
Jay-Z rhymes with easy.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.760
I'm Nathaniel.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.760
I'm Nathaniel.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.760
I'm Dan Hormann.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760
I'm not from LA.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760
I'm originally from Minneapolis.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760
Oh.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760
Now I move.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760
No.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760
I move to LA.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760
Exposure is the best 101 show.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.760
How dare they cancel it so quickly.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.760
You are the greatest man that I've ever known in my life.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.760
D&D isn't pathfinder.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.760
We need to go.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760
Be a netminder.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.760
The NHL just came to town.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760
They left.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760
This is terrible.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.760
Oh.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.760
He fucking Chris Rocked it.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760
Chris Rock might have dropped it.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760
Wow.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.760
Probably the least earned mic drop in the history.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760
Or the most.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760
Or the most.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.760
I've done some that were pretty unearned.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:33.760
I think the only less earned one was just a guy working in inventory at the microphone store.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.760
That was absolutely...

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.760
Let's tear this place apart.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.760
That was pretty special.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.760
We came on a little after five.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.760
We're pushing our envelope.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.760
We got a little bit of time on it.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.760
I think we should because I'm very excited.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.760
There's a couple of towns we're going to on this tour that I love and we're not going to get to spend any time in.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.760
We actually have a full evening because we're doing an early show.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:20.760
Let's all find me after the show and let's pick the best place to go eat and get fucked up.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760
Without breaking into a big place.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.760
We're all going to take our shirts off, you guys.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.760
The easiest thing would be to determine now that everyone's listening.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:35.760
Is there a consensus on where we should go?

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760
I knew that was going to happen.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.760
We're going on to the Titty Bar. We have a winner.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760
Wait, what?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.760
I think it's like the Jumbo's Clown Room of Atlanta.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.760
It's a Titty Bar.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.760
We're old women.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.760
Really?

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.760
It's where strippers go to die.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.760
I think strippers just get up in the morning to die.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.760
They don't need to go to the Temple of Doom or anything like that.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.760
This bring her out, gentlemen. She's got seven minutes to live.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.760
She's chosen a vocation unapproved by society and yet profited on.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.760
She's on two bottles of Perkiset. Let's get her out.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.760
She's a victim of institutionalized sexism. Put your hands together for millennia.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.760
Moussela!

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760
Moussela.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760
What was yours?

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.760
Millennia.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.760
Millennia!

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.760
She's a thousand tonight.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.760
Make her feel special.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.760
Her tits are underfoot.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.760
One of the 10% of the strippers to live past her bra size.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.760
Stupid. Edit it out.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.760
Trying to connect dots, an idiot.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.760
Seriously, where are we going? We're not going to a Titty Bar.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.760
Some place where there's room for everybody to be...

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.760
I shouldn't have put it to the room. We'll never agree.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.760
Oh, there's something. You're saying the vortex.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760
We should just stay here. It's easy, right?

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760
We can't all get in someone's truck.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.760
We'll certainly do that until people want me to sign stuff, not to be presumptuous.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760
I don't think anyone wants anything signed.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760
I'm from Wisconsin.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.760
But if you buy anything, I think we'll scoot out that door.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.760
And then maybe we'll hang out and have some drinks and we'll hang out.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.760
Stupid.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.760
Alright, so now...

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760
Let's get the girls back up on stage.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760
Let's get Rihanna and Ditto back up here.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760
Dianna? What was it?

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.760
Dianna.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.760
Dianna and Jackie.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.760
How's it going?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.760
It's so nice.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.760
All I have to do is ask and girls come up and sing your song. It's so cool.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.760
Well, the community audience was always like,

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760
you get on YouTube and everybody that watched...

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760
There was only two million people that watched it,

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.760
but all of them were better editors than everybody that watched everything else.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.760
Pretty interesting.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:03.760
I think I'm doomed to be a lightning rod for a bunch of geniuses.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:10.760
So I'm going to do my farewell Atlanta rap,

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.760
and it's going to be fucking intense.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760
What'd you say?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.760
SHarmontown.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.760
Every time I try to work a suggestion into it, I just...

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.760
You're hamstringing yourself by putting too much stuff on you.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.760
Just speak from the heart, man.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.760
I got to just spit my fire, man.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.760
Backstage in the green room, there's a list of rules of comedy by Bill Hicks,

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.760
the great late comic.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.760
Was he from here?

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.760
No, he's from Texas.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.760
And one of them was just like really just like,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.760
just like close your eyes and say something and let it all rip.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.760
But I broke the first rule on it, or the one he really goes off on.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760
The first thing I said is, how y'all doing?

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760
And he hates when people do that.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.760
And then Spencer came out and he said, how y'all doing?

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.760
And that's like when someone doesn't have an opening line,

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.760
I broke that rule right off the bat.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.760
So, you know, I'd say just...

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.760
He'd forgive you, huh?

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.760
He'd forgive you.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760
Yeah, he probably would, yeah.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760
He's probably done it a million times himself.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760
That's how we knew not to do it.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.760
All right, all right.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.760
This is going to be the great rap.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.760
I want you to dig deep then.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760
I want to dig deep.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.760
I really like reveal something, even if it's not funny,

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.760
but then it's just sharing the, you know, like the whatever's going on.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Yo, yo.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.760
Yo, yo.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Muscles and bones in my body.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.760
I want to have some calamari.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.760
It's deep fried squid.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.760
I'm so sorry for everything I do, everything I did.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.760
Order a plate of fried fish.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.760
Make every woman make a wish,

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.760
and then either grant it or not give it to them.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:57.760
Gonna do it, gonna white glue them with my sperm.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760
I'm so sorry.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.760
I'm trying to learn.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.760
Trying to learn how to rap from the heart.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.760
Don't want to do nothing on this stage.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.760
Don't want to lay a fart.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.760
Turn that frown upside down.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.760
P is yellow, poop is brown.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.760
Yo, I feel Atlanta's mind.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760
I feel everything I was searching for.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.760
I'm gonna find.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.760
I see people in the crowd looking up at me.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.760
Don't want to do anything.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.760
Don't make them drink my pee.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.760
Just want to go to your mama's house.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.760
Fuck her pussy.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.760
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.760
Sorry.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.760
Just give me, let me get my bearings.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760
Sorry.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.760
Hold on a second.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.760
Dance it out, dance it out.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.760
Get loose.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.760
Get lover.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.760
Railroad choo choo bop bop.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.760
I want to do the chicken Atlanta walk.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.760
Gonna go from the left and right.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760
The chicken wings.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.760
Gonna do all the Atlanta, Georgia things.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.760
I want to have the Falcons beat Seattle.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.760
Gonna fuck your mama like she was a cattle.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.760
Gonna milk all her udders.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.760
Gonna apologize to all my sisters, brothers.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.760
I want to tell you I had a good time.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760
So sorry, I can't rap.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.760
Sorry, I can't rhyme.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.760
I got to do easy dance like a baby.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.760
I won't bite you.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.760
I don't have rabies.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.760
Turn that crown upside down.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760
Struggle.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.760
When he's yellow to this ground.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.760
Again.

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.760
Turn that crown upside down.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.760
Strength.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.760
When he's yellow to this ground.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.760
Rude faggots.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760
Reach for my veggies.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.760
I'm so sorry.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.760
Hammer's got to call Sledgies.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760
I just decided that.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.760
Sledgehammer.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.760
An abbreviation for it would be Sledgy.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.760
Doesn't matter.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.760
Let's move on.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.760
Go to Home Depot.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.760
It's the store that you all know.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.760
It's headquarters.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.760
I'm in Atlanta.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.760
I really respect you guys.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.760
That's all that matters.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.760
Give me a second.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.760
I'm not fracking it.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.760
I'm going to take a shit.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.760
Just mime it.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.760
Don't worry about it.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.760
Wrap it on my face.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760
All over the place.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760
Feel my poop.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.760
Feel my pee.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.760
Feel me.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.760
Reach for me.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.760
Feel me.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.760
Reach your hands up and try to touch me.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.760
So the documentary looks like I did something cool.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.760
I wish I could touch you.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.760
I wish you could touch me.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.760
Take it.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.760
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.760
Rude faggots.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:06.760
How do you get the feeling.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:14.760
Hey is yellow poops this brown.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760
What's your name.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.760
Daniel.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.760
No it's not.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760
What's your name.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.760
More like Kelly.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760
What's your name.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.760
Hello, kids and girls, coming down from deep south with the paint and the scars

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:38.760
All the airplanes and the railroad cars, coming through one hub, coming through one place

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.760
Making stride for every human being and race, but you gonna rise up, prove everyone wrong

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:50.760
You gonna sing a motherfuckin' sing-harmon-song, gonna do that in this laughing skull

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.760
You gonna go outside and smoke a bowl, buy a t-shirt, on the sidewalk

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.760
I fucked your mama, she was a fried wok

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.760
Chinese food

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.760
Chinese food

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.760
Thank you all for coming to Hartman Town, everybody

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.760

God bless you
