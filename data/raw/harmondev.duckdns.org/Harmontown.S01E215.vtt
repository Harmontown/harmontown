WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Oh, yeah, from Hollywood, California, and Meltdown Comics.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
We're all good podcasts, go, and they grow up.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
Harmontown is now in session. Welcome friends, welcome newcomers.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
Are we Spencerless tonight? Let's not bring out Spencer sadly, no Spencer.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
But don't think of it as losing a Spencer. Think of it as gaining a mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:45.000 --> 00:56.000
What's up, Dan?

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
No, nothing, nothing. This probably never happens to you.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Do you always say the opposite thing and people say, how is it going?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
And then you say, nothing?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
And then they say, how are you?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Wait, that's the same one, nothing.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
But whatever, whatever the other one is, I do it wrong, okay?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
So it's going to be a bad show.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
You got a nice little haircut there?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, thanks, thanks.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Where do you go? Who's your guy?

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm a 23 in the front and 50 in the back.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
It's the new, where do I go?

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
I go to that place on Hillhurst, Opion, Opion, OPYAN.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
It's decorated like kind of like an Armenian swamp cave.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Oh yeah, that place, yeah, yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Armenian swamp cave.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Like it's rejuvenating.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
Stay away from me.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
So the only thing, oh, there is one piece of business, official business to get out of the way.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
So as you guys know, I'm a big user of the App Cookie Collector 2.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It looks like that.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You collect cookies.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Each menu makes a sound.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, there's, okay, that's, well, let me, sorry about this.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Let's start the show over.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, that's a little crunchy sound.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Yep.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
But you can mute it after a while.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Do you play with the mute?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You collect cookies.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You go like that.

02:36.000 --> 02:49.000
When you gather cookies, I have 120.82 Treadekillian cookies at 16.157 Duo Dekillian cookies per second.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
But that's a misleading figure, since each cookie can be upgraded to be worth more cookies at the cost of cookies.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
Each cookie you gather is a kind of currency that you can use to create, for instance, structures that create cookies.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Everybody, please file slowly out of the exits.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
It's a cookie press, the baker, the dispenser, you can get a grandma, a tree, things that make cookies.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
All right, but let me get to my point.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
This is under the heading, we have some business to take care of.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I probably don't have to tell you, each day of the week there's special things. Sunday is milkshakes appear twice as often.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't have to tell you what milkshakes are for.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
You use those to buy cookies.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Or to bring all the boys to the art.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
They recently did an update where they have league play now.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
That's why I'm talking to you guys.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Uh-oh.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
So my bakery, it was called Butnut, but I had to change it because I don't think it would let you.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
So I started a cookie collector two team called The Crumb Rumblers.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
So I'm just letting you know that.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
I'm not telling you you have to join my cookie collector team and help me collect cookies.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
If it's something you were already going to do and you're looking for a cookie collector two team,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
just know that I have one called The Crumb Rumblers.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh shit, I'm missing a fucking cookie storm.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
God damn it. Fuck. Oh, fucking messed it.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
We had fucking damage.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
What happens when you miss a cookie storm?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
You don't get as many cookies, you fucking asshole.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I know you know the answer.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
How often do cookie storms come along? Are they predictable?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Every eight minutes.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
The rainbow cookies, the cookie storms are rainbow cookies.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Now that you're the gang leader of The Crumb Rumblers,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
how many people can be a member of that team, infinite amount?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm not who I don't know.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
But when you have a team, you're all going into this cookie collecting together?

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, I'm sure all the cookies we collect get added up and then we get ranked.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
There's other teams. That's all.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm not going to belabor the point. I want it to be an entertaining show.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
How many Crumb Rumblers are there right now? Just you?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah, as far as I know, just me.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
The thing is, I think there's a passcode maybe, so that'll be our final order of business.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Then we'll get on with the entertainment.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
I don't like that we're using our podcast for you to shill for your own Crumb Rumbler cookie collector 2 team.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
My team, The Crumb Rumblers, I'm the only member.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
It says members 1 out of 50 collected 39,742 cookies.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Passcode, I want to write this down.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
7-7-1. Fuck, milkshake.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Double milkshakes today. It's Sunday. Double milkshakes.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Double milkshakes in Westworld.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
The fuck is our show?

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
I think there's probably some people here that are just fans of logic that are like, what the fuck is this?

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Is that your cookies or is that somebody else?

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
We don't tolerate any bullshit with phones.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Anyways, okay, so I was giving you that passcode and then we'll get on with the show.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
The passcode is 7-7-1-8-1-3. I don't know if that gives you access to my cookies.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't know if you can use that to buy shit. I don't know, but that's that code again.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Fuck, 7-7-1-8-1-3. How do you open the new iPhone?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I wrote it down. 7-7-1-8-1-3.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Alright, well, listen.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
So far, I would say one of the best Harmontowns of all time.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
The Crumb Rumblers. The Crumb Rumblers, sir.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Crumb Rumblers. 7-7-1-8-1-3.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And the world famous 7-7-1-8-1-3.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
It's the Crumb Rumblers. Oh, it's the Crumb Rumblers.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
No, not all one word. Nope. Spaces. Use it. Spaces. Spelt crumb right. Do it all.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, I don't want any of that shit.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Is there a space between Crumb and Rumblers?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yep.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
The Crumb Rumblers. Just pretend it's the name of a movie, which it will be.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
You thought that you might get kicked off for being Team Butt Nut?

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
I thought my bakery's name was Butt Nut. And yes, I kept trying to create the Crumb Rumblers

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
and it kept just like blanking out and I was like, I bet it doesn't like the Butt Nut

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
and I changed my bakery name to Dan Harmon. So now it's the Crumb Rumblers

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
and I'm in there alone. Let's move on with the show.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
Because my name on Transformers Earth Wars, they didn't allow. They changed my name for me.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Because you wanted to be...

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Negatron.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I was going to do Optimus Rhyme but they would have allowed that one

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
but that's already been taken too.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Alright, well, our team is Channel 101. If you guys want to join us, Channel 101.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I don't know if I like Transformers Earth Wars.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
Anyways, hasn't Cookie Collector 2 become a competitive team thing now?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, and it's going to be better than Transformers Earth Wars.

08:17.000 --> 08:26.000
You guys, I missed out on that whole Amanda Knox thing. I just watched that documentary on Netflix.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I didn't even know what was going on when that was going on. You know who Amanda Knox is?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I do not.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Watch the documentary. It's pretty interesting. That's all.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, thank you for clarifying that for me.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
That's worth a watch. It's a fascinating story. You won't believe it happened right under your nose in 2013.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
I just missed out on it. I must have been busy on one of my hit shows.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
But it was very interesting.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Very interesting.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
You guys looking forward to Westworld?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Okay, good.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Alright, I'm going to watch that tonight.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I guess let's get on with this.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
I can't watch anything because I'm moving places and I have no TV, no internet, no Wi-Fi, no nothing.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm living in a toilet dark age.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Well, you can come over, come over after the show and watch Westworld.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Watch it tonight?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh, okay.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I will.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
That's a date.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
We had pizza and stuff last night and they left the box out so the dog's probably, this place probably looks pretty bad.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay, I'll have some of that dog pizza.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Let's say the house is probably kind of a mess.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Do you have a friend in Toronto? That was pretty fun, right?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yep, I have a friend in Toronto.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Alright.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, if you guys are, in my podcast audience, then you're a fan of quality rapping.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And the hip hop lifestyle.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Just my vocoder down here?

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Okay, good.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Warm, make sure this thing is working.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You want to try it out?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Just kind of warm up.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Do a little vocoder sound check?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, do you have a beat?

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, I'll give you kind of one of our old school beats that we're not going to use later on.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Okay, let's do...

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Check, check.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah, yeah, rapping.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Rapping like I'm tapping.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Tapping, rapping and crapping.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I'm doing running around a circle that's called laughing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Laughing of your pussy.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Like I'm mapping your pussy.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Cartography, your pussy.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Saying here's the north, here's the south, here's my mouth.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
On the equator of your pussy.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Tropic of Capricorn on your pussy.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Yucatan on your pussy.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Archipelago on your lamea.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yo, your pussy is a map.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And I'm going to give it quite a rap lap.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm going to rap it left and right.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
And when I get done lapping, go to sleep tonight.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Okay, so it's warmed up, it's warmed up.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I didn't mean any of that misogynistically.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Dan, can we try, if you don't want to, this is pushing it too hard.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Just do like an acapella.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Like you're like a doo-wop on the corner.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Kind of just like you just freestyle.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Like just singing acapella.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
But with this?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, can we do it together?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Is there a way that you and I can do a little doo-wop together?

11:21.000 --> 11:31.000
Doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-doo, wop-wop-doo, wop-a-doo-ba-doo, wop-wop-doo, wop-a-doo-wop, wop-wop-doo, wop-wop-doo, wop-wop-doo, wop-wop, doo-wop-doo, wop-wop.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, my girl's got some titties.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And she's walking through the cities.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Going down Fifth Avenue.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
No, no, when I see those titties, what I'll do, but I'll squeeze them.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Gonna squeeze them all night long.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
And I'm gonna sing a doo-wop song to her nipples.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Like they were microphones, cause I'm a man child.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
I'm afraid to be alone, so I need a woman in my life.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I better stay away from the nights, cause I'm lonely.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And I'm angry.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And I'm... bad.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Alright, well...

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, we're all warmed up.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I mean, ten dollars.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
You guys got a fucking cheap, cheap admission.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
This is too much program for you guys.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Let's bring out our new... wait, I gotta turn this off, so I don't keep sound.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Let's bring out our new friend.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Logic!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
DJ Logic?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Professor Logic?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Swag.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Psychological?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes, that was actually my first rap name, for real.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Psychological?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, awkwardly enough.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And who the fuck is gonna call somebody psychological?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Hey, psychological, pass the salt.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
No, definitely not.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
So, yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And then my homie just called me Logic for short.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
What is that?

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Justin Roiland has a kind of... has a rapping alter ego.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
What's his name?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Psychic Abilities.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But that's a real thing when he told me that.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I thought he was joking.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, it's... I mean, it's a real thing.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I mean, he raps in gibberish.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
He just raps gibberish words that rhyme.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
So funny.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
When I first met him, he was like, yeah man, just come to my house.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
This is very rare.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I was talking to him on Twitter, because I was like, I love Rick and Morty.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
And he was like, oh yeah, okay, cool, come to my house.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And I was like, what?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
So I was like, okay, so me and my wife, we went over there.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
And we met him and Abby, and they were very drunk.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
And there was like nine other people that I didn't know, and it was very awkward.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
But by the time I left, everybody was family, and it was awesome.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
And it was great, yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Did he make you do VR?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Of course he did, dude.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
He totally did, yeah, no.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
But me and my wife, we loved it.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I got to get my setup though.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
I don't have one.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I have like a PC, but I got to get like a real setup.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
You have to dedicate a room to it in your house, if you want to do the Vive.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
The Oculus is lighter weight, but you have to use a gamepad.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know, it's tough.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It's like the VHS beta thing.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
You don't know what I'm talking about.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
You're 26.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It's the two big things.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
It's like what's going to be the mainstay DVD Blu-ray you might have been around for that.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Yes, I know that.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah, and now we're all living in the cloud with young rappers like yourself.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, the cloud is fucking weird, man.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
I try to go no, because I like to keep all my stuff on the super download because of hackers.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I've gotten like hack before, which sucks.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
But they never really get any like real information, because I'm like an idiot for like letting them know, like having the easiest password to get.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Like you gave them your cookie collector passcode.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah, they got like the easiest shit, you know, like pussy seven dash, you know what I mean?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Or whatever.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Pussy seven?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Pussy seven?

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
Do you mean when you say you get hacked, you mean like they break into your like bin of like unfinished albums?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
No, no, no, that's what I'm saying is like no way.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
No, they just get like Netflix.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
And then like, so if you log into my Netflix, it's Bobby, which is my real name, and then Jess, which is my wife's name.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And then it's like family, you know?

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
And then so somebody hacked my shit and was like, yo, dude, follow me on Twitter.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Fucker.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I was like, what?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I was like, what?

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
So yeah, so that was, and then I apologized to you.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
So I wised up and my assistant who's here, his name's Christian, he was like, why the hell didn't you have two step verification on?

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
Because like, and everything has two step where you just get like a text to your phone giving you an extra code so you can't get in.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.000
So I do that, but when it comes to when it comes to like, like actual raps and music files and all that stuff, I don't do anything over the internet.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
You know, it's just to be safe.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It's all on dat tape.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Flash drives.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
That's it.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
It's just like me and my buddy, my main producer and then my engineer.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And so we just, that's it.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
The only time I think we send actual files over the internet is if it's like a beat and it's just like it isn't even anything yet.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
And I'm like, oh, I really like that beat. And if I like it, then I'm like, you better go back to that fucking email and delete that beat.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
So nobody like steals it.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You won't even do a coded drop box thing.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Like, like, like you won't send anything over the internet.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Dude, I like deleted my drop box.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Really?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Because it's not even like they got any serious information because like, I don't do that.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't, I don't put anything out there really.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
But it was just weird because I was like, oh, shit, they, they, they've got my Snapchat.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And they were like, but they weren't even posting anything. It was really weird.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
They were just like, go follow gangsta, kill a seven.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It was like the weirdest like names.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I live in real terror and I haven't really done anything decent about it yet.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
But I did, I started using one password. This isn't an ad.

16:41.000 --> 16:49.000
Like, like, it's like, I finally just gave in and started using one of those apps where it just generates these crazy long ass passwords.

16:49.000 --> 16:56.000
And then you, so that every time you want to get anything, you have to like go there, copy, then paste a long ass password that even you don't know.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, I think my assistant has that too.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
But fuck that.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
But when the fa, when the fappening happened, that was a warning shot across my, my bow.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The fappening. Damn.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah, that was pretty crazy.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
But it is true that around that time, that's how we know the guy that runs the server for the, for this thing.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
Like that's kind of how I made friends with him is that he was a fan who he, he was like down deep into that whole crazy world.

17:20.000 --> 17:31.000
And like he let me know, he said, like, do you have, and like named all of my Apple equipment and like some other shit that I was like, what's going on?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
How did he find that out?

17:32.000 --> 17:40.000
And he said there, because you're, you're, you're your iCloud password, which is so simple.

17:40.000 --> 17:48.000
That's how the fappening happened is that everybody's like iCloud, iCloud passwords are like, are like the name of their dog or it's just like, or it's just like password.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Because no one took iCloud seriously.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
And, and, and, and, but iCloud gives you your address book.

17:54.000 --> 18:11.000
It gives, it's just like, it was just a, and so like, because, you know, I'm somehow ancillarily, if that's a word related to like some, you know, like someone that, that was fappeningable.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Fappable?

18:12.000 --> 18:23.000
Like they're my, they were, they had my, they had already hacked me, they just hadn't, like the way it worked is that like, they can, you get hacked by like just an autonomous like thing.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
It's just like a machine that just drills away at your shit on a server somewhere.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
But then you, you, the hacker comes back and opens that treasure chest and pulls shit out and they hadn't done that.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
But these, some people had found the stuff and so he was, he was warning me.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
No, that's crazy.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
But that's some, yeah, like I've actually had that happen to me as well where people will like tell you and they're not actually dicks.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
They just do it for like a weird sport.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
They're like, yeah, I just went into your shit.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm just letting you know.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Like, yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Like I swear to God, like I see that all the time.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I just did it a couple of times when I, when I was still using Windows back in the, back in the day.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Back in the day.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Back in the day where people, when people said back in the day.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I had, I had heard like,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Remember AOL disks?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Totally.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
They talked about like IP scanners or something like that.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Like software that just scans for IPs and how Windows was so vulnerable.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
And I just, I just got one of these free apps that like scanned low, you know, IPs just went through lists of them and, and probed them for open ports.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It's not even about guessing passwords.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It was like Windows was so vulnerable.

19:28.000 --> 19:39.000
If you networked your home system, the way to get it to work, like often involved, like if you only knew a little bit about what you were doing and not everything, you were, you were bound to be open to the public.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
And so I just like, I ended up like, I just wanted to do it.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And then I, I was like, I'm in here.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And then it was like, oh, those are your tax documents.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
And I was like, I left a lot of little, I felt like a dick for even doing this, but I felt like it was better than not doing anything.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
Just leaving and left a little text, little, little, little text documents that said, look, I'm sorry, I was here.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Really?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I was here and yours.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
There's your social security number.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I don't have, I'm not looking at it.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
I swear.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That's crazy.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I was just dicking around.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
I'm a 30 year old dude in Los Feliz.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
There's my name.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Come get me.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Dude, I never understood how people actually got that.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Like the ones who are like, yeah, I'm going to, because you know, like Kylie Jenner, all these like different celebrities.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
That's how it happened with me.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
It was like this, this dude who like hacks into people's Snapchat.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And it's just like, yeah, pussy springs or something.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
He just does this, just he'll just like tweet the most random shit or whatever.

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
But I always wonder like, how does like somebody go, I'm going to hack this person's shit and like jack into the fucking matrix, man.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
That's like so weird.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I see that codes, like those green codes.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Like when I think of some guy like, yeah, I'm going to destroy your soul.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah, so.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah, I know.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
Well, that's what's terrifying about like, well, that there's so much crossover with the, you know, the guys that can do that and the, and the alt right and stuff.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
You can, because you can just like, just by being a human being that has feelings, like you and your politics.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
If you stay on publicly, you could end up like, you know, being an example that gets made.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Like people will find some serious shit on my stuff.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Like I make an easy, fun target.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Like everyone, even my fans want to see me go down.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Like that's that's part of what they enjoy.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like they show up here to watch me fail.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Like it's about the shape of my head or something.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I love watching you go down.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Nice.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
But you, you, you were born, you're from Maryland.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Originally I'm from Maryland, which is near DC for those of you guys who don't know.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Because usually I'm like, Maryland people are like, what?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Where?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
So yeah.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
East coast.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
It's a state.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
It is a state.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It is a state.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
It's a very small state.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
We're known for crabs, but not the sexual kind.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's Baltimore.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Fuck Baltimore.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I'll sign it.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Fucking Baltimore is a piece of shit.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
That's good.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
That's good.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Maryland humor.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Hey man, if it wasn't for the Baltimore, we wouldn't have the wire.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That's true.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Really awesome show.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
The wire.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Or Poe, a growling Poe.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Indeed.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I did not know that.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
H.L. Menken.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Now I can claim that shit, son.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I didn't know that.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
But what part of Maryland are you from?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I'm from Gaithersburg, Maryland in Montgomery County.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I was born at Shady Grove Hospital at 7.36 a.m.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
By the way, that was the first time someone's in a city and nobody clapped.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Oh yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I'm from Gaithersburg.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Motherfucker, come on.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
No, but yes.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
It sounds nicer than what Wikipedia in your childhood section says it is.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
You know what's crazy?

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
So I grew up section 8 household, welfare, food stamps, all that stuff, to a black father

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
and a white mother.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
And I'm biracial, but look very white, obviously.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Hummelbrack.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yes.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
Which can be very, very confusing.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Dan's half jealous right now.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Half jealous?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Yeah, man.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So I grew up there and it's weird.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
It's one of those places where it's like on the outside, it kind of like looks really

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
beautiful, but then you like take a left and you're like in the hood, like you're in like

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
a really fucked up area, which is kind of anywhere.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
I mean, anywhere in the world, there's good places and there's bad places.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
And me, I never really tried to glorify any of the negative shit.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Would you like a drink?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh, I'm okay.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Thanks.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I drink Scotch.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Swag.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I only just started drinking.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I only drink a little bit here and there.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Well, someone just got fired because we brought this out for you.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I never drink.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I'll have this water.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
But yeah, so I grew up there and it was not that great.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
I was like, was it like bad neighborhood?

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Well, it says that your mom and dad were...

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
They were both drug addicts and alcoholics.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
So my father was addicted to crack cocaine and my mother, she was addicted to pills and alcohol.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
So I never actually had a father in my life, which is really hard.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
And then also all my brothers and sisters are not to get all fucking deep.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
This is supposed to be like really fun.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
You think they come here for my fucking cookie game?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
This is why they're...

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah, you saw how high the bar was when you came out like that.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And it's not for my hilarious standup either.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
So it's like, no, go deeper, go home, Mr. Logic.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
It wasn't necessarily about where I live but my actual household.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
So all my brothers and sisters, they're all black and they all look black and have black features.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And once again, I'm the only one who looks white.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
So it was very hard to identify when you're raised in a black household with a white mother.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
And the crazy thing is that my mother was also extremely racist, which sounds weird.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Because it's like, how's this racist shit going to fuck all these black dudes?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
But that's what happened.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I don't know how it happened.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Well, I mean...

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
But that's what happened.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
I mean, all men hate women and look how many people we have together.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
We managed to work it out.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah, it definitely works.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Misogyny never gets in the way of...

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Logically, she racist across the board or just...

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
No, you know what?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It was one of those things where I think obviously...

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
I mean, it's a very confusing thing because some people will be like, well, that doesn't fucking make sense.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And I'm like, yeah, I know.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I had to live that way and grow up.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
And she was super Bible thumping like Jesus freak.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And I'm a very open guy.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
I'm an open-minded guy.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
I'm the type of dude that's like, I believe in equality for all race religions, color creeds, and sexual orientations.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Period.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
And if you want to argue and fucking kill each other, you do it over there.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
I'm just going to chill and watch Rick and Morty and fucking...

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Real shit.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm just going to have fun.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So, but she was like total opposite.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
And I always think like, I don't know how I didn't become a Satanist.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Like just a spider.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
You know what I mean?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
But I...

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It's never too late.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
That's true.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
That's very true.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
But yeah, no.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
So I think it stemmed down with her family because I know that her side of the family was very racist.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
So like my grandparents would never let me like come over.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
And I'd always be like, oh, please.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
And they'd be like, no, the guest room because they were balling and we were poor shit.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
They're like, the guest room is not available.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And I'm like, oh, sleep on the couch.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
And they're like, oh, no, the couch.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
No.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
And I'm like, oh, sleep on the floor.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
And they're like, no, get out of here.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
You fucking neighbor.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
So...

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
You found it.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
All right.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
All right.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
All right.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
We buried the lead.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Yes.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
But anyway, so that was like confusing.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
No.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
What were you going to say?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
What's that like?

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
Like if your siblings look more black than you and you're in a biracial household.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
So you're getting it from both angles.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
You're not black enough to be black and you're not white enough.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Like you're not totally...

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
No, it's really weird.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It's...

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
That's what I had to deal with my whole life and then leading also into my career.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.120
Because I, you know, like literally being called a nigger by your own mother and then

26:42.120 --> 26:45.000
going to school and then people are like, you fucking cracker, white boy.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
And it's like, what?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh, shit.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
The fuck's going on.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
You know what I mean?

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
I better become a successful recording artist.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Some shit better go down.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
With a built-in audience of zero.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
People just keep accusing you of co-opting your own culture.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah, I know.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Going back and forth.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
But that's what I did.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
I just focused on music and it was very difficult and so...

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
And you had to focus on logic, not to be corny about it, but you really...

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Like Dirk Diggler, you thought long and hard about your...

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah, long and fucking hard.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
You arrived at psychological and then shortened it to logic, but I think the...

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
I'm babbling.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
You're doing fine.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Keep talking.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
But it's like, yeah.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
I mean, what other recourse do you have?

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
I think by the way, that's where good hip-hop and nerd culture totally overlap.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Nerds are like, wait, how am I...

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
It's not equatable.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
I don't want to make that crime, but nerds always draw that analogy.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
It's like, wow, you're getting it from all angles.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
You don't know.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
And that's why we get into Spock and Star Trek and sci-fi.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It's something to escape in.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
And that's what I used to do.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
So I love video games.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
I'm a huge video game guy.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
So I love Last of Us and Uncharted and those real games you can jump in and just engulf yourself in.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
And I used to play those games to escape and to run away from my life and not deal with it.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
And then through that, as I got older, through my teenage years, I realized that I could do that with music.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
And truly write.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And now here's the real crazy thing.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
So my mom is like this super Jesus-free, crazy, racist, white bitch, right?

28:23.000 --> 28:31.000
But then on top of that, on top of that, I'd be writing raps to try to vent and talk about these things.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
And she'd be like, don't you curse, goddammit, motherfucker.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
So she was also that.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
So it was very suppressive and it was very difficult.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
But I worked through it and I worked on music.

28:41.000 --> 28:48.000
And then when I was 17, I left the house because it was just so horrific.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It was so bad.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
She was just on so many pills.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
And I got two jobs to support myself.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
And I worked those jobs for a long time and it was one in the morning and one at night.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
And unfortunately, I didn't graduate high school because back then there was so much going on.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I mean, I've seen my father smoke crack.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I've been kidnapped.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
I've seen my mother get beat by men and my sisters were raped and my brothers were in the street

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
selling crack even sometimes to our own father.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
So it was a lot of crazy shit that I was seeing.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
But every time I was like, this isn't right.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I knew that it wasn't right.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
And that's where I think everybody else, and I'm not going to say necessarily failed.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
And I'm not going to try to highlight my family and say the right or wrong that they did or who they went to become.

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
But I think that's what it is, especially within the inner city in different places where, oh, OK,

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
if I go work at McDonald's and I make $5.50 an hour or I can go sell crack and make $5,000 in a day.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
And it's really fucked up and it's really terrible and it's really horrible.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
And when I saw this, I was like, OK, well, don't beat women.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Don't sell crack.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Don't do this.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Don't do that.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
What you need to do is you need to write about it and you need to tell the world and you need to tell the youth

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
that are coming from where you're coming from to get out of that.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
And so that's what I did and what I tried to do.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
And you were good at it.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I was good at it.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm sure a lot of people are like, I'm going to rap about this.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
And then they're like, yo, yo.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yo, check it.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Yo, I fucked your mama.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Crack rock.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
More like bad rock.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Don't smoke it.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
You got to poke it.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah, so that's my best rap.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
I was doing a voice like I was imitating a bad rapper.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
But my secret was I was rapping as good as I could.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Nice.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm actually going to go home tonight and say, that was pretty good flow.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Are you a freestyler too?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Or are you mostly a writer?

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
Honestly, I write and I love to write, but I think that any person who raps should have fun and freestyle.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Yeah.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
How does it, how does it free?

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
I always, I'm so, I'm always so confused about freestyling because I, when I listen to like...

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Oh, you've made that very clear.

30:53.000 --> 31:09.000
When we, when we, when people are freestyling, like whether it's in a, it's in a biopic movie, like Eight Mile or...

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
This feels fucking Eight Mile like B-Rabbit right now.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
I can't even see like people pass like the second row.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
This is crazy.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Yo, fuck you, Doug.

31:18.000 --> 31:26.000
But are the people, I assume it's like, like if you freestyle a lot, then the more you freestyle, the more arrows you have in your quiver.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
I.e. like you're also, like one thing you're like phonetically engineering your mind from an early age.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Like for you, you were a child and you were like, you were drawn to hip hop.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
I feel like Eminem was like, like, he was like a savant.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
Like when his first album came out or what it was, like...

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It's all about studying.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
So like if you really want to do so, like a lot of rappers go, yeah, I'm going to rap and get these bitches' hoes.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
You know what I'm saying?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
These chains and shit, dawg.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
And then it never works out.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
And it's the people that actually say, I'm going to turn this into, you know, I'm going to make this a business.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
I'm going to be a walking company.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
And I'm going to first and foremost do it because I love it, but I'm going to fucking make something out of it.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
And that's, that's what great, the greats did.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
That's what I'm doing my best to do.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Well, now it's even harder for you, harder slash easier in a sense.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
I mean, like, I guess everything just changed.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
But like, you're the, I, you're the second Wikipedia article I've read.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
It sounds so similar to The Weeknd, who I recently...

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Love that guy.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
That's my homie.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
And was like, it's like, oh, you look at, it's like the parallels are, it's like, it's, this is the new career path.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
You have to be a ninja and like make yourself out of nothing.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Like you don't get to, you have a mentor in your, in your development.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
And you have a record label that comes along, but not before you build yourself out of dirt without permission.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Completely.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Yeah.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
And The Weeknd just came out of nowhere and you, you have to release these mixed tapes and, but they're not tapes anymore.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
They're digital and these kids are with their pants are so low.

32:56.000 --> 33:06.000
But, and it's, and it's got to be lonely and it's got to be like, how do you, I mean, that's the age old question.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
Everybody in Los Angeles is always asking, how do you know when you're supposed to quit?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
How do you know?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I always say, but it's a very convenient answer.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It's easy for the people that they're asking.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
They're not asking the people that failed.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Damn.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Well, yeah.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
I thought about it that way.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Holy shit.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Thank you for asking me that question.

33:25.000 --> 33:36.000
There's, there's never a writer's panel for failed writers, you know, like, people come and they go, how, how do you know when you should quit?

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
And I always say it's easy for me to say, but it's like, I do believe this.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
Like, well, you have to, you have to really believe that you wouldn't let that you would do it for free.

33:46.000 --> 33:58.000
And that, and that if you did it for 20 years and then got hit by a bus without ever having an amount to paying your rent that you wouldn't go, oh man, I wasted 20 years that you'd go, that's pretty cool.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
You loved it.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You loved it.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
That's the big part, you know, and I think, I think for me, I'd probably be like dead in jail or addicted to drugs.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
And that's what I saw.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Not to fucking get Debbie down or wah, wah.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
But like, legit, seeing that, I was like, oh shit, son, gotta write these raps, dog.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Like, I was like, I can't not.

34:16.000 --> 34:25.000
After having written about all that childhood stuff and how you grew up, I mean, are you, have you gotten all that out of your system or is there still, is there an endless journey to write about?

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Question.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Okay.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
So you have to soon start rapping about your gardener.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
No, this is, this is the thing.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
Your second album ends with like, and that's what I had to say, mom about Coke.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
And then your third album starts and it's like, stop interrupting me at dinner.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
I'm trying to eat with my wife.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It's just a message to fans.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Yo, my wife is like totally with that.

34:49.000 --> 34:56.000
Every time we go out, because I'm like, I'm like so nice, because I just can't, I just like, but sometimes I'll be eating like, you know, okay, today.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
No, it's real shit.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
I love my fans.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Straight up.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Love my fans.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Love anything from my fans, except like sexual stuff.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
But like, so I was at, uh,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Hey, you said you're an open guy early.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
I know, yeah.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Turns out you're a fanophobe.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
No, so I, no, no, no.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
So I was at Fry's Electronics today.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
And so I get there and there's a lot of like young Hispanic males working and those are a lot of my fans.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I have a lot of Hispanic males in Los Angeles, California.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
And, uh,

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
And you'd like to give a shout out?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah, shout out my boy Jose and Juan.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Those are real people.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
I'll three.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yes.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.000
Um, no, but so, so just being there and like, oh, it's like, you know, some people notice and, you know, some people would be like, oh, hey, logic.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
I really like your music, man.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
And they fucking keep it pushing.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
I'm like, whoa, that's so cool.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
Cause typically how it goes is, hey,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Demo.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Sup dog.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Yo, you're on my fucking Snapchat.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Say what's up.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And it's not even like, hey, how are you?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Or like shaking your hand.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Like, like legit.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
It's like, yo, can I take a picture?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Like fuck, dude.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
You're gonna like buy me dinner for a shit.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
You're just going to fuck me.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I'm serious.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Like, it's like, I'm so down to have a conversation and hang out in whatever the case may be.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
But it's usually like, what can you do for me?

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
There's been times where I've like, I've done a show, had 103 degree fever, was out back.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
Like, I know this sounds gross, but like throwing up and puking my brains out after the show because I was just so sick from doing 45 cities in a row.

36:16.000 --> 36:23.000
And fans are like, hey, and they throw it while I'm throwing up or like taking selfies with me.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
So there is a negative side to it as well.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
But like today I got followed in the bathroom while I'm taking a piss.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
And some dude was like, hey, man, I need me to shake your dick.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
And I'm just kidding.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But he was like...

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
But he's just...

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Again, I apologize.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
It's like, you gotta let some shit go, man.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
The weird thing is that he didn't say anything.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
So it's a guy who works there and he just walks in, he's just like staring at me.

36:49.000 --> 36:56.000
Like, you know how sometimes guys in the urinal you can like see with the metal fleshy thing handle?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
The reflection.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
And I just see this dude just kind of like staring at me.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
And I'm like, this is so fucking wrong.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
And then I turn around and wash my hands and I'm like, so is this guy going to say anything to me?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
And he like, doesn't say anything?

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And I fucking leave.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And it was really awkward.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
He might have just been a murderer.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah, maybe.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah, you never verify it.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
I'm like...

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I have no idea.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Do you...

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Okay, I'm gonna...

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I...

37:26.000 --> 37:34.000
There was a point when I had enough people in...

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
To my surprise, go, I know who you are.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I like what you do.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
I'm so happy you're alive, et cetera, the validation.

37:45.000 --> 37:54.000
But there was a tipping point where I feel like I internalized it to a point where I can live off of it.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
It hasn't been cut off.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
So I don't know how big that tank is, but then I kind of like...

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I have this self-awareness that that doesn't...

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
Like, it didn't make me taller or more handsome or a better person even that I did this stuff.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
But because those people say the things that I always wished the people would say,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
which is why I wished I would be...

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I don't ever wish to be taller or more handsome, but...

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I understand exactly what you're saying.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
That it's like...

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I hit this wizard of eyes.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
You could have gone home anytime you wanted.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Like, tipping point where it wasn't a bad thing.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
It was all a lie.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
It was a good thing that it was all a lie.

38:29.000 --> 38:42.000
That it was like, oh, I now know how my body feels and my brain feels when I assume someone in the room is amazed that I'm going through this TSA checkpoint.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
See, that's why I always...

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
And it makes me less cranky and...

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
It's like this weird...

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
I hate admitting that because it's kind of a douchey thing, but at the same time it's like...

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I wish I could give that pill to everybody.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
No, that's not a douchey thing. That's fucking awesome.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
And I know what that feels like, but I always do my best because...

39:00.000 --> 39:07.000
Here's the thing, especially with hip-hop and the younger generation, everybody thinks other people think they're the shit.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
That's got to be really extreme, too.

39:08.000 --> 39:14.000
So I always do my best to, like, once again, treat everybody equally and with respect and kind and introduce myself.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
I'm not even like, yo, I'm Logic.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
Unless it's like a professional setting like this and I'm backstage with people, I'll be like, hey, I'm Logic.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Or if there's fans, I'm like, hey, I'm Logic.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
But when I meet just, you know, anybody, I'm like, my name is Bobby. That's my fucking name.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm not going to be like, yo, something's Logic.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
And they're like, what?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
What?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Yeah, you know what I mean?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
But what I'm saying is...

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Can I talk right there?

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
Yeah, because I was checking into a hotel with my girlfriend and it was like in Beverly Hills.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
My hotel name is Mike Hawke.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
That's the real thing.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Yes.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
We were going from the lobby to the elevator and it was like, there was this like giant dude.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
And I guess it's important that he's black, but I don't see the world through that lens, but...

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
He had a baseball cap on, he definitely looked like he belonged in a Beverly Hills hotel, but at the same time,

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
because his clothes were all new and like, but he was full of all this weird energy

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
and he was like dragging a bunch of bags on a cart, but there were that.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
And it was like, he was a really big dude.

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
And then he came out of the elevator and he just called out to someone that I couldn't...

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And it was like, yo, sneaks, sneaks.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Like he was just yelling for sneaks.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
And I was just like, just play it cool and I got in the elevator and then I was just like to my girlfriend.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
I was like, do you think sneaks is famous or do you think that guy is like way out of line?

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Like, it's just like, like sneaks.

40:38.000 --> 40:45.000
Like what if sneaks is just a friend and like, is the hotelier going like, God, these guys,

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
they just come by and one of them's named sneaks and they're just so loud.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
Or is sneaks like a Grammy winner and why is that okay?

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
You know what I love about you, Dan?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Is that I always interrupt you with a perfect story.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
No, no, I love that.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Like, dude, you're like fucking crazy, man.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
And you make me feel good, bro.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Because I love the way you think, man.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Because I think about the craziest shit all the time, bro.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Like, you know what?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Let's talk about last night.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
No, two nights ago.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
And I was at my house hanging, playing pool with my buds, right?

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
You promised that you wouldn't talk about this.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I'm a bit of a pool shark.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
And so I'm walking and I take my dogs outside and I have a new little puppy.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
His name's Panda.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
What's the breed?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yes.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
He's a little corgi.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Boo.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
He's a corgi.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I got a puppy named Panda.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
What breed?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
It's a Panda.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Boo.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
I just wanted to repeat that joke.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
It's funny.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Piggy has a Panda.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Nice.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
I have a Panda.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Wicked.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
And because he didn't even give it a real name.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
All right.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
All right.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
All right.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Well, the other dog, his name is Phillip J. Fry.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
We call him Fry for short.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Yes.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Cutorama.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Let's go.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Fuck yeah.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
What does the J stand for?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Johnson.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Jojo.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
I have no idea.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
I just made it up.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
Anyway, so we're walking and it's nighttime and I see this snail with a fucking big ass shell.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
And I'm walking past this snail in my backyard and I'm like, whoa, snail.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
That's crazy.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
I hope like one of my dogs don't eat this snail.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
And so the first dog comes out and sniffs it and I'm like, no.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
And he's like, oh shit.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
All right.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Cool.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
So he walks on by and then the little puppy who like doesn't really know, know yet.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
So I'm just like, wow.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
And he's like, oh shit.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Okay.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Cool.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
He keeps walking.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
I'm like, man, I wonder what the fuck that snail's thinking.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
You know what I mean?

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Like real talk.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
I'm like legit.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
I'm thinking like, man, like does he even understand?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Does he know how close he came?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
And I'm like, wow, this is so crazy.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And I'm like, I gotta, I'm serious.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Okay.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
And I'm like, I got to make sure this fucking snail is okay because he's in the middle of

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
the sidewalk in my backyard and I got to make sure that like he makes it to the grass.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
So I'm like posted and I'm watching my dogs and everything's cool.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
My wife's walking by.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I'm like, hey, watch out.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
You know, people coming by and then my buddy six comes out and I'm like, yo, there's a snail.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Watch out.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
And then crunch.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Oh.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Yeah.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
So anyway, I'm like, yo, does this snail have any kids?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Like what the fuck?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
You know what I mean?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
But this is like real shit that I think.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
So when you go off on such a just snail, snail's married for life.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Are you serious?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Are you serious?

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
No, I don't make that.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
You know what I always worry about with snails?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
What?

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Is that their, their deaths must be horrible because they're like, they're like, what was

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
this shell for?

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
Because it's like, what is that for?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
To protect them from warrior snails?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I guess it's effective that way.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
Like if a snail tries to kill you, having a shell is like fucking whoa.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
He's like Batman.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Cause it's like, it's thin as a, like a fingernail.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
It's like so thin.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
I mean, when you, when you do, if you've ever had the displeasure of realizing you've stepped

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
on a snail, it's like, I mean, those things, it's like, it's like Jesus Christ, the thing

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
that it bought to protect itself.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
It turns into a thousand knives.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I guess that's, I guess that's us in cars.

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
I mean, like, like, we're just driving around in fucking pieces of glass that are temporarily

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
in one piece, like whizzing them at each other.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
That sucks.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I never thought about that.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
And now you've given me like 80 million more things to think about.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Thanks a lot.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Appreciate it.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Well, you know how people like, like they put that snail stuff out to keep snails out.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Cause I guess there's.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Isn't it like salt?

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Yeah.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Well.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
That's for slugs.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
There's like hardcore, okay, slug stuff.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
It's like, but somebody told me it's like, you know, they're not eating that and it's

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
poisoning them.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
It's like, it's like little, it cuts them.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Oh, that's fucked up.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Yeah.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
See, this is like the microscopic, like fucked up world of like earth and all the shit that

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
happens behind the scenes.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
But then our producer, Dustin Marshall told me that a Cetaminophen, the reason why it's

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
a fast acting ingredient drugs or something is it has little molecules that are, that

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
cut up your stomach.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
So it gets in your bloodstream faster.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Well, that's second gross.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
This fucking kid.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
Dustin, you don't know yet.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
He's fucked up.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Like that's the only reason I want to live to a healthy old age because I want to see

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
how fucked up he is at 40.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Wow.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Nice.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
Cause he's like, he dresses like Beetlejuice.

45:28.000 --> 45:34.000
Like he's, he's got a, he's got a whole podcast network that used to, that used to be like,

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
okay, he's got a podcast.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Wait, is this the guy I met?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Yeah.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Total Beetlejuice.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Look, don't say it one more time.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Don't say it one more time.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
You got it.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
You got it.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
You fucking be right out here.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
It's like Marilyn Manson Beetlejuice.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Oh shit.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Who's great?

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
No, I don't mean that in a bad way.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
He comes in.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
He's really nice.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
No, no, no.

45:52.000 --> 46:00.000
He looks like he's about to kill a rock album.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
You said Beetlejuice the third time.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Oh.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Shit.

46:04.000 --> 46:13.000
You thought, you thought like Marilyn Manson was my uncle or something.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I got to watch you work recently.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I was so impressed.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
I have a bunch of hip hop artists to compare it to, but I was impressed as a creative because

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
you're so young and you've had your own success.

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
And I'm sure the lesson you've learned is that you know best and that you'd have that

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
Steve Jobs lobe would be inflamed, which is not a bad thing in my opinion.

46:38.000 --> 46:48.000
Sometimes the curse of genius, my friend, is non-collaborative.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
You have a healthy fear of other people.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
That's what I've learned from my predecessors, both in comedy because I love comedy.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
And I think the parallels between comedy and rap is the same shit.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
It's all about punchline and timing.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
And for me, I've always been very open because I know what I know.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
And I know how to rap and I know how to do this and I know how to perform and I know that

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
and nobody can tell me how to do that the way I do it.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
But the things that I don't know, I go to the people that do and I just shut the fuck up.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
I was like 39 when I figured that out.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
So I guess you're more talented than me.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
It's not a competition, you piece of shit.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
I was very impressed, like you can tell, you're an old soul and there's no such thing as old souls

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
and you were the son of drug addicts in a horrible political racial situation

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
and you were forced to become Vulcan and wise.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Logic.

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
I'm assuming that could easily make you more combative and isolated and autonomous and all this stuff.

47:53.000 --> 48:03.000
The reason we met is because he did a little thing for Season 3 of Rick and Morty, which it's not even a spoiler

48:03.000 --> 48:10.000
because you won't remember this conversation in 2019 when it comes to it.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
We're a little behind schedule.

48:13.000 --> 48:20.000
I won't spoil the specifics of the episode, but it was great that Justin knew you and you came in

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
and I figured you were a cool guy or you wouldn't be coming in in the first place,

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
but I didn't expect what you came in and you worked in front of us.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
It took me so long before I could...

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
I wouldn't be able to ride on airplanes because next to me I might be watching my process.

48:41.000 --> 48:47.000
Then when I started doing Community, it was a hit show I did for NBC in 2009,

48:47.000 --> 48:57.000
but I went through a period where it took me time to learn that it was okay to sit at a keyboard with a screen

48:57.000 --> 49:03.000
and have other people looking at the screen while I was deciding what someone should say.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
That was the equivalent of watching me masturbate or poop.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I totally understand.

49:10.000 --> 49:20.000
He came in and I had written a rap for a thing and it was placeholder lyrics.

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
You just came in from top to bottom, looked at it, welcomed it, found a tempo for it,

49:26.000 --> 49:34.000
found a beat for it, started going through the lyrics and then changing them, adapting them to give it basically a better...

49:34.000 --> 49:42.000
It was like the scene when Mozart meets Soliari and is like, oh, that thing, and he starts adding...

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
That's what you were doing, which is what we wanted, but to do it in front of us,

49:46.000 --> 49:54.000
and you weren't showboating, you were lifting us up and there was no membrane of you being like,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
you know what, maybe just let me...

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
Are you saying that you generate your own beat right on the spot there?

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Well, no, what happened was, and I'm not going to get too... I won't give anything away,

50:04.000 --> 50:10.000
but basically, like Dan said, and it was really cool to think like, damn, I wrote some shit with Dan Harmon.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
That was so cool. First of all, just walk in the room and Justin's there and Dan's there

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and everybody's just being super fucking cool.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
This is the first time I meet this guy. He's like, yeah, motherfucker, blah, blah, blah.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
He's doing all these raps and I'm like, whoa.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
All right, this is my kind of party.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
So, you know, so there's this like template and it's, you know, it's all this like really fun stuff

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
and things that have to do with the episode that wouldn't make sense without him kind of writing it first,

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
because how would I know, you know, so he does these things.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
And then what I did was, is I go, okay, well, let me see, what would be a good BPM for this?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Beats per minute, how fast the song is.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
Okay, and then I went on YouTube and got like a template beat, if you will, just something fun.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
It was some tribe called Quest.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
And so I got that and threw it on. Say what?

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
What song?

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
God Lives Through, which is one of my favorite beats by them.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
So I did that and I kind of caught a vibe and I caught it and then I basically took what he did

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
and then rearranged it and then added things and took things away and, you know, came to a good place.

51:11.000 --> 51:20.000
But here's the thing, the reason why I think I could do that is because unlike, I don't want to put this,

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
people who didn't necessarily grow up in like the Twitter era, you know what I mean?

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
I had to do everything in my career in front of the world.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Right.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
Which was hard, you know, because once again, there's people like, I mean, even in fucking rap,

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
I mean, think about going my whole life being like, you fucking, you're white or black or this or that

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
or you're not this or you're not that.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
And then you go to hip hop, which is predominantly black and you're, I'm like, hey, my brothers.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
And they're like, no.

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
And then I got to do a whole album about my life and they're like, okay, kinda.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
And I do a second album and really bring it home for the brothers and they're like, all right, you're cool.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
You know what I mean?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
So it's like, it's like.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
But don't go in that house.

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
Oh, I thought you were a movie.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
I don't know.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
So that was it though.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
Grandpa's sleepy logic.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
I was just imagining all black people saying things and I was, I was adding to that.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Watch out.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
Grits.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
It's cool on black.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Yeah.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
It was fun.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
It was great.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
So I was impressed by that.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
And yeah.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
And you're so, so, but you were impressed with my rap writing, obviously.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
This is a real thing.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Like, like, I don't know if you're doing like a bit.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I was actually impressed with the rap.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
It was so cool.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
I thought something was interesting.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
It was a make a good segue because this is something that I would ask you regardless of this had come up in that conversation.

52:48.000 --> 52:57.000
But it's one of the first things that came up is because I was, I was going for authenticity with my, with my template wrap.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It was festooned with the N word.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
I didn't know.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I hadn't, I didn't know.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I didn't, I guess I kind of.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
So basically what happened was, by the way, it was the word nigga all over this shit.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Right.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
And I come in and I basically, I tell him this, I was raising this household.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
This is a word that I use.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
It's just, it's, it's a part of the culture.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
It's hard to explain.

53:21.000 --> 53:28.000
But within my music, I never use this word unless it is what's unless it's hilarious.

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
Unless it's commentary.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Yeah, exactly.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Unless it is, it is a full, it is a true representation.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Do you understand?

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Unless it's being used to discuss the issue.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
Or if it's in quotations, like if it's part of the conversation that's happening maybe or?

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Kind of something like that.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
But it's like, just, just understand.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.000
Like I've always had a rule that until people know and understand, because it's just, it's just a word that's in my vocabulary.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Growing up in a black household, having all black family and friends and it just, it is what it is.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
It's in my vocabulary and I didn't have any of that.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
No, no, but there's a, see, there's a difference though.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It's like, you're not a racist man.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
You're, you're, you're a writer.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
You're a comedian.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Like you use this to write.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
And I try to liven up monopoly games.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Yeah.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Nice.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
But yeah, so I basically was just like.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
And showers are boring.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
And you always, you're always looking for a new thing to call your, your, your, your friends.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
And like, all right.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Nice.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Anyway.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
It's just, I, I, I.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Okay.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
All right.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Leave it.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Leave it.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Don't take it there.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
And I thought it was a interesting topic and what I like about it is like the dichotomy of bad word, good word.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Use the word.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Don't use the word.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
It's all preference.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
It's all preference.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And there's like, and this is where we got to get racy.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
No, I'm just kidding.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Okay.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
That was a terrible joke.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Anyway.

54:50.000 --> 55:01.000
So no, but like it's all, it's all like, you know, there's things that my mentor said that you never argue about, you know, like race, religion, politics, you know, just, there's certain, it's, it's, it's sports.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
It's like a thing that there's no writer.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
There's no resolution.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Yeah, you exactly.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
So it's like, almost with that, like, here's how I feel about the word.

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
And if, you know, when I go to concerts and I see the majority of the demographic who are attending concerts, they're all white.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
So it's like, if it's like, Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with nigga, blah, blah, blah, like whatever.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
It's like, don't get mad at the kid.

55:21.000 --> 55:27.000
Like you put it in, you know, you put it in the song and they're, they're reciting the song and they love you and they're paying to see you.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
It isn't a racist thing.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
You know what I mean?

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
It's not from that place.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
Anyway, so me, I just don't like to fuck with that in general.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So I was just like, yeah, I'm not going to say that.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
And he was like, cool.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Right.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Long story short.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
I expected for, I, I context.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
That's what I was going to say.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
It's all about context.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
Like when I, when I explained like my mother being racist or like on the, on the album that I'm working on, I won't super get into that.

55:52.000 --> 55:58.000
But like I'm rapping from the perspective of, you know, a black man who told me that I wasn't shit, but a white boy.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
And he was like, you're just a white boy, nigga.

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
Which is like so, but no, it's really funny because it's so like that doesn't make any fucking sense.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
What you just said.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
And, and so in that context is, is when I use the word.

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
I love that idea that language can be thought and that it doesn't have to have these electric fences about it.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
But at the same time, it's not as simple as this libertarian linguistic policy of like, let's let it all slosh together because the most racist shit will be,

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
will be cloaked in false equivalents.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
People will go, well, I can say this, but so and so can't say that.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
It's like, yeah, context and history and all these things.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
So on one hand, you, you definitely want all of that in place because that's part of language and history.

56:40.000 --> 56:48.000
It's like that to me, the enemies are people who are certain about things and who have rules for other people about things.

56:48.000 --> 57:00.000
And the, and the people that will quote unquote solve any problems we have with, with anything really are the people that are so uncertain that all they have is to focus on is their,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
is their own gut and their own instinct and they have like this code.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
And I thought that was, I'm sure you're not the only one.

57:06.000 --> 57:12.000
And it's kind of like that, that made me, that gave me like a whole, it just, I don't know, it just made me happy.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
I was just like, oh, that's so cool that that word can be like any other chemical in a chemistry set.

57:18.000 --> 57:28.000
It can be like, yep, there's sulfuric acid and like you can use that to, like different people have different rules for how much of it they use and what circumstances they use.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
And it's like their own relationship with it.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I was like, that's, that's what it is.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
So basically that word is like your snail.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I mean, my guy's thinking about the craziest shit.

57:37.000 --> 57:53.000
Because my rule is very simple. I never, I use it constantly when I am alone, making sandwiches, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, I'm just like, it's all over all of my songs about how I need mustard.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Catch up.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Because it, because I have extra niggers.

57:57.000 --> 58:09.000
It's just me, it's like, I refer to myself and the third person as, as, as, as that and that, and that, and that, and that I need more mustard.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
And Jeff, Jeff does the same thing.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
Oh yeah, no, it's, it's, it's like Worcestershire sauce in my house.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Like, it goes here and there.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
I literally, I literally will use it as a pet name with my girlfriend.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
Like, I'm gonna, like, like, like, we, like, like,

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Oh, these are real things.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
We have to trust each other.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Is this a bit? Is this a real thing?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
No, no, it's real.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
You know what, here's one thing I just want to fucking say.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
Because there's a lot of people who, like, try to twist and turn and all types of stuff.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
And like, Dan, like, you're such a, like, a nice guy.

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
And like, and, and I wouldn't surround myself by people who weren't, you know, open minded and, and like, kind hearted.

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
And one thing, and I just kind of want to talk about this, is there are, there are extremists on both sides.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
And this is, this is also what my album has to do.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
You know what, I have not talked about my next album at all, because it's not coming out until later next year.

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
But one thing that I will say about it is it has to do not only with race relations,

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
but it has to do just once again with the equality of all men, women and children,

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
Because I believe that we are all born equal, but we are not treated equally.

59:10.000 --> 59:15.000
And when there's amazing people, you know, like yourself, and I'm sure everybody in this fucking crowd,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
because you guys, like, love these guys, you know what I mean?

59:17.000 --> 59:23.000
And what the show represents is like, when people will try to, like, pull the card and, like, flip it.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Because I believe that there's extremists everywhere, you know what I mean?

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
And even, like, with Black Lives Matter, for example, right?

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
So, when that hashtag was going around, you know, there was people tweeting me and saying,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
why aren't you hashtagging Black Lives Matter?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Were you not black?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
And it's like, whoa.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Like, why would you say something?

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Like, first of all, that's like the most racist shit, and you're trying to, you know what I mean?

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
And I think that there are extremists in everything, you know what I mean?

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
There's white extremists, there's black extremists, this is that.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
And I think, like, for example, like, just to bring this up,

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
like, Black Lives Matter, what that term means, and this is just what it is represented from the black community,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
is that there are black men, women, and children being murdered.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And, you know, they're just saying, like, we matter too.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
You know what I mean?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That's all it is.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And then there's those extremists who would be like, alright, let's go kill a bunch of white cops,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
or blah, blah, blah, or the extremists who would be like, you know, on the other side.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And I guess all I'm trying to say, and this is one thing, whether you know me or you don't know me,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
is that I'm here to represent fucking mankind and good people like yourself who can joke around and have fun

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and respect everyone.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So, swag.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And I even think there's, I think there's good people that get good results by doing, by like, problematizing

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
things that we complain about, like, do focus on language.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And you should say this and you shouldn't say that.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Be mindful of when you say this or that.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Like, there are important, like, goalposts being moved by people who think that way,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and there are also horrible vampire people who are like, oh, you can police language?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Well, now I just found myself a new bridge to troll under.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Like, I'm so comfortable here.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And I always say, like, the litmus test is, if you're doing something that you consider activism,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
like, if it's not just expressing yourself, which should be joyful and easy for everybody,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
but as a challenge, like, the, if you're, if you are labeling in your own head what you're doing is, like,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
speaking truth to power or sticking up for somebody or something like that,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
just quickly just a little baby flow chart in the sidebar of your head, like,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
is what you're doing difficult at all?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Are you putting yourself at any risk by saying what you're saying?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And that's not to say that if the answer is no, you shouldn't do what you're doing.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's just, just remind yourself of that. Have that compass on your dashboard next to everything else

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
on your dashboard that should all be yours.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Like, like, but always remember in those moments, like, don't get too carried away

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000
because the people that were acting in racism in the 50s, they were, they were outraged.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
They were victims. They were underdogs.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
They thought that they were battling a horrible force that was telling them

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
that they had to eat sandwiches at the same counter as other people.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Like, they were doing what was easy. Like, they were expressing, like, all of this outrage.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And it's like, we need to, like, that's like the big cane that I shake at young people.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It's like, like, there's probably a kind of like one-for-one analog between you and some old white dude

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000
in the 50s. Like, as far as the amount of battle you're fighting with this tweet.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Like, you're a tweet. The hashtag. That's why I think it's all bullshit

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
because there's people out there saying like, once again, when they're like,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
why don't you do this hashtag? It's like, no, fuck that. I'm going to go do a whole album about it.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I'm not just going to do it so it lives in the moment to look cool.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Like, don't argue with me. And I think at the end of the day, man, once again,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
like, I like to argue. I enjoy it. I love to have debates and crazy conversations

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
with people about race and politics and religion and fucking my favorite television show

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
or cartoons or anime or Rubik's cubes or whatever the hell I'm into.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
But the thing is, like, I love doing that with like-minded individuals, open-minded individuals.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Like, you know, when I was young, my mom was super crazy about Jesus.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And now I'm like, I don't know if God exists, but I believe in an energy.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And there's certain people that would be like, no, fuck you. You're going to hell. Jesus exists.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It is what it is. Like, you know what I mean?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Yeah. And then other people going, that's a damn shame because people that believe in an energy

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
burnt women in the Salem, which trials it. And it's like, that conversation is about whether or not

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
you should think what you think as opposed to the other person going, oh, thank you for that information.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
When I was young, I did blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And then you both go, uh-huh. And then you're like, both, your brains are a little bit bigger.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Yeah. Like, even if you don't agree with someone, no, this is a real thing.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And they're like, you know, and this is why it's, I've always been kind of scared to have these talks.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And that's why I'm excited for my whole next album because it's not just about black and white and this and that.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Once again, it's about everyone. And it's like, I was so scared for so long to talk about this shit because like,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
as soon as you bring up, you know, black men and women in America, it's like, oh, what'd you say?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And they fucking, you know, every little thing or this or that or whatever or religion, you know, and it's just this like thing

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000
that gets at you. And it's like, man, I'm, instead of being scared to talk about it, I'm going to talk about that shit

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and I'm going to bring it up, but I'm going to do it in a way that hopefully educates, especially the youth,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and just being open-minded. If you believe, if you're Baptist or Catholic or this or that, like, and you believe that,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000
that's cool. If you believe that the dude who goes to church on Saturday and not Sunday is going to hell because of that,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
that's cool. Just like, stop fucking telling them you're going to hell and stop yelling and screaming and like, hating it.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
That's just the shit that's like, super fucking annoying to me, man. Just let people live, dawg.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I kind of want, for those of you, those of you that aren't familiar with it, you were describing your last album.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You're doing a Comic-Con panel for your last album, which I got to run and pirate after this.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Popcorn Time. Nice. I'm so old and rich, I don't know how to pirate anymore.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You know what's crazy? I'm going to go right to Target. That shit's like dying. Like, honestly streaming and all that shit is almost dying.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
My life used to be Lime Wire. I got every Adobe product. Lime Wire. Oh, you took it back, dawg.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I was just sitting there and I was like, I want to learn Avid. Okay, now I want to learn Final Cut.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Now I want to learn Adobe everything. And I was like, boom, boom. And I would sit there as a 27-year-old and I'd go,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.000
they know that one day I'll be rich and I'll need to use Photoshop. And I was right.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I've given Adobe so much more money than they ever would have earned if I had been like a kid.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That's what I started recording on. I started recording on a thing called Adobe Audition 1.5, which is crazy.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And this was like a really shit, I'm not going to say this is a shit program, but like considering like Pro Tools and all this other stuff.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So I did this and I was on a Yahoo chat hip-hop. It wasn't like some sexual shit.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And this guy, I was like, oh, I was 16 years old and I was on really bad internet and I said, hey, do you know a program I could use to record?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And he says, yeah, I can give you the file right now. And he sent me the file and he stayed in the chat for six hours and let the whole thing download.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And if it wasn't for that, honestly, I wouldn't be here. Yeah, that really changed my whole life.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
That man's name?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I fucking had no clue.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Fucking Shug Knight.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Shug Knight at Yahoo Messenger.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Say what you will about Shug. He'll fucking be there for you for the download.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
He gets a lot of fucking bad press.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Sugar Bear.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
But he'll walk you through that shit.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Yeah, no, he dangled a producer over a balcony for me for three and a half hours.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000
If he had pulled them back up from the hotel balcony at two hours and 45 minutes, the whole thing would have been lost.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It would have been like your mom getting on the phone when you're downloading in the 80s.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Oh, that album. You were talking about the...

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Do you have a name for your new album?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
The album.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I do, but I can't.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
It's new album secret, but based on your old album.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
But on the last album, yeah, so I have a Comic-Con panel next week in New York.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And I did it last year as well, and it's for my last album called The Incredible True Story,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
which was originally going to be called The Incredible True Story in transformation of the man who saved the world,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
but like, ain't no fucking blonde college girl remembering that shit.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So we just changed it to The Incredible True Story, which the acronym is TITS, nice.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah, so I released that in Elevator Pitch.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
The year is 2065.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
In 2065, yeah.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
The last human footprint was left on Earth before sending to a space station called Babble,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
where there was only 5 million human beings left, and for the last 50 years from 2065 on,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
we've been looking for a habitable planet. It's like Rap Interstellar.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So, the cool thing is that at the beginning of the album, you press play,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
and at the end of it is a skit in what I like to call an audio-cinematic experience.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Now, I was watching... No, this is a real thing.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I was watching a... That's a real fucking thing, bro.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I was watching a documentary called I Know That Voice.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I don't know if you guys have seen it, but I love it. It's amazing.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And while watching it, I saw one of my favorite voice actors of all time.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
His name is Steve Blum. He's done Spike on Cowboy Bebop.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
He's on Star Wars Rebels. He's done so many different things.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And in his portion of the interview, he goes,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
yeah, I mean, you know, like, this is a job.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Anybody can hire you. And I was like, what?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Anybody can hire this guy? Are you serious?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
So, like, I reached out to my people, and I got his agents' information,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and I was like, oh, my God, yo, I fucking love you.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I was like, you're the best, bro.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And we met, and we sat down, and he agreed to do it.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Mind you, this is like one of my childhood heroes.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I absolutely love this guy. He agreed to do it, and he plays a captain named Thomas anyway.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So on their way to this planet called Paradise that they hope is habitable for human beings,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
they're listening to oldies music from 100 years ago,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and that happens to be my album that they're listening to from there to there.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And it's like this really cool story, and that's what we're doing the panel on.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It's basically a year later how much has happened.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And here's the crazy thing. One thing that I really want to say is like,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
once again, you know, I've faced a lot of shit in my life, and a lot of it's been really hard,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
but the crazy thing is some of the hardest things later in my life was being a nerd,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
was, like, loving Rubik's Cubes and video games and all this in hip-hop.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
What the fuck? That was the weirdest...

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
He came into the room, and then I watched you work, and you, like, threw a wrap together,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
and we're, like, taking suggestions and doing all this shit.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And then in the middle of it, you didn't bring it.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I should have brought my Rubik's Cube today.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
It was, like, laying out because Justin's a maniac.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Yeah, it's fucking weird.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
And it was a Rubik's Cube, and you picked it up, and it was, like, 1982.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That's incredible, like, record-setting.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And then you did it behind your back.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
What?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Damn, I wish I had it. Why the... Damn it.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yo, blame my assistant Christian, wherever the fuck he is right now.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Well, have your back, and we'll show you a little...

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
There is assistant Christian...

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I mean, honestly, assistant Christian...

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Assistant Christian, oh, the time has come.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Pull my fro you and my...

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I can't be the first person to have sung as assistant Christian.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
That's definitely that you're the first person.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I fucking love it.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Nice.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Where's my record?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But it's okay, because, honestly, the thing about solving Rubik's Cube

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
really fast is that verbally saying that you did it, as long as there's someone to vouch for you,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
it's just as impressive as watching it.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It's pretty cool. Super fun.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Oh, sorry.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Get your drink on.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I derailed you about that, but I think...

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So you're already into the sci-fi scene, the concept album scene.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You came up from underneath the cloud, through the cloud streets.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I want you to have a radio play hit song.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Crazy.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000
If the weekend can have 11 of them, then you can have several.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You want to know something?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I was very distraught at different points in my career, because I didn't have that.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And there was actually times when...

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
It's not that I was going to make different music, because the message is always the same,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
which is one of following your dreams and doing what you love.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But, you know, sonically, I was like, man, there's times when I found myself in the studio,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
like, man, damn, this dude's popping, or that dude's popping.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Like, damn, should I make some radio shit?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Is that what's going to do it?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
There were times where I really thought it would, but I was like, it just doesn't feel right.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Did you have any embarrassing moments where you tried a little...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
No, I mean, I had...

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I would like...

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Sure, I made fun radio songs, and it's not that they were bad.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I looked in the mirror and I was like, nah, this isn't me.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I still make fun radio-type-esque records, but not that sounds like the same shit.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You know what I mean?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And so I told myself, like, no, I'm going to stay true to myself and my roots and what I do.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And so just not to flex, but just to give you an example,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
then this is why we're doing the panel again a year later.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So nowadays, I'm not going to name any names, because I don't want it to be taken the wrong way,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000
but there's a lot of humongous pop stars that, one, cannot sell tickets on their tours,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and you can't sell records where they're selling more, they're selling like 50 or 60 or 70,000.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Now, I know some of you guys...

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Shakira, talking to you.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
No.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Shakira!

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Now, I know that some of you guys might think like, oh, no, I'm going to fucking sell millions and millions of records.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Like, no, that's not true.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
This isn't like 96, you know what I mean?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yeah, Shakira.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
That doesn't work anymore.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Your hips lie now.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
They do.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000
So there's artists, huge artists, pop artists, pop stars and girls who sing pop and all this stuff

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
who are only moving 50, 60, 70, 80,000 units in their first week.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And so I said, fuck that, you know, because of singles.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And I said, I'm going to make albums.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I want to be an album artist.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And in my first week on my last album, I sold 135,000 in the first week.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
This is like, everybody keeps arguing on TV panels.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
They keep going, oh, television, where's television going?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And I'm like, it's like, you know, it's not like I'm the only one that can see it, but it just seems like it's so obvious.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Like, all you have to do is just look at the MP3 threshold that the music went through because of the lower bandwidth.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Because a song began as a thing that was, you know, it was 3.5 megabytes.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And there was a tipping point we hit where the music industry was in big trouble as it knew itself.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And then there was all this argument about, should we sue this technology, all this stuff?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
It happens over and over and over again.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I was a communications major in college before I dropped out a week into college.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.000
But I did take the one class where they, like, this has been happening since, when TV got rolled out,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000
movies were like, they said the exact same things that the record labels said about MP3s.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Because they were like, they went to the government and said, you should make TV illegal.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Because this isn't fair. If people can look at a screen at home, why would they ever go to the movie?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
When phonographs were putting people's houses, people were buying phonographs and buying records,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
the people that made sheet music were like, we're fucking out of a job.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
When sheet music, people were selling sheet music bands were like, no one's going to go out and see live music anymore.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Because people can just go home and play it by themselves.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And then the truth that emerges is it's never more good, it's never more bad, it's more good and more bad.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So what you're saying is verifying my prediction about how TV is going to go is that either Vince Gilligan

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:17.000
or a 26-year-old Vince Gilligan that doesn't have a Breaking Bad like available to him,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
because he has our next files, staff writing job or anything, like there's no system left for him to go through,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000
or they're going to, Louis C.K. is already doing it, they're going to Howard Hughesify the TV industry,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
it's going to turn into just everybody's just self-employed.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000
No, I agree. I think honestly a lot of people when streaming of music first started, everybody was like, no.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But that's everything. It saved the music industry.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So Universal Music Group, which is like the biggest fucking label there is, was up two years ago,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
more than they had been in years and years because of streaming.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So I think what it really comes down to is just like demand.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Like we as people in this era in time, we want it right now, you know what I'm saying?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Like Stranger Things, one episode, fuck that, I want them all.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
You know Fuller House Season 2? Hurry the fuck up.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Roger, that's real.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
You want to come watch Westworld at my place tonight?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
There's pizza on the floor.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
When you say you're making an album, I'll distract you from not having to answer that question.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000
When you think of making an album because that's an art form that's kind of gone away, some people still do.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Like how many tracks, is it all thematic?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
That's such a good question, dude.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Oh, I got loads.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I had some good ones.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Can I awkwardly go use the restroom and then come back?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I just drank like two bottles of water and I've been up here.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
So I'm going to come back and answer your question about...

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I want you to think good and hard about that while you're here tonight.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Good and hard, yes.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You go pee and I'll talk to Jeff about his question asking.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I'm glad somebody finally asked it.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
What the fuck was that?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
What?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
You went over my head, you're trying to show me up.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I have penetrating journal...

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I dropped out of college with a journalism major that I didn't get.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Yeah.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Well you just penetrated me.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Huh?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
On my show.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Dude, Harmon...

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Harmon, you text it to me, let me ask it.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
If I penetrate you, you're going to fucking know you got penetrated.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
That's how penetrating my questions are.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Alright, hit a beat while he's gone.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Zach, where you at?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
We got Zach back there?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
No.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Where's fucking Zach go?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
The one show we need Zach with the beats.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Acapella?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Yeah, do it.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Let's do it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Acapella.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Yo.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yo.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Yo.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Yo.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Yo.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Yo.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Yo.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Yo.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yo.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Yo.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:41.920
I fuck the two.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.420
It's a name, it doesn't have to make sense.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.040
You can be named anything.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.500
Logic's peeing so I'm rapping.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.640
He's going, he's peeing not crapping.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.680
It's number one, it's not number two.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680
I fuck your mama!

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.180
What you going to do?

01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:59.120
Please, go in designer clothes.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:05.000
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.580
Other Adult

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.280
Well I'm that mama.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:24.520
Oh, my name is DJ Truck, I don't know why I'm rapping, I'm usually a DJ by trade.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.520
You have 10 seconds to rap.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:35.400
But some of us, some of us, some DJs rap now, it's, the industry is, he's back, he's

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.400
back, he's back.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:48.800
So anyways, Star Wars, yes, not all nerf herders are scruffy, first Star Wars, but tell us

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.880
about your pee, how'd it go?

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:51.880
It was awesome.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.680
Do you guys know Dolly Parton's playing the Hollywood Bowl?

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680
Yeah.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
She's so good.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.520
Hey, I'm Dolly Parton, I don't, that's what you said.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.520
Are you Dolly Parton fan?

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.400
No, but check it out, so my mother-in-law is, and she had my wife who's sitting back

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.000
like fourth row, love you baby doll, swag.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.560
No, so anyway, so we're in the car, and she's like, oh babe, take a picture of that and

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.560
send it to my mom.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.560
And I'm like, what are you saying?

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560
What are you talking about?

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560
She's like, yeah, just tell her we're at that concert.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560
And I'm like, what?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560
That's fucked up.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.800
She's like, yeah, it's my mom's favorite artist.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800
Wait, she's there right now, Dolly Parton?

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.320
Yeah, Dolly Parton's at the Hollywood Bowl.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320
10 nights.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320
Yes, but here's the crazy thing.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
I know.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.040
What am I doing here at this fucking shit show?

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:37.560
Because while I was in there taking a piss, Dolly Parton, a TV guide, just staring at

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560
me.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560
It sounds real nice.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560
Like a current one?

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.560
No.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.060
Definitely like 1906.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.440
I saw Dolly Parton play at the Greek amphitheater, which is one of my favorite places to see

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440
anybody.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440
Really?

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.560
And everybody in that place had a good time.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560
Everybody laughed.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560
Everybody cried.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.760
She tells the greatest stories of all time.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.120
Can I ask you a quick question?

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.120
Yeah.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:04.280
I played the forum the last time I was in LA, and that was a lot of fun.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.520
And I'm not necessarily, I don't know if I want to go to the forum again, because it's

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.520
awesome.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.520
Yeah.

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.520
But it's an hood.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.520
No, I'm just kidding.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.520
It's an angle hood.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.520
I'm just joking.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.280
But I've always wanted to do the Greek.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.240
Play the Greek, because there's no bad city to the Greek.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.720
I know, but the thing is it's just capacity-wise, it's only like 6,000.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.200
It's pretty small, but as Neil Diamond said, it's where great musicians get to go to when

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200
they die.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.680
That's the place to play.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680
Okay.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.680
I feel like it's a very satisfying place to play.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.560
I feel like it would be a lot of fun, but I heard that it's kind of quiet.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560
Is that true?

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560
No.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560
Okay.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.280
I mean, I've seen a lot of shows there, and I've been in the front, and I've been

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.960
way in the back, and it's pretty tasty audio there.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960
Fucking noted.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960
Yeah.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:50.160
But then again, I don't know, for rap, because it's in a residential neighborhood up there.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160
What she said, because I'm black, isn't that going to work?

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160
Yeah.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.160
I'm scared.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.840
The property values are going to go down.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.280
The next show's tickets will be the lower price.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.280
It'll be like $2 a pop.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280
No, I'm joking.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.120
John Tesh, $2.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120
What happened?

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120
Oh, a black show.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120
What happened?

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120
Dolly Parton looked out.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.120
You know the song, Jolene?

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.120
You know, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.120
It's a great song.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.640
I don't know that much, Dolly.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.160
She looked out of the crowd, and she goes, you know, I don't mean any offense, but I'm

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:24.880
looking out of my audience, and I know my audience when I come to Hollywood, but I really,

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.160
I would like to sing the first verse of this as drag queen, drag queen, 4,000 of the 6,000

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.880
people stood up, and they were all drag queens.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880
Really?

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880
Oh, yeah.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.320
It was draggy as fuck.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.160
It was real good.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160
It was really...

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160
Draggy.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.440
Dolly plays every instrument in the fucking building.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.560
She plays the horn, the piano, like the violin.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.560
Really?

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560
Yeah, guitars.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560
She plays everything.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.560
I didn't know that.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.560
Dolly puts on a program.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.080
That's how I saw Dolly Parton, who was on Hannah Montana, because my wife was making

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080
me watch it.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:58.160
That's what I was telling you in the greeners, Miley Cyrus, I heard, like she, because Billy

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160
Ray was...

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
Billy Ray.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.360
I don't know, contemporary.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:10.000
She hung out a lot, and so Miley Cyrus cites Dolly Parton as an early mentor.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.720
She tells the most inspirational, sad, beautiful, heartwarming story about, well, I forget the

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.160
name of the small town that she grew up in, but it's quite small, and I don't even remember

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160
the state.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160
Tennessee, where's she from?

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.160
Tennessee.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160
Tennessee.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:29.920
And her father was ruled down to earth, ruled just good, well-meaning, moralistic father,

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.720
and when she got really famous, they erected a big statue in the center of town of Dolly,

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.560
and he kept saying to her, don't let this go to your head.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.560
You're still Dolly.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.080
You're still the girl from the small town.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.080
Don't ever let this become who you are.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.280
That statue doesn't mean anything, and she's like, yeah, but it's my statue.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.920
I made it, dad, and she's like, yeah, but don't get a big head about this.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.480
She found out many years later that in the middle of the night, he would go out and clean

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.920
the bird poop off her statue.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.920
Damn, that's awesome.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:56.920
What a good story.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920
I wanted to hate him so bad.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920
No.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.920
No, I was on board.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.920
I was fucking lost in fucking family rage.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:09.040
I was like, that fucking asshole, I hope this ends with him dying.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.040
I was like, no, what you were seeing was my therapy exercises.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.920
I was like, he loved that statue more than anybody else because it was his little girl

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.240
and he wouldn't let any bird shit on her and it was fucking great.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.040
All right, well, let your little girl think she's bigger than your tail when she gets

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.040
a statue.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040
That's why I pissed.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040
I took a piece.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040
Oh, yeah.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.720
Tell me about when you say you're going to make an album now, which is a dying art because

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:34.040
like when we grew up, albums were a thing that the story got told, or even if they didn't

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.920
mean to tell a story, they would arrange the songs in a way that if you could play a record

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.880
from front to back on the first side and flip the tape or flip the record or whatever, like

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.920
you were going through this journey.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:50.560
So like, if you're one of those people and you clean your weed on the, if it was a like

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.240
total concept album would fold it open and you could clean your weed because you pinch

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.440
it up here and the seeds rolled down into the middle.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.440
So logic.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:07.240
So when you're making an album, like, how do you approach that?

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.240
And also, is there like, that's, that's where you think the market is right now that you

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.240
think that people.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.080
The market's 100 million percent not into the album.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.800
The market is into singles and EPs and fucking get, you know, make as much money as you can

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.520
as quick as you can.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.320
And once again, that's where I had to defy the odds.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.360
I mean, even with my last album, it was a rap album about space.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:36.400
But I mean, like think, like imagine me walking into Def Jam, okay, like Def Jam and being

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.240
like, yeah, so I got this cool idea about like space and rap.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240
How's that?

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.760
And they're like, what?

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:50.080
And I'm like, are there any, there's a lot of amazing stories about music history of

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:57.480
one person, one of the few great artists loving a record producers like label people that

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.120
would stick their necks out and say, no, we need to, we need to make this record because

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120
this is going to be important.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.600
And the top of, you know, the head of Capitol Records said, no, nobody wants to buy that

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600
shit.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.200
But it ends up being Dave Brubeck's take time out, you know, the biggest jazz record of

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.200
all time.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.120
And nobody ever wanted to make, are there still people that you think, do they even

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.720
exist in the record industry that would stick their necks out and support an artist doing

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720
that?

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.720
No.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720
Just because there's no money in it.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.120
No, it's not that it's like, you know, who supported me was my manager, but he's also

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120
my best friend.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.280
So I'm signed to an independent visionary music group.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.160
And through that, we did, we did a partnership with IDJ, which is then, which is Def Jam,

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.840
which is then Universal is this whole fucking matrix.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.000
And, and yeah, I mean, we had to defy a lot, a lot of the odds, you know, there was a lot

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.040
of things that they were like, eh, we don't want to do this or we don't want to do that.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.680
And we were like, fuck you going to do it anyway.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.680
Right.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.680
And we did it.

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.440
And the reason, but the reason we had that leverage is because of the things like the

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440
mix tapes.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.600
My man's checking Twitter because I'm just kidding.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600
I'm joking.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600
I'm joking.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.680
The moment the guest turned to start to me, Dan checks right the fuck out.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.680
Nice.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.680
Well, no, that's obviously that's my luxury.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.680
I'm sorry I'm visible that I was checking on our sponsor to see if what the fuck we're

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.680
supposed to say about their product.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680
Nice.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.400
I wanted you guys to be doing what you're doing.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.400
It was good.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.760
It was a good opportunity for me to look at this.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.760
I'm sorry.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.760
Yes.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.760
I don't even know what we were talking about.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.760
The album making process.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.760
Yeah.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.960
So is your next one, can you say, is it going to be another like thematic?

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960
It is.

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.960
It is.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:31.800
Bowie Esk, Ziggy Stardust journey into there is a huge theme.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.160
I'm really excited about it.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.120
I wish I could give you the title now, but I can't.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.120
Is it called crumb rumblers?

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.200
Because that would be fucking fun.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.200
But you know what, I will give you the title to my next album.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.040
Well, well, well, it looks like there's a Harmontown exclusive here.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.600
This is a real thing because you know what, because everything that we've been talking

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.000
about, I think, I think it'd be great and, and you know, it's not too crazy.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.320
It's just the title.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:00.400
Before I give you the title, I want you to know that it is a word that I created.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.240
I formed, I formed to know it's not that word.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.040
Nas did that.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.840
But it's two words that I put together and basically the definition of it is the cultural

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:17.200
evolution of man from scientifically proven the first man and woman from Africa and then

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.320
how over time culturally evolving into a, you know, lighter and lighter and much more

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.560
fairer skin.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.280
So the album is going to be called Afrikarian and it's no real shit.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.640
And it's about, it's about me being black and white and seeing life from, from two sides.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.480
And once again, about that cultural evolution and how you can go from the darkest of skin

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.880
to the lightest of skin or the Aryan brotherhood, if you will, who believe that they're pure

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.600
of blood when at the end of the fucking day, we all have, you know, that, that in our blood

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.560
and we all have so, so many different ethnicities in our blood, no matter how pure we think

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.560
that we are.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.800
And that at the end of the day, life should all be, should be about peace, love and positivity

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.440
and equality for all every man, woman and child that walks the earth.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.520
And that's what I'm saying on this entire album.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.720
I'm going to buy that record.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.720
I'm going to buy that record.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.720
Here.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:06.720
Here.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.720
Exclusive.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:08.720
Yeah.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:21.640
I definitely, I think what you're saying is that humanity could use a good shave.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.440
And they need to understand that they need to stop thinking that they need to choose

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.800
between price and quality to get an amazing and affordable shave.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.800
That's like legit.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.720
Like, that's what the fucking album is about.

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.720
Exactly.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.720
That is like exact.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.520
Dan, Dan, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you, you're not talking about Dollar Shave Club,

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.520
are you?

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520
Wait.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.520
Well, I, oh, oh, no, I, but are you, are you talking about Dollar Shave Club?

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.800
You're, you're, you're certainly talking to their language.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800
Yeah.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.320
I mean, it sounds like you're talking about maybe my favorite place.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:59.360
I just read in my texts about Dollar Shave Club.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.360
Which part, which line?

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.360
Well, I just started.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.120

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:13.720
Hey, for a third of the price of what the greedy razor, they really wrote that?

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.040
Guys, logic, Dan, bad pitch.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.000
Let's just, let's just kill two birds one stone.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
No, logic.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Keep the text there.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.040
Can we put a bead on and maybe try to wrap this?

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.200
Well, can I have your phone?

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.200
So that we have our talking points and we can like Dollar Shave Club.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:32.680

and we'll just tell everybody about Dollar Shave Club.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.680
I mean, hit the points, but let's put a beat on

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.640
before you get peed on.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.480
Okay.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.320
Ha ha ha.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.160
Ha ha ha.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:50.160
Uh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.680
When you shave, you want to save.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.280
You don't want to spend, you want to mend.

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.760
Dollar Shave Club's bringing quality.

I'm talking about equality between the bearded

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.120
and the clean shaven.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.120
I saw your mama, and I'm going to be saving money.

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:06.960

It's real nice.

The executive blade.

Like the mafia made Joe Pesci.

When you shave with this, you're going to look hessy.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.040
It's a new word that means clean shaven.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:29.040
Yeah.

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.360
Yo, you don't even have to give them P.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.640
Just pay shipping.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.640
Just pay shipping?

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:52.400
After that, after that, a few bucks a month, no hassle,

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.800
no, just a few bucks a month.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.000
The long-term commitment, no hidden fees,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.200
except the shipping fees.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.200
That's the shit, this.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.200
Ha ha ha.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:09.720
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.960
Go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Harmontown.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.920
You're going to turn the thing that's hiding your frown upside

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.760
down and then off your face.

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.000
Put it in the basket, take it to a race.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.560
Black, white, you need to get together.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.800
Tickle your skin like a feather.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.880
Oh, you're so soft.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.080
I don't know your ethnic.

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.520
What?

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.200
I thought you'd take it from there.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.280
You know what I'm talking about.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.960
You actually offended logic, then.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.040
You offended both of my races.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.080
My phone went dead.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.080
At the same time.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.480
I thought you'd take it from there.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:47.840
What?

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.400
OK, all right.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.640
Dollar Shave.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.200
100 pennies, it's not a lot.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.520
You got beard on your face.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.000
A collect snot.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.360
Clean that shit off with a knife that comes on a handle.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:05.960
All your life, you're going to feel younger and more executive.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.240
Don't wreck, you give.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:12.000
Yo, yo.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.320

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.080
Make a splat.

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.360
Dollar Shave Club.com.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.920
What's bats doing in here?

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.920
Batman, motherfuckers.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.480
Oh, I'm Batman.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.040
Batman and Robin.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.000
Yo, I'm Batman.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.480
Batman, yo, yo, yeah.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.600
I'm going to switch it up.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.200
Yeah, bat rap.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.160
The full house rap.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.280
Oh, shaving bat rap.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.040
Yo, check it, I'm about to fucking rap this bad.

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.520
I got to get it like that.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.400
This is how we do it.

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.760
Got to shave my face for saving grace.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.960
This is how we do it, man.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:50.840
Pardon.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.280
I'm about to chill with my home girl, Dolly Parton.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.160
Yeah, bring it back again.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.760
This is how we got to do it when we're naked in him.

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.920
I don't even know what the hell I'm saying.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.640
So I'm going to pass it to my man.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.000
Yo, yo.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.160
With your life I'm saving.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.200
My face I'm shaving.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.360
I can't turn my head so you know when I shave,

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.560
I don't like to spend bread.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.520
So Dollar Shave Club is where it's at.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:20.120
It gets sent to the Bat Cave and that's where it's at.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.240
So I use it on my face and I go out and I save people.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.600
I prefer to think of all race.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.920
But I have had some criticisms.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.080
But I would blame that on crime.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.040
I'm not going to do quota vigilanceism.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.480
That doesn't get us anywhere.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.600
I had white parents.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.640
They got killed.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.480
Got killed.

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.720
Yo, they got killed.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.640
Got killed.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.320
When that parents got killed, that was ill.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.800
It was ill to kill.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.440
My parents before I had my parenthood filled.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.680
When I'm just like a bat, you think

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.360
you know that it's all about that.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.520
But I just want to put fear in the hearts of enemies.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.880
I fucked your mama so hard, she's now a friend of me.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.160
Yo, I made her pussy go wide and Batman's inside.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.800
Made a little robin, pulled it out, gave him a costume,

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.640
and said run about.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.960
Be my sidekick, help me fight crime.

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.200
But I'm going to stay in the cave and bust some rhymes

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.240
with logic, logic, Batman, logic.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.160
So I think it's always good to show up

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.240
as advice when you have a professional rapper on stage

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.240
to do most of the rapping yourself.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:53.480
I, look, let's clean up some details.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.960
I think we covered most of it, but there's still

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:58.640
more bills to pay.

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.400
But it was the idea, the general idea of that rap,

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.360
which I think came through, was that price and quality,

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.840
they don't need to compete.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.280
It's like if you're a biracial rapper.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.960
How much are they paying us for this?

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.760
Wait, no, no, no.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.040
How much are they paying me?

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.480
Because that's exactly.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.880
We're going to kick start your fourth, this next album.

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.440
You've got that.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.080
The one after that.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.840
Then your next album has to be all about shaving.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.920
Can I get that Dolly Parton feature, though?

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.360
Price and quality.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.520
Don't let them compete.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.320
You can get the quality for a low price

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.520
and get an amazing and affordable shave.

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.560
And take my word for it.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.640
MC shaves a lot.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.000
I shave constantly.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.480
Show me your glistening balls.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.360
Yeah, yeah, that's dirty.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.640
You need to be shaved.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.640
Oh, no.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.360
Oh, plus lines.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.040
You did not just go there, girlfriend.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.880
Oh, my goodness, girl.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.080
I shave my balls so much with Dollar Shave Club

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.720
that I need me undies to cradle them.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.400
Or I'd get like cotton burns.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.440
No, those two companies are total rivals.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.480
It's like Pepsi and Coke.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.040
They're owned by them.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.040
But they work so well together.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.720
That's like telling me Doritos and Taco Bell

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.560
don't get along.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.680
Come on.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.560
Have you met them?

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.520
That was witty.

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.320
That was great.

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.040
I mean, come on.

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.600
They got the Doritos Locos.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.960
That was a great joke.

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.200
DollarShaveClub.com's the answer.

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.040

Seriously?

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.200
We're going to hear about that shipping fee later.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:47.160
DollarShaveClub.com offers amazing razors right to your door

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.240
for a third of the price of what the greedy razor

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.680
corporations charge.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.400
Big razor.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.080
You've heard of big razor.

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.680
You don't have to deal with the drugstore.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.480
I mean, who wants to go to the drugstore just because you

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.400
have hair on your face?

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:00.880
That's ridiculous.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.280
I mean, I let you go down to the drugstore

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.680
to hear some tunes in the jukebox and get a phosphate.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.360
Stay away from the pool hall.

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.480
And yeah, don't go down there anymore to get your razors.

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.480
Don't do that.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.760
But old man Johnson, he's run that drugstore on my corner

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.080
for 50 years.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.560
He's a piece of racist shit.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:25.240
He built that drugstore was built by slaves.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.760
You're groaning your own country.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.720
No, it's true.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:31.640
Yeah, I heard that.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.360
Just go to DollarShaveClub.com and pick a razor that

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.920

Amazing blades, how sweet.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.680
The shave.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:39:02.240
That shave appears like a beard.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:02.920
Nice.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:15.120
I once had a beard, but now I shaved.

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.000
Twice Dollar ShaveClub.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.720

No long term commitment.

It's the longest ad.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.800

They used to have to get that micro machine guy.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.160
You don't know what I'm talking about.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.680
Dan has a really good impression of the Chef Motor

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:21.960
Model.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.200
Chef Lightning Lips.

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:23.520
What?

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.520
What is that?

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.000
What is that?

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.400
Chef Lightning Lips is an entertainer who's now

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.480
going to double his YouTube hits.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:31.760
Wait, wait, wait, what does he do?

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:35.320
What doesn't he do?

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.160
He says food fast.

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.760
So do you know I have the Lightning Lips?

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.320
Yeah.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.880
Did you know this?

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:44.400
Well, I mean, that's kind of sounds weird.

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.800
Well, maybe you need to demonstrate it with another.

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.480
I'm going to demonstrate.

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:49.400
How many foods can you say as fast as you can?

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.480
It's not about foods, but it's about description.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.320
So I have a song called Gang Related where

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.520
I'm rapping about my brother and the things

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.320
that he went through and a part of it.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.560
So it goes where he's basically talking about being

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.560
in the streets.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.640
But it goes, get down or lay down.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.520
Hit you with the Beretta.

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.840
You better stay down.

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.400
Straight side to the playground.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.640
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm giving.

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.920
Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.240
Show me the enemy and I'm going to hit them.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.640
The second I bit them, I get them and hit them with the venom.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.240
And I don't need to pretend I'm going to never do it.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:16.600
I knew it.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.520
I've already been through it.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.800
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life.

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.920
Anybody that's gang related.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.320
And when I do it on stage, I say, in one breath,

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.360
get down or lay down.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.000
Hit you with the Beretta.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:25.600
Get better, stay down.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.320
Straight shots in the playground, living how I'm living with the life

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:27.600
that I'm giving.

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.840
Anybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.680
Show me the enemy and I'm going to hit them.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.000
The second I bit them, I get them and hit them with the venom.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.040
I don't need to pretend I'm going to never do it.

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:32.280
I knew it.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:32.840
I've already been through it.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.120
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life.

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:35.120
Anybody that's gang related.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.360
But logic, you brought a knife to a gun fight

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.120
because you haven't heard Dan do a chef.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:01.720
When I talk about life in the streets,

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.320
one thing that I'll say is, I know you're a brother,

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.040
but I know another.

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:14.000
And I have a brother that's another that doesn't get his druthers.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.440
Because society is trying to smother the brother that's

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.840
another that doesn't get what he wants.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.160
So show.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.800
But when I'm on stage, sometimes I go,

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.520
a brother with another guy comes to get the gun.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.160
But then I'll stop and go, starting over.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.160
A brother with another guy, some other guy.

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.520
I mean, I'm sure what you do is fine.

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.440
It's like so fast that you can't even register.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.560
A brother with a guy.

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.560
She's so quick.

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.240
Micro-machines.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.480
Well, here's my serious question.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:43:00.760
So when you do something like that, is that so in that instance,

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.280
are you, do you think phonetically when you're writing,

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.400
obviously you must go, when you're writing lyrics, you go,

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.680
I think this is something a lot of people don't understand,

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.880
that only you and I get.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.560
Is that it's not about like, you don't just go like,

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.160
oh, I'm going to rhyme the word milk,

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.600
so then I'm going to say silk at the end of this thing.

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.920
It's like this phonetic like the entire time.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.240
So yes, I studied, obviously, like the dictionary

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.000
and the thesaurus as a kid.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.280
So it's just like live and given, just like these words that

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:35.320
Jeremy Piven.

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.120
Jeremy Piven, you know what I mean?

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.560
But there's a difference between just saying some shit.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.120
So I have this thing where I kind of have fun with it.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.400
So basically, that's a real thing.

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.560
You guys heard me say it, and it's kind of depicting this street

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.600
lifestyle that this guy is living.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.720
And I'm preaching to not live that way

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.240
and not have to deal with that.

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.680
But then there's fun ones.

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.080
So I could do little freestyles and be like, yo, it's

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.440
L-O-G-I-C, chilling in LA from MD.

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.720
The second I get it, you know who we be, right?

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.680
And then at the end, I'll end it and be like,

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.640
because I'm ripping and living like almost like some Jack

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.120
the River.

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.760
I said I'm ripping and living and striving.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.160
The killer, the ripper, he's calling what goes when he flow.

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.200
And this is where it's all just kind of syllable and just fun.

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.280
Calling what go when he flow.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.240
And you know he's pursuing it, doing it, moving it,

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.440
grooving it, stopping it, right?

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.480
Like all just kind of flexing and having fun.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.360
But when I say it back really fast, it's just ripping and

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.520
living, just dropping it, killing it, ripping, calling what

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:23.880
go when he flow.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.880
And you know he's pursuing it, doing it, moving it,

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.880
grooving it, stopping it, rocking it, talking about

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.920
walking it, flipping it, ripping it, motherfucking it,

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.360
screwing it, wanting to go when I buy it, then break it,

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.520
roll it, then lick it, then smoke a choke on it later.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.360
But what this is.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.520
It's like a roulette wheel.

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.640
Yeah, totally.

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.200
It's like price is right.

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.800
A cart and bike spoke.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.440
That's fun, because like me, it's almost like solving

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.160
a Rubik's Cube.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.320
So like next time, hopefully I can come and I'll do it.

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.600
But it's all about algorithms.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.120
It's like muscle memory or playing the drums.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.120
It's about logic.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.120
So what you do is you just memorize this and you just do

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.400
it over and over and over.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.000
And so when you are on stage and you are performing, I

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.480
slaved away on that gang-related verse, the first

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:01.920
one that I did.

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.600
That is a real thing that I did.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.200
This one's just like jerking off.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.160
This one's just like all these people who have no idea.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.360
I'm just like, yeah, ripping it, living it, dropping it,

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.080
killing it, ripping it, calling it.

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.920
And I'm taking these fun words and putting them together.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.560
But they're like, oh my god.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.440
So it's like cheating.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.640
But that's for fun though.

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.520
I actually do it.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.760
But that's just like the fun though.

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:20.160
But not cheating at all because your listener is going,

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.800
wow, he talks fast.

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.920
It's like you're talking about like, oh, but to add meaning

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.480
into that, to add a narrative.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.240
And then you're talking, when you're jerking off, you're

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.040
doing like, well, this word and that word are like.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:35.160
I'm still forming sentences, but it's more fun.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160
You know, like even the breakages.

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.200
Do you ever do one of those?

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.240
It's super fast, but you're just actually talking shit

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:39.760
about somebody.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.000
They don't know it.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.360
Or I just say some real satanic shit in there.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.800
No, I don't think so.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.920
Like, river to river to Shave Brave.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.760
Well, this is what I wanted to do.

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.320
Is that what it's called, Shave Brave?

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.440
Dollar Shave Club.

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.600
Oh, Dollar Shave Club.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.080
Shave Brave is the name of the year.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.240
I think that's a new Autobot from Transformer.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.560
Be brave to Shave.

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.360
Shave Brave.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.600
Wait, what the fuck is it called again?

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.000
Get over it on those.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:04.520
Shave Brave.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.400
Dollar Shave Club?

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.960
Dollar Shave Club.com.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.460
Nice.

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.320
So let me ask you a question real quick.

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.720
If you, if this person, like this company, they spot you,

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.320
but you like, can you like, make fun of them?

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320
Are you allowed to do that?

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.800
I think we're about to find out.

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.720
They'll either be back or they won't.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.120
I don't know if we offended me on these or if they use them.

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.560
That is like, that's like the first rule of Dollar Shave

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.280
Club.

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:31.320
We just totally fucked that up.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.520
But I think the beauty of the new world is it's like, well,

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.360
there's always going to be, it's more of a buyer's market

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.960
in the sense of like, you know, hey,

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.360
there'll be another Shave Club.

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.000
Hey, if it's, if it's, if it's a dynamic industry.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.720
Hey, can I just say that I was like super nervous to come out

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.080
here?

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.000
And no, I'm serious.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.760
I was so nervous, man, because like, this isn't,

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.560
this isn't like, this isn't my, my.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.680
You're jammed, the kids say.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.600
Go ahead.

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.680
Let me teach you some street culture.

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.440
It's not your jam.

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:01.920
What?

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.760
It's your jam.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.240
What?

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.440
No, it's not my jam.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.520
Oh yeah, I get it.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.040
It comes from jelly.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.320
You're making like sandwiches.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.640
Like, this isn't my jam.

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.320
But yes, I, I, uh, this isn't my jam.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.520
Like this is kind of, you know, this is like fun and,

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.880
and, and, you know, and comedic.

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.360
And also I, I do want to just say that I appreciate you kind

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.440
of like, let me talk about, you know,

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.000
some more serious stuff as well.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.800
But to everybody in the crowd who might not know me,

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.360
I just want to say thank you so much for even like sitting

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.720
through this and, and, you know, and I really appreciate it.

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:30.760
And this is fucking awesome.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.960
And I hope maybe just maybe massive that I can come back.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:34.600
Oh yeah.

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.760
Absolutely.

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.800
You should come back all the time.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.320
But I think we should conclude with,

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.760
this is what I was getting at earlier.

01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.640
It was like, our lives are intersecting.

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.760
I need to, when we go to the moon,

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.480
and you did the sci-fi rap thing,

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.880
it's about exodus from the earth and stuff.

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.680
So I think like you could help us create like a

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.160
Harmontown anthem that should probably be hip hop.

01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.000
We'll just like, we'll close with that and then we'll go.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.200
This is not going to go well.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.560
But I think it will cause.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.640
Well, let me ask you real quick, Dan, to cut you off.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.440
You said you're nervous to come out here,

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.640
but are you nervous when you go on stage at the forum?

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.120
What's that, 40,000 people?

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:15.960
What do you got there?

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.240
It wasn't 40,000, but you know, some of the shows we did,

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.320
they were like 20,000.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.120
Yeah.

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.760
Are you nervous when you go on and do your own thing,

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760
or you're not prepared?

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.600
Not really.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.160
If I haven't done it in three months,

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.640
and then I'm, you know, I have like a one-off show

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.480
or a festival, I get like, oh man, I'm excited.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.080
But as soon as I touch the stage, I'm like, it goes away.

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.920
But this is different, but it's not a bad thing.

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.080
It's actually really nice because there's less and less

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.800
things, not to sound any type of way, but like, you know,

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:40.120
like the last time, this is gonna sound crazy.

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.800
The last time I felt how I felt like sitting back there,

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.480
it was when I performed on Jimmy Fallon with the Roots

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.880
for nine million viewers.

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.240
And it's because I performed so many times

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.600
in front of so many people and this and that,

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.680
that like, I'm used to that.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.280
Performing on television was crazy.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.440
Doing this, like, you know, I watched,

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.360
and I was telling Dan this, like,

01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.840
I wasn't really hip to all of this.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.160
Obviously, I knew Dan, and I love Rick and Morty,

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.560
and I know community, and you know,

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.720
all these different things, but I didn't really know

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.480
about this world, and I did my homework,

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.560
and I watched fucking Harmontown,

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.960
I watched Documentary, I watched everything,

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.360
and then I got real scared, like, oh shit,

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.840
I can't fuck this up, you know?

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.680
And so it's just-

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.520
And clearly, in the meantime,

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.400
I'm diligently listening to all your albums.

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.960
Yeah, yeah, totally.

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:23.080
I came so prepared, but yeah, no, I think they would,

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.400
I mean, I know that you are like, cut out for podcasting.

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.800
Like, you should be, because it's just a,

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:34.160
like, you're cut, we're on the over, Jesus, I'm drunk.

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.560
You should, you have leftovers.

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.160
You're cut for our breath over.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.840
You're practicing a craft on stage,

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.360
and on your albums, you're putting those things together

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.920
meticulously, but, and it's not a waste of all of the,

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.200
you know, when you're 80 years old,

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.000
and you're a hologram, like,

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.240
if you want to avoid going like, oh shit, man,

01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.760
I was chugging and chugging and chugging,

01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.440
and how much of that smoke went into albums

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.280
and things that I took so preciously,

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:04.880
it's like, you're fun to listen to just having coffee,

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.880
so that's what podcasting is.

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.080
Like, you could just scoop up all that butter

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.440
and dog pizza and put it in and dog pizza.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.520
Logic, what he was saying is, stop selling out

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.320
and, you know, making all this money on records,

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.280
and just really get into the podcast world.

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.600
Yeah.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.000
I know, it's a side-to-side action.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.920
Join my, join my click, join my company.

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:24.760
Exactly.

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.160
It'll, it'll, it'll, no, it's,

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.520
it's something to do in the meantime.

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.360
I've thought about it.

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.200
Keep the voices out of your head.

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.240
No, I'm legit, I've thought about it.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.480
I thought how it could be something that'd be really fun

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.400
and maybe to do like once a month and just, you know,

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.920
and just have, well, but here's the real fucking question.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.440
Don't do it with ear wolf.

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.280
So.

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:42.920
Oh, I thought that's what he was gonna ask.

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:46.000
So, if, if I, if I truly, if I do,

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.720
if I start my own podcast,

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.800
will you two come be on one of my episodes?

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.520
Of course, that's part of the, yes.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.160
Okay, cool.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.600
Nice.

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.440
Yes.

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.360
All right.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.240
Leah Beedon, let's do the Harmontown anthem.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.560
Zach, pick a beat for us, please.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.680
This is what's gonna play at all the Harmontown events

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.920
that are non-sporting.

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.960
So wait, I'm, I'm, I'm joining in on this.

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:06.800
How's it going?

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:07.840
Yeah, well you're gonna be the main version.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.080
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do like a,

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.040
I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw it to you and you're doing it.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:12.880
Suck my dick.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.880
Yo.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.280
Harmontown going down with a fucks drum.

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:21.200
Wait for it.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.040
Yeah.

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:22.880
Clive Active.

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.720
Yeah.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.560
Building suspense.

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.640
Yeah.

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.480
Building suspense, pregnant pause, y'all.

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:30.680
It's like having sex in the wood, it's fucking intense.

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.840
Yo, we in Harmontown going down.

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.800
It don't matter if you white as fuck or dark brown.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.280
We talk about a lot of crazy shit

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:43.440
like religion and politics and, uh, shape like.

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.800
I'm about to keep it going now.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:50.040
Uh, I said I'm about to keep it going now.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:50.880
Yeah.

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.720
Damn.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.560
Yeah.

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.400
Is it going down?

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.240
Yeah.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my name is Ed209.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:02.160
You have 10 seconds to comply with all of my rhymes.

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.440
I am the future of law enforcement.

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.640
Enforcement droid.

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:07.280
I can't stand and sit.

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:09.120
If I do, I get a hemorrhoid.

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.560
I'm the future of Detroit.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:13.520
It has a cancer.

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.000
It's called crime.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.720
Get, get away.

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:17.560
Yeah.

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:19.920
What the fuck happened there?

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:20.760
Anyway.

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.600
Yeah.

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.440
Yeah.

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.480
I already know coming from above.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.880
You need to share, homie.

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.120
Do you believe in love?

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.480
I'm about to keep it going.

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:32.120
I'm about to keep it going.

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:32.960
Come on, Dan.

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:33.800
Come on, Dan.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.080
Homie, keep it going.

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:40.080
Do you believe that you can rock?

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.240
Because I saw your mama in a fair trap.

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:47.320
Because she's part Beaver and she's part June Cleaver.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:52.160
But I was trying to go cold, but I'm not.

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.600
A rapper that's very bold.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.800
I'm a gentle, psychological philosopher.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.040
I saw your mama, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:01.880
fuck her.

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.000
Sands of time.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:07.840
Time.

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.680
Yo, sands of crimes.

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:13.760
Wash your hands of the crimes with the rhymes.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.080
Suck it.

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.720
When you're born in the streets.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:17.560
Cities.

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:18.880
You never get enough oak.

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.560
You only get meat.

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.600
Do your taxes.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.280
Because it's cheaper at McDonald's.

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:29.040
But your momma just to work an insert random word.

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.240
I love pants.

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.680
Because it rhymes with dance.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:34.440
Dance.

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.200
Well, you take.

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.000
Yo, I got my pants.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.880
Rhymes is such a half beat, motherfucking beat.

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:44.600
I don't actually rap like this.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.840
I sound like an idiot.

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:48.120
But it's all good.

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.320
They're going to fix me on the overdug.

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:53.280
But don't forget about shape.

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.280
Yo.

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.320
Thank you for coming to Harmontown tonight, everybody.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.720
Let's hear it for logic.

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.200
Logic?
