{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.000\nOh, yeah, from Hollywood, California, and Meltdown Comics.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:24.000\nWe're all good podcasts, go, and they grow up.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:32.000\nHarmontown is now in session. Welcome friends, welcome newcomers.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:40.000\nAre we Spencerless tonight? Let's not bring out Spencer sadly, no Spencer.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:45.000\nBut don't think of it as losing a Spencer. Think of it as gaining a mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:56.000\nWhat's up, Dan?\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:01.000\nNo, nothing, nothing. This probably never happens to you.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:04.000\nDo you always say the opposite thing and people say, how is it going?\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:06.000\nAnd then you say, nothing?\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nAnd then they say, how are you?\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nWait, that's the same one, nothing.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nBut whatever, whatever the other one is, I do it wrong, okay?\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nSo it's going to be a bad show.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nYou got a nice little haircut there?\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:19.000\nOh, thanks, thanks.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nWhere do you go? Who's your guy?\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:28.000\nI'm a 23 in the front and 50 in the back.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nIt's the new, where do I go?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:37.000\nI go to that place on Hillhurst, Opion, Opion, OPYAN.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt's decorated like kind of like an Armenian swamp cave.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nOh yeah, that place, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nArmenian swamp cave.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:48.000\nLike it's rejuvenating.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:57.000\nStay away from me.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:02.000\nSo the only thing, oh, there is one piece of business, official business to get out of the way.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:10.000\nSo as you guys know, I'm a big user of the App Cookie Collector 2.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nIt looks like that.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nYou collect cookies.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nEach menu makes a sound.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nOh, there's, okay, that's, well, let me, sorry about this.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nLet's start the show over.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nOh, that's a little crunchy sound.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nYep.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nOkay.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:32.000\nBut you can mute it after a while.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nDo you play with the mute?\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nYou collect cookies.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nYou go like that.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:49.000\nWhen you gather cookies, I have 120.82 Treadekillian cookies at 16.157 Duo Dekillian cookies per second.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:58.000\nBut that's a misleading figure, since each cookie can be upgraded to be worth more cookies at the cost of cookies.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:06.000\nEach cookie you gather is a kind of currency that you can use to create, for instance, structures that create cookies.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nEverybody, please file slowly out of the exits.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:16.000\nIt's a cookie press, the baker, the dispenser, you can get a grandma, a tree, things that make cookies.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nAll right, but let me get to my point.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:23.000\nThis is under the heading, we have some business to take care of.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nI probably don't have to tell you, each day of the week there's special things. Sunday is milkshakes appear twice as often.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nI don't have to tell you what milkshakes are for.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nYou use those to buy cookies.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nOr to bring all the boys to the art.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:40.000\nThey recently did an update where they have league play now.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nThat's why I'm talking to you guys.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nUh-oh.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:50.000\nSo my bakery, it was called Butnut, but I had to change it because I don't think it would let you.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:56.000\nSo I started a cookie collector two team called The Crumb Rumblers.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nSo I'm just letting you know that.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:05.000\nI'm not telling you you have to join my cookie collector team and help me collect cookies.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:12.000\nIf it's something you were already going to do and you're looking for a cookie collector two team,\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\njust know that I have one called The Crumb Rumblers.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nOh shit, I'm missing a fucking cookie storm.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nGod damn it. Fuck. Oh, fucking messed it.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nWe had fucking damage.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nWhat happens when you miss a cookie storm?\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nYou don't get as many cookies, you fucking asshole.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nI know you know the answer.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nHow often do cookie storms come along? Are they predictable?\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nEvery eight minutes.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nThe rainbow cookies, the cookie storms are rainbow cookies.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nNow that you're the gang leader of The Crumb Rumblers,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nhow many people can be a member of that team, infinite amount?\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nI'm not who I don't know.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nBut when you have a team, you're all going into this cookie collecting together?\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nYeah, I'm sure all the cookies we collect get added up and then we get ranked.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nThere's other teams. That's all.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nI'm not going to belabor the point. I want it to be an entertaining show.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nHow many Crumb Rumblers are there right now? Just you?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nYeah, as far as I know, just me.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:19.000\nThe thing is, I think there's a passcode maybe, so that'll be our final order of business.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nThen we'll get on with the entertainment.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:29.000\nI don't like that we're using our podcast for you to shill for your own Crumb Rumbler cookie collector 2 team.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:35.000\nMy team, The Crumb Rumblers, I'm the only member.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:41.000\nIt says members 1 out of 50 collected 39,742 cookies.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nPasscode, I want to write this down.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:50.000\n7-7-1. Fuck, milkshake.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nDouble milkshakes today. It's Sunday. Double milkshakes.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nDouble milkshakes in Westworld.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nThe fuck is our show?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:06.000\nI think there's probably some people here that are just fans of logic that are like, what the fuck is this?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:11.000\nIs that your cookies or is that somebody else?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:16.000\nWe don't tolerate any bullshit with phones.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnyways, okay, so I was giving you that passcode and then we'll get on with the show.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:27.000\nThe passcode is 7-7-1-8-1-3. I don't know if that gives you access to my cookies.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:33.000\nI don't know if you can use that to buy shit. I don't know, but that's that code again.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nFuck, 7-7-1-8-1-3. How do you open the new iPhone?\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nI wrote it down. 7-7-1-8-1-3.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nAlright, well, listen.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:49.000\nSo far, I would say one of the best Harmontowns of all time.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nThe Crumb Rumblers. The Crumb Rumblers, sir.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nCrumb Rumblers. 7-7-1-8-1-3.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd the world famous 7-7-1-8-1-3.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nIt's the Crumb Rumblers. Oh, it's the Crumb Rumblers.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:05.000\nNo, not all one word. Nope. Spaces. Use it. Spaces. Spelt crumb right. Do it all.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nYeah, I don't want any of that shit.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nIs there a space between Crumb and Rumblers?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nYep.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:18.000\nThe Crumb Rumblers. Just pretend it's the name of a movie, which it will be.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nYou thought that you might get kicked off for being Team Butt Nut?\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:26.000\nI thought my bakery's name was Butt Nut. And yes, I kept trying to create the Crumb Rumblers\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nand it kept just like blanking out and I was like, I bet it doesn't like the Butt Nut\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nand I changed my bakery name to Dan Harmon. So now it's the Crumb Rumblers\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nand I'm in there alone. Let's move on with the show.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:44.000\nBecause my name on Transformers Earth Wars, they didn't allow. They changed my name for me.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nBecause you wanted to be...\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nNegatron.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nI was going to do Optimus Rhyme but they would have allowed that one\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nbut that's already been taken too.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:03.000\nAlright, well, our team is Channel 101. If you guys want to join us, Channel 101.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nI don't know if I like Transformers Earth Wars.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnyways, hasn't Cookie Collector 2 become a competitive team thing now?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nYeah, and it's going to be better than Transformers Earth Wars.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou guys, I missed out on that whole Amanda Knox thing. I just watched that documentary on Netflix.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nI didn't even know what was going on when that was going on. You know who Amanda Knox is?\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nI do not.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:33.000\nWatch the documentary. It's pretty interesting. That's all.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nWell, thank you for clarifying that for me.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:41.000\nThat's worth a watch. It's a fascinating story. You won't believe it happened right under your nose in 2013.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:48.000\nI just missed out on it. I must have been busy on one of my hit shows.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nBut it was very interesting.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nVery interesting.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nYou guys looking forward to Westworld?\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nOkay, good.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nAlright, I'm going to watch that tonight.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nI guess let's get on with this.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:07.000\nI can't watch anything because I'm moving places and I have no TV, no internet, no Wi-Fi, no nothing.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nI'm living in a toilet dark age.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nWell, you can come over, come over after the show and watch Westworld.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nWatch it tonight?\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nYeah.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nOh, okay.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nI will.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nThat's a date.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nYeah.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:25.000\nWe had pizza and stuff last night and they left the box out so the dog's probably, this place probably looks pretty bad.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:29.000\nOkay, I'll have some of that dog pizza.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nLet's say the house is probably kind of a mess.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nDo you have a friend in Toronto? That was pretty fun, right?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nYep, I have a friend in Toronto.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nYeah, I enjoyed it.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nAlright.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:46.000\nWell, if you guys are, in my podcast audience, then you're a fan of quality rapping.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd the hip hop lifestyle.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nJust my vocoder down

old school beats that we're not going to use later on.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nOkay, let's do...\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.000\nCheck, check.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nYeah, yeah,

I'm going to give it quite a rap lap.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'm going to rap it left and right.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nAnd when I get done lapping, go to sleep tonight.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.000\nOkay, so it's warmed up, it's warmed up.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nI didn't mean any of that misogynistically.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:05.000\nDan, can we try, if you don't want to, this is pushing it too hard.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nJust do like an acapella.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nLike you're like a doo-wop on the corner.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nKind of just like you just freestyle.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nLike just singing acapella.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nBut with this?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nYeah, can we do it together?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nIs

afraid to be alone, so I need a woman in my life.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nI better stay away from the nights, cause I'm lonely.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nAnd I'm angry.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nAnd I'm... bad.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nAlright, well...\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nWell, we're all warmed up.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nI mean, ten dollars.\n\n12:12.000 -->

And if I like it, then I'm like, you better go back to that fucking email and delete that beat.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nSo nobody like steals it.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nYou won't even do a coded drop box thing.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nLike, like, like you won't send anything over the internet.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nDude, I like deleted my drop box.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nReally?\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nYeah.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nBecause it's not even like they got any serious information because like, I don't do that.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nI don't, I don't put anything out there really.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:27.000\nBut it was just weird because I was like, oh, shit, they, they, they've got my Snapchat.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nAnd they were like, but they weren't even posting anything. It was really weird.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nThey were just like, go follow gangsta, kill a seven.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nIt was like the weirdest like names.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nI live in real terror and I haven't really done anything decent about it yet.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:41.000\nBut I did, I started using one password. This isn't an ad.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:49.000\nLike, like, it's like, I finally just gave in and started using one of those apps where it just generates these crazy long ass passwords.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:56.000\nAnd then you, so that every time you want to get anything, you have to like go there, copy, then paste a long ass password that even you don't know.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nYeah, I think my assistant has that too.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nBut fuck that.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:04.000\nBut when the fa, when the fappening happened, that was a warning shot across my, my bow.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nThe fappening. Damn.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nYeah, that was pretty crazy.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:13.000\nBut it is true that around that time, that's how we know the guy that runs the server for the, for this thing.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:20.000\nLike that's kind of how I made friends with him is that he was a fan who he, he was like down deep into that whole crazy world.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd like he let me know, he said, like, do you have, and like named all of my Apple equipment and like some other shit that I was like, what's going on?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nHow did he find that out?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:40.000\nAnd he said there, because you're, you're, you're your iCloud password, which is so simple.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:48.000\nThat's how the fappening happened is that everybody's like iCloud, iCloud passwords are like, are like the name of their dog or it's just like, or it's just like password.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nBecause no one took iCloud seriously.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\nAnd, and, and, and, but iCloud gives you your address book.\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:11.000\nIt gives, it's just like, it was just a, and so like, because, you know, I'm somehow ancillarily, if that's a word related to like some, you know, like someone that, that was fappeningable.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nFappable?\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:23.000\nLike they're my, they were, they had my, they had already hacked me, they just hadn't, like the way it worked is that like, they can, you get hacked by like just an autonomous like thing.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:28.000\nIt's just like a machine that just drills away at your shit on a server somewhere.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:36.000\nBut then you, you, the hacker comes back and opens that treasure chest and pulls shit out and they hadn't done that.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:41.000\nBut these, some people had found the stuff and so he was, he was warning me.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nNo, that's crazy.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:48.000\nBut that's some, yeah, like I've actually had that happen to me as well where people will like tell you and they're not actually dicks.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nThey just do it for like a weird sport.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nThey're like, yeah, I just went into your shit.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nI'm just letting you know.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nLike, yeah.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nLike I swear to God, like I see that all the time.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:00.000\nI just did it a couple of times when I, when I was still using Windows back in the, back in the day.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nBack in the day.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:05.000\nBack in the day where people, when people said back in the day.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.000\nI had, I had heard like,\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nRemember AOL disks?\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nTotally.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nThey talked about like IP scanners or something like that.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nLike software that just scans for IPs and how Windows was so vulnerable.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:24.000\nAnd I just, I just got one of these free apps that like scanned low, you know, IPs just went through lists of them and, and probed them for open ports.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nIt's not even about guessing passwords.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nIt was like Windows was so vulnerable.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:39.000\nIf you networked your home system, the way to get it to work, like often involved, like if you only knew a little bit about what you were doing and not everything, you were, you were bound to be open to the public.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd so I just like, I ended up like, I just wanted to do it.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nAnd then I, I was like, I'm in here.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nAnd then it was like, oh, those are your tax documents.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:53.000\nAnd I was like, I left a lot of little, I felt like a dick for even doing this, but I felt like it was better than not doing anything.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:59.000\nJust leaving and left a little text, little, little, little text documents that said, look, I'm sorry, I was here.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nReally?\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nI was here and yours.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nThere's your social security number.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nI don't have, I'm not looking at it.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nI swear.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nI was just dicking around.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:13.000\nI'm a 30 year old dude in Los Feliz.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nThere's my name.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nCome get me.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nDude, I never understood how people actually got that.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nLike the ones who are like, yeah, I'm going to, because you know, like Kylie Jenner, all these like different celebrities.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nThat's how it happened with me.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nIt was like this, this dude who like hacks into people's Snapchat.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nAnd it's just like, yeah, pussy springs or something.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nHe just does this, just he'll just like tweet the most random shit or whatever.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:38.000\nBut I always wonder like, how does like somebody go, I'm going to hack this person's shit and like jack into the fucking matrix, man.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nThat's like so weird.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nI see that codes, like those green codes.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nLike when I think of some guy like, yeah, I'm going to destroy your soul.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nYeah.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nYeah, so.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:54.000\nWell, that's what's terrifying about like, well, that there's so much crossover with the, you know, the guys that can do that and the, and the alt right and stuff.\n\n20:54.000 --> 21:01.000\nYou can, because you can just like, just by being a human being that has feelings, like you and your politics.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:06.000\nIf you stay on publicly, you could end up like, you know, being an example that gets made.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\nLike people will find some serious shit on my stuff.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nLike I make an easy, fun target.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:17.000\nLike everyone, even my fans want to see me go down.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nLike that's that's part of what they enjoy.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nLike they show up here to watch me fail.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nLike it's about the shape of my head or something.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nI love watching you go down.\n\n21:28.000

22:25.000\nBy the way, that was the first time someone's in a city and nobody clapped.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nOh yeah.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nI'm from Gaithersburg.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nMotherfucker, come on.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nNo, but yes.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:34.000\nIt sounds nicer than what Wikipedia in your childhood section says it is.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nYou know what's crazy?\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:41.000\nSo I grew up section 8 household, welfare, food stamps, all that stuff, to a black father\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:42.000\nand a white mother.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:45.000\nAnd I'm biracial, but look very white, obviously.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nHummelbrack.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nYes.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:52.000\nWhich can be very, very confusing.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nDan's half jealous right now.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nHalf jealous?\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nYeah, man.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nSo I grew up there and it's weird.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:06.000\nIt's one of those places where it's like on the outside, it kind of like looks really\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nbeautiful, but then you like take a left and you're like in the hood, like you're in like\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\na really fucked up area, which is kind of anywhere.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:14.000\nI mean, anywhere in the world, there's good places and there's bad places.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:19.000\nAnd me, I never really tried to glorify any of the negative shit.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nWould you like a drink?\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nOh, I'm okay.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nThanks.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nI drink Scotch.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nSwag.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nI only just started drinking.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nI only drink a little bit here and there.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nWell, someone just got fired because we brought this out for you.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nI never drink.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nI'll have this water.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:40.000\nBut yeah, so I grew up there and it was not that great.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:45.000\nI was like, was it like bad neighborhood?\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.000\nWell, it says that your mom and dad were...\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nThey were both drug addicts and alcoholics.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:55.000\nSo my father was addicted to crack cocaine and my mother, she was addicted to pills and alcohol.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:59.000\nSo I never actually had a father in my life, which is really hard.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd then also all my brothers and sisters are not to get all fucking deep.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nThis is supposed to be like really fun.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:09.000\nYou think they come here for my fucking cookie game?\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nThis is why they're...\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:13.000\nYeah, you saw how high the bar was when you came out like that.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nAnd it's not for my hilarious standup either.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:19.000\nSo it's like, no, go deeper, go home, Mr. Logic.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:26.000\nIt wasn't necessarily about where I live but my actual household.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:31.000\nSo all my brothers and sisters, they're all black and they all look black and have black features.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nAnd once again, I'm the only one who looks white.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:37.000\nSo it was very hard to identify when you're raised in a black household with a white mother.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:41.000\nAnd the crazy thing is that my mother was also extremely racist, which sounds weird.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.000\nBecause it's like, how's this racist shit going to fuck all these black dudes?\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nBut that's what happened.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nI don't know how it happened.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nWell, I mean...\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nBut that's what happened.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:53.000\nI mean, all men hate women and look how many people we have together.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nWe managed to work it out.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nYeah, it definitely works.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nMisogyny never gets in the way of...\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nLogically, she racist across the board or just...\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:02.000\nNo, you know what?\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nIt was one of those things where I think obviously...\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nI mean, it's a very confusing thing because some people will be like, well, that doesn't fucking make sense.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nAnd I'm like, yeah, I know.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nI had to live that way and grow up.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:16.000\nAnd she was super Bible thumping like Jesus freak.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nAnd I'm a very open guy.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nI'm an open-minded guy.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:24.000\nI'm the type of dude that's like, I believe in equality for all race religions, color creeds, and sexual orientations.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nPeriod.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nAnd if you want to argue and fucking kill each other, you do it over there.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:30.000\nI'm just going to chill and watch Rick and Morty and fucking...\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nReal shit.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nI'm just going to have fun.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nSo, but she was like total opposite.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:39.000\nAnd I always think like, I don't know how I didn't become a Satanist.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nLike just a spider.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nBut I...\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nIt's never too late.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nThat's true.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nThat's very true.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nBut yeah, no.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:52.000\nSo I think it stemmed down with her family because I know that her side of the family was very racist.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nSo like my grandparents would never let me like come over.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nAnd I'd always be like, oh, please.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:59.000\nAnd they'd be like, no, the guest room because they were balling and we were poor shit.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nThey're like, the guest room is not available.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, sleep on the couch.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nAnd they're like, oh, no, the couch.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nNo.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, sleep on the floor.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nAnd they're like, no, get out of here.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nYou fucking neighbor.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nSo...\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:09.000\nYou found it.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nAll right.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nAll right.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nAll right.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nWe buried the lead.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nYes.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nBut anyway, so that was like confusing.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nNo.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.000\nWhat were you going to say?\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nWhat's that like?\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:26.000\nLike if your siblings look more black than you and you're in a biracial household.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nSo you're getting it from both angles.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:32.000\nYou're not black enough to be black and you're not white enough.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:33.000\nLike you're not totally...\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nNo, it's really weird.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nIt's...\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nThat's what I had to deal with my whole life and then leading also into my career.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:42.120\nBecause I, you know, like literally being called a nigger by your own mother and then\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:45.000\ngoing to school and then people are like, you fucking cracker, white boy.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nAnd it's like, what?\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nOh, shit.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nThe fuck's going on.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:53.000\nI better become a successful recording artist.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nYeah.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nSome shit better go down.\n\n26:55.000 --> 27:00.000\nWith a built-in audience of zero.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nPeople just keep accusing you of co-opting your own culture.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nGoing back and forth.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nBut that's what I did.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nI just focused on music and it was very difficult and so...\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:15.000\nAnd you had to focus on logic, not to be corny about it, but you really...\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:18.000\nLike Dirk Diggler, you thought long and hard about your...\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nYeah, long and fucking hard.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:25.000\nYou arrived at psychological and then shortened it to logic, but I think the...\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nI'm babbling.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nYou're doing fine.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nKeep talking.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nBut it's like, yeah.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:32.000\nI mean, what other recourse do you have?\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:38.000\nI think by the way, that's where good hip-hop and nerd culture totally overlap.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nNerds are like, wait, how am I...\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nIt's not equatable.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:47.000\nI don't want to make that crime, but nerds always draw that analogy.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:51.000\nIt's like, wow, you're getting it from all angles.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nYou don't know.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:57.000\nAnd that's why we get into Spock and Star Trek and sci-fi.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nIt's something to escape in.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nAnd that's what I used to do.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nSo I love video games.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nI'm a huge video game guy.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:07.000\nSo I love Last of Us and Uncharted and those real games you can jump in and just engulf yourself in.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:12.000\nAnd I used to play those games to escape and to run away from my life and not deal with it.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:16.000\nAnd then through that, as I got older, through my teenage years, I realized that I could do that with music.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nAnd truly write.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nAnd now here's the real crazy thing.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:23.000\nSo my mom is like this super Jesus-free, crazy, racist, white bitch, right?\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:31.000\nBut then on top of that, on top of that, I'd be writing raps to try to vent and talk about these things.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.000\nAnd she'd be like, don't you curse, goddammit, motherfucker.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nSo she was also that.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:39.000\nSo it was very suppressive and it was very difficult.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nBut I worked through it and I worked on music.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:48.000\nAnd then when I was 17, I left the house because it was just so horrific.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nIt was so bad.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nShe was just on so many pills.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:53.000\nAnd I got two jobs to support myself.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:58.000\nAnd I worked those jobs for a long time and it was one in the morning and one at night.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:03.000\nAnd unfortunately, I didn't graduate high school because back then there was so much going on.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nI mean, I've seen my father smoke crack.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nI've been kidnapped.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:10.000\nI've seen my mother get beat by men and my sisters were raped and my brothers were in the street\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nselling crack even sometimes to our own father.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.000\nSo it was a lot of crazy shit that I was seeing.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nBut every time I was like, this isn't right.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nI knew that it wasn't right.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:23.000\nAnd that's where I think everybody else, and I'm not going to say necessarily failed.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd I'm not going to try to highlight my family and say the right or wrong that they did or who they went to become.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:35.000\nBut I think that's what it is, especially within the inner city in different places where, oh, OK,\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:42.000\nif I go work at McDonald's and I make $5.50 an hour or I can go sell crack and make $5,000 in a day.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nAnd it's really fucked up and it's really terrible and it's really horrible.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:48.000\nAnd when I saw this, I was like, OK, well, don't beat women.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nDon't sell crack.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nDon't do this.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nDon't do that.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nWhat you need to do is you need to write about it and you need to tell the world and you need to tell the youth\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:57.000\nthat are coming from where you're coming from to get out of that.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:00.000\nAnd so that's what I did and what I tried to do.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nAnd you were good at it.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nI was good at it.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:09.000\nI'm sure a lot of people are like, I'm going to rap about this.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:12.000\nAnd then they're like, yo, yo.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nYo, check it.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nYo, I fucked your mama.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nCrack rock.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nMore like bad rock.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nDon't smoke it.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:22.000\nYou got to poke it.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nYeah, so that's my best rap.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nI was doing a voice like I was imitating a bad rapper.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:32.000\nBut my secret was I was rapping as good as I could.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nNice.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.000\nI'm actually going to go home tonight and say, that was pretty good flow.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nAre you a freestyler too?\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nOr are you mostly a writer?\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:46.000\nHonestly, I write and I love to write, but I think that any person who raps should have fun and freestyle.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nYeah.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\nHow does it, how does it free?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nI always, I'm so, I'm always so confused about freestyling because I, when I listen to like...\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nOh, you've made that very clear.\n\n30:53.000 --> 31:09.000\nWhen we, when we, when people are freestyling, like whether it's in a, it's in a biopic movie, like Eight Mile or...\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nThis feels fucking Eight Mile like B-Rabbit right now.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:15.000\nI can't even see like people pass like the second row.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nThis is crazy.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nYo, fuck you, Doug.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:26.000\nBut are the people, I assume it's like, like if you freestyle a lot, then the more you freestyle, the more arrows you have in your quiver.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:33.000\nI.e. like you're also, like one thing you're like phonetically engineering your mind from an early age.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:36.000\nLike for you, you were a child and you were like, you were drawn to hip hop.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:39.000\nI feel like Eminem was like, like, he was like a savant.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:43.000\nLike when his first album came out or what it was, like...\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nIt's all about studying.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:50.000\nSo like if you really want to do so, like a lot of rappers go, yeah, I'm going to rap and get these bitches' hoes.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nThese chains and shit, dawg.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nAnd then it never works out.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:59.000\nAnd it's the people that actually say, I'm going to turn this into, you know, I'm going to make this a business.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nI'm going to be a walking company.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:04.000\nAnd I'm going to first and foremost do it because I love it, but I'm going to fucking make something out of it.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:07.000\nAnd that's, that's what great, the greats did.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nThat's what I'm doing my best to do.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:12.000\nWell, now it's even harder for you, harder slash easier in a sense.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:15.000\nI mean, like, I guess everything just changed.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:21.000\nBut like, you're the, I, you're the second Wikipedia article I've read.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:27.000\nIt sounds so similar to The Weeknd, who I recently...\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nLove that guy.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.000\nThat's my homie.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:34.000\nAnd was like, it's like, oh, you look at, it's like the parallels are, it's like, it's, this is the new career path.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:37.000\nYou have to be a ninja and like make yourself out of nothing.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:41.000\nLike you don't get to, you have a mentor in your, in your development.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:46.000\nAnd you have a record label that comes along, but not before you build yourself out of dirt without permission.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nCompletely.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nYeah.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:53.000\nAnd The Weeknd just came out of nowhere and you, you have to release these mixed tapes and, but they're not tapes anymore.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:56.000\nThey're digital and these kids are with their pants are so low.\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:06.000\nBut, and it's, and it's got to be lonely and it's got to be like, how do you, I mean, that's the age old question.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nEverybody in Los Angeles is always asking, how do you know when you're supposed to quit?\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nHow do you know?\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nI always say, but it's a very convenient answer.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nIt's easy for the people that they're asking.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nThey're not asking the people that failed.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nDamn.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nI thought about it that way.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nHoly shit.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nThank you for asking me that question.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:36.000\nThere's, there's never a writer's panel for failed writers, you know, like, people come and they go, how, how do you know when you should quit?\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:40.000\nAnd I always say it's easy for me to say, but it's like, I do believe this.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:46.000\nLike, well, you have to, you have to really believe that you wouldn't let that you would do it for free.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:58.000\nAnd that, and that if you did it for 20 years and then got hit by a bus without ever having an amount to paying your rent that you wouldn't go, oh man, I wasted 20 years that you'd go, that's pretty cool.\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nYou loved it.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nYou loved it.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:05.000\nThat's the big part, you know, and I think, I think for me, I'd probably be like dead in jail or addicted to drugs.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nAnd that's what I saw.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nNot to fucking get Debbie down or wah, wah.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:14.000\nBut like, legit, seeing that, I was like, oh shit, son, gotta write these raps, dog.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nLike, I was like, I can't not.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:25.000\nAfter having written about all that childhood stuff and how you grew up, I mean, are you, have you gotten all that out of your system or is there still, is there an endless journey to write about?\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nQuestion.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nOkay.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nSo you have to soon start rapping about your gardener.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nNo, this is, this is the thing.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:37.000\nYour second album ends with like, and that's what I had to say, mom about Coke.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:40.000\nAnd then your third album starts and it's like, stop interrupting me at dinner.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nI'm trying to eat with my wife.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nIt's just a message to fans.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nYeah.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.000\nYo, my wife is like totally with that.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:56.000\nEvery time we go out, because I'm like, I'm like so nice, because I just can't, I just like, but sometimes I'll be eating like, you know, okay, today.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nNo, it's real shit.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nI love my fans.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nStraight up.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nLove my fans.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nLove anything from my fans, except like sexual stuff.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nBut like, so I was at, uh,\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nHey, you said you're an open guy early.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nI know, yeah.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nTurns out you're a fanophobe.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nNo, so I, no, no, no.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nSo I was at Fry's Electronics today.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:19.000\nAnd so I get there and there's a lot of like young Hispanic males working and those are a lot of my fans.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:22.000\nI have a lot of Hispanic males in Los Angeles, California.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.000\nAnd, uh,\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nAnd you'd like to give a shout out?\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nYeah, shout out my boy Jose and Juan.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:27.000\nThose are real people.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:28.000\nI'll three.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nYes.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:37.000\nUm, no, but so, so just being there and like, oh, it's like, you know, some people notice and, you know, some people would be like, oh, hey, logic.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:38.000\nI really like your music, man.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nAnd they fucking keep it pushing.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nI'm like, whoa, that's so cool.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:44.000\nCause typically how it goes is, hey,\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nDemo.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.000\nSup dog.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.000\nYo, you're on my fucking Snapchat.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:48.000\nSay what's up.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nAnd it's not even like, hey, how are you?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nOr like shaking your hand.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nLike, like legit.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nIt's like, yo, can I take a picture?\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nLike fuck, dude.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nYou're gonna like buy me dinner for a shit.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nYou're just going to fuck me.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nI'm serious.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nLike, it's like, I'm so down to have a conversation and hang out in whatever the case may be.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nBut it's usually like, what can you do for me?\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:10.000\nThere's been times where I've like, I've done a show, had 103 degree fever, was out back.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:16.000\nLike, I know this sounds gross, but like throwing up and puking my brains out after the show because I was just so sick from doing 45 cities in a row.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:23.000\nAnd fans are like, hey, and they throw it while I'm throwing up or like taking selfies with me.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:26.000\nSo there is a negative side to it as well.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.000\nBut like today I got followed in the bathroom while I'm taking a piss.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nAnd some dude was like, hey, man, I need me to shake your dick.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nAnd I'm just kidding.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nBut he was like...\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nBut he's just...\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:39.000\nAgain, I apologize.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:43.000\nIt's like, you gotta let some shit go, man.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nThe weird thing is that he didn't say anything.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:49.000\nSo it's a guy who works there and he just walks in, he's just like staring at me.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:56.000\nLike, you know how sometimes guys in the urinal you can like see with the metal fleshy thing handle?\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nThe reflection.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nAnd I just see this dude just kind of like staring at me.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:03.000\nAnd I'm like, this is so fucking wrong.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:07.000\nAnd then I turn around and wash my hands and I'm like, so is this guy going to say anything to me?\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nAnd he like, doesn't say anything?\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nAnd I fucking leave.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nAnd it was really awkward.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nHe might have just been a murderer.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nYeah, maybe.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nYeah, you never verify it.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nI'm like...\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nI have no idea.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nDo you...\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nOkay, I'm gonna...\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nI...\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:34.000\nThere was a point when I had enough people in...\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:39.000\nTo my surprise, go, I know who you are.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nI like what you do.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:45.000\nI'm so happy you're alive, et cetera, the validation.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:54.000\nBut there was a tipping point where I feel like I internalized it to a point where I can live off of it.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nIt hasn't been cut off.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nSo I don't know how big that tank is, but then I kind of like...\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nI have this self-awareness that that doesn't...\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:07.000\nLike, it didn't make me taller or more handsome or a better person even that I did this stuff.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:13.000\nBut because those people say the things that I always wished the people would say,\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nwhich is why I wished I would be...\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nI don't ever wish to be taller or more handsome, but...\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nI understand exactly what you're saying.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nThat it's like...\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nI hit this wizard of eyes.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nYou could have gone home anytime you wanted.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nLike, tipping point where it wasn't a bad thing.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.000\nIt was all a lie.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nIt was a good thing that it was all a lie.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:42.000\nThat it was like, oh, I now know how my body feels and my brain feels when I assume someone in the room is amazed that I'm going through this TSA checkpoint.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nSee, that's why I always...\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nAnd it makes me less cranky and...\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nIt's like this weird...\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:52.000\nI hate admitting that because it's kind of a douchey thing, but at the same time it's like...\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nI wish I could give that pill to everybody.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:55.000\nNo, that's not a douchey thing. That's fucking awesome.\n\n38:55.000 --> 39:00.000\nAnd I know what that feels like, but I always do my best because...\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:07.000\nHere's the thing, especially with hip-hop and the younger generation, everybody thinks other people think they're the shit.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.000\nThat's got to be really extreme, too.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:14.000\nSo I always do my best to, like, once again, treat everybody equally and with respect and kind and introduce myself.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:15.000\nI'm not even like, yo, I'm Logic.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:19.000\nUnless it's like a professional setting like this and I'm backstage with people, I'll be like, hey, I'm Logic.\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nOr if there's fans, I'm like, hey, I'm Logic.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:25.000\nBut when I meet just, you know, anybody, I'm like, my name is Bobby. That's my fucking name.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:26.000\nI'm not going to be like, yo, something's Logic.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:27.000\nAnd they're like, what?\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nWhat?\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nYeah, you know what I mean?\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nBut what I'm saying is...\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nCan I talk right there?\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:39.000\nYeah, because I was checking into a hotel with my girlfriend and it was like in Beverly Hills.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.000\nMy hotel name is Mike Hawke.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nThat's the real thing.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nYes.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:52.000\nWe were going from the lobby to the elevator and it was like, there was this like giant dude.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:58.000\nAnd I guess it's important that he's black, but I don't see the world through that lens, but...\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:04.000\nHe had a baseball cap on, he definitely looked like he belonged in a Beverly Hills hotel, but at the same time,\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:09.000\nbecause his clothes were all new and like, but he was full of all this weird energy\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:13.000\nand he was like dragging a bunch of bags on a cart, but there were that.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nAnd it was like, he was a really big dude.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:23.000\nAnd then he came out of the elevator and he just called out to someone that I couldn't...\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nAnd it was like, yo, sneaks, sneaks.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nLike he was just yelling for sneaks.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:31.000\nAnd I was just like, just play it cool and I got in the elevator and then I was just like to my girlfriend.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:35.000\nI was like, do you think sneaks is famous or do you think that guy is like way out of line?\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:38.000\nLike, it's just like, like sneaks.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:45.000\nLike what if sneaks is just a friend and like, is the hotelier going like, God, these guys,\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:50.000\nthey just come by and one of them's named sneaks and they're just so loud.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:55.000\nOr is sneaks like a Grammy winner and why is that okay?\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:58.000\nYou know what I love about you, Dan?\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:01.000\nIs that I always interrupt you with a perfect story.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nNo, no, I love that.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:05.000\nLike, dude, you're like fucking crazy, man.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:08.000\nAnd you make me feel good, bro.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nBecause I love the way you think, man.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:14.000\nBecause I think about the craziest shit all the time, bro.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:15.000\nLike, you know what?\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nLet's talk about last night.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nNo, two nights ago.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:20.000\nAnd I was at my house hanging, playing pool with my buds, right?\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:23.000\nYou promised that you wouldn't talk about this.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nI'm a bit of a pool shark.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:31.000\nAnd so I'm walking and I take my dogs outside and I have a new little puppy.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:32.000\nHis name's Panda.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:33.000\nWhat's the breed?\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nYes.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nHe's a little corgi.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:36.000\nBoo.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:37.000\nHe's a corgi.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nI got a puppy named Panda.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:40.000\nWhat breed?\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:41.000\nIt's a Panda.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:42.000\nBoo.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nI just wanted to repeat that joke.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:44.000\nIt's funny.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:45.000\nPiggy has a Panda.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:46.000\nNice.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:47.000\nI have a Panda.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:48.000\nWicked.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:53.000\nAnd because he didn't even give it a real name.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.000\nAll right.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nAll right.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:56.000\nAll right.\n\n41:56.000 --> 42:00.000\nWell, the other dog, his name is Phillip J. Fry.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:01.000\nWe call him Fry for short.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:02.000\nYes.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nCutorama.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:04.000\nLet's go.\n\n42:04.000 -->

idea.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:10.000\nI just made it up.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:15.000\nAnyway, so we're walking and it's nighttime and I see this snail with a fucking big ass shell.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:19.000\nAnd I'm walking past this snail in my backyard and I'm like, whoa, snail.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:20.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:23.000\nI hope like one of my dogs don't eat this snail.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:26.000\nAnd so the first dog comes out and sniffs it and I'm like, no.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:27.000\nAnd he's like, oh shit.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nAll right.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nCool.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:32.000\nSo he walks on by and then the little puppy who like doesn't really know, know yet.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nSo I'm just like, wow.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nAnd he's like, oh shit.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:36.000\nOkay.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:37.000\nCool.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:38.000\nHe keeps walking.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nI'm like, man, I wonder what the fuck that snail's thinking.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.000\nLike real talk.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:42.000\nI'm like legit.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:43.000\nI'm thinking like, man, like does he even understand?\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nDoes he know how close he came?\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:46.000\nAnd I'm like, wow, this is so crazy.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nAnd I'm like, I gotta, I'm serious.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:49.000\nOkay.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:53.000\nAnd I'm like, I got to make sure this fucking snail is okay because he's in the middle of\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:56.000\nthe sidewalk in my backyard and I got to make sure that like he makes it to the grass.\n\n42:56.000 --> 43:00.000\nSo I'm like posted and I'm watching my dogs and everything's cool.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nMy wife's walking by.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nI'm like, hey, watch out.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:08.000\nYou know, people coming by and then my buddy six comes out and I'm like, yo, there's a snail.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:09.000\nWatch out.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nAnd then crunch.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:11.000\nOh.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:12.000\nYeah.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:16.000\nSo anyway, I'm like, yo, does this snail have any kids?\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nLike what the fuck?\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nBut this is like real shit that I think.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:25.000\nSo when you go off on such a just snail, snail's married for life.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nAre you serious?\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:27.000\nAre you serious?\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:28.000\nNo, I don't make that.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nYou know what I always worry about with snails?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nWhat?\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:35.000\nIs that their, their deaths must be horrible because they're like, they're like, what was\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:38.000\nthis shell for?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:43.000\nBecause it's like, what is that for?\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.000\nTo protect them from warrior snails?\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nI guess it's effective that way.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:52.000\nLike if a snail tries to kill you, having a shell is like fucking whoa.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:53.000\nHe's like Batman.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nCause it's like, it's thin as a, like a fingernail.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:56.000\nIt's like so thin.\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:00.000\nI mean, when you, when you do, if you've ever had the displeasure of realizing you've stepped\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:04.000\non a snail, it's like, I mean, those things, it's like, it's like Jesus Christ, the thing\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nthat it bought to protect itself.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:12.000\nIt turns into a thousand knives.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nI guess that's, I guess that's us in cars.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:19.000\nI mean, like, like, we're just driving around in fucking pieces of glass that are temporarily\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:22.000\nin one piece, like whizzing them at each other.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nThat sucks.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:24.000\nI never thought about that.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.000\nAnd now you've given me like 80 million more things to think about.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nThanks a lot.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nAppreciate it.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:32.000\nWell, you know how people like, like they put that snail stuff out to keep snails out.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:33.000\nCause I guess there's.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:34.000\nIsn't it like salt?\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:35.000\nYeah.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nWell.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nThat's for slugs.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:40.000\nThere's like hardcore, okay, slug stuff.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:43.000\nIt's like, but somebody told me it's like, you know, they're not eating that and it's\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\npoisoning them.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nIt's like, it's like little, it cuts them.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:47.000\nOh, that's fucked up.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nYeah.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:53.000\nSee, this is like the microscopic, like fucked up world of like earth and all the shit that\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nhappens behind the scenes.\n\n44:55.000 --> 45:00.000\nBut then our producer, Dustin Marshall told me that a Cetaminophen, the reason why it's\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:06.000\na fast acting ingredient drugs or something is it has little molecules that are, that\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\ncut up your stomach.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nSo it gets in your bloodstream faster.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nWell, that's second gross.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:14.000\nThis fucking kid.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:17.000\nDustin, you don't know yet.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:18.000\nHe's fucked up.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:21.000\nLike that's the only reason I want to live to a healthy old age because I want to see\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nhow fucked up he is at 40.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\nWow.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:25.000\nNice.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:28.000\nCause he's like, he dresses like Beetlejuice.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:34.000\nLike he's, he's got a, he's got a whole podcast network that used to, that used to be like,\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nokay, he's got a podcast.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:36.000\nWait, is this the guy I met?\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:37.000\nYeah.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nTotal Beetlejuice.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nYeah.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:40.000\nLook, don't say it one more time.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:41.000\nDon't say it one more time.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nYou got it.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nYou got it.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:44.000\nYou fucking be right out here.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nIt's like Marilyn Manson Beetlejuice.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nOh shit.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:47.000\nWho's great?\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nNo, I don't mean that in a bad way.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nHe comes in.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nHe's really nice.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n45:52.000 --> 46:00.000\nHe looks like he's about to kill a rock album.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nYou said Beetlejuice the third time.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:03.000\nOh.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:04.000\nShit.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:13.000\nYou thought, you thought like Marilyn Manson was my uncle or something.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nI got to watch you work recently.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nI was so impressed.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:24.000\nI have a bunch of hip hop artists to compare it to, but I was impressed as a creative because\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:27.000\nyou're so young and you've had your own success.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:33.000\nAnd I'm sure the lesson you've learned is that you know best and that you'd have that\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:38.000\nSteve Jobs lobe would be inflamed, which is not a bad thing in my opinion.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:48.000\nSometimes the curse of genius, my friend, is non-collaborative.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:54.000\nYou have a healthy fear of other people.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:58.000\nThat's what I've learned from my predecessors, both in comedy because I love comedy.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:03.000\nAnd I think the parallels between comedy and rap is the same shit.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nIt's all about punchline and timing.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:09.000\nAnd for me, I've always been very open because I know what I know.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:13.000\nAnd I know how to rap and I know how to do this and I know how to perform and I know that\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nand nobody can tell me how to do that the way I do it.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:20.000\nBut the things that I don't know, I go to the people that do and I just shut the fuck up.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:23.000\nI was like 39 when I figured that out.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:26.000\nSo I guess you're more talented than me.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nIt's not a competition, you piece of shit.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:36.000\nI was very impressed, like you can tell, you're an old soul and there's no such thing as old souls\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:42.000\nand you were the son of drug addicts in a horrible political racial situation\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:45.000\nand you were forced to become Vulcan and wise.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nLogic.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:53.000\nI'm assuming that could easily make you more combative and isolated and autonomous and all this stuff.\n\n47:53.000 --> 48:03.000\nThe reason we met is because he did a little thing for Season 3 of Rick and Morty, which it's not even a spoiler\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:10.000\nbecause you won't remember this conversation in 2019 when it comes to it.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:13.000\nWe're a little behind schedule.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:20.000\nI won't spoil the specifics of the episode, but it was great that Justin knew you and you came in\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:25.000\nand I figured you were a cool guy or you wouldn't be coming in in the first place,\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:30.000\nbut I didn't expect what you came in and you worked in front of us.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:35.000\nIt took me so long before I could...\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:41.000\nI wouldn't be able to ride on airplanes because next to me I might be watching my process.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:47.000\nThen when I started doing Community, it was a hit show I did for NBC in 2009,\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:57.000\nbut I went through a period where it took me time to learn that it was okay to sit at a keyboard with a screen\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:03.000\nand have other people looking at the screen while I was deciding what someone should say.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:08.000\nThat was the equivalent of watching me masturbate or poop.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nI totally understand.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:20.000\nHe came in and I had written a rap for a thing and it was placeholder lyrics.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:26.000\nYou just came in from top to bottom, looked at it, welcomed it, found a tempo for it,\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:34.000\nfound a beat for it, started going through the lyrics and then changing them, adapting them to give it basically a better...\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:42.000\nIt was like the scene when Mozart meets Soliari and is like, oh, that thing, and he starts adding...\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:46.000\nThat's what you were doing, which is what we wanted, but to do it in front of us,\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:54.000\nand you weren't showboating, you were lifting us up and there was no membrane of you being like,\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nyou know what, maybe just let me...\n\n49:56.000 --> 50:00.000\nAre you saying that you generate your own beat right on the spot there?\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:04.000\nWell, no, what happened was, and I'm not going to get too... I won't give anything away,\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:10.000\nbut basically, like Dan said, and it was really cool to think like, damn, I wrote some shit with Dan Harmon.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:14.000\nThat was so cool. First of all, just walk in the room and Justin's there and Dan's there\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nand everybody's just being super fucking cool.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:19.000\nThis is the first time I meet this guy. He's like, yeah, motherfucker, blah, blah, blah.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:23.000\nHe's doing all these raps and I'm like, whoa.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:26.000\nAll right, this is my kind of party.\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:31.000\nSo, you know, so there's this like template and it's, you know, it's all this like really fun stuff\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:36.000\nand things that have to do with the episode that wouldn't make sense without him kind of writing it first,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:40.000\nbecause how would I know, you know, so he does these things.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:44.000\nAnd then what I did was, is I go, okay, well, let me see, what would be a good BPM for this?\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nBeats per minute, how fast the song is.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:50.000\nOkay, and then I went on YouTube and got like a template beat, if you will, just something fun.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nIt was some tribe called Quest.\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:55.000\nAnd so I got that and threw it on. Say what?\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.000\nWhat song?\n\n50:56.000 --> 51:00.000\nGod Lives Through, which is one of my favorite beats by them.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:05.000\nSo I did that and I kind of caught a vibe and I caught it and then I basically took what he did\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:11.000\nand then rearranged it and then added things and took things away and, you know, came to a good place.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:20.000\nBut here's the thing, the reason why I think I could do that is because unlike, I don't want to put this,\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:24.000\npeople who didn't necessarily grow up in like the Twitter era, you know what I mean?\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:28.000\nI had to do everything in my career in front of the world.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:29.000\nRight.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:33.000\nWhich was hard, you know, because once again, there's people like, I mean, even in fucking rap,\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:37.000\nI mean, think about going my whole life being like, you fucking, you're white or black or this or that\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nor you're not this or you're not that.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:42.000\nAnd then you go to hip hop, which is predominantly black and you're, I'm like, hey, my brothers.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:45.000\nAnd they're like, no.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:50.000\nAnd then I got to do a whole album about my life and they're like, okay, kinda.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:55.000\nAnd I do a second album and really bring it home for the brothers and they're like, all right, you're cool.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:57.000\nSo it's like, it's like.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nBut don't go in that house.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:04.000\nOh, I thought you were a movie.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:05.000\nI don't know.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:09.000\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:10.000\nSo that was it though.\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:14.000\nGrandpa's sleepy logic.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:19.000\nI was just imagining all black people saying things and I was, I was adding to that.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nWatch out.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:24.000\nGrits.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:28.000\nIt's cool on black.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:29.000\nYeah.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:30.000\nYeah.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nIt was fun.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:32.000\nIt was great.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nSo I was impressed by that.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:34.000\nAnd yeah.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:37.000\nAnd you're so, so, but you were impressed with my rap writing, obviously.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:38.000\nThis is a real thing.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nLike, like, I don't know if you're doing like a bit.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nI was actually impressed with the rap.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nIt was so cool.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:44.000\nI thought something was interesting.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:48.000\nIt was a make a good segue because this is something that I would ask you regardless of this had come up in that conversation.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:57.000\nBut it's one of the first things that came up is because I was, I was going for authenticity with my, with my template wrap.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nIt was festooned with the N word.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:03.000\nI didn't know.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nI hadn't, I didn't know.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nI didn't, I guess I kind of.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:12.000\nSo basically what happened was, by the way, it was the word nigga all over this shit.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:13.000\nRight.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:16.000\nAnd I come in and I basically, I tell him this, I was raising this household.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nThis is a word that I use.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nIt's just, it's, it's a part of the culture.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:21.000\nIt's hard to explain.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:28.000\nBut within my music, I never use this word unless it is what's unless it's hilarious.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:33.000\nUnless it's commentary.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:34.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nUnless it is, it is a full, it is a true representation.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:38.000\nDo you understand?\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:42.000\nUnless it's being used to discuss the issue.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:47.000\nOr if it's in quotations, like if it's part of the conversation that's happening maybe or?\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:48.000\nKind of something like that.\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nBut it's like, just, just understand.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:56.000\nLike I've always had a rule that until people know and understand, because it's just, it's just a word that's in my vocabulary.\n\n53:56.000 --> 54:00.000\nGrowing up in a black household, having all black family and friends and it just, it is what it is.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nIt's in my vocabulary and I didn't have any of that.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nNo, no, but there's a, see, there's a difference though.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nIt's like, you're not a racist man.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:07.000\nYou're, you're, you're a writer.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:08.000\nYou're a comedian.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:09.000\nLike you use this to write.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:12.000\nAnd I try to liven up monopoly games.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:13.000\nYeah.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:14.000\nNice.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:19.000\nBut yeah, so I basically was just like.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nAnd showers are boring.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:26.000\nAnd you always, you're always looking for a new thing to call your, your, your, your friends.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:27.000\nAnd like, all right.\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:28.000\nNice.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nAnyway.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:30.000\nIt's just, I, I, I.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nOkay.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nAll right.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:33.000\nLeave it.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:34.000\nLeave it.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:35.000\nDon't take it there.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:40.000\nAnd I thought it was a interesting topic and what I like about it is like the dichotomy of bad word, good word.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nUse the word.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\nDon't use the word.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:43.000\nIt's all preference.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nIt's all preference.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nAnd there's like, and this is where we got to get racy.\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:47.000\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:48.000\nOkay.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:49.000\nThat was a terrible joke.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:50.000\nAnyway.\n\n54:50.000 --> 55:01.000\nSo no, but like it's all, it's all like, you know, there's things that my mentor said that you never argue about, you know, like race, religion, politics, you know, just, there's certain, it's, it's, it's sports.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nIt's like a thing that there's no writer.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:04.000\nThere's no resolution.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:05.000\nYeah, you exactly.\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:08.000\nSo it's like, almost with that, like, here's how I feel about the word.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:15.000\nAnd if, you know, when I go to concerts and I see the majority of the demographic who are attending concerts, they're all white.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:19.000\nSo it's like, if it's like, Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with nigga, blah, blah, blah, like whatever.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nIt's like, don't get mad at the kid.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:27.000\nLike you put it in, you know, you put it in the song and they're, they're reciting the song and they love you and they're paying to see you.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nIt isn't a racist thing.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:30.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:31.000\nIt's not from that place.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:34.000\nAnyway, so me, I just don't like to fuck with that in general.\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nSo I was just like, yeah, I'm not going to say that.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:37.000\nAnd he was like, cool.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:38.000\nRight.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nLong story short.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:44.000\nI expected for, I, I context.\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:45.000\nThat's what I was going to say.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:46.000\nIt's all about context.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:52.000\nLike when I, when I explained like my mother being racist or like on the, on the album that I'm working on, I won't super get into that.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:58.000\nBut like I'm rapping from the perspective of, you know, a black man who told me that I wasn't shit, but a white boy.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.000\nAnd he was like, you're just a white boy, nigga.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:07.000\nWhich is like so, but no, it's really funny because it's so like that doesn't make any fucking sense.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:08.000\nWhat you just said.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:12.000\nAnd, and so in that context is, is when I use the word.\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:18.000\nI love that idea that language can be thought and that it doesn't have to have these electric fences about it.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:26.000\nBut at the same time, it's not as simple as this libertarian linguistic policy of like, let's let it all slosh together because the most racist shit will be,\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:29.000\nwill be cloaked in false equivalents.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:32.000\nPeople will go, well, I can say this, but so and so can't say that.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:35.000\nIt's like, yeah, context and history and all these things.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:40.000\nSo on one hand, you, you definitely want all of that in place because that's part of language and history.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:48.000\nIt's like that to me, the enemies are people who are certain about things and who have rules for other people about things.\n\n56:48.000 --> 57:00.000\nAnd the, and the people that will quote unquote solve any problems we have with, with anything really are the people that are so uncertain that all they have is to focus on is their,\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:03.000\nis their own gut and their own instinct and they have like this code.\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:06.000\nAnd I thought that was, I'm sure you're not the only one.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:12.000\nAnd it's kind of like that, that made me, that gave me like a whole, it just, I don't know, it just made me happy.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:18.000\nI was just like, oh, that's so cool that that word can be like any other chemical in a chemistry set.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:28.000\nIt can be like, yep, there's sulfuric acid and like you can use that to, like different people have different rules for how much of it they use and what circumstances they use.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nAnd it's like their own relationship with it.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nI was like, that's, that's what it is.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:35.000\nSo basically that word is like your snail.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nI mean, my guy's thinking about the craziest shit.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:53.000\nBecause my rule is very simple. I never, I use it constantly when I am alone, making sandwiches, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, I'm just like, it's all over all of my songs about how I need mustard.\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:54.000\nCatch up.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:57.000\nBecause it, because I have extra niggers.\n\n57:57.000 --> 58:09.000\nIt's just me, it's like, I refer to myself and the third person as, as, as, as that and that, and that, and that, and that I need more mustard.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:10.000\nAnd Jeff, Jeff does the same thing.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:15.000\nOh yeah, no, it's, it's, it's like Worcestershire sauce in my house.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nLike, it goes here and there.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:21.000\nI literally, I literally will use it as a pet name with my girlfriend.\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:24.000\nLike, I'm gonna, like, like, like, we, like, like,\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:25.000\nOh, these are real things.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nWe have to trust each other.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:28.000\nIs this a bit? Is this a real thing?\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nNo, no, it's real.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nYou know what, here's one thing I just want to fucking say.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:35.000\nBecause there's a lot of people who, like, try to twist and turn and all types of stuff.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nAnd like, Dan, like, you're such a, like, a nice guy.\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:43.000\nAnd like, and, and I wouldn't surround myself by people who weren't, you know, open minded and, and like, kind hearted.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:48.000\nAnd one thing, and I just kind of want to talk about this, is there are, there are extremists on both sides.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nAnd this is, this is also what my album has to do.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:54.000\nYou know what, I have not talked about my next album at all, because it's not coming out until later next year.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:59.000\nBut one thing that I will say about it is it has to do not only with race relations,\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:03.000\nbut it has to do just once again with the equality of all men, women and children,\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:06.000\nregardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:10.000\nBecause I believe that we are all born equal, but we are not treated equally.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:15.000\nAnd when there's amazing people, you know, like yourself, and I'm sure everybody in this fucking crowd,\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nbecause you guys, like, love these guys, you know what I mean?\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:23.000\nAnd what the show represents is like, when people will try to, like, pull the card and, like, flip it.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:26.000\nBecause I believe that there's extremists everywhere, you know what I mean?\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:29.000\nAnd even, like, with Black Lives Matter, for example, right?\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:33.000\nSo, when that hashtag was going around, you know, there was people tweeting me and saying,\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nwhy aren't you hashtagging Black Lives Matter?\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nWere you not black?\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nAnd it's like, whoa.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:40.000\nLike, why would you say something?\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:43.000\nLike, first of all, that's like the most racist shit, and you're trying to, you know what I mean?\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nAnd I think that there are extremists in everything, you know what I mean?\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:49.000\nThere's white extremists, there's black extremists, this is that.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:52.000\nAnd I think, like, for example, like, just to bring this up,\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:59.000\nlike, Black Lives Matter, what that term means, and this is just what it is represented from the black community,\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nis that there are black men, women, and children being murdered.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nAnd, you know, they're just saying, like, we matter too.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nThat's all it is.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nAnd then there's those extremists who would be like, alright, let's go kill a bunch of white cops,\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nor blah, blah, blah, or the extremists who would be like, you know, on the other side.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nAnd I guess all I'm trying to say, and this is one thing, whether you know me or you don't know me,\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nis that I'm here to represent fucking mankind and good people like yourself who can joke around and have fun\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nand respect everyone.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nSo, swag.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nAnd I even think there's, I think there's good people that get good results by doing, by like, problematizing\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nthings that we complain about, like, do focus on language.\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nAnd you should say this and you shouldn't say that.\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nBe mindful of when you say this or that.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nLike, there are important, like, goalposts being moved by people who think that way,\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nand there are also horrible vampire people who are like, oh, you can police language?\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nWell, now I just found myself a new bridge to troll under.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nLike, I'm so comfortable here.\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nAnd I always say, like, the litmus test is, if you're doing something that you consider activism,\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nlike, if it's not just expressing yourself, which should be joyful and easy for everybody,\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nbut as a challenge, like, the, if you're, if you are labeling in your own head what you're doing is, like,\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nspeaking truth to power or sticking up for somebody or something like that,\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000\njust quickly just a little baby flow chart in the sidebar of your head, like,\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nis what you're doing difficult at all?\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nAre you putting yourself at any risk by saying what you're saying?\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nAnd that's not to say that if the answer is no, you shouldn't do what you're doing.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nIt's just, just remind yourself of that. Have that compass on your dashboard next to everything else\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\non your dashboard that should all be yours.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nLike, like, but always remember in those moments, like, don't get too carried away\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nbecause the people that were acting in racism in the 50s, they were, they were outraged.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nThey were victims. They were underdogs.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nThey thought that they were battling a horrible force that was telling them\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nthat they had to eat sandwiches at the same counter as other people.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nLike, they were doing what was easy. Like, they were expressing, like, all of this outrage.\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nAnd it's like, we need to, like, that's like the big cane that I shake at young people.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nIt's like, like, there's probably a kind of like one-for-one analog between you and some old white dude\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nin the 50s. Like, as far as the amount of battle you're fighting with this tweet.\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nLike, you're a tweet. The hashtag. That's why I think it's all bullshit\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nbecause there's people out there saying like, once again, when they're like,\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nwhy don't you do this hashtag? It's like, no, fuck that. I'm going to go do a whole album about it.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nI'm not just going to do it so it lives in the moment to look cool.\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nLike, don't argue with me. And I think at the end of the day, man, once again,\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nlike, I like to argue. I enjoy it. I love to have debates and crazy conversations\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nwith people about race and politics and religion and fucking my favorite television show\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nor cartoons or anime or Rubik's cubes or whatever the hell I'm into.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nBut the thing is, like, I love doing that with like-minded individuals, open-minded individuals.\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nLike, you know, when I was young, my mom was super crazy about Jesus.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nAnd now I'm like, I don't know if God exists, but I believe in an energy.\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nAnd there's certain people that would be like, no, fuck you. You're going to hell. Jesus exists.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nIt is what it is. Like, you know what I mean?\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nYeah. And then other people going, that's a damn shame because people that believe in an energy\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nburnt women in the Salem, which trials it. And it's like, that conversation is about whether or not\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nyou should think what you think as opposed to the other person going, oh, thank you for that information.\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nWhen I was young, I did blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nAnd then you both go, uh-huh. And then you're like, both, your brains are a little bit bigger.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nYeah. Like, even if you don't agree with someone, no, this is a real thing.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nAnd they're like, you know, and this is why it's, I've always been kind of scared to have these talks.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nAnd that's why I'm excited for my whole next album because it's not just about black and white and this and that.\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nOnce again, it's about everyone. And it's like, I was so scared for so long to talk about this shit because like,\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nas soon as you bring up, you know, black men and women in America, it's like, oh, what'd you say?\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nAnd they fucking, you know, every little thing or this or that or whatever or religion, you know, and it's just this like thing\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nthat gets at you. And it's like, man, I'm, instead of being scared to talk about it, I'm going to talk about that shit\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nand I'm going to bring it up, but I'm going to do it in a way that hopefully educates, especially the youth,\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nand just being open-minded. If you believe, if you're Baptist or Catholic or this or that, like, and you believe that,\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nthat's cool. If you believe that the dude who goes to church on Saturday and not Sunday is going to hell because of that,\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nthat's cool. Just like, stop fucking telling them you're going to hell and stop yelling and screaming and like, hating it.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nThat's just the shit that's like, super fucking annoying to me, man. Just let people live, dawg.\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nI kind of want, for those of you, those of you that aren't familiar with it, you were describing your last album.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nYou're doing a Comic-Con panel for your last album, which I got to run and pirate after this.\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nPopcorn Time. Nice. I'm so old and rich, I don't know how to pirate anymore.\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nYou know what's crazy? I'm going to go right to Target. That shit's like dying. Like, honestly streaming and all that shit is almost dying.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nMy life used to be Lime Wire. I got every Adobe product. Lime Wire. Oh, you took it back, dawg.\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nI was just sitting there and I was like, I want to learn Avid. Okay, now I want to learn Final Cut.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nNow I want to learn Adobe everything. And I was like, boom, boom. And I would sit there as a 27-year-old and I'd go,\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nthey know that one day I'll be rich and I'll need to use Photoshop. And I was right.\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nI've given Adobe so much more money than they ever would have earned if I had been like a kid.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nThat's what I started recording on. I started recording on a thing called Adobe Audition 1.5, which is crazy.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nAnd this was like a really shit, I'm not going to say this is a shit program, but like considering like Pro Tools and all this other stuff.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nSo I did this and I was on a Yahoo chat hip-hop. It wasn't like some sexual shit.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nAnd this guy, I was like, oh, I was 16 years old and I was on really bad internet and I said, hey, do you know a program I could use to record?\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nAnd he says, yeah, I can give you the file right now. And he sent me the file and he stayed in the chat for six hours and let the whole thing download.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nAnd if it wasn't for that, honestly, I wouldn't be here. Yeah, that really changed my whole life.\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nThat man's name?\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nI fucking had no clue.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nFucking Shug Knight.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nShug Knight at Yahoo Messenger.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nSay what you will about Shug. He'll fucking be there for you for the download.\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nHe gets a lot of fucking bad press.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nSugar Bear.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nBut he'll walk you through that shit.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nYeah, no, he dangled a producer over a balcony for me for three and a half hours.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nIf he had pulled them back up from the hotel balcony at two hours and 45 minutes, the whole thing would have been lost.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nIt would have been like your mom getting on the phone when you're downloading in the 80s.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nOh, that album. You were talking about the...\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nDo you have a name for your new album?\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nThe album.\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nI do, but I can't.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nIt's new album secret, but based on your old album.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nBut on the last album, yeah, so I have a Comic-Con panel next week in New York.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAnd I did it last year as well, and it's for my last album called The Incredible True Story,\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nwhich was originally going to be called The Incredible True Story in transformation of the man who saved the world,\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nbut like, ain't no fucking blonde college girl remembering that shit.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nSo we just changed it to The Incredible True Story, which the acronym is TITS, nice.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nYeah, so I released that in Elevator Pitch.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nThe year is 2065.\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nIn 2065, yeah.\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nThe last human footprint was left on Earth before sending to a space station called Babble,\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nwhere there was only 5 million human beings left, and for the last 50 years from 2065 on,\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nwe've been looking for a habitable planet. It's like Rap Interstellar.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nSo, the cool thing is that at the beginning of the album, you press play,\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nand at the end of it is a skit in what I like to call an audio-cinematic experience.\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nNow, I was watching... No, this is a real thing.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nI was watching a... That's a real fucking thing, bro.\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nI was watching a documentary called I Know That Voice.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nI don't know if you guys have seen it, but I love it. It's amazing.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nAnd while watching it, I saw one of my favorite voice actors of all time.\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nHis name is Steve Blum. He's done Spike on Cowboy Bebop.\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nHe's on Star Wars Rebels. He's done so many different things.\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nAnd in his portion of the interview, he goes,\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nyeah, I mean, you know, like, this is a job.\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nAnybody can hire you. And I was like, what?\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nAnybody can hire this guy? Are you serious?\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nSo, like, I reached out to my people, and I got his agents' information,\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nand I was like, oh, my God, yo, I fucking love you.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nI was like, you're the best, bro.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nAnd we met, and we sat down, and he agreed to do it.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nMind you, this is like one of my childhood heroes.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nI absolutely love this guy. He agreed to do it, and he plays a captain named Thomas anyway.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nSo on their way to this planet called Paradise that they hope is habitable for human beings,\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nthey're listening to oldies music from 100 years ago,\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nand that happens to be my album that they're listening to from there to there.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nAnd it's like this really cool story, and that's what we're doing the panel on.\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nIt's basically a year later how much has happened.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nAnd here's the crazy thing. One thing that I really want to say is like,\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nonce again, you know, I've faced a lot of shit in my life, and a lot of it's been really hard,\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nbut the crazy thing is some of the hardest things later in my life was being a nerd,\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nwas, like, loving Rubik's Cubes and video games and all this in hip-hop.\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nWhat the fuck? That was the weirdest...\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nHe came into the room, and then I watched you work, and you, like, threw a wrap together,\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nand we're, like, taking suggestions and doing all this shit.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nAnd then in the middle of it, you didn't bring it.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI should have brought my Rubik's Cube today.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nIt was, like, laying out because Justin's a maniac.\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nYeah, it's fucking weird.\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nAnd it was a Rubik's Cube, and you picked it up, and it was, like, 1982.\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nThat's incredible, like, record-setting.\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nAnd then you did it behind your back.\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nWhat?\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nDamn, I wish I had it. Why the... Damn it.\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nYo, blame my assistant Christian, wherever the fuck he is right now.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nWell, have your back, and we'll show you a little...\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nThere is assistant Christian...\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nI mean, honestly, assistant Christian...\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nAssistant Christian, oh, the time has come.\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nPull my fro you and my...\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nI can't be the first person to have sung as assistant Christian.\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nThat's definitely that you're the first person.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nI fucking love it.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nNice.\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nWhere's my record?\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nBut it's okay, because, honestly, the thing about solving Rubik's Cube\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nreally fast is that verbally saying that you did it, as long as there's someone to vouch for you,\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nit's just as impressive as watching it.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nIt's pretty cool. Super fun.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nGet your drink on.\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nI derailed you about that, but I think...\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nSo you're already into the sci-fi scene, the concept album scene.\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nYou came up from underneath the cloud, through the cloud streets.\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nI want you to have a radio play hit song.\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nCrazy.\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nIf the weekend can have 11 of them, then you can have several.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nYou want to know something?\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nI was very distraught at different points in my career, because I didn't have that.\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nAnd there was actually times when...\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nIt's not that I was going to make different music, because the message is always the same,\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nwhich is one of following your dreams and doing what you love.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nBut, you know, sonically, I was like, man, there's times when I found myself in the studio,\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nlike, man, damn, this dude's popping, or that dude's popping.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nLike, damn, should I make some radio shit?\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nIs that what's going to do it?\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nThere were times where I really thought it would, but I was like, it just doesn't feel right.\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nDid you have any embarrassing moments where you tried a little...\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nNo, I mean, I had...\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nI would like...\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nSure, I made fun radio songs, and it's not that they were bad.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nI looked in the mirror and I was like, nah, this isn't me.\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nI still make fun radio-type-esque records, but not that sounds like the same shit.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nAnd so I told myself, like, no, I'm going to stay true to myself and my roots and what I do.\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nAnd so just not to flex, but just to give you an example,\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nthen this is why we're doing the panel again a year later.\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nSo nowadays, I'm not going to name any names, because I don't want it to be taken the wrong way,\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nbut there's a lot of humongous pop stars that, one, cannot sell tickets on their tours,\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nand you can't sell records where they're selling more, they're selling like 50 or 60 or 70,000.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nNow, I know some of you guys...\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nShakira, talking to you.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nNo.\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nShakira!\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nNow, I know that some of you guys might think like, oh, no, I'm going to fucking sell millions and millions of records.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nLike, no, that's not true.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nThis isn't like 96, you know what I mean?\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nYeah, Shakira.\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nThat doesn't work anymore.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nYour hips lie now.\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nThey do.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nSo there's artists, huge artists, pop artists, pop stars and girls who sing pop and all this stuff\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nwho are only moving 50, 60, 70, 80,000 units in their first week.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nAnd so I said, fuck that, you know, because of singles.\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nAnd I said, I'm going to make albums.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nI want to be an album artist.\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nAnd in my first week on my last album, I sold 135,000 in the first week.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nThis is like, everybody keeps arguing on TV panels.\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nThey keep going, oh, television, where's television going?\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nAnd I'm like, it's like, you know, it's not like I'm the only one that can see it, but it just seems like it's so obvious.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nLike, all you have to do is just look at the MP3 threshold that the music went through because of the lower bandwidth.\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nBecause a song began as a thing that was, you know, it was 3.5 megabytes.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nAnd there was a tipping point we hit where the music industry was in big trouble as it knew itself.\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nAnd then there was all this argument about, should we sue this technology, all this stuff?\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nIt happens over and over and over again.\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nI was a communications major in college before I dropped out a week into college.\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nBut I did take the one class where they, like, this has been happening since, when TV got rolled out,\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nmovies were like, they said the exact same things that the record labels said about MP3s.\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nBecause they were like, they went to the government and said, you should make TV illegal.\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nBecause this isn't fair. If people can look at a screen at home, why would they ever go to the movie?\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nWhen phonographs were putting people's houses, people were buying phonographs and buying records,\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nthe people that made sheet music were like, we're fucking out of a job.\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nWhen sheet music, people were selling sheet music bands were like, no one's going to go out and see live music anymore.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nBecause people can just go home and play it by themselves.\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nAnd then the truth that emerges is it's never more good, it's never more bad, it's more good and more bad.\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nSo what you're saying is verifying my prediction about how TV is going to go is that either Vince Gilligan\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nor a 26-year-old Vince Gilligan that doesn't have a Breaking Bad like available to him,\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nbecause he has our next files, staff writing job or anything, like there's no system left for him to go through,\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nor they're going to, Louis C.K. is already doing it, they're going to Howard Hughesify the TV industry,\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nit's going to turn into just everybody's just self-employed.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nNo, I agree. I think honestly a lot of people when streaming of music first started, everybody was like, no.\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nBut that's everything. It saved the music industry.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nSo Universal Music Group, which is like the biggest fucking label there is, was up two years ago,\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nmore than they had been in years and years because of streaming.\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nSo I think what it really comes down to is just like demand.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nLike we as people in this era in time, we want it right now, you know what I'm saying?\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nLike Stranger Things, one episode, fuck that, I want them all.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nYou know Fuller House Season 2? Hurry the fuck up.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nRoger, that's real.\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nYou want to come watch Westworld at my place tonight?\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nThere's pizza on the floor.\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nWhen you say you're making an album, I'll distract you from not having to answer that question.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nWhen you think of making an album because that's an art form that's kind of gone away, some people still do.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nLike how many tracks, is it all thematic?\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nThat's such a good question, dude.\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nOh, I got loads.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nI had some good ones.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nCan I awkwardly go use the restroom and then come back?\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nI just drank like two bottles of water and I've been up here.\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nSo I'm going to come back and answer your question about...\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nI want you to think good and hard about that while you're here tonight.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nGood and hard, yes.\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nYou go pee and I'll talk to Jeff about his question asking.\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nI'm glad somebody finally asked it.\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nWhat the fuck was that?\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nWhat?\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nYou went over my head, you're trying to show me up.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nI have penetrating journal...\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nI dropped out of college with a journalism major that I didn't get.\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nWell you just penetrated me.\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nHuh?\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nOn my show.\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nDude, Harmon...\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nHarmon, you text it to me, let me ask it.\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nIf I penetrate you, you're going to fucking know you got penetrated.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nThat's how penetrating my questions are.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nAlright, hit a beat while he's gone.\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nZach, where you at?\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nWe got Zach back there?\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nNo.\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nWhere's fucking Zach go?\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nThe one show we need Zach with the beats.\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nAcapella?\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nYeah, do it.\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nLet's do it.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nAcapella.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nYo.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nYo.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nYo.\n\n01:17:34.000 -->

--> 01:17:47.040\nYou can be named anything.\n\n01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.500\nLogic's peeing so I'm rapping.\n\n01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.640\nHe's going, he's peeing not crapping.\n\n01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.680\nIt's number one, it's not number two.\n\n01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680\nI fuck your mama!\n\n01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.180\nWhat you going to do?\n\n01:17:57.180 -->

01:18:51.880\nIt was awesome.\n\n01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.680\nDo you guys know Dolly Parton's playing the Hollywood Bowl?\n\n01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680\nYeah.\n\n01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680\nShe's so good.\n\n01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.520\nHey, I'm Dolly Parton, I don't, that's what you said.\n\n01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.520\nAre you Dolly Parton fan?\n\n01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.400\nNo, but check it out, so my mother-in-law is, and she had my wife who's sitting back\n\n01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.000\nlike fourth row, love you baby doll, swag.\n\n01:19:07.000 -->

like, what are you saying?\n\n01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560\nShe's like, yeah, just tell her we're at that concert.\n\n01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560\nAnd I'm like, what?\n\n01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560\nThat's fucked up.\n\n01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.800\nShe's like, yeah, it's my mom's favorite artist.\n\n01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800\nWait, she's there right now, Dolly Parton?\n\n01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.320\nYeah, Dolly Parton's at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320\n10 nights.\n\n01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320\nYes, but here's the crazy thing.\n\n01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320\nI know.\n\n01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.040\nWhat am I doing here at this fucking shit show?\n\n01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:37.560\nBecause while I was in there taking a piss, Dolly Parton, a TV guide, just staring at\n\n01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560\nme.\n\n01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560\nIt sounds real nice.\n\n01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560\nLike a current one?\n\n01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.560\nNo.\n\n01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.060\nDefinitely like 1906.\n\n01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.440\nI saw Dolly Parton play at the Greek amphitheater, which is one of my favorite places to see\n\n01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440\nanybody.\n\n01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440\nReally?\n\n01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.560\nAnd everybody in that place had a good time.\n\n01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560\nEverybody laughed.\n\n01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560\nEverybody cried.\n\n01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.760\nShe tells the greatest stories of all time.\n\n01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.120\nCan I ask you a quick question?\n\n01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.120\nYeah.\n\n01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:04.280\nI played the forum the last time I was in LA, and that was a lot of fun.\n\n01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.520\nAnd I'm not necessarily, I don't know if I want to go to the forum again, because it's\n\n01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.520\nawesome.\n\n01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.520\nYeah.\n\n01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.520\nBut it's an hood.\n\n01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.520\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.520\nIt's an angle hood.\n\n01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.520\nI'm just joking.\n\n01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.280\nBut I've always wanted to do the Greek.\n\n01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.240\nPlay the Greek, because there's no bad city to the Greek.\n\n01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.720\nI know, but the thing is it's just capacity-wise, it's only like 6,000.\n\n01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.200\nIt's pretty small, but as Neil Diamond said, it's where great musicians get to go to when\n\n01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200\nthey die.\n\n01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.680\nThat's the place to play.\n\n01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680\nOkay.\n\n01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.680\nI feel like it's a very satisfying place to play.\n\n01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.560\nI feel like it would be a lot of fun, but I heard that it's kind of quiet.\n\n01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560\nIs that true?\n\n01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560\nNo.\n\n01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560\nOkay.\n\n01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.280\nI mean, I've seen a lot of shows there, and I've been in the front, and I've been\n\n01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.960\nway in the back, and it's pretty tasty audio there.\n\n01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960\nFucking noted.\n\n01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960\nYeah.\n\n01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:50.160\nBut then again, I don't know, for rap, because it's in a residential neighborhood up there.\n\n01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.160\nWhat she said, because I'm black, isn't that going to work?\n\n01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.160\nI'm scared.\n\n01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.840\nThe property values are going to go down.\n\n01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.280\nThe next show's tickets will be the lower price.\n\n01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.280\nIt'll be like $2 a pop.\n\n01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280\nNo, I'm joking.\n\n01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.120\nJohn Tesh, $2.\n\n01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120\nWhat happened?\n\n01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120\nOh, a black show.\n\n01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120\nWhat happened?\n\n01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120\nDolly Parton looked out.\n\n01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.120\nYou know the song, Jolene?\n\n01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.120\nYou know, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.\n\n01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.120\nIt's a great song.\n\n01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.640\nI don't know that much, Dolly.\n\n01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.160\nShe looked out of the crowd, and she goes, you know, I don't mean any offense, but I'm\n\n01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:24.880\nlooking out of my audience, and I know my audience when I come to Hollywood, but I really,\n\n01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.160\nI would like to sing the first verse of this as drag queen, drag queen, 4,000 of the 6,000\n\n01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.880\npeople stood up, and they were all drag queens.\n\n01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880\nReally?\n\n01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.320\nIt was draggy as fuck.\n\n01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.160\nIt was real good.\n\n01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.160\nIt was really...\n\n01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.160\nDraggy.\n\n01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.440\nDolly plays every instrument in the fucking building.\n\n01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.560\nShe plays the horn, the piano, like the violin.\n\n01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.560\nReally?\n\n01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560\nYeah, guitars.\n\n01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560\nShe plays everything.\n\n01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.560\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.560\nDolly puts on a program.\n\n01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.080\nThat's how I saw Dolly Parton, who was on Hannah Montana, because my wife was making\n\n01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080\nme watch it.\n\n01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:58.160\nThat's what I was telling you in the greeners, Miley Cyrus, I heard, like she, because Billy\n\n01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160\nRay was...\n\n01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160\nBilly Ray.\n\n01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.360\nI don't know, contemporary.\n\n01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:10.000\nShe hung out a lot, and so Miley Cyrus cites Dolly Parton as an early mentor.\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.720\nShe tells the most inspirational, sad, beautiful, heartwarming story about, well, I forget the\n\n01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.160\nname of the small town that she grew up in, but it's quite small, and I don't even remember\n\n01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160\nthe state.\n\n01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160\nTennessee, where's she from?\n\n01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.160\nTennessee.\n\n01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160\nTennessee.\n\n01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:29.920\nAnd her father was ruled down to earth, ruled just good, well-meaning, moralistic father,\n\n01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.720\nand when she got really famous, they erected a big statue in the center of town of Dolly,\n\n01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.560\nand he kept saying to her, don't let this go to your head.\n\n01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.560\nYou're still Dolly.\n\n01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.080\nYou're still the girl from the small town.\n\n01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.080\nDon't ever let this become who you are.\n\n01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.280\nThat statue doesn't mean anything, and she's like, yeah, but it's my statue.\n\n01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.920\nI made it, dad, and she's like, yeah, but don't get a big head about this.\n\n01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.480\nShe found out many years later that in the middle of the night, he would go out and clean\n\n01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.920\nthe bird poop off her statue.\n\n01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.920\nDamn, that's awesome.\n\n01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:56.920\nWhat a good story.\n\n01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920\nI wanted to hate him so bad.\n\n01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920\nNo.\n\n01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.920\nNo, I was on board.\n\n01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.920\nI was fucking lost in fucking family rage.\n\n01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:09.040\nI was like, that fucking asshole, I hope this ends with him dying.\n\n01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.040\nI was like, no, what you were seeing was my therapy exercises.\n\n01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.920\nI was like, he loved that statue more than anybody else because it was his little girl\n\n01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.240\nand he wouldn't let any bird shit on her and it was fucking great.\n\n01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.040\nAll right, well, let your little girl think she's bigger than your tail when she gets\n\n01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.040\na statue.\n\n01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040\nThat's why I pissed.\n\n01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040\nI took a piece.\n\n01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.720\nTell me about when you say you're going to make an album now, which is a dying art because\n\n01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:34.040\nlike when we grew up, albums were a thing that the story got told, or even if they didn't\n\n01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.920\nmean to tell a story, they would arrange the songs in a way that if you could play a record\n\n01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.880\nfrom front to back on the first side and flip the tape or flip the record or whatever, like\n\n01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.920\nyou were going through this journey.\n\n01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:50.560\nSo like, if you're one of those people and you clean your weed on the, if it was a like\n\n01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.240\ntotal concept album would fold it open and you could clean your weed because you pinch\n\n01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.440\nit up here and the seeds rolled down into the middle.\n\n01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.440\nSo logic.\n\n01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:07.240\nSo when you're making an album, like, how do you approach that?\n\n01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.240\nAnd also, is there like, that's, that's where you think the market is right now that you\n\n01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.240\nthink that people.\n\n01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.080\nThe market's 100 million percent not into the album.\n\n01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.800\nThe market is into singles and EPs and fucking get, you know, make as much money as you can\n\n01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.520\nas quick as you can.\n\n01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.320\nAnd once again, that's where I had to defy the odds.\n\n01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.360\nI mean, even with my last album, it was a rap album about space.\n\n01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:36.400\nBut I mean, like think, like imagine me walking into Def Jam, okay, like Def Jam and being\n\n01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.240\nlike, yeah, so I got this cool idea about like space and rap.\n\n01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240\nHow's that?\n\n01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.760\nAnd they're like, what?\n\n01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:50.080\nAnd I'm like, are there any, there's a lot of amazing stories about music history of\n\n01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:57.480\none person, one of the few great artists loving a record producers like label people that\n\n01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.120\nwould stick their necks out and say, no, we need to, we need to make this record because\n\n01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120\nthis is going to be important.\n\n01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.600\nAnd the top of, you know, the head of Capitol Records said, no, nobody wants to buy that\n\n01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600\nshit.\n\n01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.200\nBut it ends up being Dave Brubeck's take time out, you know, the biggest jazz record of\n\n01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.200\nall time.\n\n01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.120\nAnd nobody ever wanted to make, are there still people that you think, do they even\n\n01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.720\nexist in the record industry that would stick their necks out and support an artist doing\n\n01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720\nthat?\n\n01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.720\nNo.\n\n01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720\nJust because there's no money in it.\n\n01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.120\nNo, it's not that it's like, you know, who supported me was my manager, but he's also\n\n01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120\nmy best friend.\n\n01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.280\nSo I'm signed to an independent visionary music group.\n\n01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.160\nAnd through that, we did, we did a partnership with IDJ, which is then, which is Def Jam,\n\n01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.840\nwhich is then Universal is this whole fucking matrix.\n\n01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.000\nAnd, and yeah, I mean, we had to defy a lot, a lot of the odds, you know, there was a lot\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.040\nof things that they were like, eh, we don't want to do this or we don't want to do that.\n\n01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.680\nAnd we were like, fuck you going to do it anyway.\n\n01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.680\nRight.\n\n01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.680\nAnd we did it.\n\n01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.440\nAnd the reason, but the reason we had that leverage is because of the things like the\n\n01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440\nmix tapes.\n\n01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.600\nMy man's checking Twitter because I'm just kidding.\n\n01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600\nI'm joking.\n\n01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600\nI'm joking.\n\n01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.680\nThe moment the guest turned to start to me, Dan checks right the fuck out.\n\n01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.680\nNice.\n\n01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.680\nWell, no, that's obviously that's my luxury.\n\n01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.680\nI'm sorry I'm visible that I was checking on our sponsor to see if what the fuck we're\n\n01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.680\nsupposed to say about their product.\n\n01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680\nNice.\n\n01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.400\nI wanted you guys to be doing what you're doing.\n\n01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.400\nIt was good.\n\n01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.760\nIt was a good opportunity for me to look at this.\n\n01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.760\nYes.\n\n01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.760\nI don't even know what we were talking about.\n\n01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.760\nThe album making process.\n\n01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.760\nYeah.\n\n01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.960\nSo is your next one, can you say, is it going to be another like thematic?\n\n01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960\nIt is.\n\n01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.960\nIt is.\n\n01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:31.800\nBowie Esk, Ziggy Stardust journey into there is a huge theme.\n\n01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.160\nI'm really excited about it.\n\n01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.120\nI wish I could give you the title now, but I can't.\n\n01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.120\nIs it called crumb rumblers?\n\n01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.200\nBecause that would be fucking fun.\n\n01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.200\nBut you know what, I will give you the title to my next album.\n\n01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.040\nWell, well, well, it looks like there's a Harmontown exclusive here.\n\n01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.600\nThis is a real thing because you know what, because everything that we've been talking\n\n01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.000\nabout, I think, I think it'd be great and, and you know, it's not too crazy.\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.320\nIt's just the title.\n\n01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:00.400\nBefore I give you the title, I want you to know that it is a word that I created.\n\n01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.240\nI formed, I formed to know it's not that word.\n\n01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.040\nNas did that.\n\n01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.840\nBut it's two words that I put together and basically the definition of it is the cultural\n\n01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:17.200\nevolution of man from scientifically proven the first man and woman from Africa and then\n\n01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.320\nhow over time culturally evolving into a, you know, lighter and lighter and much more\n\n01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.560\nfairer skin.\n\n01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.280\nSo the album is going to be called Afrikarian and it's no real shit.\n\n01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.640\nAnd it's about, it's about me being black and white and seeing life from, from two sides.\n\n01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.480\nAnd once again, about that cultural evolution and how you can go from the darkest of skin\n\n01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.880\nto the lightest of skin or the Aryan brotherhood, if you will, who believe that they're pure\n\n01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.600\nof blood when at the end of the fucking day, we all have, you know, that, that in our blood\n\n01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.560\nand we all have so, so many different ethnicities in our blood, no matter how pure we think\n\n01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.560\nthat we are.\n\n01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.800\nAnd that at the end of the day, life should all be, should be about peace, love and positivity\n\n01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.440\nand equality for all every man, woman and child that walks the earth.\n\n01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.520\nAnd that's what I'm saying on this entire album.\n\n01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.720\nI'm going to buy that record.\n\n01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.720\nI'm going to buy that record.\n\n01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.720\nHere.\n\n01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:06.720\nHere.\n\n01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.720\nExclusive.\n\n01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:08.720\nYeah.\n\n01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:21.640\nI definitely, I think what you're saying is that humanity could use a good shave.\n\n01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.440\nAnd they need to understand that they need to stop thinking that they need to choose\n\n01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.800\nbetween price and quality to get an amazing and affordable shave.\n\n01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.800\nThat's

01:34:23.240\nSo I use it on my face and I go out and I save people.\n\n01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.600\nI prefer to think of all race.\n\n01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.920\nBut I have had some criticisms.\n\n01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.080\nBut I would blame that on crime.\n\n01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.040\nI'm not going to do quota vigilanceism.\n\n01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.480\nThat doesn't get us anywhere.\n\n01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.600\nI had white parents.\n\n01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.640\nThey got killed.\n\n01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.480\nGot killed.\n\n01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.720\nYo, they got killed.\n\n01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.640\nGot killed.\n\n01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.320\nWhen that parents got killed, that was ill.\n\n01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.800\nIt was ill to kill.\n\n01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.440\nMy parents before I had my parenthood filled.\n\n01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.680\nWhen I'm just like a bat, you think\n\n01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.360\nyou know that it's all about that.\n\n01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.520\nBut I just want to put fear in the hearts of enemies.\n\n01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.880\nI fucked your mama so hard, she's now a friend of me.\n\n01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.160\nYo, I made her pussy go wide and Batman's inside.\n\n01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.800\nMade a little robin, pulled it out, gave him a costume,\n\n01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.640\nand said run about.\n\n01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.960\nBe my sidekick, help me fight crime.\n\n01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.200\nBut I'm going to stay in the cave and bust some rhymes\n\n01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.240\nwith logic, logic, Batman, logic.\n\n01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.160\nSo I think it's always good to show up\n\n01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.240\nas advice when you have a professional rapper on stage\n\n01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.240\nto do most of the rapping yourself.\n\n01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:53.480\nI, look, let's clean up some details.\n\n01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.960\nI think we covered most of it, but there's still\n\n01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:58.640\nmore bills to pay.\n\n01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.400\nBut it was the idea, the general idea of that rap,\n\n01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.360\nwhich I think came through, was that price and quality,\n\n01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.840\nthey don't need to compete.\n\n01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.280\nIt's like if you're a biracial rapper.\n\n01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.960\nHow much are they paying us for this?\n\n01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.760\nWait, no, no, no.\n\n01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.040\nHow much are they paying me?\n\n01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.480\nBecause that's exactly.\n\n01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.880\nWe're going to kick start your fourth, this next album.\n\n01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.440\nYou've got that.\n\n01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.080\nThe one after that.\n\n01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.840\nThen your next album has to be all about shaving.\n\n01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.920\nCan I get that Dolly Parton feature, though?\n\n01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.360\nPrice and quality.\n\n01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.520\nDon't let them compete.\n\n01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.320\nYou can get the quality for a low price\n\n01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.520\nand get an amazing and affordable shave.\n\n01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.560\nAnd take my word for it.\n\n01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.640\nMC shaves a lot.\n\n01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.000\nI shave constantly.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.480\nShow me your glistening balls.\n\n01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:54.360\nYeah, yeah, that's dirty.\n\n01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.640\nYou need to be shaved.\n\n01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.640\nOh, no.\n\n01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.360\nOh, plus lines.\n\n01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.040\nYou did not just go there, girlfriend.\n\n01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.880\nOh, my goodness, girl.\n\n01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.080\nI shave my balls so much with Dollar Shave Club\n\n01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.720\nthat I need me undies to cradle them.\n\n01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.400\nOr I'd get like cotton burns.\n\n01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.440\nNo, those two companies are total rivals.\n\n01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.480\nIt's like Pepsi and Coke.\n\n01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.040\nThey're owned by them.\n\n01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.040\nBut they work so well together.\n\n01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.720\nThat's like telling me Doritos and Taco Bell\n\n01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.560\ndon't get along.\n\n01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.680\nCome

goes where he's basically talking about being\n\n01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.560\nin the streets.\n\n01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.640\nBut it goes, get down or lay down.\n\n01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.520\nHit you with the Beretta.\n\n01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.840\nYou better stay down.\n\n01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.400\nStraight side to the playground.\n\n01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.640\nLiving how I'm living with the life that I'm giving.\n\n01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.920\nAnybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them.\n\n01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.240\nShow me the enemy and I'm going to hit them.\n\n01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.640\nThe second I bit them, I get them and hit them with the venom.\n\n01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.240\nAnd I don't need to pretend I'm going to never do it.\n\n01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:16.600\nI knew it.\n\n01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.520\nI've already been through it.\n\n01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.800\nI do it for the street, for the fam, for the life.\n\n01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.920\nAnybody that's gang related.\n\n01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.320\nAnd when I do it on stage, I say, in one breath,\n\n01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.360\nget down or lay down.\n\n01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.000\nHit you with the Beretta.\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:25.600\nGet better, stay down.\n\n01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.320\nStraight shots in the playground, living how I'm living with the life\n\n01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:27.600\nthat I'm giving.\n\n01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.840\nAnybody that's riding with me, I'm riding with them.\n\n01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.680\nShow me the enemy and I'm going to hit them.\n\n01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.000\nThe second I bit them, I get them and hit them with the venom.\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.040\nI don't need to pretend I'm going to never do it.\n\n01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:32.280\nI knew it.\n\n01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:32.840\nI've already been through it.\n\n01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.120\nI do it for the street, for the fam, for the life.\n\n01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:35.120\nAnybody that's gang related.\n\n01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.360\nBut logic, you brought a knife to a gun fight\n\n01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.120\nbecause you haven't heard Dan do a chef.\n\n01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:01.720\nWhen I talk about life in the streets,\n\n01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.320\none thing that I'll say is, I know you're a brother,\n\n01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.040\nbut I know another.\n\n01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:14.000\nAnd I have a brother that's another that doesn't get his druthers.\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.440\nBecause society is trying to smother the brother that's\n\n01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.840\nanother that doesn't get what he wants.\n\n01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.160\nSo show.\n\n01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.800\nBut when I'm on stage, sometimes I go,\n\n01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.520\na brother with another guy comes to get the gun.\n\n01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.160\nBut then I'll stop and go, starting over.\n\n01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.160\nA brother with another guy, some other guy.\n\n01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.520\nI mean, I'm sure what you do is fine.\n\n01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.440\nIt's like so fast that you can't even register.\n\n01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.560\nA brother with a guy.\n\n01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.560\nShe's so quick.\n\n01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.240\nMicro-machines.\n\n01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.480\nWell, here's my serious question.\n\n01:42:53.480 --> 01:43:00.760\nSo when you do something like that, is that so in that instance,\n\n01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.280\nare you, do you think phonetically when you're writing,\n\n01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.400\nobviously you must go, when you're writing lyrics, you go,\n\n01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.680\nI think this is something a lot of people don't understand,\n\n01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.880\nthat only you and I get.\n\n01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.560\nIs that it's not about like, you don't just go like,\n\n01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.160\noh, I'm going to rhyme the word milk,\n\n01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.600\nso then I'm going to say silk at the end of this thing.\n\n01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.920\nIt's like this phonetic like the entire time.\n\n01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.240\nSo yes, I studied, obviously, like the dictionary\n\n01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.000\nand the thesaurus as a kid.\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.280\nSo it's just like live and given, just like these words that\n\n01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:35.320\nJeremy Piven.\n\n01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.120\nJeremy Piven, you know what I mean?\n\n01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.560\nBut there's a difference between just saying some shit.\n\n01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.120\nSo I have this thing where I kind of have fun with it.\n\n01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.400\nSo basically, that's a real thing.\n\n01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.560\nYou guys heard me say it, and it's kind of depicting this street\n\n01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.600\nlifestyle that this guy is living.\n\n01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.720\nAnd I'm preaching to not live that way\n\n01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.240\nand not have to deal with that.\n\n01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.680\nBut then there's fun ones.\n\n01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.080\nSo I could do little freestyles and be like, yo, it's\n\n01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.440\nL-O-G-I-C, chilling in LA from MD.\n\n01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.720\nThe second I get it, you know who we be, right?\n\n01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.680\nAnd then at the end, I'll end it and be like,\n\n01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.640\nbecause I'm ripping and living like almost like some Jack\n\n01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.120\nthe River.\n\n01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.760\nI said I'm ripping and living and striving.\n\n01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.160\nThe killer, the ripper, he's calling what goes when he flow.\n\n01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.200\nAnd this is where it's all just kind of syllable and just fun.\n\n01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.280\nCalling what go when he flow.\n\n01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.240\nAnd you know he's pursuing it, doing it, moving it,\n\n01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.440\ngrooving it, stopping it, right?\n\n01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.480\nLike all just kind of flexing and having fun.\n\n01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.360\nBut when I say it back really fast, it's just ripping and\n\n01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.520\nliving, just dropping it, killing it, ripping, calling what\n\n01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:23.880\ngo when he flow.\n\n01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.880\nAnd you know he's pursuing it, doing it, moving it,\n\n01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.880\ngrooving it, stopping it, rocking it, talking about\n\n01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.920\nwalking it, flipping it, ripping it, motherfucking it,\n\n01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.360\nscrewing it, wanting to go when I buy it, then break it,\n\n01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.520\nroll it, then lick it, then smoke a choke on it later.\n\n01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.360\nBut what this is.\n\n01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.520\nIt's like a roulette wheel.\n\n01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.640\nYeah, totally.\n\n01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.200\nIt's like price is right.\n\n01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.800\nA cart and bike spoke.\n\n01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.440\nThat's fun, because like me, it's almost like solving\n\n01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.160\na Rubik's Cube.\n\n01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.320\nSo like next time, hopefully I can come and I'll do it.\n\n01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.600\nBut it's all about algorithms.\n\n01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.120\nIt's like muscle memory or playing the drums.\n\n01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.120\nIt's about logic.\n\n01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.120\nSo what you do is you just memorize this and you just do\n\n01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.400\nit over and over and over.\n\n01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.000\nAnd so when you are on stage and you are performing, I\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.480\nslaved away on that gang-related verse, the first\n\n01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:01.920\none that I did.\n\n01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.600\nThat is a real thing that I did.\n\n01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.200\nThis one's just like jerking off.\n\n01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.160\nThis one's just like all these people who have no idea.\n\n01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.360\nI'm just like, yeah, ripping it, living it, dropping it,\n\n01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.080\nkilling it, ripping it, calling it.\n\n01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.920\nAnd I'm taking these fun words and putting them together.\n\n01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.560\nBut they're like, oh my god.\n\n01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.440\nSo it's like cheating.\n\n01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.640\nBut that's for fun though.\n\n01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:15.520\nI actually do it.\n\n01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.760\nBut that's just like the fun though.\n\n01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:20.160\nBut not cheating at all because your listener is going,\n\n01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.800\nwow, he talks fast.\n\n01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.920\nIt's like you're talking about like, oh, but to add meaning\n\n01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.480\ninto that, to add a narrative.\n\n01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.240\nAnd then you're talking, when you're jerking off, you're\n\n01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.040\ndoing like, well, this word and that word are like.\n\n01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:35.160\nI'm still forming sentences, but it's more fun.\n\n01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160\nYou know, like even the breakages.\n\n01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.200\nDo you ever do one of those?\n\n01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.240\nIt's super fast, but you're just actually talking shit\n\n01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:39.760\nabout somebody.\n\n01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.000\nThey don't know it.\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.360\nOr I just say some real satanic shit in there.\n\n01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.800\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.920\nLike, river to river to Shave Brave.\n\n01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.760\nWell, this is what I wanted to do.\n\n01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.320\nIs that what it's called, Shave Brave?\n\n01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.440\nDollar Shave Club.\n\n01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.600\nOh, Dollar Shave Club.\n\n01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.080\nShave Brave is the name of the year.\n\n01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.240\nI think that's a new Autobot from Transformer.\n\n01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.560\nBe brave to Shave.\n\n01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.360\nShave Brave.\n\n01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.600\nWait, what the fuck is it called again?\n\n01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.000\nGet over it on those.\n\n01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:04.520\nShave Brave.\n\n01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.400\nDollar Shave Club?\n\n01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.960\nDollar Shave Club.com.\n\n01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.460\nNice.\n\n01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.320\nSo let me ask you a question real quick.\n\n01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.720\nIf you, if this person, like this company, they spot you,\n\n01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.320\nbut you like, can you like, make fun of them?\n\n01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320\nAre you allowed to do that?\n\n01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.800\nI think we're about to find out.\n\n01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.720\nThey'll either be back or they won't.\n\n01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.120\nI don't know if we offended me on these or if they use them.\n\n01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.560\nThat is like, that's like the first rule of Dollar Shave\n\n01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.280\nClub.\n\n01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:31.320\nWe just totally fucked that up.\n\n01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.520\nBut I think the beauty of the new world is it's like, well,\n\n01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.360\nthere's always going to be, it's more of a buyer's market\n\n01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.960\nin the sense of like, you know, hey,\n\n01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.360\nthere'll be another Shave Club.\n\n01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.000\nHey, if it's, if it's, if it's a dynamic industry.\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.720\nHey, can I just say that I was like super nervous to come out\n\n01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.080\nhere?\n\n01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.000\nAnd no, I'm serious.\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.760\nI was so nervous, man, because like, this isn't,\n\n01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.560\nthis isn't like, this isn't my, my.\n\n01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.680\nYou're jammed, the kids say.\n\n01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.600\nGo ahead.\n\n01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.680\nLet me teach you some street culture.\n\n01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.440\nIt's not your jam.\n\n01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:01.920\nWhat?\n\n01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.760\nIt's your jam.\n\n01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.240\nWhat?\n\n01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.440\nNo, it's not my jam.\n\n01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.520\nOh yeah, I get it.\n\n01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.040\nIt comes from jelly.\n\n01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.320\nYou're making like sandwiches.\n\n01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.640\nLike, this isn't my jam.\n\n01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.320\nBut yes, I, I, uh, this isn't my jam.\n\n01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.520\nLike this is kind of, you know, this is like fun and,\n\n01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.880\nand, and, you know, and comedic.\n\n01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.360\nAnd also I, I do want to just say that I appreciate you kind\n\n01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.440\nof like, let me talk about, you know,\n\n01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.000\nsome more serious stuff as well.\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.800\nBut to everybody in the crowd who might not know me,\n\n01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.360\nI just want to say thank you so much for even like sitting\n\n01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.720\nthrough this and, and, you know, and I really appreciate it.\n\n01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:30.760\nAnd this is fucking awesome.\n\n01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.960\nAnd I hope maybe just maybe massive that I can come back.\n\n01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:34.600\nOh yeah.\n\n01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.760\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.800\nYou should come back all the time.\n\n01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.320\nBut I think we should conclude with,\n\n01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.760\nthis is what I was getting at earlier.\n\n01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.640\nIt was like, our lives are intersecting.\n\n01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.760\nI need to, when we go to the moon,\n\n01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.480\nand you did the sci-fi rap thing,\n\n01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.880\nit's about exodus from the earth and stuff.\n\n01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.680\nSo I think like you could help us create like a\n\n01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.160\nHarmontown anthem that should probably be hip hop.\n\n01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.000\nWe'll just like, we'll close with that and then we'll go.\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.200\nThis is not going to go well.\n\n01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.560\nBut I think it will cause.\n\n01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.640\nWell, let me ask you real quick, Dan, to cut you off.\n\n01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.440\nYou said you're nervous to come out here,\n\n01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.640\nbut are you nervous when you go on stage at the forum?\n\n01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.120\nWhat's that, 40,000 people?\n\n01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:15.960\nWhat do you got there?\n\n01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.240\nIt wasn't 40,000, but you know, some of the shows we did,\n\n01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.320\nthey were like 20,000.\n\n01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.120\nYeah.\n\n01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.760\nAre you nervous when you go on and do your own thing,\n\n01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760\nor you're not prepared?\n\n01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.600\nNot really.\n\n01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.160\nIf I haven't done it in three months,\n\n01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.640\nand then I'm, you know, I have like a one-off show\n\n01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.480\nor a festival, I get like, oh man, I'm excited.\n\n01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.080\nBut as soon as I touch the stage, I'm like, it goes away.\n\n01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.920\nBut this is different, but it's not a bad thing.\n\n01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.080\nIt's actually really nice because there's less and less\n\n01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.800\nthings, not to sound any type of way, but like, you know,\n\n01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:40.120\nlike the last time, this is gonna sound crazy.\n\n01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.800\nThe last time I felt how I felt like sitting back there,\n\n01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.480\nit was when I performed on Jimmy Fallon with the Roots\n\n01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.880\nfor nine million viewers.\n\n01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.240\nAnd it's because I performed so many times\n\n01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.600\nin front of so many people and this and that,\n\n01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.680\nthat like, I'm used to that.\n\n01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:53.280\nPerforming on television was crazy.\n\n01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.440\nDoing this, like, you know, I watched,\n\n01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.360\nand I was telling Dan this, like,\n\n01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.840\nI wasn't really hip to all of this.\n\n01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.160\nObviously, I knew Dan, and I love Rick and Morty,\n\n01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.560\nand I know community, and you know,\n\n01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.720\nall these different things, but I didn't really know\n\n01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.480\nabout this world, and I did my homework,\n\n01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.560\nand I watched fucking Harmontown,\n\n01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.960\nI watched Documentary, I watched everything,\n\n01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.360\nand then I got real scared, like, oh shit,\n\n01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.840\nI can't fuck this up, you know?\n\n01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.680\nAnd so it's just-\n\n01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.520\nAnd clearly, in the meantime,\n\n01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.400\nI'm diligently listening to all your albums.\n\n01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.960\nYeah, yeah, totally.\n\n01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:23.080\nI came so prepared, but yeah, no, I think they would,\n\n01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.400\nI mean, I know that you are like, cut out for podcasting.\n\n01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.800\nLike, you should be, because it's just a,\n\n01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:34.160\nlike, you're cut, we're on the over, Jesus, I'm drunk.\n\n01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.560\nYou should, you have leftovers.\n\n01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.160\nYou're cut for our breath over.\n\n01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.840\nYou're practicing a craft on stage,\n\n01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.360\nand on your albums, you're putting those things together\n\n01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.920\nmeticulously, but, and it's not a waste of all of the,\n\n01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.200\nyou know, when you're 80 years old,\n\n01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.000\nand you're a hologram, like,\n\n01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.240\nif you want to avoid going like, oh shit, man,\n\n01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.760\nI was chugging and chugging and chugging,\n\n01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.440\nand how much of that smoke went into albums\n\n01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.280\nand things that I took so preciously,\n\n01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:04.880\nit's like, you're fun to listen to just having coffee,\n\n01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.880\nso that's what podcasting is.\n\n01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.080\nLike, you could just scoop up all that butter\n\n01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.440\nand dog pizza and put it in and dog pizza.\n\n01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.520\nLogic, what he was saying is, stop selling out\n\n01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.320\nand, you know, making all this money on records,\n\n01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.280\nand just really get into the podcast world.\n\n01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.600\nYeah.\n\n01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.000\nI know, it's a side-to-side action.\n\n01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.920\nJoin my, join my click, join my company.\n\n01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:24.760\nExactly.\n\n01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.160\nIt'll, it'll, it'll, no, it's,\n\n01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.520\nit's something to do in the meantime.\n\n01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.360\nI've thought about it.\n\n01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.200\nKeep the voices out of your head.\n\n01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.240\nNo, I'm legit, I've thought about it.\n\n01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.480\nI thought how it could be something that'd be really fun\n\n01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.400\nand maybe to do like once a month and just, you know,\n\n01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.920\nand just have, well, but here's the real fucking

ask.\n\n01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:46.000\nSo, if, if I, if I truly, if I do,\n\n01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.720\nif I start my own podcast,\n\n01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.800\nwill you two come be on one of
