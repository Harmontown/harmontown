{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nFrom the curiously named Hollywood Theater in Portland, Oregon,\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:10.000\nHarmontown, now in possession.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:15.000\nWould you please join me?\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:40.000\nWelcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harp.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:41.000\nThank you.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:43.000\nThank you, Portland.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:45.000\nWow, it's cavernous.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nThis is cavernous.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:51.000\nIt's good, though.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:52.000\nDan?\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:53.000\nYeah.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:55.000\nCould I ask you a personal question?\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:56.000\nYeah.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nHave you been drinking today?\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:02.000\nA little bit.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:03.000\nAll right.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:04.000\nAll right.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nI just want to get through the Evernote list.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:12.000\nSo a guy I met at a bar today.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nIt was his 25th birthday.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:18.000\nAnd I bought him a drink.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nAnd he was turning 25.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:25.000\nSo I said, man, you got to do all your shit.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:26.000\n25.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:27.000\nI'm 42.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:28.000\nIt's a bunch of stuff.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:33.000\nEvery day, I think I say, well, if I was 25, I'd do this or that.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nSo you got to do everything.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.000\nAnd he said, yeah.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:40.000\nIt's like, yeah, you got to go intertubing with sluts.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nAnd I wrote it down.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nHe said, I fucked that up.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nHe said, intertubing with hot sluts.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:56.000\nSo he distinguishes those ugly sluts that you don't want to go intertubing with.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nI thought Portland might enjoy that.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nDo people still intertube here?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:06.000\nLike, do you guys go to, do you guys do it with hot sluts?\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nDoes that make it better?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nWhat's the river here?\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nIs it the chutes, right?\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nYou got the chutes here?\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nIs it the Cooch River?\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:19.000\nWillameth.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nBut you guys have hot sluts here, but you don't.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:26.000\nThey're not more important than the regular sluts, are they?\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nAnd they're not better at intertubing.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nRight?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nAsk that kid.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nHot sluts.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nHot sluts.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nIntertubing with hot sluts.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:39.000\nAll right.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nThe last thing on my list.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:48.000\nThe last thing on my two-item list is, well, I mean, there's another, there's a side note,\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nwhich is a Twitter corner.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nDoes Twitter corner have a theme?\n\n02:52.000 --> 03:01.000\nTwitter corner.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:07.000\nIf you have something to say to me and you can fit it in a tweet, say it.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:12.000\nIf it takes nine tweets, say it somewhere else.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nThat's it.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:14.000\nThat's it.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:21.000\nI thought that might resonate.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nNo one wants that in their feed.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:27.000\nLike the guy with the parentheses, the eight out of nine guy.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nAnd first of all, feminism in the early 90s.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.000\nBuddy, it's Twitter.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nIt's a bumper sticker.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nJust say you like women.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nYou don't have to say it nine times.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nOr write a blog.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nNo one will read it.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nThat's the point.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nSo, I mean, just don't, I'm blocking everyone now.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nI block, I block, I block.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nHow many a day?\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nHow many, how many blocks?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nI block, I block more people than healthy people eat kale.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nI block, I block, I get up in the morning and I block.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nI start blocking.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nI just block.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nThat's the end of that corner.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nAll right.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nSo, a guy at the bar across the street.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nWhat was it?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nThe Queen Moon in six pence?\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nWhat's that place called?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.000\nThe Moon in six pence or something?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nThere was a guy.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nSo, obviously, because I'm doing a show here,\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nsome of you were drinking there tonight.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nAnd a lot of you came up to me and were very friendly to me\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nand told me that you like me.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:27.000\nAnd it was very wonderful.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:28.000\nAnd I enjoy it.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\nAnd I love your city.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd I love you.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nAnd there was a guy sitting next to me at the bar who, like,\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nthree hours ago, obviously, I've been drinking for six hours.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd the guy the entire time was like, he was just this guy.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nAnd he kept going like, what do you do?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nAnd it's like, I do a podcast.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nThat's why they're saying these nice things to me.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nWhat's a podcast?\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nWell, it's a thing.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nAnd I have to explain it.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nAnd he's like, so it's like radio?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nI mean, yes, it's like radio.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nFine, done.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nForget it.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nAll you have to do is stop talking to me.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nAnd your troubles will be over.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nYou don't have to.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nAnd he's like, so why are you famous, though?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm not famous.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nI'm not.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nThey're experiencing people coming up to me in this bar\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\ntwo blocks from the venue.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nThey're excited to see the show.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nThey're getting a drink before they go and line up.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nI'm not famous.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nI'm as famous as you are, kind of.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nLike if you, like wherever you work,\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nif a lot of people worked there,\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nand you were going to do karaoke,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nlike that's what's happening.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nWell, what's your name?\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nMy name is Dan Harmon.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nWhat do you spell it?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nIt's fucking, god damn it.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nI'm not allowed to do this to other people.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nH-A-R-M-O-N.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nWell, I'm going to ask my son.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nMy son's in college.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nWould my son hear of you?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nI bet your fucking ass he has, motherfucker.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nBecause I made an awesome...\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nThat's how good I am at karaoke.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nYour son.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.000\nYeah, I crossed the line there.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\nI was like, I bet your son has.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nBut then it was three hours later, the guy's like,\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nwell, I asked my son and he said,\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nI Googled him and I never heard of him.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nFuck you.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nI don't know why I'm telling this story,\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nbut I just, I was like,\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nI didn't never knew I wanted to be famous\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nuntil I talked to this guy.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nIt wasn't even a thing in my mind.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nThe guy wants to be, clearly he wants to be famous,\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nor his son does.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nI'm just saying.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nLike, I was fine until I talked to that guy.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nI found the first dickhead in Portland is my story.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nI love Portland.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nIt's so fun here.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nWe have to fly out.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nFuck Portland.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.000\nFuck this city!\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:53.000\nLet's burn this shit whole down!\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nFuck Portland!\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nLet's hold and not get face tattoos.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nThere's a lot of face tattoos here.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nHey, hey, Portland,\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:08.000\nyou guys have all seen Human Centipede 3, right?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:09.000\nI did.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nI watched it.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nWait, there's a 3?\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:12.000\nYeah, there's a 3.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nWhat happens in 3?\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nIn the third one.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:19.000\nThis was on my list of shit to talk about.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:24.000\nOkay, so Human Centipede 3.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nHow many people have seen Human Centipede 1?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nI got some.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nIs that a good 15% of the people here?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nYeah, that was the 8%.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nHow many people have seen Human Centipede 1 and 2?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nJust as a side note,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nhow many people have seen Human Centipede 2,\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nbut not Human Centipede 1?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nIt just jumped to the middle of the saga.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nOkay, no hands, no hands.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nSo clearly there's a linear appeal.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nIt's like Game of Thrones.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nNumber 2 really is the Empire Strikes Back of the Horses.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nYeah, you don't want to,\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nyou don't just jump in the middle.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nOkay, we know that.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nThat's important for the research.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nHuman Centipede 3, anybody see it?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\nOkay, a couple, one hand, one hand.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:09.000\nThe guy from the first movie,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nthe guy from the first movie\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nis a prison warden in the third movie.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nAnd every movie adds more people.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nLike, there's three people in the first one.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nThere's like 24 people, I think, in the second one.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nAnd then this one's like a prison.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nIt's like 500 people.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:36.000\nSo the guy from the first movie is a warden.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nHe's a prison warden, Jeff.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nAnd he doesn't know how to run his prison.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nSo what does he do?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nDoes he try to seek some solution to his prison problems?\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nHe has this accountant who keeps telling him,\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nlike, I'm telling you,\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nand the accountant keeps showing him the first...\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nWe're feeding them too much and there's too much poop.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nHe keeps showing them the first two human centipedes.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nWe have to cut down on the food and the poop wastes.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nThe five people who raised their hands\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nknow that the human centipede saga\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nhas a weird meta thing going through it,\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nwhere in each movie,\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\neach movie is about someone who's watched the previous movie.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nSo the third movie is about a prison warden\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nwho is being told by his accountant\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nwho has seen both of the previous movies\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nthat this is the way to go.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nAnd the prison warden is played by the same guy\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nthat played the doctor in the first movie,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nthe guy who's like, yes, poop your diarrhea\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:43.000\nin the mouth behind you.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nYes, I'm a doctor.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nI love watching people poop into each other.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:54.000\nThat guy's a Texas warden in the third movie,\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nand his accountant says, and I wrote it down,\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nthis is the defining moment,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\n45 minutes into human centipede three.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:10.000\nThis is after we've watched the doctor try to castrate people,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:15.000\nand he tries everything he can think of to be a good warden,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nand the accountant keeps going,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nlike, I'm telling you,\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nand he keeps holding up the human centipede movies,\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nand the warden keeps going, that's stupid,\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nand you're supposed to be like, this movie is so self-aware.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\n45 minutes into it,\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nbut it's not self-aware enough to not exist,\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:37.000\nwhich would be a truly, like, that would be a move on its part.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt would be like, oh, I understand,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nthis movie shouldn't exist,\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:45.000\nbut instead, the accountant, so I wrote this down,\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nthe accountant gets very frustrated, Jeff.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nHe loses his cool at 45 minutes.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\n45 minutes of castration and rape and horrible,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nlike, just terrible, like, Eli Roth, like, shit.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nWere mid-second acts or late-second acts here?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:03.000\nWell, I mean, let's be serious.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nStructure eludes the human centipede.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nWhat would Joseph Campbell call this scene?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nI think Joseph Campbell would say,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nlike the people in the movie,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nlike, human centipede movies themselves,\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:22.000\nlike, experiment with what defines a movie.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nLike, the whole point of the movie is,\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:28.000\noh, could you poop into a mouth?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:33.000\nAnd I don't think a story even...\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nHow many people are pooping into how many mouths\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nin the third one?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nLike, I told you, 500.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\n500 people?\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nIt's a prison full of people.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nBut it seems like, wouldn't the food,\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nas the body digests whatever food comes through it,\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nit would get less and less...\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nNo, there's this focus in the movie\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nabout how medically accurate it is.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nLike, and I can't tell...\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nI can't tell if the director is, like, for real or not.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nI can't tell...\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.000\nEverything's very tongue-in-cheek,\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nbut the tongue is, like, poking through the cheek\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nand there's, like, a butt hole where the tongue is\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nin the cheek.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nLike, I don't know...\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nI don't know what...\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nI don't know if the guy's, like...\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nThe movie is nothing if not tongue-in-cheek.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nIt's all about being tongue-in-cheek.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nSo, I have no idea.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nSo I've watched all three of them.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nAnd at one point in the third movie,\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nthe accountant at the prison,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nhe gets so fed up.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\n45 minutes into the hour...\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI think it's a 90-minute movie.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nHalfway through the movie.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nPutting this on a structural levels\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nof the first Hulk movie,\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:39.000\nwhere the Hulk appears, like, in the third act.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nThis guy, the accountant, like, goes, like...\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd he just throws, like, a Ned Beatty in network fit.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nLike, he does a little monologue.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nAnd he goes...\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nAnd I wrote it down.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nI backed it up and I transcribed his monologue.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nAnd he says...\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nBy the way, the accountant is the guy\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nfrom Human Centipede 2.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:03.000\nFor those eight people who watched the second one,\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nthe guy in the black-and-white Human Centipede 2,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nwhich is the more pulpy, noirish one,\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nhe plays the accountant.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nSo, and he goes...\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:21.000\nI have been trying to tell you for days now.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:25.000\nI have the answer to all our problems.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.000\nWe've got to make a Human Centipede of our prisoners.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nSone ass to mouth.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:35.000\nSharing one digestive system.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nNo more prison fights.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nNo more assaults on guards.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nNo more disrespect.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nThey will literally be on their knees,\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nbegging you for mercy.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nAnd it's the ultimate deterrent\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:58.000\nfor those considering a career in crime.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nThat should be the crawl at the beginning of the movie.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:04.000\nThat should be the voiceover during the trailer.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nI hadn't shared that before, right?\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nWhat's that?\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nOkay.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nThe show's an alcoholic.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nI like your new glasses, Dad.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nThat's it.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nI got nothing.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nFrom now on, we're free-wheeling.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nOh.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nI got glasses.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nMy eyeballs are not perfectly round.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nBig deal.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:29.000\nSo, they told me...\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nFor those not watching,\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nDan can't lift the mic higher in the mic stand.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nWell, it's tight and I couldn't loosen it.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:40.000\nSo, my eyeballs aren't perfectly round.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nSo, when I look far away,\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nlike when I look at these people who came to the show late,\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:51.000\nI can't see, I guess, a pixel perfect.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:55.000\nI have a one-pixel blur on everything far away.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:58.000\nSo, that's what these glasses are for.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nYou look good, though.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nThat's why I'm wearing them.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nIt's not because it improves anything.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nI told you earlier, I said,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nthis Dan, the bespectacled Dan,\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nis the Dan that will write movies.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.000\nI've started to notice that people are treating me different.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nAnd so, I'm now trapped in these glasses\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nthat actually make it very hard to function,\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nlike, within eight feet.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nLike, I'm, like, tripping over things,\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:25.000\nbut I'm like, everyone likes me now.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nAnd I'm not kidding.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nIt's not a joke.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nI can see, okay, oh, look at that speaker.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.000\nIt's black.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nBut the real thing is that bartenders are nice to me now.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nThat's it.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nIt's like a disguise.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:47.000\nI'm thinking, like, maybe I should...\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nI don't need glasses.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nI have 20-20 vision.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nAll right.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nSo, I want to...\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:59.000\nWhat I would like to do is...\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:03.000\nI'd like to do a little experiment.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:07.000\nI'd like to take off all my clothes...\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nand show you my dick.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nAnd I'd like to ask you\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nif it's big.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd I'd like you to lie to me.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nI'd like you to say it's big.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nAnd the reason I want you to do that\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nis because I think it's small.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd I don't want to live in that world.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nSo it's not so much an experiment,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:40.000\nas it is just sort of an exercise in my dishonesty.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nI'm ashamed of my tiny penis.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nWould you say tiny?\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nIs it freak show tiny or is it just regular...\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nWell, define freak show tiny.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nI don't know.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nWe live in a world where nobody knows about each other's dicks.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nLike, we don't know what's going on.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nWe've created a whole mythology.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nI don't know.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.000\nWe watch movies about guys with giant monster dicks.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nAre those regular-sized dicks?\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nYeah, see?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nI mean...\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nI don't...\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nWhat are those?\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nAre they giant dicks?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nAre those regular-sized dicks?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nNo, thank you.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nAnd women are also kind of pseudo-conditioned\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nto like, they know how fucked up we are about it,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nso they're also not honest about it.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nThey're like, they know that they're not supposed to say\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nwhether they know if a dick is small or not.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nAdmit it, right?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nYou guys learned that early on in your life.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:44.000\nLike, eight years old, you learned to lie about dicks.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nAnd men are also like, lie about my dick.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:52.000\nNone of us in this room know what a dick is supposed to look like.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nThere's no...\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nWho here thinks they have a regular dick?\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nRaise your hand if you have a regular dick.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nThere's two guys sitting right next to each other.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nTwo guys.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nTwo really well-dressed gentlemen.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nBoth very...\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nYour brothers.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nYour brothers?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nAre you guys twins?\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nOh, okay.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nWait, get on stage.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nTwo brothers with regular dicks.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nRegular dick brothers.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nRegular dick brothers.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nYou always gotta add if you want to.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nGrab water for two mikes, depending on...\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI don't want anybody to ever say,\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nwell, I was forced up on stage.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nAll right, so we're gonna talk about my dick.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nFirst off, what are your names?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nJoe.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nJoe and?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nIan.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nJoe and Ian.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nAnd you guys are very...\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou both have nice brown shoes on.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nYou're both well-dressed.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nYou're both brothers.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nWhat's the age difference between you guys?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nSeven years.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nI'm the older.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nYou're the older.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nYou're the older.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:50.000\nAnd you guys, when Dan said,\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nwho thinks they have a regular dick?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nAs one, both of your hands went up.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:59.000\nAs though he asked, what's two plus two?\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nSo what...\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nLet's talk about all of that.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nOkay.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:09.000\nI reckon about six and a half inches is average.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nAnd about the...\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nAll right.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nAnd about...\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nLet me explain the girth to...\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nWoman, as we said, no, get up on stage.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nGet up on stage.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nI'm estimating

Roberts,\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nsince he's gotten to the prison,\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nhas not said a word at all.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nOkay.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.000\nAnd he's just, he's just walked in\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nand it's just Eric Roberts walking\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:55.000\nand watching as this guy gives him\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:59.000\na tour of 500 people sown ass to mouth.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nAnd then...\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:03.000\nHow are those stored exactly?\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nIs it like zigzag back and forth?\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:09.000\nYeah, it's a, it's a Photoshop, like, of guys.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nSo they're like looking through a window\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nor something?\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nYeah, it's like a noodle of guys, yeah.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:17.000\nIt's a prison yard, it's clearly Photoshopped and it's lame.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:21.000\nSo he walks along the chain of them\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:24.000\nand he goes, yes, feed!\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nA Jew behind a Muslim!\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nA Muslim behind a Jew!\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nA Republican behind a Mexican!\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nWhoa!\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nArizona?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nA Crip behind a blood!\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:46.000\nHe never, he never counters the Mexican and the Republican.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nPeace on Earth!\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:51.000\nGoodwill to men!\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:54.000\nAnd then Eric Roberts says his first line, which is,\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:58.000\nThis is too much.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nThis is, this is too much,\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nsays Governor Eric Roberts.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nThis really is the living end.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nThis is too much.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:09.000\nAnyways, that's, I thought it was a charming film.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:13.000\nI think it's, I'm surprised that you curled up in bed\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nand watched him in Centipede 3.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nAaron was out of town and I, like, I don't know,\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.000\nI just, I like watching horror movies when she's out of town\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nand I've always wondered if you could eat diarrhea.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:31.000\nAnd if you did, could you poop it into another person's mouth?\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:37.000\nAnd if that person could poop it into another person's mouth?\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:43.000\nAnd if that could, could, could happen for 497 other people?\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:46.000\nAnd what would happen to the 497th person?\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nOh, so what happens in the movie?\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nLike, what happens to those 500?\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nThey don't address it.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nThey don't address the one thing that you're wondering about,\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nwhich is, could this actually happen?\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nNo, I'm not wondering that.\n\n29:56.000 --> 30:01.000\nWell, I just, he shows the 500 man Centipede\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nand then where does he go from there?\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nThey try to escape or what?\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nNo, no.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:11.000\nSo, yeah, so he goes home and makes toast or what, what happens?\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nThe protagonist is the prison warden.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nYeah, so what does he do from then on?\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nOr is that the end?\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nThat's, Eric Roberts looks at it.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nAre you guys cool with me spoiling the movie?\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nIt's human Centipede.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nEric Roberts looks at it and goes, this is too much.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nAnd then he says something like, God damn.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nThat's, and then he leaves.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:32.000\nAnd that's, the prison warden, like,\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:36.000\nshoots the doctor that helped him do it.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:40.000\nEric Roberts comes back and goes, you know what?\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nThis is the best.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:45.000\nSo it's like a Twilight Zone moment with the broken glasses?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:48.000\nYeah, it's like an O'Henry novel, but with no stakes.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nYeah, like that, because the guy's like,\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nbecause Eric Roberts doesn't come back and go,\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:54.000\nyou know what, this is the best.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nWhat, you shot the doctor.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nIt doesn't, it doesn't.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nAre they trying to rehabilitate the prisoners in any way?\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nYes.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nDoes number 118 eat enough poop or go,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nI'm ready to go straight?\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nOh, oh, there's another part to it,\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nwhich is that the, there's,\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:13.000\nwhat do you do with the death row people\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nand the life sentence people?\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nAnd he made a human, what does he call it?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:22.000\nHuman caterpillar, which means he cuts off their arms and legs.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.000\nSo there's just like, that's just an extra thing.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:31.000\nAnd I'm going to shock you guys and tell you\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nit's worth watching this movie,\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:36.000\nbecause I don't, I think they are,\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:39.000\nthey're in the, you know, labs right now,\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:42.000\nsmashing particles together,\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nbecause they want to know what happens\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nwhen you do something terrible, you know,\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nlike we learned about how the universe works,\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nbecause you smash two atoms together and it goes,\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nand they go like, oh, what's that?\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:55.000\nIt's a quark, it's a sub-boson.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nIf you're not, if you're,\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nwhat are you going to watch Robert Zemeckis movies\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nyour whole life?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nYou're not going to learn what life is.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nYou watch Human Centipede.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:06.000\nI think you, you gain some insight into like,\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nIt's not a popular opinion, but\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nI think it's an important film.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nIs it a closed circuit?\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nThe movie?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nNo, it's on Netflix and,\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\noh, Jeff.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nNo, I mean, didn't you say earlier\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nthat there's a ring of people all going in a thing?\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nNo, yeah, there's no, there's a final guy\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nand he poops, but they never show that part.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nThere's a front guy that eats?\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nThey never show that part.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:39.000\nThey don't show, is that guy's poop extra poopy?\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nThere's no way, there's no way,\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nno matter how much you fed the first prisoner\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nthat is going to make that food,\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nit will make it to the 500th guy.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nI'm saying the same thing you're saying, yeah.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nI feel like the movie is like,\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nI actually felt in the third one,\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nI felt like you could feel\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nlike the director's heart wasn't in it.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:01.000\nLike he was just doing it for the fans.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:05.000\nIt was season six community kind of like.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nIt's funny because it's true.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nThey loved it.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI guess.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nThanks guys, thanks.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nDid you feel like I sewed the ass of community\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nto its own mouth enough\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nuntil the show was eating poop\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nand you could let it go?\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nAll right, so, all right,\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nso here's the thing about tonight's show.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nTerrible.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nGot nothing, nothing to do,\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:39.000\nbut from terrible shows,\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:43.000\ncome terrible pizza.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nNo.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nOkay.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nWishful thinking.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nCan we bum people out\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nand tell them who didn't appear on the show tonight?\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nWell, we were going to have kid and play,\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nbut they, I think,\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nyeah, I know.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nWe were going to have kid and play.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nI feel like play hates kid.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nI really do.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nI really do.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nI wasn't there.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nAnd I was, like, actually kind of relieved\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nthat they didn't show up\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nbecause the tension is unbearable.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nI feel like play hates kid.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nPlay hates kid.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nIt really does.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nThat's the God's honest truth.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nIt's not, it sounds like a joke you'd make.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nDo you feel like if kid and or play were out here right now,\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nthat you could hold your own in a rap battle\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nwith either kid or play?\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nWell, I feel like\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nif you played a rap beat\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nfor me right now,\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nI could

so hard\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nthat I ended up looking\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\n45 degrees that way.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nI think you might have beaten kid,\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nbut not play.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nYeah, one of those guys sucks.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nYou know it.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nAll right.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nLet's meet some people tonight.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nI got so drunk, you guys.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nWho's a terrible person?\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nWho's the worst person ever?\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nThat guy's hands one up first.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nIt's like a 45 hands one up.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nWell, everybody feels like they're a bad person.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nYeah.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nI'd just like to say anytime\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nanyone blocks anyone on Twitter,\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nthat person deserved it.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nAll these people, why'd you block me?\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nI don't know. I'm sure you deserved it.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nWell, let's hear his story.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nDo you want to come up? Let's work it out.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nLet's hear it.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nThis guy's been blocked by Spencer on Twitter.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nYo, he's blocked by Spencer.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nOh, fuck, fuck.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nHe can't read my tweet.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nJust Spencer. What's your name, sir?\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nUh, Mark.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nPardon? Mark. Mark, hello, Mark.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nOh, this guy.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nNo, I don't know.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nIt was brief. He doesn't actually remember me.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nWhat did you tweet?\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nIt was during the, uh,\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nthe Ferguson riots.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nYeah, I get worked up over those.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nNo, neither of us are racist at all.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nThat's why I kind of feel bad about it,\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nbecause we're kind of on the same side,\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nbut, uh,\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nhe tweeted some Martin Luther King\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nquote that made it sound like\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nhe would have loved the riots\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nand I disagreed and we got a little argument\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nand then he was, I didn't even realize\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nhe blocked me until like months later, actually,\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nand I tried to tweet at him.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nThat's how I do it. I don't do it right away.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nYou think everything's cool\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nand then fuck.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nHe might not, he might not even have done it that night.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nHe might have just, I don't know if he was just\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nthinking about it for a while or what, but\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nat some point he went back.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nIt feels like a particular tragedy because\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nyou guys both love Martin Luther King.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nYou know, I don't think it's a tragedy.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nI just think it's life, man.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nHe's been hurt in and out.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nSometimes he catch a wave, sometimes he catch,\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nnot the beach.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nI just think\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nthat life is, okay.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nI don't know.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nSo, uh, I don't, that sounds vaguely familiar.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nHere's the thing about Martin Luther King.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nHe says that people, you know,\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nriots aren't great, but people only\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\ndo it when literally nothing else\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nhas worked thus far.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nI think it's pretty valid.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nAlso, I think that, uh,\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nwe shouldn't be talking about\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nwhat Martin Luther King meant\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nif it's not in the support of black people.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nLike maybe he said stuff\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nthat wouldn't support black people in their struggles,\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nbut I'll wait for a black guy to say that,\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nand that might be racist. I'll admit it.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nI guess it's not.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nSpencer's admitting he's racist.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nWhat do you have to say?\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nI actually, I agree with that.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nWell, the second point's kind of weird\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nbecause he's the one quoting him,\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nbut the first point I agree with,\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nwe weren't able to\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nto talk about it further.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nAnd you know what? I think that's fine.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nI'm fine with the outcome. No offense.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nBecause you got black, so the\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\ndiscussion had to cease.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nYou must have said something fucked up.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nWill you accept my apology, Spencer?\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nWhat's up? Will you accept my apology?\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nOh, yeah. No, it's not like I'm like super upset.\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nIt's just when I block someone, I'm like,\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nam I going to lose by not\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nhaving to see this guy's tweets anymore?\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nAnd you know, that's a very high bar.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nIt honestly is.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nI mean, Dan might pass that bar,\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nbut very few people. And Dan's a great\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\ntweeter. He's great on Twitter.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nBut yeah, it's just that.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nIt's like if someone makes me,\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nsends me a tweet that like makes me upset\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nor sad, it's like, I don't want to feel like\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nthat anymore. Oh wait, I don't have to.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nThat's my new rule. I don't get on Twitter for this.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nThat's what I tell people.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nAnd it really isn't personal.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nIt's just, it's a knee-jerk reaction.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nI didn't take it.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nBoo! Boo!\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nI didn't take it personally, but don't,\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\ndon't you think that's what isn't at a,\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nwell, maybe not at its best because that can get ugly\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nand maybe it did, but don't you think\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nthat's what social media should be?\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nI do not think Twitter is for\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\ndiscussions of any sort. No, I think it's a\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nterrible medium for discussing.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nI agree with that.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nFacebook,\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\ngreat for yelling at people.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nYeah, Twitter's\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nlike skyriding. You write it in the sky\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nand it blows away and it's like,\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nlet that be the end of it. Yeah, and if you\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nfeel differently, then you tweet differently.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nYou don't have to tell a guy he's wrong\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\non Twitter. Or you could.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nI mean, I'm not going to stop you.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nHe'll block your ass.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nLike, your name was...\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nBut isn't that a couple of steps better\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nthan just hashtag that awkward moment\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nand that kind of stuff? Wait, what?\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nWait, what? You know, like just, like,\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nI think it's at least creating some\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\ndiscussion, even if it was...\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nIt's just, it's not creating good\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\ndiscussion. It's creating very vitriolic,\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\ndisjointed, hard to follow\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\ndiscussion that probably drives people\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nagainst each other. But I really...\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nI really want to know what the fucking tweet was,\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nbecause I bet you a million dollars in your tweet\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nwas dickish.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nIt was, I mean, obviously... It was not\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nfucking... You were not George Poston going like,\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nno, did we consider this? He's wearing\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\na Celtic shirt. You know it was fucking dickish, man.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nHe didn't block you. I'm from Boston.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nHe didn't block you, because you were like,\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\noh, have you considered this or that you were...\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nI don't... I can't quote a verbatim,\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nbut I can pretty much tell you what it said.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nHe quoted the thing that's, you know, like he said,\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nhe's fully truthful. Martin Luther King\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nsaid, when nothing else\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nwrites all that's left, he'll have to do basically.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nThat's also not verbatim.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nBut... No, it's not. I've never claimed\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nit was. And then I said,\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nI'm not... Something like, I'm not\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nsure he would have really\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nsaid... Because the FBI\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nmurdered him. And then I said,\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nI'm not sure... You said, wait,\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nsorry, you said you're not sure that he would\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nhave... That's exactly\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nwhat he was saying. And then Spencer said,\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nfuck off, man, some other stuff.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nDid you say fuck off, man?\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nI might not... I don't know.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nAll right.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nMark, what's\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nyour Twitter handle so we can all follow you\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nand then block you the next day?\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nDo I... Do you really want me to\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\ndo... Do you have... You don't have to.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nI mean, I... Almost as a social experiment,\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nI'd like you to see what kind of tweets I get.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nSure, sure. It's totally up to you.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nIt's at not Penny's boat, but the\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nO's are zero.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nAt... It's a lost reference.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nIt's not... At Nerman's\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nboat, what? At not\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nnot Penny's boat.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nSo that's at n0t\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\np-e-n-n-\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\ny-s-b-0\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\na-t. Yep. Yeah, that's it.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nAll right.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nAll right. Well, thank you\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nand... Yeah.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nMark, everybody. Mark, thank you, sir.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nHe deserved it.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nAnd if he...\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nIf he makes sense to you,\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nyou could, like, petition Spencer.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nHey, man, I don't want ill will.
