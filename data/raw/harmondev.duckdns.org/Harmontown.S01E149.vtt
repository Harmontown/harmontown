00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
From the curiously named Hollywood Theater in Portland, Oregon,

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Harmontown, now in possession.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Would you please join me?

00:15.000 --> 00:40.000
Welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harp.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Thank you.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Thank you, Portland.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Wow, it's cavernous.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
This is cavernous.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
It's good, though.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Dan?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Could I ask you a personal question?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Have you been drinking today?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
A little bit.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
All right.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
All right.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I just want to get through the Evernote list.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
So a guy I met at a bar today.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
It was his 25th birthday.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
And I bought him a drink.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And he was turning 25.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So I said, man, you got to do all your shit.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
25.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm 42.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
It's a bunch of stuff.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Every day, I think I say, well, if I was 25, I'd do this or that.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So you got to do everything.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
And he said, yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
It's like, yeah, you got to go intertubing with sluts.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
That's what he said.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And I wrote it down.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
He said, I fucked that up.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
He said, intertubing with hot sluts.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
So he distinguishes those ugly sluts that you don't want to go intertubing with.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I thought Portland might enjoy that.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Do people still intertube here?

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Like, do you guys go to, do you guys do it with hot sluts?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Does that make it better?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
What's the river here?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Is it the chutes, right?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You got the chutes here?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Is it the Cooch River?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Willameth.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
But you guys have hot sluts here, but you don't.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
They're not more important than the regular sluts, are they?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
And they're not better at intertubing.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Right?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
I don't know.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Ask that kid.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Hot sluts.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Hot sluts.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Intertubing with hot sluts.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
All right.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
The last thing on my list.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
The last thing on my two-item list is, well, I mean, there's another, there's a side note,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
which is a Twitter corner.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Does Twitter corner have a theme?

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
Twitter corner.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
If you have something to say to me and you can fit it in a tweet, say it.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
If it takes nine tweets, say it somewhere else.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
That's it.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That's it.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
I thought that might resonate.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
No one wants that in their feed.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Like the guy with the parentheses, the eight out of nine guy.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
And first of all, feminism in the early 90s.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Buddy, it's Twitter.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
It's a bumper sticker.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Just say you like women.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You don't have to say it nine times.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Or write a blog.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
No one will read it.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
That's the point.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
So, I mean, just don't, I'm blocking everyone now.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I block, I block, I block.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
How many a day?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
How many, how many blocks?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I block, I block more people than healthy people eat kale.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I block, I block, I get up in the morning and I block.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I start blocking.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I just block.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
That's the end of that corner.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
All right.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So, a guy at the bar across the street.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
What was it?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The Queen Moon in six pence?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What's that place called?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
The Moon in six pence or something?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
There was a guy.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
So, obviously, because I'm doing a show here,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
some of you were drinking there tonight.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And a lot of you came up to me and were very friendly to me

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
and told me that you like me.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
And it was very wonderful.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
And I enjoy it.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
And I love your city.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
And I love you.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And there was a guy sitting next to me at the bar who, like,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
three hours ago, obviously, I've been drinking for six hours.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
And the guy the entire time was like, he was just this guy.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
And he kept going like, what do you do?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And it's like, I do a podcast.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
That's why they're saying these nice things to me.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
What's a podcast?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, it's a thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
And I have to explain it.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And he's like, so it's like radio?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
No, it's not.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I mean, yes, it's like radio.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Fine, done.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Forget it.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
All you have to do is stop talking to me.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
And your troubles will be over.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You don't have to.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
And he's like, so why are you famous, though?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And I'm like, I'm not famous.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm not.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
They're experiencing people coming up to me in this bar

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
two blocks from the venue.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
They're excited to see the show.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
They're getting a drink before they go and line up.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm not famous.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm as famous as you are, kind of.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Like if you, like wherever you work,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
if a lot of people worked there,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
and you were going to do karaoke,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
like that's what's happening.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, what's your name?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
My name is Dan Harmon.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
What do you spell it?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It's fucking, god damn it.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
What the fuck?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm not allowed to do this to other people.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
H-A-R-M-O-N.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Well, I'm going to ask my son.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
My son's in college.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Would my son hear of you?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I bet your fucking ass he has, motherfucker.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Because I made an awesome...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
That's how good I am at karaoke.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Your son.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, I crossed the line there.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I was like, I bet your son has.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
But then it was three hours later, the guy's like,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
well, I asked my son and he said,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I Googled him and I never heard of him.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Fuck you.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't know why I'm telling this story,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
but I just, I was like,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I didn't never knew I wanted to be famous

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
until I talked to this guy.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
It wasn't even a thing in my mind.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
The guy wants to be, clearly he wants to be famous,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
or his son does.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I don't know.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm just saying.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Like, I was fine until I talked to that guy.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
I found the first dickhead in Portland is my story.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I love Portland.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
It's so fun here.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
We have to fly out.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Fuck Portland.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Fuck this city!

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Let's burn this shit whole down!

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Fuck Portland!

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Let's hold and not get face tattoos.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
There's a lot of face tattoos here.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Hey, hey, Portland,

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
you guys have all seen Human Centipede 3, right?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I did.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
I watched it.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Wait, there's a 3?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, there's a 3.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
What happens in 3?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
In the third one.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
This was on my list of shit to talk about.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay, so Human Centipede 3.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
How many people have seen Human Centipede 1?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I got some.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Is that a good 15% of the people here?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, that was the 8%.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
How many people have seen Human Centipede 1 and 2?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Just as a side note,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
how many people have seen Human Centipede 2,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
but not Human Centipede 1?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It just jumped to the middle of the saga.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, no hands, no hands.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
So clearly there's a linear appeal.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
It's like Game of Thrones.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Number 2 really is the Empire Strikes Back of the Horses.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, you don't want to,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
you don't just jump in the middle.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay, we know that.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
That's important for the research.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Human Centipede 3, anybody see it?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay, a couple, one hand, one hand.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
The guy from the first movie,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
the guy from the first movie

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
is a prison warden in the third movie.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
And every movie adds more people.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Like, there's three people in the first one.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
There's like 24 people, I think, in the second one.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And then this one's like a prison.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It's like 500 people.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
So the guy from the first movie is a warden.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
He's a prison warden, Jeff.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
And he doesn't know how to run his prison.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
So what does he do?

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Does he try to seek some solution to his prison problems?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
He has this accountant who keeps telling him,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
like, I'm telling you,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
and the accountant keeps showing him the first...

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
We're feeding them too much and there's too much poop.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
He keeps showing them the first two human centipedes.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
We have to cut down on the food and the poop wastes.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
The five people who raised their hands

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
know that the human centipede saga

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
has a weird meta thing going through it,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
where in each movie,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
each movie is about someone who's watched the previous movie.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
So the third movie is about a prison warden

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
who is being told by his accountant

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
who has seen both of the previous movies

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
that this is the way to go.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And the prison warden is played by the same guy

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
that played the doctor in the first movie,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
the guy who's like, yes, poop your diarrhea

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
in the mouth behind you.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Yes, I'm a doctor.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I love watching people poop into each other.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
That guy's a Texas warden in the third movie,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
and his accountant says, and I wrote it down,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
this is the defining moment,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
45 minutes into human centipede three.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
This is after we've watched the doctor try to castrate people,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
and he tries everything he can think of to be a good warden,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
and the accountant keeps going,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
like, I'm telling you,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
and he keeps holding up the human centipede movies,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
and the warden keeps going, that's stupid,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
and you're supposed to be like, this movie is so self-aware.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
45 minutes into it,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
but it's not self-aware enough to not exist,

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
which would be a truly, like, that would be a move on its part.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It would be like, oh, I understand,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
this movie shouldn't exist,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
but instead, the accountant, so I wrote this down,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
the accountant gets very frustrated, Jeff.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
He loses his cool at 45 minutes.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
45 minutes of castration and rape and horrible,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
like, just terrible, like, Eli Roth, like, shit.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Were mid-second acts or late-second acts here?

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, I mean, let's be serious.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Structure eludes the human centipede.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
What would Joseph Campbell call this scene?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I think Joseph Campbell would say,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
like the people in the movie,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
like, human centipede movies themselves,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
like, experiment with what defines a movie.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Like, the whole point of the movie is,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
oh, could you poop into a mouth?

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
And I don't think a story even...

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
How many people are pooping into how many mouths

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
in the third one?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Like, I told you, 500.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
500 people?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
It's a prison full of people.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But it seems like, wouldn't the food,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
as the body digests whatever food comes through it,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
it would get less and less...

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
No, there's this focus in the movie

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
about how medically accurate it is.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Like, and I can't tell...

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I can't tell if the director is, like, for real or not.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I can't tell...

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Everything's very tongue-in-cheek,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
but the tongue is, like, poking through the cheek

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
and there's, like, a butt hole where the tongue is

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
in the cheek.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Like, I don't know...

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I don't know what...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know if the guy's, like...

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
The movie is nothing if not tongue-in-cheek.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
It's all about being tongue-in-cheek.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
So, I have no idea.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
So I've watched all three of them.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
And at one point in the third movie,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
the accountant at the prison,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
he gets so fed up.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
45 minutes into the hour...

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I think it's a 90-minute movie.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Halfway through the movie.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Putting this on a structural levels

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
of the first Hulk movie,

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
where the Hulk appears, like, in the third act.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
This guy, the accountant, like, goes, like...

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And he just throws, like, a Ned Beatty in network fit.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Like, he does a little monologue.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
And he goes...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
And I wrote it down.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I backed it up and I transcribed his monologue.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And he says...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
By the way, the accountant is the guy

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
from Human Centipede 2.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
For those eight people who watched the second one,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
the guy in the black-and-white Human Centipede 2,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
which is the more pulpy, noirish one,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
he plays the accountant.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
So, and he goes...

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
I have been trying to tell you for days now.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
I have the answer to all our problems.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
We've got to make a Human Centipede of our prisoners.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Sone ass to mouth.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Sharing one digestive system.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
No more prison fights.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
No more assaults on guards.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
No more disrespect.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
They will literally be on their knees,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
begging you for mercy.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And it's the ultimate deterrent

13:51.000 --> 13:58.000
for those considering a career in crime.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
That should be the crawl at the beginning of the movie.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
That should be the voiceover during the trailer.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I hadn't shared that before, right?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
What's that?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Okay.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I don't know.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
The show's an alcoholic.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
I don't know.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I like your new glasses, Dad.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
That's it.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I got nothing.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
From now on, we're free-wheeling.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I got glasses.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
My eyeballs are not perfectly round.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Big deal.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
So, they told me...

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
For those not watching,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Dan can't lift the mic higher in the mic stand.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, it's tight and I couldn't loosen it.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
So, my eyeballs aren't perfectly round.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
So, when I look far away,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
like when I look at these people who came to the show late,

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
I can't see, I guess, a pixel perfect.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I have a one-pixel blur on everything far away.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
So, that's what these glasses are for.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
You look good, though.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That's why I'm wearing them.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's not because it improves anything.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I told you earlier, I said,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
this Dan, the bespectacled Dan,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
is the Dan that will write movies.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I've started to notice that people are treating me different.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
And so, I'm now trapped in these glasses

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
that actually make it very hard to function,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
like, within eight feet.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Like, I'm, like, tripping over things,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
but I'm like, everyone likes me now.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
And I'm not kidding.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
It's not a joke.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I can see, okay, oh, look at that speaker.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
It's black.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
But the real thing is that bartenders are nice to me now.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
That's it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It's like a disguise.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm thinking, like, maybe I should...

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't know.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't need glasses.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I have 20-20 vision.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
All right.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
So, I want to...

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
What I would like to do is...

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
I'd like to do a little experiment.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I'd like to take off all my clothes...

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
and show you my dick.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
And I'd like to ask you

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
if it's big.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And I'd like you to lie to me.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I'd like you to say it's big.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And the reason I want you to do that

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
is because I think it's small.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
And I don't want to live in that world.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
So it's not so much an experiment,

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
as it is just sort of an exercise in my dishonesty.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm ashamed of my tiny penis.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Would you say tiny?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Is it freak show tiny or is it just regular...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Well, define freak show tiny.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I don't know.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
We live in a world where nobody knows about each other's dicks.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Like, we don't know what's going on.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
We've created a whole mythology.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I don't know.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
We watch movies about guys with giant monster dicks.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Are those regular-sized dicks?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah, see?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I mean...

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
What are those?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Are they giant dicks?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Are those regular-sized dicks?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
No, thank you.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I don't know.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
And women are also kind of pseudo-conditioned

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
to like, they know how fucked up we are about it,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
so they're also not honest about it.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
They're like, they know that they're not supposed to say

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
whether they know if a dick is small or not.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Admit it, right?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You guys learned that early on in your life.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Like, eight years old, you learned to lie about dicks.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
And men are also like, lie about my dick.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
None of us in this room know what a dick is supposed to look like.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
There's no...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Who here thinks they have a regular dick?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Raise your hand if you have a regular dick.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
There's two guys sitting right next to each other.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Two guys.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Two really well-dressed gentlemen.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Both very...

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Your brothers.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Your brothers?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Are you guys twins?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Oh, okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Wait, get on stage.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Two brothers with regular dicks.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Regular dick brothers.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Regular dick brothers.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
You always gotta add if you want to.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Grab water for two mikes, depending on...

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I don't want anybody to ever say,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
well, I was forced up on stage.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
All right, so we're gonna talk about my dick.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
First off, what are your names?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Joe.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Joe and?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Ian.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Joe and Ian.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And you guys are very...

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
You both have nice brown shoes on.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
You're both well-dressed.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
You're both brothers.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
What's the age difference between you guys?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Seven years.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I'm the older.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
You're the older.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
You're the older.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And you guys, when Dan said,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
who thinks they have a regular dick?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
As one, both of your hands went up.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
As though he asked, what's two plus two?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
So what...

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Let's talk about all of that.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Okay.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
I reckon about six and a half inches is average.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And about the...

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
All right.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
And about...

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Let me explain the girth to...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Woman, as we said, no, get up on stage.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Get up on stage.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I'm estimating the girth to be about...

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Fair Joe and Ian.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
No, lady, come up here.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Because otherwise, we'd either come up or be quiet.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
You can't do that.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
These guys are heroes.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Seven on a good day when I'm well-hydrated.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
And about the girth of a roll of silver dollars.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Wait, what?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Silver dollars with Kennedys.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
What?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Kennedy dollars.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
The girth on average.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Wait, what?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
A roll of silver dollars.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
A roll of silver dollars?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
And a roll of coins.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
How many...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
How many...

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
How many...

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I'm estimating there's about...

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
The diameter is a silver dollar.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Correct.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, diameter.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
A Susan B. Anthony penis.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
No.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
No, no, no.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Susan B. Anthony.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
You're thinking of quarters.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
What?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Those are quarters.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
How many...

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
How many silver...

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
How many...

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
What do you reckon?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
What do you reckon the roll of silver dollars is about 50 of them in there?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Pardon?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Oh, no.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
50 dollars in the roll of silver dollars?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
You guys know you have huge dicks.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That's why you raised your hand.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I estimate average.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
They're saying six and a half.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I wouldn't call that a huge dick.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
They're saying...

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
They're calling that median.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
And a woman in the back...

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
And a diameter of a silver dollar.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
A woman back there said nip.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
She instantly said no dice.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
A diameter of a silver dollar.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Her barometer is off.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I'm just gonna guess.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Oh, well, she's not...

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
She needs recalibration.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
You guys are...

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
You guys have her respect because you're up here, so...

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
No, okay.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I have three million questions.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm gonna start with...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm gonna pick one at random.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Do you guys know what each other's dick looks like?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
No.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
No, not adult.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
No.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
But you guys both raised...

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
You guys both raised your hands and didn't even look at the other guy.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You guys both knew that we were...

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
We were brothers.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
We got the same dick.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Genetic confidence.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, they didn't...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I mean, I'll jump in and say...

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
All right, please.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
We have a pretty similar mindset.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I think that you influenced me growing up.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Both of you...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh, Christ.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
By applause.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
You're Ian?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm Joe.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
You're Joe. That's Ian.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
That's right.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
By applause.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Who thinks Ian has the bigger dick of the two?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I just got a text message, I think.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
That's not important.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, by applause, who thinks Ian has the bigger dick?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
That's...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Wow.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
All right, well...

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
I guess I'm fine.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Joe, are they right?

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
You said Ian twice, which doesn't help.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
Right now, he probably does.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
So are you guys right now, or are either of you, like, hard?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
No.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
No.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Because I'm just...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I don't know.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, so how do you...

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
All right.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
We've got a lot to talk about today.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I would just say...

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Look at body language.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
This guy's sitting with legs wide open.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Ian over there got his legs crossed.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah, definitely.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Well...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
They're leaning in pants.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Something to hide, or he's afraid of showing how big that fucking dick is with those fucking...

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
with that tan suit on.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
All right.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
So I just want to get back to this metric thing.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
The diameter of a silver dollar that's upsetting to me.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And tell me about the length.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
The length.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Six, six and a half.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
What does that mean?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Six and a half silver dollars?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
No, no, no.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Inches.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Inches.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Well, I don't know what that...

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
What is that?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Half a foot.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
What is that?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I mean...

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
It's just over half a foot, dad.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I just...

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
I want to go call Aaron and apologize.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
I don't think I have a very big penis.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
All right, then.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I think she puts up with a lot.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
No.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Well, don't say it like that.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I mean, just...

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
If I'm telling you that my dick is small, it's small, what you should say is it doesn't matter.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
It doesn't matter.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
You shouldn't say it right after I tell you to say it.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
You should figure out how to convince me of it.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
So you guys are brothers and you've never looked at each other's dicks.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
The audience thinks that the brother who talks the last and keeps his legs open has a bigger dick.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
That's easy to understand.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
I didn't realize that's where we landed on that, but all right.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
It's...

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Is there...

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
You're not gonna...

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You guys won't show us your dicks, will you?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
We could make podcast history tonight.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I mean, like, that's not...

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Am I allowed to ask?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
You're probably...

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm not saying you have to do it.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
I think the state of Oregon might have something to say about that.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
But I feel like we have a private podcast network.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
We're streaming.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
I think Aaron's a lucky woman no matter what.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Thank you.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Nigel, thank you.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Someone just...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
You'll change the subject.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Joe and Ian, everybody. Joe and Ian, thank you so much for coming out, fellas.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Thank you, guys.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
That's been Dick Chalk with Joe and Ian.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Look at this.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Those guys are...

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
That's a spin-off.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Those guys are...

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
There's something weird going on.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I wanted to believe they're not actually brothers.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I think they're, like, time travelers or...

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
That's weird.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
They drink at the same time.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I think they're, like, maybe a local morning radio show.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Oh, yeah.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Like Mike and Amy.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
What's the deal with Mike and Amy?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Oh, yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
They're all over town.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Anyways, you guys don't want to see my dick, do you?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, you do.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I think you owe it to them, dad.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Ridiculous.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
Like, terrible, terrible, terrible society.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Have some respect.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
I think we should early on bring up Spencer Crittenden,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
because he's, uh...

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Oh, yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:38.000
Super Adventure Brothers.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
God Adventure.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Okay, I'm sorry.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
So, that human centipede movie...

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
They don't have any human centipedes

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
that are, like, a full circuit, do they?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
No. No, they never...

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
See, that's the third fucking movie, right?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
The first human centipede, then giant human centipede,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
then fucking human centipede

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
that's rolling all over Manhattan.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Connect it, yeah.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah, it's, you know, it's efficient.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You can move in a circle.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
You just have to ab exercises.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
You'll be rolling up and down the city,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
no crawling around.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It's all communication.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
That's what I'd do.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
If I had a human centipede.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
But I told you guys this...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I'd name it Terry.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Did I talk about a human centipede or any...

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yes?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
On the last...

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
No, just today, just earlier today.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, no, no.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Oh, tonight, yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm not that fucked up.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Whoa.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Damn.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I meant a week ago.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
That scared the shit out of me.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I was like, I did, didn't I?

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
So, I didn't tell you guys, like,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
when they, so Eric Roberts plays the governor

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
in the third one.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Eric Roberts, which makes him either

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
the most interesting actor in the world

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
or obviously in a lot of tax problems.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
Like, and he's, he, he, he comes at the...

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I don't want to spoil anything, but...

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I think it's fine.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
But it turns out a bunch of people

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
get sown ass to mouth in a chain.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
And Eric Roberts comes to the prison

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
and he's the governor and he wants to

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
know what they've done to solve their problems.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
And the guy shows him and he makes this speech,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
the doctor, and the warden says,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
and he goes, yes, feed, feed!

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And then I wrote this monologue down

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
and he goes, and so Eric Roberts,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
since he's gotten to the prison,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
has not said a word at all.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Okay.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
And he's just, he's just walked in

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
and it's just Eric Roberts walking

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
and watching as this guy gives him

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
a tour of 500 people sown ass to mouth.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
And then...

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
How are those stored exactly?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Is it like zigzag back and forth?

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, it's a, it's a Photoshop, like, of guys.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So they're like looking through a window

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
or something?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, it's like a noodle of guys, yeah.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
It's a prison yard, it's clearly Photoshopped and it's lame.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
So he walks along the chain of them

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
and he goes, yes, feed!

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
A Jew behind a Muslim!

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
A Muslim behind a Jew!

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
A Republican behind a Mexican!

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Whoa!

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Arizona?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
A Crip behind a blood!

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
He never, he never counters the Mexican and the Republican.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Peace on Earth!

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Goodwill to men!

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
And then Eric Roberts says his first line, which is,

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
This is too much.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
This is, this is too much,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
says Governor Eric Roberts.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
This really is the living end.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
This is too much.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
Anyways, that's, I thought it was a charming film.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
I think it's, I'm surprised that you curled up in bed

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and watched him in Centipede 3.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Aaron was out of town and I, like, I don't know,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I just, I like watching horror movies when she's out of town

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
and I've always wondered if you could eat diarrhea.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
And if you did, could you poop it into another person's mouth?

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
And if that person could poop it into another person's mouth?

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
And if that could, could, could happen for 497 other people?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
And what would happen to the 497th person?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Oh, so what happens in the movie?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Like, what happens to those 500?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
They don't address it.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
They don't address the one thing that you're wondering about,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
which is, could this actually happen?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
No, I'm not wondering that.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
Well, I just, he shows the 500 man Centipede

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
and then where does he go from there?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
They try to escape or what?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
No, no.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
So, yeah, so he goes home and makes toast or what, what happens?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
The protagonist is the prison warden.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah, so what does he do from then on?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Or is that the end?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
That's, Eric Roberts looks at it.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Are you guys cool with me spoiling the movie?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
It's human Centipede.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Eric Roberts looks at it and goes, this is too much.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
And then he says something like, God damn.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
That's, and then he leaves.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
And that's, the prison warden, like,

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
shoots the doctor that helped him do it.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Eric Roberts comes back and goes, you know what?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
This is the best.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
So it's like a Twilight Zone moment with the broken glasses?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Yeah, it's like an O'Henry novel, but with no stakes.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Yeah, like that, because the guy's like,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
because Eric Roberts doesn't come back and go,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
you know what, this is the best.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
What, you shot the doctor.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It doesn't, it doesn't.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Are they trying to rehabilitate the prisoners in any way?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Yes.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Does number 118 eat enough poop or go,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm ready to go straight?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Oh, oh, there's another part to it,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
which is that the, there's,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
what do you do with the death row people

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and the life sentence people?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
And he made a human, what does he call it?

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Human caterpillar, which means he cuts off their arms and legs.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
So there's just like, that's just an extra thing.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
And I'm going to shock you guys and tell you

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
it's worth watching this movie,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
because I don't, I think they are,

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
they're in the, you know, labs right now,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
smashing particles together,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
because they want to know what happens

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
when you do something terrible, you know,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
like we learned about how the universe works,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
because you smash two atoms together and it goes,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
and they go like, oh, what's that?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
It's a quark, it's a sub-boson.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
If you're not, if you're,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
what are you going to watch Robert Zemeckis movies

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
your whole life?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
You're not going to learn what life is.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
You watch Human Centipede.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
I think you, you gain some insight into like,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I don't know.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
It's not a popular opinion, but

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I think it's an important film.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Is it a closed circuit?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
The movie?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
No, it's on Netflix and,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
oh, Jeff.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
No, I mean, didn't you say earlier

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
that there's a ring of people all going in a thing?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
No, yeah, there's no, there's a final guy

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
and he poops, but they never show that part.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
There's a front guy that eats?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
They never show that part.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
They don't show, is that guy's poop extra poopy?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
There's no way, there's no way,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
no matter how much you fed the first prisoner

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
that is going to make that food,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
it will make it to the 500th guy.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I'm saying the same thing you're saying, yeah.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I feel like the movie is like,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I actually felt in the third one,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I felt like you could feel

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
like the director's heart wasn't in it.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Like he was just doing it for the fans.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
It was season six community kind of like.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
It's funny because it's true.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
They loved it.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I guess.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Thanks guys, thanks.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Did you feel like I sewed the ass of community

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
to its own mouth enough

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
until the show was eating poop

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
and you could let it go?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
All right, so, all right,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
so here's the thing about tonight's show.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Terrible.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Got nothing, nothing to do,

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
but from terrible shows,

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
come terrible pizza.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
No.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Okay.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Wishful thinking.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Can we bum people out

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
and tell them who didn't appear on the show tonight?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Well, we were going to have kid and play,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
but they, I think,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
yeah, I know.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
We were going to have kid and play.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I'm pretty sure.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I feel like play hates kid.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I really do.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I really do.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I wasn't there.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And I was, like, actually kind of relieved

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
that they didn't show up

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
because the tension is unbearable.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I feel like play hates kid.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Play hates kid.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It really does.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
That's the God's honest truth.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's not, it sounds like a joke you'd make.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Do you feel like if kid and or play were out here right now,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
that you could hold your own in a rap battle

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
with either kid or play?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Well, I feel like

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
if you played a rap beat

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
for me right now,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I could beat them in a rap battle

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
because they're not here.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I don't know.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
They'll never know.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Should we find out if maybe there's a local freestyle

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
here that wants to come up in the...

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
No, no.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I mean, you seem pretty confident right now

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
that you have the goods.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Just let me lay down a baseline.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
But you don't want to know if anyone out here...

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Just let me rap.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Party beat beat or do you want something else?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Party beat?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I call it the party beat.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Family.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Family.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Alright, let's see what the fuck is it.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Pardon me.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Alright.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
There's these...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
You rock.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Rock.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Rock.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Rock.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Rock.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
When you go to sleep

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
at night you see

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Beep beep.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Toot toot.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Be standing over your bed

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
with a bee.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Toot toot.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Toot.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Family.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I'm standing over in your bed

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
holding a bee.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
I'm staring at you.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Let's hear some rap now.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Let's hear some rap.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Yo.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Yo, going to your house.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Gonna fuck your mom with a mouse.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Gonna use it as my dick.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Four legs, but it's a stick.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
It's a mammal too.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Mama, what you gonna do

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
doing on your living room floor in your kitchen?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Fuck your mama.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm gonna do your dishes afterwards.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Gonna fuck your mama with my turds.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
And do my hand.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Shove it up a pussy.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
That's terrible.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I'm sorry.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
That's terrible.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Didn't mean to say that.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
My name is MC John.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I'm gonna...

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Please hold your applause for the end.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Sorry.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I know you get excited.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
My name's MC John,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
but just take it easy for a second.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Hold on.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
My name is MC John.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm gonna mow your lawn.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Fuck your mama.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Fuck your daddy.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Fuck your golf caddy.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Toot toot.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Beep beep.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Fuck your mama on the street.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Fuck your mama like her name was.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Favorite Emmy.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Fuck your mama.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Oh, shit.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Why am I facing this way?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I had my eyes closed the whole time.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I wrapped so hard

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
that I ended up looking

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
45 degrees that way.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I think you might have beaten kid,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
but not play.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Yeah, one of those guys sucks.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
You know it.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
All right.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Let's meet some people tonight.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Oh, Jesus.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I'm sorry.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I got so drunk, you guys.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Who's a terrible person?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Who's the worst person ever?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That guy's hands one up first.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
It's like a 45 hands one up.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Well, everybody feels like they're a bad person.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Oh, yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I'd just like to say anytime

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
anyone blocks anyone on Twitter,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
that person deserved it.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I'm sorry.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
All these people, why'd you block me?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I don't know. I'm sure you deserved it.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Well, let's hear his story.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Do you want to come up? Let's work it out.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Let's hear it.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
This guy's been blocked by Spencer on Twitter.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Yo, he's blocked by Spencer.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Oh, fuck, fuck.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
He can't read my tweet.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Just Spencer. What's your name, sir?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Uh, Mark.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Pardon? Mark. Mark, hello, Mark.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Oh, this guy.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
No, I don't know.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
It was brief. He doesn't actually remember me.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
What did you tweet?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
It was during the, uh,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
the Ferguson riots.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah, I get worked up over those.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
No, neither of us are racist at all.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
That's why I kind of feel bad about it,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
because we're kind of on the same side,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
but, uh,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
he tweeted some Martin Luther King

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
quote that made it sound like

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
he would have loved the riots

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
and I disagreed and we got a little argument

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
and then he was, I didn't even realize

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
he blocked me until like months later, actually,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
and I tried to tweet at him.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
That's how I do it. I don't do it right away.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
You think everything's cool

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and then fuck.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
He might not, he might not even have done it that night.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
He might have just, I don't know if he was just

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
thinking about it for a while or what, but

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
at some point he went back.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
It feels like a particular tragedy because

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
you guys both love Martin Luther King.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
You know, I don't think it's a tragedy.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I just think it's life, man.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
He's been hurt in and out.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Sometimes he catch a wave, sometimes he catch,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
not the beach.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I just think

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
that life is, okay.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I don't know.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
So, uh, I don't, that sounds vaguely familiar.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Here's the thing about Martin Luther King.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
He says that people, you know,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
riots aren't great, but people only

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
do it when literally nothing else

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
has worked thus far.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I think it's pretty valid.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Also, I think that, uh,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
we shouldn't be talking about

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
what Martin Luther King meant

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
if it's not in the support of black people.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Like maybe he said stuff

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
that wouldn't support black people in their struggles,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
but I'll wait for a black guy to say that,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
and that might be racist. I'll admit it.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I guess it's not.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Spencer's admitting he's racist.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
What do you have to say?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I actually, I agree with that.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Well, the second point's kind of weird

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
because he's the one quoting him,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
but the first point I agree with,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
we weren't able to

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
to talk about it further.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
And you know what? I think that's fine.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I'm fine with the outcome. No offense.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Because you got black, so the

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
discussion had to cease.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
You must have said something fucked up.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Will you accept my apology, Spencer?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
What's up? Will you accept my apology?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Oh, yeah. No, it's not like I'm like super upset.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
It's just when I block someone, I'm like,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
am I going to lose by not

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
having to see this guy's tweets anymore?

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And you know, that's a very high bar.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It honestly is.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I mean, Dan might pass that bar,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
but very few people. And Dan's a great

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
tweeter. He's great on Twitter.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
But yeah, it's just that.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It's like if someone makes me,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
sends me a tweet that like makes me upset

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
or sad, it's like, I don't want to feel like

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
that anymore. Oh wait, I don't have to.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
That's my new rule. I don't get on Twitter for this.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That's what I tell people.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And it really isn't personal.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
It's just, it's a knee-jerk reaction.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I didn't take it.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Boo! Boo!

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
No, no, no, no.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I didn't take it personally, but don't,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
don't you think that's what isn't at a,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
well, maybe not at its best because that can get ugly

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
and maybe it did, but don't you think

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
that's what social media should be?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I do not think Twitter is for

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
discussions of any sort. No, I think it's a

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
terrible medium for discussing.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I agree with that.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Facebook,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
great for yelling at people.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Yeah, Twitter's

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
like skyriding. You write it in the sky

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
and it blows away and it's like,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
let that be the end of it. Yeah, and if you

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
feel differently, then you tweet differently.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You don't have to tell a guy he's wrong

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
on Twitter. Or you could.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I mean, I'm not going to stop you.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
He'll block your ass.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Like, your name was...

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
But isn't that a couple of steps better

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
than just hashtag that awkward moment

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
and that kind of stuff? Wait, what?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Wait, what? You know, like just, like,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I think it's at least creating some

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
discussion, even if it was...

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
It's just, it's not creating good

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
discussion. It's creating very vitriolic,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
disjointed, hard to follow

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
discussion that probably drives people

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
against each other. But I really...

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I really want to know what the fucking tweet was,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
because I bet you a million dollars in your tweet

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
was dickish.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
It was, I mean, obviously... It was not

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
fucking... You were not George Poston going like,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
no, did we consider this? He's wearing

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
a Celtic shirt. You know it was fucking dickish, man.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
He didn't block you. I'm from Boston.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
He didn't block you, because you were like,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
oh, have you considered this or that you were...

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I don't... I can't quote a verbatim,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
but I can pretty much tell you what it said.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
He quoted the thing that's, you know, like he said,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
he's fully truthful. Martin Luther King

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
said, when nothing else

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
writes all that's left, he'll have to do basically.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
That's also not verbatim.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
But... No, it's not. I've never claimed

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
it was. And then I said,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm not... Something like, I'm not

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
sure he would have really

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
said... Because the FBI

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
murdered him. And then I said,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I'm not sure... You said, wait,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
sorry, you said you're not sure that he would

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
have... That's exactly

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
what he was saying. And then Spencer said,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
fuck off, man, some other stuff.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Did you say fuck off, man?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I might not... I don't know.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
All right.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Mark, what's

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
your Twitter handle so we can all follow you

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
and then block you the next day?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Do I... Do you really want me to

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
do... Do you have... You don't have to.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I mean, I... Almost as a social experiment,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I'd like you to see what kind of tweets I get.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Sure, sure. It's totally up to you.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
It's at not Penny's boat, but the

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
O's are zero.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
At... It's a lost reference.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
It's not... At Nerman's

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
boat, what? At not

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
not Penny's boat.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
So that's at n0t

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
p-e-n-n-

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
y-s-b-0

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
a-t. Yep. Yeah, that's it.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
All right.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
All right. Well, thank you

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
and... Yeah.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Mark, everybody. Mark, thank you, sir.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
He deserved it.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
And if he...

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
If he makes sense to you,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
you could, like, petition Spencer.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Hey, man, I don't want ill will. Like I said,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I'd block people on Twitter just because I don't

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
want to feel bad. Yeah.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
That's me. Yeah. You're like me.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah. Devin Faracci, you know, he gets a lot

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
of Twitter hate. He was yelling,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
oh, you think that blocking people

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
who shoot abuse at you

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
is creating an echo chamber?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Why don't I come and stop

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
your house from being an echo chamber by

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
calling your kids pieces of shit every

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
single second of the day? Yeah.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It's valid.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Why does anybody on Twitter

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
get on Twitter?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
For me?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
So does everyone... Is Twitter, like...

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Pug pictures.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Is part of the slogan of Twitter,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
confront your...

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Good front-year hero.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Confront your hypocrisy. Get on Twitter.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
That's why everyone's on Twitter, right?

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Because it's a big opportunity to be told

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
you're a piece of shit, right?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
That's why everyone with 130

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
followers gets on Twitter, because they

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
love hearing that they're a big, giant piece

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
of shit every day. And just to be clear,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
that's not this guy's crime. He was much more reasonable.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
No, I'm sure. Yeah, I know.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I find that Twitter is the perfect

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
place to tell me

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
that they don't like what I'm doing with

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Teen Wolf on MTV.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Is there anybody...

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
This is an interesting segment. Is there anybody

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
here in Portland that...

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Have I blocked anybody that,

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I don't know, felt

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
unfairly blocked or...

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Okay, good. That's nice. It's Portland, see?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
They're all cool.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Say what?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I've blocked people who try to tell me that

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
they're from Asia.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
You've blocked people

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
who try to tell you that

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Hitler was an atheist. Why do people keep

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
telling you that?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Do you

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
run some kind of Hitler museum?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
No, I'm telling you.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
What sort of God-fearing man?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
What sort of garden have you

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
killed that makes that flower grow?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Also, that was

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
such a sticking point for you that you yelled it out

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
in an almost totally unrelated context.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
We're like, speaking of the Internet,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
which

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
is fine. You're fine.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
We should all

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
block people who try to convince us that

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Hitler was an atheist.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Because that seems like a terrible waste of time.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
You should never try to convince anybody that Hitler was anything.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
He was into the occult

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
and all sorts of weird shit, right?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Wait, so are you...

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Are you saying that Hitler's an atheist?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
No, no, he's saying Hitler's not.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Sounds like what you're saying, bro.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
That's what he's saying, though, right?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Sounds like what you're saying, man.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
He thinks he protests too much about Hitler's atheism.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
No, obviously, Hitler was a Catholic, right?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Yeah, like all of us.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
He was Church of England all the way, man.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Church of England?

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
He was COE all the way.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Also, Hitler didn't drink,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
but there's a picture of him with a frenet bronca

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
in front of him.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
He drank a frenet bronca before every speech,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
apparently, to settle his nerves.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
So, you know, he also drank.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Didn't he do coke?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I always imagine him doing coke before those speeches.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Hitler used to do coke

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
off Rommel's tits

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
before every speech.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
All right, speaking of Hitler,

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
is...

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Hey, Malcolm, are you out there?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Where are you, Malcolm? Is that you?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
He's there.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Would you be willing to come up here

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
and be made a little bit of fun of?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
All right, Malcolm, come up here.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The crowd says, yes.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
This is Malcolm.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Malcolm is 11 years old.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Malcolm was...

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Here, grab one of these microphones.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Malcolm, you're 11?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Well, no, I'm being facetious.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Malcolm is a star child

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
who was put in charge of me.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
You're like an intern

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
or a volunteer that works for the festival?

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
No.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Okay.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I already like Malcolm.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
First of all,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
as I keep telling you, calm down.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
So, okay,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
you're not a volunteer for the festival?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Well, I offered to be a volunteer

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
and I showed up and was asked to,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
if you need anything,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
get you that thing.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Is this Mike on or is he being that subtle?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
No, he's not doing a bit.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
This is why I bring him up.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
He's holding the mic far away.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Your parents...

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It's not on the directional.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Conceived.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
It's a callback to last week.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Your parents were both on Xanax

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
when you were conceived.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
It's my theory.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
He's inflappable.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
He's like Rico Kasich

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
with other pizzazz.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
You don't have...

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Malcolm, I've not met you.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I have no horse in this race.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I didn't hear what you said,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
but you said it very softly.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
You offered to be a volunteer,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
but then what happened?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I showed up as a

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
maybe volunteer

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
and they asked me to,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
if you need anything,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
get you that thing.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I still have no idea

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
what's going on.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
They asked you to be a volunteer

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
and then...

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Are you mad?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Or happy right now?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Do you know what those words mean?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Dan, how did you guys meet?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
What's your origin story with Malcolm?

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
This is it.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I wanted to share. This is interesting.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
How did you first...

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You've been told you're interesting, right?

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Like...

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
You're not...

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
You don't feel bullied right now, right?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
That would not be the thing I would want to do.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
You can't be so...

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
You feel celebrated because that is what I want to do.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I think we're all on Malcolm's side right now.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Yes. He's the hero.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We all want to know

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
what is happening in your bloodstream.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
How do we get this way?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Hemoglobin.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Hemoglobin.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
It's true.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I think he doesn't have adrenaline.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Oh, sorry.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
You don't have adrenaline. That's the working theory.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
You don't have an adrenaline gland.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
See?

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Since you were a good sport

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
and came up here and were exploited,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
is there a...

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
But I almost hesitate to ask this

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
because I feel like it's going to backfire.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Is there an ambition that you have?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Nope.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Where do you see yourself in five years?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
What do you think he's going to say?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I want to be a veterinarian.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I love animals.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Where did you guys first meet?

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
He was assigned to me by the festival.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
In what capacity?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Anything you need, Malcolm will get it.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Right?

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
You're an adult and you haven't needed anything.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I haven't really needed a lot.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You got this.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Right. A little bit of Kettle One.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I know how that is.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Malcolm, how old are you if we may ask?

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Twenty-two.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
That's the best answer you could have said.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Malcolm,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
what's the thing

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
that gets you out of bed in the morning

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
and puts you to sleep at night?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Do you have an overwriting passion like music

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
or literature

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
or a certain love of your life of any sort?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Are you this self-contained at all times?

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I guess I'm just not ready to die yet.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Was that an answer to the question?

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
It's an important thing to say.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
No question.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I'm not ready to die yet.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Malcolm, is that your way of saying that you're afraid to die?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Oh, yes.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Oh, that's great.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
You do have fear.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Okay, Malcolm, let me follow up on that.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Is there something that you're afraid

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
before you die that you didn't do

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
or didn't see or accomplish or experience?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
No.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Is there a specific way you're afraid to die?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Would you rather burn to death or drown?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Drown.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Yeah.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Why?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I feel like the point of losing consciousness

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
would occur sooner.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Malcolm, are you in a band?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Because if not, you need to be in a fucking band.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And also, I want to be in that band.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
What's the band?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Do you play anything?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Are you musical at all?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
No.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
If you could play an instrument,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
what would you pick?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It's a piano.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Why would you say it like that?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Are you a Bill Hader character?

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Is there any truth, sir,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
to the allegations that you are in fact a Bill Hader character?

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
You seem like...

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
All right.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So you're 22.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
You're not ready to die

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
because you're afraid to die,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
but not because you would regret

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
not having done something.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
But you want to live.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
You want to be.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
You want to exist.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I guess I'll go do a thing.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Is there anything that makes you laugh out loud?

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Do you have any point in the day

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
or the week or the month

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
like Belly laughs at anything?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
What makes you laugh?

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Anything in particular or just the random things?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
All right. Cool. Mo for me.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
See, this is what I've suspected.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
What?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
This is what I've suspected.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
He's answering different questions

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
than the one being asked.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I didn't hear what you said.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
He said more for me.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
More for me? More comedy for you?

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
That's what I'm saying.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
He's like a

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
sort of like Dao De Jing

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
kind of like your mind comes to a halt.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
What if he can see

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
the future like and he sees like

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
questions before you ask him

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
and that's what's taken him so long to figure it all out.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
You asked me

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
what would make me laugh and I said a thing

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
and I don't know if you know this but I laughed.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
More for him. More

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
for you then.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
All right. Well, I mean

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I like this guy.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Malcolm

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
because you see him

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
and this is not like

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I like you on site. I like you

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
all the way through this whole thing.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
You seem like a cool dude.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Whatever it is you're hiding, I don't think you're hiding much.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I mean

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I think whatever

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
it is you're concealing, it's nothing that

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
you'd probably share anything that we'd

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
asked you if we asked you the right questions.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
You're not hiding anything, are you?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Yeah.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Oh, okay.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I don't know what I'm hiding.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
What's the dark side

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
of Malcolm? Is it like what's you at your worst?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
What's your behavior when you're

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
ashamed of what you just did?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Hmm, I get quiet.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
All right.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Well, I mean, I think...

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Oh, shame on you then.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
He's been a good sport. That's not torture.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I could seriously talk to him for the rest of the night.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
If you see Malcolm out there,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
buy him a drink.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Malcolm, will you do me a favor and move to Los Angeles

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
and come be on the show every week?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Yeah, I'm sure we'll all be working for you.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Malcolm, everybody.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Thank you, Malcolm. Thank you for coming up.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
The enigmatic.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Okay, I'm not going to sleep well tonight.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I don't have fucking answers.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Yeah. That's so good.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I think if our podcast

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
had done a gig in Columbine

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
at the right time,

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
we could have saved a lot of lives.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I don't know.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
That's all I kept thinking.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I look at him and I see like a Ramon

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
and a Rick O'Caseyck.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Oh, really?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Jerry Newman.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I live in their own internal world

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
that all of a sudden are volcanoes

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
of some sort of artistic expression.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Do you guys see the Cobain documentary?

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Yeah.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Maybe Malcolm is a new Cobain.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Maybe he's struggling with stomach pain

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
and he can't wait to try heroin

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and blow his brains out

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and write some great songs.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
That was a great documentary.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Dan, can I make a little interlude here

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
and talk about a place that I went to today

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
before coming here

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and meeting you at the little bar over there?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
It's a place I have not been to in six years.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
It's a strip club called Union Jacks.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Are you guys familiar with Union Jacks?

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Union Jacks is a great little strip club.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Especially in the daytime.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
When I went in there today, I was the only guy in there

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
and was wearing a suit as I do.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
There was one girl on stage

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
and she wasn't the thinnest of strippers.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
She was having the most fun

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
and I loved her and she was fantastic.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
She was teaching another stripper

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
out on the floor, out in the bar,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
how to twerk.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
And then another stripper came off the street

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
like she was coming on, like she was on duty.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Now there's three of them and I came back from the bathroom

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
so I got in line with them and we were all twerking together.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I found out I twerked better than one of them

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
but worse than the other two.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Then one girl came in

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
and she had her arm in a cast

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
and she got up on stage

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
and she was like, hey, can I do the double lampshade?

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
She named some dance move.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
No, you can't do that with your broken arm.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
But she was doing it.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
It was the greatest fucking thing in the world.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
So there was strippers with like eye patches

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
and fucking knee braces and broken arms

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
and everybody was twerking

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
and they also, I told them,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
they said, what are you doing in town?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I said, I do a comedy show.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
They said, bring everybody back after us.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
They go, our fans are a little socially awkward.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
They go, we love socially awkward.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
So we're all going to Union Jacks

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
and we're all just going to get lab dances together.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Yeah?

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I'm going.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Malcolm, you in?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Wait.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Is that Malcolm?

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
He raised his voice.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I got a hoot. Malcolm,

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
if nothing else happens this weekend,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
you and I are going to a strip club together.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Oh, shit.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Is Ollie here?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Ollie, you're not here, are you?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Who?

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I think our friend Ollie couldn't get into the show.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I didn't realize.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ollie.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Also, I want to thank Ben for giving us cool records

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
before the show. Ben, you out there?

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Thank you, brother. Ben gave me a groovy

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Everly Brothers thing and was it called Hidden Christians

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
or Secret Christians or Nervous Christians?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I've never heard of them and it sounds groovy.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
All right. Okay.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So here's the thing.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I'm going to show you guys my dick.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Oh, I forgot to tell you one last thing

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
about the strip club.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
One more thing.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
The reason I brought that up, I forgot.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
One of the strippers there looks exactly

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
like a, you know,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
suicide girls like Tattooed, kind of punk rock chicks.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
If a stripper was a suicide girl

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
but looked exactly like King Joffrey

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
from Game of Thrones.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And when we go there later on,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
That sounds really great, right? Yeah.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Like as a girl, that's great.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It gave me the strangest

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
half erection of my life.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Okay.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
So did I talk about this?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I got very drunk

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
a couple of weeks ago.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And this is a confession.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
This is the confession segment.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
This is called Rock Bottom

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Moment of Clarity

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Intervention.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Do you want some music? Yeah.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:09.000
This is a new segment because I'm not proud of these moments.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Actually, can you keep this playing?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
This is perfect to just keep playing.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Okay.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So here's what happened.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I'm going to go through it fast,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
but when I go through it fast, you're going to be like,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
what the fuck are you talking about?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Why did that happen?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The answer is because clearly I'm an alcoholic.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
had a few

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
guests over at my house

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
and I farted

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
while backing

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
out of the room.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Did you stop it?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Or is this still playing?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Okay.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The song doesn't listen to your story.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And as soon as I

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
farted,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
everyone in the room went,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
which was crazy

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
because it felt like the fart moved

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
at the speed of light.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I was like,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
because I was leaving the room to fart.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And I was like, you guys smell that?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And they're like, yeah.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And then one of them said, Dustin was there,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
our producer.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I'm farting now, as I say in this story.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But that's not important.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Just to lend the story a verse and multitude.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
heard it.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You could hear it?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
You heard it?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I heard it!

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I'm sitting 12 feet away from you.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
That's crazy.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
That's distracting.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
The track is 2 minutes 10 seconds left.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
2 minutes 10. You want to start over?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
The track is only 2 minutes long.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Oh shit.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So I'm humiliated by this story.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Although that all overshadowed everything.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I was backing out of the room and I farted.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And then everyone went,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and I was like, you could smell that?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And someone said, yeah.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Did you shit your pants?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And I said,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
no, no.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
This is how drunk I was.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I went into my bedroom

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and I took off my pants

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
and my underwear.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And I was going to put on pajamas

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and I was going to put on pajamas.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
But instead I

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
walked back into the living room

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
with my

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
underwear

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
to show my house guests

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
that I hadn't

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
shit my pants.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And Dustin

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
was there

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and his girlfriend Elizabeth

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
who's like half my age

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
and I was wearing a t-shirt

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and she was like,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
oh, no.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And I was like, no, I didn't shit my pants.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And I was like

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
6 years old showing them.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And everyone was like, get out of here.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Get out of here.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
We can see your balls.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
We can see your balls.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
That's what they kept saying. We can see your balls.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You came back in with nothing on?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I had a t-shirt on. I thought it covered my balls.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Oh no.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
What?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I'm not bragging.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I guess they could still see my balls.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
That's something you'd risk?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I'm not bragging.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
That is certainly not bragging, sir.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I was that drunk.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That's kids don't drink that much.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And I went back in

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
and I put on my pajamas and I came back in

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and I was like, I'm so sorry.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And they were like, why did you do that?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And I kept going, I wanted you to know

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I didn't shit my pants.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Why couldn't you just say that?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
That you didn't shit your pants.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I was like, I didn't think you'd believe me.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And they were like, why couldn't you put on pants

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
to come out and show us you didn't shit your pants?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And I said, because if I took too long,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
you'd think I just

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
grabbed fresh underwear

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
to fool you.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Because I was six years old in that moment.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I was like, it was insane.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You guys should not drink as much as you do

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
is the point of my story.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
You should be careful.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You should take it easy.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I'm fine.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
But you guys are young

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
and you can improve yourselves.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
If you had shit your pants,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
would you walk back in and show them

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
that you had or not?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
No, I would have hit it.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I would have thrown them out the window.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Now, Dan, our time is shorter.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Should we get into a little shadow run or no?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
How much time do we have left?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
25.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
We have like 20 minutes.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Can I tell you one more thing

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
about the daybreakers

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
with Ethan Hawke?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Daybreakers is about vampires

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
and the future daybreakers...

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
vampires,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
or as we call them, daybreakers,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
have taken over the world

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
and so humans are a minority

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
we're using them for their blood.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And Ethan Hawke

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
is a

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
phlebotomist, I guess you would call him?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
He's a blood specialist

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and he's talking to his partner in a blood lab

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and he goes like

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
he's working really hard

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
to come up with a synthetic form of blood

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
because he loves humans and he doesn't think

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
we should farm humans.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And his partner goes like,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
yeah, come on, we're ready to go with the synthetic blood.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
The animal testing is almost finished

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and as he says that

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
he hands

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Ethan Hawke a headshot

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
of a chimpanzee

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
with fangs.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I gotta tell you,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
it's like the best movie that's ever been made.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
We're almost done with the animal testing.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Chimpanzee with fangs.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It's like a...

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Why does the chimpanzee have a headshot?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It's like a fang.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Was it an 8x10 black and white?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Yeah, it was black and white.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
8x10?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Yes, 8x10 black and white headshot

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
of a chimpanzee with fangs.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
It said William Morris Agency at the bottom.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I did not say that.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Special talents, Russian accent.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Can swim.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
All right.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Now, that's it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I said we play a little

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Shadowrun.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Is it a good idea

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
by applause or a bad idea

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
if we bring Malcolm up to play Shadowrun?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Malcolm's gotta...

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Malcolm, come up.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Malcolm, would you mind coming up?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Malcolm's gotta play.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And then we should balance it out.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Erin told me I shouldn't

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
ask for always women

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
because it's like, oh, women are...

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Because she saw Mad Max and she's like, well, women aren't...

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
But I was like, well, yeah, but women...

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
She said like, well, when DeMorge

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
isn't there, you don't ask for a black guy to come up.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And I was like, well, race is an artificial construct.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Gender is not.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Kaboom.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
We need women up here.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
All right, get the fuck up here.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I like that sort of initiative.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You better not be black is my point.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Better not be black.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Wait, is that Nancy?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That's Nancy.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Nancy who we met earlier. Hello, Nancy.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
If you get a chance afterwards, smell Nancy.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
She smells terrific.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Oh, yeah.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Is that you with the Super Dimples?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Yeah, look at those dimples.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I think it's Super Nipples.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Nancy, you got those Super Nipples?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Those two.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Sure, nipples.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Silver dollars.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
That's a callback to the Dick Brothers.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I know, I know it is.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
That's the average nipple size.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Is it right?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
That doesn't matter, right?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Are you above or below average, Nancy?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Above or below average nipple size?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I don't know.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Is that the average?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You said it with assurance.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'll change your subject.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
All right.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Spencer, would you mind...

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'll come over there and pass out the things.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Oh, thank you, Jeff.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Is this enough people? Do you want any other performers?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
This is plenty.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Is my dick big enough?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Yeah, it's fine.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It doesn't matter, right?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It doesn't matter.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
It doesn't matter.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
You want to be...

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Do you want to be Camille or DeMorge?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
DeMorge.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Oh, yeah. Malcolm should be DeMorge.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
You're hard to guide.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
You're dick perfect.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But your dick...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It can be small.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And you can still be

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
satisfying

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
to people.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yep.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That you sleep with.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I'm sure if it's huge,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
that's great.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm sure that's great.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It's not that big a deal.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It doesn't need to be big all the time.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
It's my point.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Some people report discomfort

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
with overly large sized members.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Spencer Crittenden reporting.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Yep.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Just looked it up.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Spencer, is it true they call you

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Coke Can?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
What?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Oh, no, I mean,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I'd say mine's probably...

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
What? 5.5 is average, right?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That's not what mine is.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
These guys have 6.5.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah, and I would dispute that.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'd say 5.5 is more...

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I'm not saying that's mine.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
6.5 is a bit under

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
average, yeah.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
With, you know, decimal points.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
6.5 sounds like a lot.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
6.5 is above average.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
My dick is shaped exactly like an ampersand.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And the silver dollar thing...

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Silver dollar is above average.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Gert, absolutely.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Absolutely.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Silver dollars are

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
fucking giant.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Oh, okay.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
50 cent pe...

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah, Kennedy, he's got a big dick.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Okay, guys, look.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
We don't have a whole lot of show levels.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I'll go to Union Jacks and take our dicks out.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
We'll fucking settle this shit later on.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
All right, Spencer, do we have a guest

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Shadowrun Recapper?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Yeah, this is Theo from Finland again.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Malcolm, how big is your dick?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Three.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Diameter.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
He's saying diameter.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Radius.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Three radians.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
The trash can lid.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
800.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Super wide, but not very long.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
All right, are you ready, Spencer?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Uh, sure.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Last time on Harmontown.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
The gang was outside Mindplus Limited

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
where they cooked up an indeed

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
ingenious infiltration.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Jim Nightblade

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
pretended to have a cyber-eletic seeker.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Seizure

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
while Mercy and Dr. Friend

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
convinced the clinic's receptionist to admit Jim.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It worked.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Succeeding in their deception,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
the team found themselves in the C-Beta ward

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
where but two security guards

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
hung around. I can't talk.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Dr. Friend unleashed tear gas grenades

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
in the room and left everyone

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
reeling and choking.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
But would there be enough antidote for everyone?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Was their cover blown?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Do cyber eyes weep electric tears?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Would Harmontown ever come to Finland?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Find out.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
You see, because he's from Finland.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Next time on Harmontown

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Shadow Time Run.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
All right.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Yay. Who was that by? Who was that guest?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
What?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Well, what? Who wrote that?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Tail from Finland. All right.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I'll tell you one thing.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's straight.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Now, Malcolm, do you follow the show?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Do you know what's going on here?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Nope.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
All right.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You're kind of like our eyes and ears.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I don't actually have a trouble understanding.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It's fine.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Your language.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
The words.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It might be Dustin Marshall

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
wearing a wig. You know what I'm saying?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It looks a lot like Dustin Marshall.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I think he looks like Dimitri Martin under cover.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
All right.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Malcolm, follow your heart here.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
So accurate.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I'm not in the room. So what's going on?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
You guys, except for Jeff,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
are in a hospital room.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
There's a central table

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
like in the ones I've been to.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And there's also tear gas

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
fucking everywhere.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
You're choking on the floor except for Jim.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
No. Yeah. Jim's been antedoted

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
by Dr. Friend. The rest of you

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
tear gas is just full in the room.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
There's a glass window leading

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
to the exterior and the door.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I use my high

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
composure to not succumb.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Well, you do.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
It's

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
tear gas.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
My eyes are really dry.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
No.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
They're full of painful tears, in fact.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
What

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
tear, tear are we dealing with?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Like, tier 5?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Tier 5 tears. Tier 6.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
You got to do the instance with

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
PVPs.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I never played World of Warcraft

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
for like 20 minutes.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So, we got two guards in here, right?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yeah. No, they're on the floor.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You knocked them out before

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
getting antedoted.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
All right.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Is the tear gas still flowing in the room?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
It's fucking everywhere.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
You can't even see. There's three

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
tear gas grenades worth of tear gas.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Is there a window in the room?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Which is rare.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
A glass window.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
summon the spirit

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
of the Native American wind eagle

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and summon the wind eagle to go up there

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
and flap the wings so hard that it burst

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
the window and dissipates

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
the tear gas from the room.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
That's so flapping hard.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
The wind eagle is

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
like 20 feet wingspan.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's a huge thing.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
What force of summoning is this?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
A force five, baby.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
A force five?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I get under the nearest desk

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
to protect myself.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You do that.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
You find yourself well protected

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
from a giant eagle who now exists

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
in the room.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I'm also very composed.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Highly composed

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and full of tear gas.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
There's an eagle that's got

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
golden plumage and also different

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
colored plumage because it's a spirit.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's flapping around.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It's flapping up a storm, but

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
in so summoning

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Jeff, what's your care?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Eve Liberty takes five

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
fading damage or drain damage

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
from the exertion of casting a spell.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Jesus.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Combined with the three you've taken earlier,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
you're on the ropes here for consciousness.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You don't got too many spells

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
left in your brains.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
That's pretty stunned right now.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I can't cast any more spells for a while.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
May I please make a move?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Sure.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I would like to go outside the room

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
and say

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
to any nearby guards

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
hey,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
we got some tear gas in here.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
We've got a situation. Get in here.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
You guys like to party?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Come over here.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
We've got a serious situation.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Leaving the Golden Eagle behind,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
you exit,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
see Beta Ward,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
and you see a guard.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
He's at the end of the hallway. He's got a big rifle.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Hey.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Hey. We need your help down here.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Oh, yeah. I'm coming.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It's all fucked up. What do you need?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I need you to walk

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
in front of me and go into the room.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Why? What's up?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The room's crazy. It's a little crazy room.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
No, that doesn't seem like any of my business.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Oh, so you're just going to hang out?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Yep.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I'll go back into the room then,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
but I'm telling you...

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
What are you telling me?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
It's crazy?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Yeah.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Be more descriptive.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
There's tear gas.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It's a terrorist attack.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Shit. We should lock

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
the hospital down then.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Yeah, I'll follow you.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Okay.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I don't need to go anywhere. I'll just dial it in.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Okay.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
We'll turn your back to me.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Okay.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
He pulls out his comm link and turns away from me

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
to dial a number.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I stun him. I stun him. I stun him.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I stun him.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
You...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
All right.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
You go to stun him and you hit him right in the temple.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Right in the temple.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
The electricity flows through him.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
You hear the smoldering

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
something fleshy.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Or maybe not.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
He drops to the floor and smoke exits

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
his ears.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
911.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
It's not really upon there.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I had to check in.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It's a very cute guard.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
There's a large golden eagle chilling.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
No, he's flapping his wings

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
to get the tear gas out of the room.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Oh, okay.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Wait, out of what? Out of the room?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Out of the window I was trying to burst.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Who?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I mean, how much wind...

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I guess a lot of wind can burst a window.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Yeah.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
All right. That happens.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Oh, man.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I don't know.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Well, yeah, tornadoes and shit.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Yeah, and those guys' dicks are huge.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Sure.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Well, it's all yes and each other tonight.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
No, well, I just...

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
You know, I live in an earthquake area.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I'm not used to wind...

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
anything different than what it is.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
My wife didn't do me a favor

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
by marrying me.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
If anything,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
she did herself a favor.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I think she did us all

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
a favor.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Cliff Hanger!

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Cliff Hanger!

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Oh, all right.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
All right.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Thank you for coming to Harbor 10, everybody.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Let's thank you Nancy very much. Malcolm, everybody.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Oh, no.
