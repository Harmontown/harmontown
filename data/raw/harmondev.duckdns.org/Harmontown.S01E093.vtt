This is Harmontown. Harmontown is\n\n00:37.400 --> 00:44.800\nonce again in session. Please welcome the Chairman of the Academy of Rosy Pictures and Sciences,\n\n00:44.800 --> 00:55.840\nand the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. It's Oscar\n\n00:55.840 --> 01:02.200\nNite. You shouldn't be expected to be here, and you're heroic for being here. We have\n\n01:02.200 --> 01:10.120\na heroically medium-sized audience. Are the Oscars still going on right now? I saw 17\n\n01:10.120 --> 01:15.000\nfat guys in tuxedos walking down the road, which means it just let out, or they just\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:22.200\nsaid, fuck it. Well, those guys, yeah, they're done, like the award for best fat guy. They're\n\n01:22.200 --> 01:28.760\nlike, fuck it. But there's probably still a couple as we're up here on stage right now.\n\n01:28.760 --> 01:35.000\nAre they currently running right now? Yeah. Do we know any biggies? I won't watch it. Who\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:42.480\nwants to be our live Tyler? Tyler's put up with his fair share of shit. He's always\n\n01:42.480 --> 01:50.120\ngot his iPhone. Tyler, get out your Oscar app, and let us know when the best director,\n\n01:50.120 --> 01:59.000\nbest movie, yeah, as they come in. What a fucking, I'm glad, I'm so glad I missed the\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:06.680\nin memoriam this year. That's something I missed, because what a fucking, okay, so let's\n\n02:06.680 --> 02:15.720\nstart with that. Let's start with this really sad shit. Harold Ramis has shuffled, yeah,\n\n02:15.720 --> 02:24.840\nyou guys didn't do anything wrong. I just think that's a funny way to mourn. I think\n\n02:24.840 --> 02:29.000\nthat was just polite. No, I know, I know, I didn't do anything wrong. It's just funny\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:35.720\nhow we sound. It's funny how we behave. I never met Harold Ramis. I don't, I don't, I don't,\n\n02:35.720 --> 02:42.640\nthis is nothing. I, family members of mine have died that I have not, I just ass burger\n\n02:42.640 --> 02:48.640\nit out. Like, I don't, I don't fucking care. Like, I have talked to grandfathers on the\n\n02:48.640 --> 02:55.520\nphone the night before they went into surgery that they may or may not survive. And I have\n\n02:55.520 --> 02:59.440\ntalked to them and gone, good luck in that surgery and found out they didn't make it\n\n02:59.440 --> 03:08.280\nand was like, well, and that's just a fact laid up against the fact that I was, when\n\n03:08.280 --> 03:15.920\nI found out through Twitter that Harold Ramis died, I, my knees buckled and I sat on a piece\n\n03:15.920 --> 03:22.240\nof flagstone on a sidewalk in Burbank. And I know that this is all about me. I'm not,\n\n03:22.240 --> 03:27.760\nI know because I don't, I don't know this person. He's a celebrity. He's a stranger.\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:37.600\nBut he was an important celebrity to me and to so many people. And I, I wept publicly,\n\n03:37.600 --> 03:45.400\nnot publicly, like I was performing. I wept in public. I wept on a sidewalk in Burbank.\n\n03:45.400 --> 03:51.200\nTears running down my face for about 15 minutes. I was late to my next appointment. You hear\n\n03:51.200 --> 03:57.360\nthat Harold Ramis? So you felt more connected to a person that you never met than, than\n\n03:57.360 --> 04:01.280\nto grandfathers. Yeah. And I don't know. I think it's important.\n\n04:01.280 --> 04:05.760\nThe important thing about that is that when people die, when celebrities die especially,\n\n04:05.760 --> 04:11.280\nthey, they're symbolic. They spend their lives symbolically, their deaths are symbolic too.\n\n04:11.280 --> 04:16.400\nAs a writer, most of my heroes, I choose very well because they commit suicide and you don't,\n\n04:16.400 --> 04:22.400\nyou don't mourn them. They, they mourn themselves and then they kill themselves. I, my heroes,\n\n04:22.400 --> 04:27.120\nSpalding Gray, Hunter Thompson, like they, they do themselves in one way or another.\n\n04:27.120 --> 04:31.240\nAnd in fact, Philip Seymour Hoffman, like, like fits into that category in a small way,\n\n04:31.240 --> 04:36.240\nlike the people that are really passionate, people that really like, they're incredible.\n\n04:36.240 --> 04:42.200\nYeah. They leave too soon, but there's something comforting about or something that you don't\n\n04:42.200 --> 04:49.760\nhave to deal with because if they, if they pursue this sort of brightly lit path, Harold\n\n04:49.760 --> 04:58.240\nRamis was not going down that path. 69 is too young to die for a man who wrote truly\n\n04:58.240 --> 05:04.160\nlike every comedy that we've, I remember being in the theater for Ghostbusters. Do you remember\n\n05:04.160 --> 05:09.640\nwhere you were? Yes. Yes. Yes. Mike Olinberg's 12th birthday. We went to see Ghostbusters\n\n05:09.640 --> 05:15.600\nand, and I had no idea. Back then you would in Milwaukee, there was no internet or anything.\n\n05:15.600 --> 05:19.640\nBut you were what, 10, 11? You must have been 11 or something like that. You'd go to see,\n\n05:19.640 --> 05:23.840\nyou'd see a poster outside to see a bunch of guys with some Ghostbuster clothes on. You go in,\n\n05:23.840 --> 05:30.680\nyou pay your ticket, you sit there. Unbelievable. But I mean, talk about Groundhog Day, like\n\n05:30.680 --> 05:41.840\nCaddyshack. Caddyshack. It's just the, the, the, the list balls. Yeah. His, he, you don't\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:47.360\nwant to, you don't want to defile anybody's memory by comparing them to people, but the,\n\n05:47.360 --> 05:53.520\nthe extent to which we mourned John Hughes, like that means that we have to really observe\n\n05:53.520 --> 06:03.360\nthe incredible vacuum that is left by Harold Ramis because his movies were, the, the, we,\n\n06:03.360 --> 06:11.040\nwe quote them always. Like, wait, wait, wait, all of his jokes, all of his dialogue. And yet you\n\n06:11.040 --> 06:20.480\ncan't find a movie that he ever wrote that, that had any toxicity to it. There was never any, some,\n\n06:20.480 --> 06:25.440\nsome of them were sillier than others. Some of them were dumb, but in every single one of them,\n\n06:25.440 --> 06:29.760\nthe people that were heroes were the people that were underestimated. They were, they were people\n\n06:29.760 --> 06:34.560\nthat they were, they were people versus the system. And I think the thing that made me really\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:41.680\nstart weeping on the, on a sidewalk in Burbank was I, it was, it was totally narcissistic because\n\n06:41.680 --> 06:46.800\nI never even thought about it. And I think that's a beauty. It's such a testament to his work is\n\n06:46.800 --> 06:52.160\nthat he just fit like a brick into a wall of, of, of all of our lives. He was just, and then,\n\n06:52.160 --> 06:57.360\nand then only when it comes out, do you realize what's missing and only, only when you think\n\n06:57.360 --> 07:01.680\nabout what that means to you, do you realize something that you were holding onto? In my case,\n\n07:01.680 --> 07:09.680\nI was, I was holding on to this idea that, that the good guys could live forever. And I didn't\n\n07:09.680 --> 07:15.600\ncount myself among them. I didn't, I figured I would be one of those other guys, but I also\n\n07:15.600 --> 07:21.040\nthought that the good guys could live for at least 100 years, or, you know, if not forever,\n\n07:21.040 --> 07:26.960\nI thought that, I thought that the guys that just made you feel good, I thought that they could earn\n\n07:26.960 --> 07:34.720\ntheir way to some form of immortality or super mortality. And it's weird at 69 for somebody\n\n07:34.720 --> 07:41.120\nof that caliber to die. Anyway, so I sat on a fucking like sidewalk, I don't know of any\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:47.600\ncelebrity that ever died that I ever wept for, and I'm crying now talking about it. It's, and\n\n07:47.600 --> 07:54.480\nit's all personal, it's all weird. You're, for, for some cosmic mother to come to you and say to you,\n\n07:55.280 --> 08:00.000\nyou can't have that blanket anymore and take it away. And for you to suddenly realize there was\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.400\na blanket there, I never knew I had it. I didn't know, I didn't know that I thought that you could\n\n08:04.400 --> 08:10.560\nwrite your way around death. I didn't know that I thought that Harold Ramis was going to live forever.\n\n08:10.560 --> 08:19.840\nAnd then, and then he was gone. It was, it was, it was a gust of air, horrible, like weird narcissistic\n\n08:19.840 --> 08:25.440\nfit that I had outside some hat shop. I'm afraid to even like, like, like you, like your eyes are\n\n08:25.440 --> 08:30.000\nred and watery, like, if I start talking about it, I may cry for the same reason just saying and\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:39.680\nalso like, people that I look up to, I didn't realize, like you looked up to him, the eulogies\n\n08:39.680 --> 08:46.480\nhe got are unlike anybody's I've ever like, like there was a certain kind of eulogizing that went\n\n08:46.480 --> 08:54.160\non for Harold, where people were like, like he, like he affected people in a very specific way,\n\n08:54.160 --> 09:00.240\nlike it's really, really sad, but that he did achieve more immortality in that sense, you know.\n\n09:00.240 --> 09:06.800\nWell, of course, yeah, but that's, you know, we want him to taste waffles for 40 extra years.\n\n09:06.800 --> 09:12.400\nLike he did, I thought that he would outlive me. I didn't know that I thought that I thought that\n\n09:12.400 --> 09:18.640\nwhen I died, the world I left would have Harold, an old Carol Ramis in it. I really did. I didn't\n\n09:18.640 --> 09:24.240\nknow that I thought that, but I really thought that. And it's, it's, it's an odd, strange thing.\n\n09:24.240 --> 09:30.800\nYou guys are 25. You've got your Jared Leto and you should hang on to him.\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:35.040\nBut what, what if the world takes him tomorrow?\n\n09:38.720 --> 09:43.440\nWhat, what, what if, what if the world did and this, this podcast drops some moments before,\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:50.560\nyou know, Jared, Jared Leto began tonight's Oscars in an amazing fashion. It was, I went\n\n09:50.560 --> 09:54.400\nto an Academy Awards once I was getting, if I told the story, I got it. I was getting my hair cut\n\n09:54.400 --> 09:59.840\nlike years ago. Well, it would have been the one where Holly Berry won Best Actress and\n\n09:59.840 --> 10:05.520\nSunni Poitier was there. And I think it was right after 9-11. Yeah. It doesn't one 2002.\n\n10:05.520 --> 10:11.200\nYeah. Whatever the one, the Academy Awards right after the planes hit the buildings. And, oh,\n\n10:11.200 --> 10:20.800\nthat was 9-11. The Academy Awards weren't on 9-11. Oh, oh, oh. Sorry. You were trying to remember\n\n10:20.800 --> 10:27.520\na date and years. Can I help? I was going to, I hope I haven't told the story before. I was going\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:32.720\nto get my hair cut and as I'm walking up to the back door of the, of the place I get my hair cut\n\n10:32.720 --> 10:37.040\nfor many years, I realized, oh, it's Sunday. Like this guy's not even open on Sunday. What the\n\n10:37.040 --> 10:42.320\nfuck am I thinking? And also why am I walking up without, without an appointment? And I walk in\n\n10:42.320 --> 10:46.320\nand as I'm walking through, oh, it's Sunday. He won't be open, but the door is open. And it's,\n\n10:46.320 --> 10:52.640\nmy friend Bob, this stylist and he's there and he's cutting one woman's hair and she has two gowns\n\n10:52.640 --> 10:58.080\nhung next to her where she's getting her hair cut. One beautiful white gown and one beautiful black\n\n10:58.080 --> 11:02.400\ngown and she's getting a haircut. And I've never seen these two before. I've never seen this woman\n\n11:02.400 --> 11:09.520\nbefore. And I go, oh, Bob, I'm sorry. Like it's not only Sunday, it's Academy Awards Sunday.\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:13.840\nLike, I don't know what I was thinking. He goes, Jeff, hang on. And the woman whispers something\n\n11:13.840 --> 11:20.880\nin his ear and he goes, Jeff, what are you doing tonight? And I go, nothing. He goes,\n\n11:20.880 --> 11:28.160\ndo you want to go to the Academy Awards? I was like, what? He goes, her date just backed out.\n\n11:28.160 --> 11:35.520\nShe has no dates. And she was, I won't get the specifics. She was, she had been nominated\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:42.480\nfor an award as a technical Academy Award for a film in the 90s. So she's allowed to go to the\n\n11:42.480 --> 11:47.680\nAcademy Awards. If I say the movie, you'll be able to triangulate who she is. And I won't be able to\n\n11:47.680 --> 11:52.080\ntalk shit about her for the rest of the story. She did all the props for nine and a half weeks.\n\n11:54.480 --> 11:57.680\nShe was the reason why you feel like that's Mickey Rooney's come.\n\n12:00.800 --> 12:08.400\nMickey Rooney. Mickey Rourke. Yeah. The reason why you feel like Mickey Rourke's come is Mickey\n\n12:08.400 --> 12:12.880\nRooney. Mickey Rooney. It's because it's actually Mickey Rooney. There was a woman. This woman was\n\n12:12.880 --> 12:18.880\nin charge of milking him, milking Mickey Rooney. Coaxing Mickey Rooney's 80-year-old come out of\n\n12:18.880 --> 12:24.320\nhim. That was an important part of that film. It was like, oh yeah, Mickey Rourke. I'm sure it's\n\n12:24.320 --> 12:33.440\ngoing to be white and frothy. It had to be like semi-transparent. It had to be Mickey Rooney's\n\n12:33.440 --> 12:38.960\ncome because only Mickey Rooney's come sparkles like that. With the sparkles of showbiz. Yeah,\n\n12:38.960 --> 12:46.000\nI'm 35 millimeter. No comes sparkles like old Mickey Rooney, 80-year-old come. So I went with her\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.920\nand she got drunk. She got so drunk I was embarrassed and she tried to schmooze everybody.\n\n12:49.920 --> 12:54.960\nIt was the fucking worst night. However, it was the Oscars where Woody Allen was there and\n\n12:54.960 --> 13:00.800\nSydney Partier was there. And I just cried the whole goddamn time because it was so amazing.\n\n13:00.800 --> 13:06.320\nAnd also the in-memoriam thing always gets you. But like you said, this one would have been a real\n\n13:06.320 --> 13:11.200\nroad train for two reasons I could name. I don't know about these electricians that died, but\n\n13:12.880 --> 13:15.840\nI know that. Anyone in the crowd know who else would have been in it? Like\n\n13:17.200 --> 13:24.320\nShirley Temple died this year? Since Caesar died? Yes. Jesus Christ on a cracker.\n\n13:25.440 --> 13:29.200\nOkay, so I wanted to do this thing tonight. I was just thinking the green right before we went on.\n\n13:29.200 --> 13:33.440\nI don't know how this will work, but well, let me explain that later actually because once I explain\n\n13:33.440 --> 13:37.920\nit, we'll start doing it. But let me see. Have you guys ever watched Youngsters in the Crowd?\n\n13:37.920 --> 13:43.920\nHave you guys watched since Caesar's, your show shows? Yes. Yeah, like that to me, like I was on\n\n13:43.920 --> 13:50.080\na tour bus. The guy that said yes was so old you could tell from his voice. At least 29. Yes.\n\n13:51.680 --> 13:59.120\nThat was Carl Reiner. I drink wine out of a box. But that shit is funny. Like since Caesar,\n\n13:59.120 --> 14:04.480\nlike oh my lord. And also people ask like who the funniest women you know? Like for me,\n\n14:04.480 --> 14:10.320\nImaging Coca. I don't know if you guys don't know her. We know her as the grandma on vacation\n\n14:11.440 --> 14:18.480\nwith your pal Chevy. But since Caesar, your show shows, holy smoke. Everybody watch it.\n\n14:18.480 --> 14:25.280\nDownload the holotapes and watch it. All right, so here comes the, I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't.\n\n14:25.280 --> 14:29.920\nYou got better things to do. Yeah. Well, I do. You're still crying. You're still crying about\n\n14:29.920 --> 14:35.840\nHarold Ramis and you're fucking talking about Imaging Coca. No, I don't, I don't, I'm not.\n\n14:35.840 --> 14:41.760\nYou've never cried about another star passing before Harold Ramis? No. I was, I got bent out of\n\n14:41.760 --> 14:47.680\nshape about Spalding Gray and I got bent out of shape about Hunter S. Thompson. But the reason\n\n14:47.680 --> 14:52.720\nI got bent out of shape is that I felt like at the risk of sounding incredibly presumptuous.\n\n14:52.720 --> 14:59.920\nI, not because I equate myself with these men, but because I feel a certain relationship to\n\n14:59.920 --> 15:05.680\nthem. I feel like maybe I'm a certain sub breed of the human species. I feel like there's a\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:10.960\nconfirmation there when these guys do, yeah, there's just a part of you that thinks like,\n\n15:10.960 --> 15:15.040\nwhat is this sickness called life and how do you, how do you get out of it? How do you cure it?\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:20.320\nAnd I, the guys that you really look up to when they, when they take that way out, I just, you\n\n15:20.320 --> 15:25.520\nknow, I don't want to hear, you know, bums me out. All right. But, but you don't have to mourn\n\n15:26.080 --> 15:31.040\nbecause they fucking took off. They said goodbye. Like those are the friends I like.\n\n15:31.600 --> 15:36.560\nI like an Irish goodbye, but, but, but Harold Ramis too young, too friendly. Hunter did the\n\n15:36.560 --> 15:40.400\nthing where he killed himself, but also like in the kitchen where his family had to fucking scoop\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:44.640\nhim up and shit. Like, I don't do that. If you're going to blow your brains out, like do it in a\n\n15:44.640 --> 15:50.640\nfucking, like in a plastic lined room, which a team of professionals get to clean you up before\n\n15:50.640 --> 15:56.560\nyour fucking daughter comes in. All right. Anyways. All right. So a couple of quick things before I,\n\n15:56.560 --> 16:00.080\nI want to do an experiment tonight. I don't know if it'll work at all, but it's Oscar night.\n\n16:01.280 --> 16:05.520\nI did, I did this, I went in, did I tell you guys I was gonna, I'm gonna, I did this. I went\n\n16:05.520 --> 16:13.680\nin and did the DND book on tape thing. I did it. Yeah. I went into a little booth and I read a story\n\n16:13.680 --> 16:20.240\nfrom the point of view of Diz Dorden, a famous dark elf from the underworld who walks the surface\n\n16:20.240 --> 16:27.440\nworld and who, and who doesn't want to be like other drow. And, and, and is like, seems like kind\n\n16:27.440 --> 16:33.440\nof a Vulcan character and he has little adventures and I'm him reading the story. And then, and then\n\n16:33.440 --> 16:37.520\npart of the story, he runs into a goblin and the engineer told me he's like, you just go in and\n\n16:37.520 --> 16:41.760\nthe engineer goes, look, here's, if you run into a word, you don't know how to say it. I'll, I'll\n\n16:41.760 --> 16:47.680\npull up a thing that is like a recording of a guy. So you go like, I, I went through the halls of\n\n16:47.680 --> 16:52.960\nMithral, all right, fuck it. And then the, and then you just hear in your headphones, Mithralador.\n\n16:54.720 --> 17:00.160\nI went through the halls of Mithralador and I did the thing. But then, but then the guy also said\n\n17:00.160 --> 17:06.160\nlike, you know, you might encounter a goblin or two. You don't have to get too fancy. I, I, I\n\n17:06.160 --> 17:11.920\nknew what he meant. I knew, I knew that Ice-T and David Duchovny probably fucking put too much mustard\n\n17:11.920 --> 17:16.480\non it when they ran into a goblin. I knew what he meant. I was like, I don't want to do that. I can\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:22.240\nimagine David Duchovny like mustering a fucking goblin, but I'm, you mean David Duchovny, right?\n\n17:22.240 --> 17:28.320\nDavid Duchovny motherfucking nobody. Uh, who are we still? I mean, maybe who knows? Can we get him\n\n17:28.320 --> 17:33.680\nover here? Uh, but I, uh, get Duchovny on Harmontown. But I just found myself naturally, I was\n\n17:33.680 --> 17:38.000\nreading the story and I was into the story and I was like, I, I pulled my bow string back tight.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.720\nThe goblin looked at me, his leathery lips hissing in the white middle earth sun.\n\n17:47.600 --> 17:52.320\nPlease, old master. I'm like, that's the voice I did. I did kind of a, what do you, I mean,\n\n17:52.320 --> 17:58.640\nwhat are you going to do? And the engineer was like, nice. He was into it. And I went through\n\n17:58.640 --> 18:04.080\nthe whole thing. It was like 52 pages. I did it in a couple of hours, but probably buck 20. And, uh,\n\n18:04.080 --> 18:14.480\nhe said I was the best. He said, because I understood the story. So I just picture a\n\n18:14.480 --> 18:20.800\nsteaming like, I was, oh, all right. So going across the river, the spirit animal followed me.\n\n18:20.800 --> 18:27.600\nI don't know, it was fucking this shit doesn't. But I was like into it because\n\n18:27.600 --> 18:33.120\nwhere is the story structure I attack got the felt ogre and then I, and then I would go back\n\n18:33.120 --> 18:36.720\nand he was like, no, it's fine. I said, no, but the felt ogre is a different ogre. I should have\n\n18:36.720 --> 18:42.640\nstressed Feld, but was the felt ogre I can see in my head. I know where, which ogre is where.\n\n18:43.200 --> 18:46.400\nSo when you, so when you buy that story from audible.com,\n\n18:46.400 --> 18:56.800\nwas the story called days and nights of a fucking dark alpha the white\n\n18:56.800 --> 19:02.560\nmiddle-earth son I don't know it's at this get this character drizzed drizzed\n\n19:02.560 --> 19:08.240\ndoor and he's like apparently the most written about D&D character I don't know\n\n19:08.240 --> 19:12.600\nand they're I well we talked about this like will Wheaton and David to company\n\n19:12.600 --> 19:16.360\ntell us shit I think there's any chance that they would have to do pickups\n\n19:16.360 --> 19:19.520\nwhere you and iced tea and Dukovny would be in the same place we all have to come\n\n19:19.520 --> 19:23.580\nin yeah the basic thing is if iced tea would play some of the ogres or the\n\n19:23.580 --> 19:30.080\nfarmers hey man we're looking for these ogres and I drew my bowstring back why\n\n19:30.080 --> 19:35.080\nyou drawing it back now because I because it's got a plus two under normal\n\n19:35.080 --> 19:41.080\nconditions or do you have to save versus ogre enchantment a good point good\n\n19:41.080 --> 19:51.240\npoint in my in my largest fantasies Spencer is the dungeon master and you\n\n19:51.240 --> 19:56.280\nDukovny and iced tea are in a campaign together that would be yeah I mean that\n\n19:56.280 --> 20:00.600\nwould be a fucking do yeah because I see me like I drop my bowstring back and\n\n20:00.600 --> 20:04.760\nspecial well you don't have a bow well you what the fuck\n\n20:04.760 --> 20:10.200\nwell like Spencer would just dispense I need like start rifling through my shit\n\n20:10.200 --> 20:13.880\nlike it's like I go like catch him and he'd go it's not it you know it's not\n\n20:13.880 --> 20:19.200\nbusiness it's personal or whatever it's all right so one more piece of celebrity\n\n20:19.200 --> 20:25.200\ngossip Stephen Colbert loves community I just wanted to tell you all right who\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:28.680\ncares he didn't say he loves Harmontown so what do we what do we fuck him\n\n20:28.680 --> 20:32.120\nDino went to New York he hung

this guy more\n\n21:13.560 --> 21:16.440\nthan anything and pointed at Dino and then started telling stories about Dino\n\n21:16.440 --> 21:20.760\nin front of his daughter who clearly who's obligated to hate him you know but\n\n21:20.760 --> 21:25.200\nbut who is a big fan of Colbert and it's you know that's a cool story for a\n\n21:25.200 --> 21:30.280\ndad of a teenage daughter all right anyways

and\n\n24:04.320 --> 24:09.160\nI slowly realized 1971 that he's talking about himself the creation of himself\n\n24:09.160 --> 24:15.840\nhis own birth I'm not kidding in 1971 a woman was a woman was admitted to the\n\n24:15.840 --> 24:20.440\nhospital she had pains in her stomach and no the contractions were getting more\n\n24:20.440 --> 24:26.640\nand more severe and she slowly her vagina thrust

about what's going on\n\n26:54.240 --> 26:58.680\nin the Sudan or anything like that but it was absolutely about you know like\n\n26:58.680 --> 27:03.600\nlike like if it was it was good it was a nice sandwich of like those are good\n\n27:03.600 --> 27:07.280\nacceptance speeches whatever you think about like these movies whatever you\n\n27:07.280 --> 27:10.720\nthink about this pageantry and who

what propels this thing like this this telecast this idea\n\n27:21.440 --> 27:26.680\nthis idea that we're one day going to actually be called up onto a stage and\n\n27:26.680 --> 27:30.040\nbeing given a war and get to do this thing called an acceptance speech that\n\n27:30.040 --> 27:34.320\nwe're gonna either nail it or or not nail it have you fantasized you gave an\n\n27:34.320 -->

Nebraska or the other one I don't know man I like I saw 12 years\n\n50:39.120 --> 50:43.040\na slave I didn't I didn't see most of them I thought it was good but not great\n\n50:43.040 --> 50:47.000\nI thought it was a good film but not like not a spectacular film but how good\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:51.600\ndoes it need to be if Brad Pitt all of a sudden in the movie at the end that was\n\n50:51.600 --> 50:55.080\nvery silly and egregious but he's a producer on it and that helps get a\n\n50:55.080 --> 50:58.720\nmovie made in this day and age it was it wasn't the fucked up thing about that\n\n50:58.720 --> 51:03.120\nwell I'm curious to I want to read that guy's actual memoirs because is there a\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:09.520\nis there an angelic like handsome like a guy from guy is just like all of a\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:13.400\nsudden after all of this betrayal and you knew when the guy from Deadwood is\n\n51:13.400 --> 51:19.080\nlike in the barracks like he's from Deadwood don't like he played two\n\n51:19.080 --> 51:22.680\ndifferent guys in Deadwood and they're all bad guys like like don't trust him\n\n51:22.680 --> 51:26.960\nhe's white he's white don't get out of there it's such a heartbreaker like it's\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:30.520\nso funny watching that movie in bed when you're eating a fucking hot wings and\n\n51:30.520 --> 51:35.920\nthey like just the thing like Aaron Aaron's comments included this guy can't\n\n51:35.920 --> 51:45.160\nget a break and my personal favorite which I'd actually like to talk about\n\n51:45.160 --> 51:50.000\nwhich is like after watching a little bit of fastbender in his ways this guy\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:54.840\nloves having slaves which is which is actually important to talk about because\n\n51:54.840 --> 51:59.160\nthat was a I think that's why that movie was very interesting I don't know if\n\n51:59.160 --> 52:02.800\nit's because of how it was written or directed or act I certainly the actors\n\n52:02.800 --> 52:06.800\nare doing a fantastic job another question we both had while watching it\n\n52:06.800 --> 52:10.960\nis what is it what is that set like when they call cut what the fuck happens\n\n52:10.960 --> 52:15.360\nwhen you call cut on a set like that what I don't like any other set like what\n\n52:15.360 --> 52:19.560\nthe fuck do you do I mean it's probably not a spoiler maybe everybody's seen it\n\n52:19.560 --> 52:27.000\nbut the well slavery is abolished eventually it was labor loses but the\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:31.440\nlashing scene when he went oh my god she gets when she gets lash and that like\n\n52:31.440 --> 52:36.360\nthe most most movies in my experience like like Denzel and Glory when he's\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:40.520\ngetting like lashes usually the camera's facing the person getting like getting\n\n52:40.520 --> 52:45.760\nwhipped yeah and and there's a lot of like horrible I think it for no other\n\n52:45.760 --> 52:49.760\nreason when they when they when they turn the camera around and the the effects\n\n52:49.760 --> 52:56.920\nthe most brutal the most brutal visuals weren't the CG flesh openings on the\n\n52:56.920 --> 53:02.920\nends of the whip but actually right before that the aerosol mist of blood\n\n53:02.920 --> 53:09.600\ncoming off of backs the the the thing that was most striking to me about that\n\n53:09.600 --> 53:14.960\nmovie which has nothing to do with how it was written directed acted whatever but\n\n53:14.960 --> 53:19.680\nthe important thing that sunk into my 41 year old brain about American slavery\n\n53:19.680 --> 53:27.560\nwhich was fucking a minute ago was it was commercial and on top of it it was\n\n53:27.560 --> 53:32.040\nlike untenable that like it was it was so psychotic the whole thing like every\n\n53:32.040 --> 53:37.800\ncharacter in that movie is protesting too much and like I always that my my\n\n53:37.800 --> 53:42.360\nimage as a child of the 70s is always a guy in a horse with a whip having the\n\n53:42.360 --> 53:48.120\ntime of his life while a bunch of people ruthlessly like you know just do things\n\n53:48.120 --> 53:53.400\nthat machines will one day be able to do and and it's horrible and they but but\n\n53:53.400 --> 53:58.120\nthe the the psychology of all of it it was like I kept I kept thinking throughout\n\n53:58.120 --> 54:02.280\nthe entire movie like Jesus Christ who the fuck thought this was a good idea\n\n54:02.280 --> 54:06.600\nlike everybody that's doing it the people that are profiting the most are\n\n54:06.600 --> 54:12.000\nall tangled up in it like they they really need to say things to themselves and\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:15.640\nto each other over and over and over again to make this all right and more\n\n54:15.640 --> 54:21.240\nimportantly like the the emphasis on commerce the idea of debt the idea that\n\n54:21.240 --> 54:25.880\nthis person it wasn't just a choice between is this right or is this wrong\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:33.200\nbecause we as 25 year old hipsters we all go well the fuck's fun about having a\n\n54:33.200 --> 54:37.680\nslave that's not cool that's not cool I didn't see any of the nominated films\n\n54:37.680 --> 54:41.200\nbut as far as that's concerned was there a dissenting voice at all among in the\n\n54:41.200 --> 54:44.600\nmovie at all among the people who are like just keep your head down don't do\n\n54:44.600 --> 54:47.520\nthis was there any sort of well is everybody what do you mean like like\n\n54:47.520 --> 54:52.360\nlike amongst amongst the titular slaves in the film were there any everybody\n\n54:52.360 --> 54:56.400\njust people saying like like keep your head down like it's it's easier well\n\n54:56.400 --> 54:59.800\nthey tell the guy you can't forget you know how to read or write yeah he can't\n\n54:59.800 --> 55:03.320\neven you don't tell anybody that you're literate because you'll actually end up\n\n55:03.320 --> 55:07.200\ngetting killed which is a terrifying belly of the whale realization that he\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:12.720\nactually the key to his freedom that he thought was actually in his hand that\n\n55:12.720 --> 55:16.480\nhe thought couldn't be taken away from him that doesn't mean anything compared\n\n55:16.480 --> 55:19.440\nto the color of his skin or the circumstances or what she was born so\n\n55:19.440 --> 55:24.080\nin fact the fact that he's literate actually puts him in great peril and\n\n55:24.080 --> 55:28.560\nand he walks this weird tightrope between it the the but the amazing like\n\n55:28.560 --> 55:33.080\nlike I just I was blown away like oh shit this was commerce this was buying a\n\n55:33.080 --> 55:39.000\nSnickers bar this was this was the people kept saying I owe the the Shawshank\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:46.240\nfarm I owe them 50 redemptions for redemptions I have to I my crops aren't\n\n55:46.240 --> 55:49.400\njust that it's at the emphasis on capitalism because that's what it fucking\n\n55:49.400 --> 55:55.000\nis and that's the thing like we we pat ourselves on the back so much for like\n\n55:55.000 --> 56:00.480\noutgrowing this concept but it's not it's just it's just barbarism combined\n\n56:00.480 --> 56:05.960\nwith rampant capitalism if you in case you if you're allowed to you will abuse\n\n56:05.960 --> 56:11.040\npeople there were there I this movie is nothing to do with the movie but I\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:15.200\nexperienced that epiphany while watching the movie even though I I thought I\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:18.640\nunderstood that we had slavery and what that meant and why I should feel bad\n\n56:18.640 --> 56:23.520\nabout it and I but I kind of didn't and that and that movie made me kind of\n\n56:23.520 --> 56:26.680\nthink about it on a different level yeah I I sort of get what you're coming from\n\n56:26.680 --> 56:31.400\nit in that I mean the stakes are different but sort of the the capitalism\n\n56:31.400 --> 56:36.600\ninvolved in the machine is no different than what it is now except I do you think\n\n56:36.600 --> 56:39.960\nthat people at some one of them went to the numbers and went if we know actually\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:43.280\npay these people and give them wages they'll last longer they I'm sure it's\n\n56:43.280 --> 56:46.720\none of the time there was a cost analysis done went wait we can make more\n\n56:46.720 --> 56:50.720\nmoney and these are you know our slaves or our people working for us will last\n\n56:50.720 --> 56:55.400\nlonger if we help them kind of along with a you know we don't have to keep the\n\n56:55.400 --> 56:59.520\nbottom line doesn't go up that much more importantly if you were allowed to if the\n\n56:59.520 --> 57:04.920\nlaw said that you were allowed to as as the as the superhuman Amish Brad Pitt\n\n57:04.920 --> 57:09.120\nwho comes in at the end of the end of the story comes in with this message and\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:16.040\nsays to this character if if tomorrow the law said that I was allowed to treat\n\n57:16.040 --> 57:20.720\nyou this way would that make it right and he can't he can't wrap his brain\n\n57:20.720 --> 57:27.560\naround it because it's so it's so based on hatred I just the I was stricken by\n\n57:27.560 --> 57:31.000\nthe amount of work I don't know how much of it was based on reality with the\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:36.000\namount of work that went into for instance taking a lantern and going out\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:39.440\nto your slave hut and having all of your slaves come into your house and do a\n\n57:39.440 --> 57:44.240\ndance for you I that seems so much harder than just having slaves there's so\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:49.240\nmuch work I wouldn't like it was insane how fucking like what there was there\n\n57:49.240 --> 57:53.560\nwasn't about saving work he had a lot of free time come in come in come in the\n\n57:53.560 --> 57:57.920\nhouse everybody dance come dance then they're doing a dance the dance has to\n\n57:57.920 --> 58:02.680\nbe taught to them you have to have a choreographer teach everybody and then\n\n58:02.680 --> 58:06.640\nthere's all this anger you're fucking that slave I'm not fucking that slave I'm\n\n58:06.640 --> 58:09.600\ngonna throw a vase at her it's like like Jesus Christ they put a lot of work into\n\n58:09.600 --> 58:14.000\nhaving slaves these people all right anyways it was I thought it was a good\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:19.600\nmovie I I I think it's really interesting like my first my first thought as\n\n58:19.600 --> 58:24.880\neveryone's is is oh well if you make a movie set in this world you're not allowed\n\n58:24.880 --> 58:30.520\nto not be nominated for an ask her much less win one perhaps if gravity is\n\n58:30.520 --> 58:34.080\nnominated but I think it's interesting yes of course but I think it's very\n\n58:34.080 --> 58:38.080\ninteresting at what you do with that thought do you then like but you if you\n\n58:38.080 --> 58:41.840\ngo to rotten tomatoes and you look at the scores and you sort them by lowest to\n\n58:41.840 --> 58:47.360\nhighest like the people that I I out of morbid curiosity I went and looked at\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:51.720\nthe reviews of that movie like what are what are the big detractors of this\n\n58:51.720 --> 59:00.480\nmovies prestige saying and it's it's it's it's it's very strange I saw I saw a\n\n59:00.480 --> 59:05.120\nguy with a one-star review of the movie saying this is this is pornography for\n\n59:05.120 --> 59:11.440\nracists and soft-hearted lemmings and I don't I don't know if that's the most\n\n59:11.440 --> 59:15.040\nprofound thing in the world you can ever say are the most idiotic I don't know\n\n59:15.040 --> 59:18.720\nwhat that is I think that person is generally saying oh this is this is\n\n59:18.720 --> 59:22.520\nrace bait I don't know I guess if you were trying to if you were to endow that\n\n59:22.520 --> 59:27.000\nperson with an IQ that's what they would I have to watch it again it's just a\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:31.160\nclinically fucking exploration it's an adaptation of the memory it doesn't the\n\n59:31.160 --> 59:35.120\ncamera doesn't push down a bar while the Rolling Stones play it's not anybody\n\n59:35.120 --> 59:38.360\nhere first of all black or feel strongly about that film like for better\n\n59:38.360 --> 59:41.600\nfor worse anybody here we don't have there's no black people that come to\n\n59:41.600 --> 59:46.760\nthis podcast where's NT when we need him he's he's having an Oscar party are\n\n59:46.760 --> 59:53.480\nyou kidding me tonight's his night man the I yeah I just think I just think it's\n\n59:53.480 --> 59:57.640\nweird like like the conversation that you have between somebody that would\n\n59:57.640 --> 01:00:06.100\nbother to insist that that movie not be regarded well like at least at least a\n\n01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.880\nfilm that that deals with important stuff like an actual like heavy matter\n\n01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.320\nlike wins and not some of the pithle that was nominated like yeah I'd rather\n\n01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.960\nit's the only movie that's about class systems it's the only movie why aren't\n\n01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.240\nthe other movies why aren't the other movies dealing with the fact that there\n\n01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.320\nare poor people being told what to do by rich people isn't that sort of the\n\n01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.760\npoint of the Oscar bait movie there was to sort of specifically go for the\n\n01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.640\nthings that are the hot button issues not to say that they did it just for the\n\n01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.560\npurpose of the Oscar bait but that's sort of what that's that's films wheel\n\n01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.320\nhouses you want to kind of tackle big issues and bring to light it you know\n\n01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.480\nthings like that what was the film I'm really ignorant about it the the\n\n01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:51.320\ndocumentary about Egypt and the the that when what what oh the act of\n\n01:00:51.320 --> 01:01:00.880\nkilling didn't win there a lot of lot of great documentaries the 25th\n\n01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:08.000\nstart was great but I'm sorry I the act of killing is I threw a shoe at the\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.160\nTV I how give give give 20 feet from stardom remake it next year it's two\n\n01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.960\nhours of people saying over and over again that it's hard to be a backup\n\n01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.920\nsinger I'm sorry it's the act of killing is a fucking exploration of of the\n\n01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.840\ndefinition of good and evil and the human condition and our capacity to lie\n\n01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.880\nto ourselves and each other 20 20 from stardom is fun you know during the\n\n01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.280\nacceptance speech for 20 feet of stardom they brought one of the backup\n\n01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.200\nsinger speech and the last half of the acceptance speech was her singing about\n\n01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.080\nhow happy she was yeah I don't want to take anything away from no I mean it\n\n01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.400\nwas a good documentary yeah it was fine all those documentaries were great I\n\n01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.920\nthink I saw most of them but boy god the act of killing I felt like I wanted to\n\n01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.800\nrun out in the street and say this is the most important film I've ever seen in\n\n01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.320\nmy life because it's beyond Indonesia it's beyond it's beyond killing it's\n\n01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:02.480\nit goes into like what the fuck what who are we we are insane we're insane we\n\n01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:09.320\nare a species of fucking liars and and and just like we swallow it down and it\n\n01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:16.120\ncomes up through vomit you can come to the the point of the you know strong\n\n01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.840\nissues documentary versus the interesting thing documentaries like is I don't\n\n01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.200\nthink that necessarily one is patently better than the other did you you saw\n\n01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.640\nboth of them did you think that the the the the the square was patently a better\n\n01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.640\nI didn't see the square I didn't see it okay someone's raising their hand yeah\n\n01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:49.200\nthat's always good what's your name strike one he said I'm not black\n\n01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:56.760\nbut isn't 12 years a slave pornographic like wouldn't you agree with that\n\n01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.520\ngrab a mic and come on stage with Sam or if you want to get over Sam then we\n\n01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.600\ncan hear you if we have to proceed that we can we can hear you for the podcast\n\n01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.480\noh yeah take taking the very difficult position of yeah it would be easy to say\n\n01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.120\nokay 12 years a slave is great movie but you're saying like intellectually yeah\n\n01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:23.440\nit's just I mean slavery is pretty bad but that's a but showing how bad it is\n\n01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:34.560\nyeah it's I mean that was the for me was the most like that the bad stuff the\n\n01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.840\npornographic stuff was the stuff that was like oh shit this is really good but\n\n01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:46.360\nother than that that's it that's like it's I mean that's like in Korea like you\n\n01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.560\nyou put a film about the Korean war and like North Korea and the shit that North\n\n01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.200\nKorea is doing that's gonna win the equivalent of the Korean Oscars which is\n\n01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.520\nwhat by the way I want to know it's got it's called the squeegee\n\n01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.680\ndoesn't I don't know are you Korean I'm sorry was it racist for me to assume you\n\n01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:15.840\nknew Sam are you Korean I am Korean yeah oh it was a bad movie but did you how\n\n01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.400\nold are you can ask you seem young enough I can ask how old you are that's\n\n01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:27.720\nracist I'm dirty all right yes no because congratulations thank you American\n\n01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:35.120\nhustle talked about class in a way I mean I wasn't speaking of class somebody\n\n01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:42.360\nthe crap with black people better than I think 12 years a slave because I feel\n\n01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.560\nlike it was okay I think I understand the point he's trying to make in that\n\n01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.240\nin that a lot of these films that are these sort of Oscar the ones that are\n\n01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.280\ngoing after the heavy issues choose to depict these scenes that are very real\n\n01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.040\nthat were the actual parts of you know violent parts of our history you know\n\n01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.040\nthe dark parts of our history just to sort of to get the reaction of people to\n\n01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.920\nget them to think this is something we need to consider this is something we\n\n01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.200\nneed to think about and that I would say I would say that that's sort of the\n\n01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.720\npoint of those films isn't it a sort of I think of a lot of the films in the\n\n01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.520\npast like they show those scenes that are uncomfortable for the purpose of\n\n01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.720\nlike getting the viewer to sort of think about it and go look but Django did a\n\n01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:28.240\nbetter job of that but Django obviously yeah it takes place in a mythical\n\n01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.320\nuniverse that's the danger I think that I mean you're 30 I'm 41 I think that when\n\n01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.240\nI think about the concept of slavery in America and the fact that the country's\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.800\nbuilt on it all this stuff it's like this is this is right back around the\n\n01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.640\ncorner but the fact that I'm able to actually like in a post roots post\n\n01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:51.600\nfucking everything world like I was raised in the 70s on awareness of this\n\n01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.800\nshit and yet I when I watch that movie I'm still I there is something about the\n\n01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:02.240\naerosol mist of blood coming off of someone's back that I didn't receive\n\n01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:09.000\nthrough the movie glory with Matthew Broderick I didn't I did I needed to I\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.440\nneeded to be brutalized I needed to watch more pornography about slavery I\n\n01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.080\ndid I don't know if that makes a good movie or not but I don't I don't know\n\n01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.760\nit doesn't make a best picture though I but compared to these other ones I'm not\n\n01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.360\nsure I didn't see two of them but I'm not sure yeah I don't I thought I mean it's\n\n01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.760\nthe guys putting the camera in the right places as far as I'm concerned he\n\n01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.480\ndidn't do anything like you know yeah I mean it wasn't it wasn't like holy shit\n\n01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.720\nwhat a what a rock star isn't that the point is some of these films then like I\n\n01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.880\nwas saying to use that depiction like to sort of jog the oh wait this is\n\n01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.480\nsomething I need to pay attention to so they can get their message across that\n\n01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.960\nsort of seems to be a common theme but with that hot button going around you if\n\n01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.320\nyou show up to that set you put your styrofoam cup of coffee down and you're\n\n01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.800\nready to do the scene with fastbender and these other actors pick up the whip\n\n01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.440\nokay this scene you're gonna do this and that isn't that a good director isn't\n\n01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.340\nthat a good movie if if if those people are but Django should have won but\n\n01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:17.120\nDjango Django's just silly and gross like that comic book idea of the\n\n01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.240\nof the big well I think this comes down but this comes into a very interesting\n\n01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.440\nconcept because it creates a dichotomy between good movie versus these things\n\n01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.080\nthat often the Oscars are celebrating which is conscientious for me if you're\n\n01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.120\ngonna be conscientious and make important films like not documentaries but\n\n01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.080\nlike but but fictional or in this case you know an annotation of a real memoir\n\n01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.600\nlike a really like serious heavy stuff like for me and I'd have to watch it\n\n01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.920\nagain to talk intelligently about it I just feel like it missed for me in some\n\n01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.720\nways and I don't know what it was Django or no no fuck Django the 12 years of\n\n01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:57.800\nslave and and and like lots of films like that they you can deal with heavy\n\n01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.240\nstuff but I don't think it elevates itself to the level of like artistic\n\n01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.520\nlike like achievement and film like even if even if talking to slaves a really\n\n01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.560\ngood adaptation of that of that memoir which I've not read which I'm hoping and\n\n01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.480\nassuming is you know riveting and better I think it misses on certain levels of\n\n01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:22.000\nlike in terms of making a great film but then what are we replacing it with\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.560\nfrozen like exactly what's what is a good movie forest gump what the fuck yeah\n\n01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.600\nwhat are we talking about I don't know I mean like like these movies that win\n\n01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.280\nevery year and the notable exception is the category of best screenplay which I\n\n01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.240\ntruly feel but now the question is like like what you know hurry I thought was\n\n01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.200\nit was it was it was a pretty moving important movie I don't I don't know\n\n01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:48.200\nthat's best picture material either but like would it would it film that one\n\n01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.440\nbest picture like some of the great ones of all time like what an all about Eve\n\n01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.760\nor what a castle blanc could be recognized as even a movie anymore like\n\n01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.880\nwould people see it would people recognize it with the Academy look at\n\n01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.400\nit like yeah I don't know what their job is anymore I mean it's an institution\n\n01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.080\nthis idea of this like prestigious thing they did this thing tonight where\n\n01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.480\nthey parade it out these this benetton kids where they were like they called\n\n01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.800\nthem team Oscar or something did you see what I'm talking about they had like a\n\n01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:22.000\ndecidedly multicultural multi-ethnic like group of 25 year old kids 20 year old\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.800\nkids that they they taught I didn't even understand what it was there was like\n\n01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.040\nduring a dub soap commercial they started teaming it up and then and then\n\n01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.320\nduring this Oscars they brought them out there was like seven kids they were\n\n01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.880\nlike helping with the production or something I was at the kind of gesture\n\n01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.480\nto them it was such such just proud of station lives which are like we're not\n\n01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.160\nwe're not an oligarchy look look at this look at this band of proletarians and I\n\n01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160\ndon't know it was weird it was like it was like to during the pre-show was like\n\n01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.440\nthese two the two old white producers who

an aerospace engineer damn it Jim the science flaws\n\n01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.780\nand they are totally like who gives a fuck what's a lightsaber I don't give a\n\n01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.780\nfuck tell me the rules make them up the other sound in space if you say so George\n\n01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.500\nLucas like maybe tell a story there's no fucking movie in that movie it's just a\n\n01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.300\nbunch of stupid it could have been caught I could have called I've been\n\n01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.500\ncalled that drive driveway but they could have made a driveway movie I don't\n\n01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.620\nunderstand why they make they could have made a driver movie it would have been\n\n01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:56.260\njust as good or bad no it wouldn't have been it would have been worse you're\n\n01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.620\nright it would have been worse only because the only thing good about that\n\n01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.300\nmovie is it happens in space but that's a lot of great thing to happen in a\n\n01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:09.420\nmovie certainly then give give give the cinematographer an award they did but\n\n01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:13.020\ndon't give anybody else an award in that fucking movie because a movie fucking\n\n01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:17.340\nstinks it stinks nothing happens make a movie about lost in space it's exciting\n\n01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:20.860\nmaterial and Aaron keeps telling me I'm not a feminist just because I keep\n\n01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:25.660\nsaying Sandra Bullock's ass looks great at 50 listen they knew that her ass looked\n\n01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:31.900\ngreat that's why yeah her ass was but not her whole ass that's that's that's\n\n01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:37.420\nthat's like I just I just know they didn't computer generate her ass you\n\n01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:42.340\nget the end of the movie you you can air breath you can airbrush cellulite and\n\n01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:47.180\nstuff or whatever but but but she I'm saying I don't I'm making a joke now as\n\n01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.780\nthat because it irritates Aaron because I keep saying like I'm a feminist because\n\n01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:57.020\nI'm like you go girl it's funny to me I don't know I think the definition of\n\n01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:01.100\nfeminism has become very funny because it's about you consume media along with\n\n01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:04.140\neveryone else and then based on whether you think the frozen lady should have\n\n01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:09.180\nlike worn one outfit or another you can call yourself a feminist people had\n\n01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:14.340\ntumbler right right right to things and they go like oh Brit is the betrayal of\n\n01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:18.380\nbut I just think it's funny that we all consume media like a bunch of fucking\n\n01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:24.620\ndisgusting larvae like sucking on these tubes that come from the Ministry of\n\n01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:28.260\nPropaganda and that the difference between a so-and-so and such and such is\n\n01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:36.500\npeople who go let's taste like vanilla I got a shamrock one I think it's silly I\n\n01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:42.500\ndon't think it's revolutionary to to post an emoji of an eye roll after\n\n01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.820\nsomething that you didn't like on Deadwood I don't think that that counts\n\n01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:51.100\nas progress yeah that's contributing yeah but gravity is not a good movie\n\n01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:59.740\nfrozen also did you float away in space would that I had come out with that I\n\n01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:03.660\ndidn't like it I did I had a great time at the movies watching it I thought it\n\n01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:07.100\nwas gorgeously shot and it is very sexy and good-looking and technically\n\n01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:11.420\nwonderful I just think that they wasted an awesome opportunity to tell a story\n\n01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:16.460\nabout what that might be like thank you beef steak bills on my side all right\n\n01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.980\nthe elephant in the room is Spencer once again taking the week off yeah we got\n\n01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:24.540\nkumail status now he comes and goes as he pleases we have a chair over there like\n\n01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:28.700\nlike that like that it seems like a packing tape on a block died there's\n\n01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:32.820\nthat photo of the microphone was nobody there I don't want to I don't want
