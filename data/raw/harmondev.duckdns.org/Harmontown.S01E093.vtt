Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, from the Kodak Theater

00:29.480 --> 00:37.400
in Hollywood, and the 174th Annual Academy Awards. This is Harmontown. Harmontown is

00:37.400 --> 00:44.800
once again in session. Please welcome the Chairman of the Academy of Rosy Pictures and Sciences,

00:44.800 --> 00:55.840
and the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. It's Oscar

00:55.840 --> 01:02.200
Nite. You shouldn't be expected to be here, and you're heroic for being here. We have

01:02.200 --> 01:10.120
a heroically medium-sized audience. Are the Oscars still going on right now? I saw 17

01:10.120 --> 01:15.000
fat guys in tuxedos walking down the road, which means it just let out, or they just

01:15.000 --> 01:22.200
said, fuck it. Well, those guys, yeah, they're done, like the award for best fat guy. They're

01:22.200 --> 01:28.760
like, fuck it. But there's probably still a couple as we're up here on stage right now.

01:28.760 --> 01:35.000
Are they currently running right now? Yeah. Do we know any biggies? I won't watch it. Who

01:35.000 --> 01:42.480
wants to be our live Tyler? Tyler's put up with his fair share of shit. He's always

01:42.480 --> 01:50.120
got his iPhone. Tyler, get out your Oscar app, and let us know when the best director,

01:50.120 --> 01:59.000
best movie, yeah, as they come in. What a fucking, I'm glad, I'm so glad I missed the

01:59.000 --> 02:06.680
in memoriam this year. That's something I missed, because what a fucking, okay, so let's

02:06.680 --> 02:15.720
start with that. Let's start with this really sad shit. Harold Ramis has shuffled, yeah,

02:15.720 --> 02:24.840
you guys didn't do anything wrong. I just think that's a funny way to mourn. I think

02:24.840 --> 02:29.000
that was just polite. No, I know, I know, I didn't do anything wrong. It's just funny

02:29.000 --> 02:35.720
how we sound. It's funny how we behave. I never met Harold Ramis. I don't, I don't, I don't,

02:35.720 --> 02:42.640
this is nothing. I, family members of mine have died that I have not, I just ass burger

02:42.640 --> 02:48.640
it out. Like, I don't, I don't fucking care. Like, I have talked to grandfathers on the

02:48.640 --> 02:55.520
phone the night before they went into surgery that they may or may not survive. And I have

02:55.520 --> 02:59.440
talked to them and gone, good luck in that surgery and found out they didn't make it

02:59.440 --> 03:08.280
and was like, well, and that's just a fact laid up against the fact that I was, when

03:08.280 --> 03:15.920
I found out through Twitter that Harold Ramis died, I, my knees buckled and I sat on a piece

03:15.920 --> 03:22.240
of flagstone on a sidewalk in Burbank. And I know that this is all about me. I'm not,

03:22.240 --> 03:27.760
I know because I don't, I don't know this person. He's a celebrity. He's a stranger.

03:27.760 --> 03:37.600
But he was an important celebrity to me and to so many people. And I, I wept publicly,

03:37.600 --> 03:45.400
not publicly, like I was performing. I wept in public. I wept on a sidewalk in Burbank.

03:45.400 --> 03:51.200
Tears running down my face for about 15 minutes. I was late to my next appointment. You hear

03:51.200 --> 03:57.360
that Harold Ramis? So you felt more connected to a person that you never met than, than

03:57.360 --> 04:01.280
to grandfathers. Yeah. And I don't know. I think it's important.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.760
The important thing about that is that when people die, when celebrities die especially,

04:05.760 --> 04:11.280
they, they're symbolic. They spend their lives symbolically, their deaths are symbolic too.

04:11.280 --> 04:16.400
As a writer, most of my heroes, I choose very well because they commit suicide and you don't,

04:16.400 --> 04:22.400
you don't mourn them. They, they mourn themselves and then they kill themselves. I, my heroes,

04:22.400 --> 04:27.120
Spalding Gray, Hunter Thompson, like they, they do themselves in one way or another.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.240
And in fact, Philip Seymour Hoffman, like, like fits into that category in a small way,

04:31.240 --> 04:36.240
like the people that are really passionate, people that really like, they're incredible.

04:36.240 --> 04:42.200
Yeah. They leave too soon, but there's something comforting about or something that you don't

04:42.200 --> 04:49.760
have to deal with because if they, if they pursue this sort of brightly lit path, Harold

04:49.760 --> 04:58.240
Ramis was not going down that path. 69 is too young to die for a man who wrote truly

04:58.240 --> 05:04.160
like every comedy that we've, I remember being in the theater for Ghostbusters. Do you remember

05:04.160 --> 05:09.640
where you were? Yes. Yes. Yes. Mike Olinberg's 12th birthday. We went to see Ghostbusters

05:09.640 --> 05:15.600
and, and I had no idea. Back then you would in Milwaukee, there was no internet or anything.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.640
But you were what, 10, 11? You must have been 11 or something like that. You'd go to see,

05:19.640 --> 05:23.840
you'd see a poster outside to see a bunch of guys with some Ghostbuster clothes on. You go in,

05:23.840 --> 05:30.680
you pay your ticket, you sit there. Unbelievable. But I mean, talk about Groundhog Day, like

05:30.680 --> 05:41.840
Caddyshack. Caddyshack. It's just the, the, the, the list balls. Yeah. His, he, you don't

05:41.840 --> 05:47.360
want to, you don't want to defile anybody's memory by comparing them to people, but the,

05:47.360 --> 05:53.520
the extent to which we mourned John Hughes, like that means that we have to really observe

05:53.520 --> 06:03.360
the incredible vacuum that is left by Harold Ramis because his movies were, the, the, we,

06:03.360 --> 06:11.040
we quote them always. Like, wait, wait, wait, all of his jokes, all of his dialogue. And yet you

06:11.040 --> 06:20.480
can't find a movie that he ever wrote that, that had any toxicity to it. There was never any, some,

06:20.480 --> 06:25.440
some of them were sillier than others. Some of them were dumb, but in every single one of them,

06:25.440 --> 06:29.760
the people that were heroes were the people that were underestimated. They were, they were people

06:29.760 --> 06:34.560
that they were, they were people versus the system. And I think the thing that made me really

06:34.560 --> 06:41.680
start weeping on the, on a sidewalk in Burbank was I, it was, it was totally narcissistic because

06:41.680 --> 06:46.800
I never even thought about it. And I think that's a beauty. It's such a testament to his work is

06:46.800 --> 06:52.160
that he just fit like a brick into a wall of, of, of all of our lives. He was just, and then,

06:52.160 --> 06:57.360
and then only when it comes out, do you realize what's missing and only, only when you think

06:57.360 --> 07:01.680
about what that means to you, do you realize something that you were holding onto? In my case,

07:01.680 --> 07:09.680
I was, I was holding on to this idea that, that the good guys could live forever. And I didn't

07:09.680 --> 07:15.600
count myself among them. I didn't, I figured I would be one of those other guys, but I also

07:15.600 --> 07:21.040
thought that the good guys could live for at least 100 years, or, you know, if not forever,

07:21.040 --> 07:26.960
I thought that, I thought that the guys that just made you feel good, I thought that they could earn

07:26.960 --> 07:34.720
their way to some form of immortality or super mortality. And it's weird at 69 for somebody

07:34.720 --> 07:41.120
of that caliber to die. Anyway, so I sat on a fucking like sidewalk, I don't know of any

07:41.120 --> 07:47.600
celebrity that ever died that I ever wept for, and I'm crying now talking about it. It's, and

07:47.600 --> 07:54.480
it's all personal, it's all weird. You're, for, for some cosmic mother to come to you and say to you,

07:55.280 --> 08:00.000
you can't have that blanket anymore and take it away. And for you to suddenly realize there was

08:00.000 --> 08:04.400
a blanket there, I never knew I had it. I didn't know, I didn't know that I thought that you could

08:04.400 --> 08:10.560
write your way around death. I didn't know that I thought that Harold Ramis was going to live forever.

08:10.560 --> 08:19.840
And then, and then he was gone. It was, it was, it was a gust of air, horrible, like weird narcissistic

08:19.840 --> 08:25.440
fit that I had outside some hat shop. I'm afraid to even like, like, like you, like your eyes are

08:25.440 --> 08:30.000
red and watery, like, if I start talking about it, I may cry for the same reason just saying and

08:30.000 --> 08:39.680
also like, people that I look up to, I didn't realize, like you looked up to him, the eulogies

08:39.680 --> 08:46.480
he got are unlike anybody's I've ever like, like there was a certain kind of eulogizing that went

08:46.480 --> 08:54.160
on for Harold, where people were like, like he, like he affected people in a very specific way,

08:54.160 --> 09:00.240
like it's really, really sad, but that he did achieve more immortality in that sense, you know.

09:00.240 --> 09:06.800
Well, of course, yeah, but that's, you know, we want him to taste waffles for 40 extra years.

09:06.800 --> 09:12.400
Like he did, I thought that he would outlive me. I didn't know that I thought that I thought that

09:12.400 --> 09:18.640
when I died, the world I left would have Harold, an old Carol Ramis in it. I really did. I didn't

09:18.640 --> 09:24.240
know that I thought that, but I really thought that. And it's, it's, it's an odd, strange thing.

09:24.240 --> 09:30.800
You guys are 25. You've got your Jared Leto and you should hang on to him.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.040
But what, what if the world takes him tomorrow?

09:38.720 --> 09:43.440
What, what, what if, what if the world did and this, this podcast drops some moments before,

09:43.440 --> 09:50.560
you know, Jared, Jared Leto began tonight's Oscars in an amazing fashion. It was, I went

09:50.560 --> 09:54.400
to an Academy Awards once I was getting, if I told the story, I got it. I was getting my hair cut

09:54.400 --> 09:59.840
like years ago. Well, it would have been the one where Holly Berry won Best Actress and

09:59.840 --> 10:05.520
Sunni Poitier was there. And I think it was right after 9-11. Yeah. It doesn't one 2002.

10:05.520 --> 10:11.200
Yeah. Whatever the one, the Academy Awards right after the planes hit the buildings. And, oh,

10:11.200 --> 10:20.800
that was 9-11. The Academy Awards weren't on 9-11. Oh, oh, oh. Sorry. You were trying to remember

10:20.800 --> 10:27.520
a date and years. Can I help? I was going to, I hope I haven't told the story before. I was going

10:27.520 --> 10:32.720
to get my hair cut and as I'm walking up to the back door of the, of the place I get my hair cut

10:32.720 --> 10:37.040
for many years, I realized, oh, it's Sunday. Like this guy's not even open on Sunday. What the

10:37.040 --> 10:42.320
fuck am I thinking? And also why am I walking up without, without an appointment? And I walk in

10:42.320 --> 10:46.320
and as I'm walking through, oh, it's Sunday. He won't be open, but the door is open. And it's,

10:46.320 --> 10:52.640
my friend Bob, this stylist and he's there and he's cutting one woman's hair and she has two gowns

10:52.640 --> 10:58.080
hung next to her where she's getting her hair cut. One beautiful white gown and one beautiful black

10:58.080 --> 11:02.400
gown and she's getting a haircut. And I've never seen these two before. I've never seen this woman

11:02.400 --> 11:09.520
before. And I go, oh, Bob, I'm sorry. Like it's not only Sunday, it's Academy Awards Sunday.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.840
Like, I don't know what I was thinking. He goes, Jeff, hang on. And the woman whispers something

11:13.840 --> 11:20.880
in his ear and he goes, Jeff, what are you doing tonight? And I go, nothing. He goes,

11:20.880 --> 11:28.160
do you want to go to the Academy Awards? I was like, what? He goes, her date just backed out.

11:28.160 --> 11:35.520
She has no dates. And she was, I won't get the specifics. She was, she had been nominated

11:35.520 --> 11:42.480
for an award as a technical Academy Award for a film in the 90s. So she's allowed to go to the

11:42.480 --> 11:47.680
Academy Awards. If I say the movie, you'll be able to triangulate who she is. And I won't be able to

11:47.680 --> 11:52.080
talk shit about her for the rest of the story. She did all the props for nine and a half weeks.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.680
She was the reason why you feel like that's Mickey Rooney's come.

12:00.800 --> 12:08.400
Mickey Rooney. Mickey Rourke. Yeah. The reason why you feel like Mickey Rourke's come is Mickey

12:08.400 --> 12:12.880
Rooney. Mickey Rooney. It's because it's actually Mickey Rooney. There was a woman. This woman was

12:12.880 --> 12:18.880
in charge of milking him, milking Mickey Rooney. Coaxing Mickey Rooney's 80-year-old come out of

12:18.880 --> 12:24.320
him. That was an important part of that film. It was like, oh yeah, Mickey Rourke. I'm sure it's

12:24.320 --> 12:33.440
going to be white and frothy. It had to be like semi-transparent. It had to be Mickey Rooney's

12:33.440 --> 12:38.960
come because only Mickey Rooney's come sparkles like that. With the sparkles of showbiz. Yeah,

12:38.960 --> 12:46.000
I'm 35 millimeter. No comes sparkles like old Mickey Rooney, 80-year-old come. So I went with her

12:46.000 --> 12:49.920
and she got drunk. She got so drunk I was embarrassed and she tried to schmooze everybody.

12:49.920 --> 12:54.960
It was the fucking worst night. However, it was the Oscars where Woody Allen was there and

12:54.960 --> 13:00.800
Sydney Partier was there. And I just cried the whole goddamn time because it was so amazing.

13:00.800 --> 13:06.320
And also the in-memoriam thing always gets you. But like you said, this one would have been a real

13:06.320 --> 13:11.200
road train for two reasons I could name. I don't know about these electricians that died, but

13:12.880 --> 13:15.840
I know that. Anyone in the crowd know who else would have been in it? Like

13:17.200 --> 13:24.320
Shirley Temple died this year? Since Caesar died? Yes. Jesus Christ on a cracker.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.200
Okay, so I wanted to do this thing tonight. I was just thinking the green right before we went on.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.440
I don't know how this will work, but well, let me explain that later actually because once I explain

13:33.440 --> 13:37.920
it, we'll start doing it. But let me see. Have you guys ever watched Youngsters in the Crowd?

13:37.920 --> 13:43.920
Have you guys watched since Caesar's, your show shows? Yes. Yeah, like that to me, like I was on

13:43.920 --> 13:50.080
a tour bus. The guy that said yes was so old you could tell from his voice. At least 29. Yes.

13:51.680 --> 13:59.120
That was Carl Reiner. I drink wine out of a box. But that shit is funny. Like since Caesar,

13:59.120 --> 14:04.480
like oh my lord. And also people ask like who the funniest women you know? Like for me,

14:04.480 --> 14:10.320
Imaging Coca. I don't know if you guys don't know her. We know her as the grandma on vacation

14:11.440 --> 14:18.480
with your pal Chevy. But since Caesar, your show shows, holy smoke. Everybody watch it.

14:18.480 --> 14:25.280
Download the holotapes and watch it. All right, so here comes the, I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.920
You got better things to do. Yeah. Well, I do. You're still crying. You're still crying about

14:29.920 --> 14:35.840
Harold Ramis and you're fucking talking about Imaging Coca. No, I don't, I don't, I'm not.

14:35.840 --> 14:41.760
You've never cried about another star passing before Harold Ramis? No. I was, I got bent out of

14:41.760 --> 14:47.680
shape about Spalding Gray and I got bent out of shape about Hunter S. Thompson. But the reason

14:47.680 --> 14:52.720
I got bent out of shape is that I felt like at the risk of sounding incredibly presumptuous.

14:52.720 --> 14:59.920
I, not because I equate myself with these men, but because I feel a certain relationship to

14:59.920 --> 15:05.680
them. I feel like maybe I'm a certain sub breed of the human species. I feel like there's a

15:05.680 --> 15:10.960
confirmation there when these guys do, yeah, there's just a part of you that thinks like,

15:10.960 --> 15:15.040
what is this sickness called life and how do you, how do you get out of it? How do you cure it?

15:15.040 --> 15:20.320
And I, the guys that you really look up to when they, when they take that way out, I just, you

15:20.320 --> 15:25.520
know, I don't want to hear, you know, bums me out. All right. But, but you don't have to mourn

15:26.080 --> 15:31.040
because they fucking took off. They said goodbye. Like those are the friends I like.

15:31.600 --> 15:36.560
I like an Irish goodbye, but, but, but Harold Ramis too young, too friendly. Hunter did the

15:36.560 --> 15:40.400
thing where he killed himself, but also like in the kitchen where his family had to fucking scoop

15:40.400 --> 15:44.640
him up and shit. Like, I don't do that. If you're going to blow your brains out, like do it in a

15:44.640 --> 15:50.640
fucking, like in a plastic lined room, which a team of professionals get to clean you up before

15:50.640 --> 15:56.560
your fucking daughter comes in. All right. Anyways. All right. So a couple of quick things before I,

15:56.560 --> 16:00.080
I want to do an experiment tonight. I don't know if it'll work at all, but it's Oscar night.

16:01.280 --> 16:05.520
I did, I did this, I went in, did I tell you guys I was gonna, I'm gonna, I did this. I went

16:05.520 --> 16:13.680
in and did the DND book on tape thing. I did it. Yeah. I went into a little booth and I read a story

16:13.680 --> 16:20.240
from the point of view of Diz Dorden, a famous dark elf from the underworld who walks the surface

16:20.240 --> 16:27.440
world and who, and who doesn't want to be like other drow. And, and, and is like, seems like kind

16:27.440 --> 16:33.440
of a Vulcan character and he has little adventures and I'm him reading the story. And then, and then

16:33.440 --> 16:37.520
part of the story, he runs into a goblin and the engineer told me he's like, you just go in and

16:37.520 --> 16:41.760
the engineer goes, look, here's, if you run into a word, you don't know how to say it. I'll, I'll

16:41.760 --> 16:47.680
pull up a thing that is like a recording of a guy. So you go like, I, I went through the halls of

16:47.680 --> 16:52.960
Mithral, all right, fuck it. And then the, and then you just hear in your headphones, Mithralador.

16:54.720 --> 17:00.160
I went through the halls of Mithralador and I did the thing. But then, but then the guy also said

17:00.160 --> 17:06.160
like, you know, you might encounter a goblin or two. You don't have to get too fancy. I, I, I

17:06.160 --> 17:11.920
knew what he meant. I knew, I knew that Ice-T and David Duchovny probably fucking put too much mustard

17:11.920 --> 17:16.480
on it when they ran into a goblin. I knew what he meant. I was like, I don't want to do that. I can

17:16.480 --> 17:22.240
imagine David Duchovny like mustering a fucking goblin, but I'm, you mean David Duchovny, right?

17:22.240 --> 17:28.320
David Duchovny motherfucking nobody. Uh, who are we still? I mean, maybe who knows? Can we get him

17:28.320 --> 17:33.680
over here? Uh, but I, uh, get Duchovny on Harmontown. But I just found myself naturally, I was

17:33.680 --> 17:38.000
reading the story and I was into the story and I was like, I, I pulled my bow string back tight.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.720
The goblin looked at me, his leathery lips hissing in the white middle earth sun.

17:47.600 --> 17:52.320
Please, old master. I'm like, that's the voice I did. I did kind of a, what do you, I mean,

17:52.320 --> 17:58.640
what are you going to do? And the engineer was like, nice. He was into it. And I went through

17:58.640 --> 18:04.080
the whole thing. It was like 52 pages. I did it in a couple of hours, but probably buck 20. And, uh,

18:04.080 --> 18:14.480
he said I was the best. He said, because I understood the story. So I just picture a

18:14.480 --> 18:20.800
steaming like, I was, oh, all right. So going across the river, the spirit animal followed me.

18:20.800 --> 18:27.600
I don't know, it was fucking this shit doesn't. But I was like into it because

18:27.600 --> 18:33.120
where is the story structure I attack got the felt ogre and then I, and then I would go back

18:33.120 --> 18:36.720
and he was like, no, it's fine. I said, no, but the felt ogre is a different ogre. I should have

18:36.720 --> 18:42.640
stressed Feld, but was the felt ogre I can see in my head. I know where, which ogre is where.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.400
So when you, so when you buy that story from audible.com,

18:46.400 --> 18:56.800
was the story called days and nights of a fucking dark alpha the white

18:56.800 --> 19:02.560
middle-earth son I don't know it's at this get this character drizzed drizzed

19:02.560 --> 19:08.240
door and he's like apparently the most written about D&D character I don't know

19:08.240 --> 19:12.600
and they're I well we talked about this like will Wheaton and David to company

19:12.600 --> 19:16.360
tell us shit I think there's any chance that they would have to do pickups

19:16.360 --> 19:19.520
where you and iced tea and Dukovny would be in the same place we all have to come

19:19.520 --> 19:23.580
in yeah the basic thing is if iced tea would play some of the ogres or the

19:23.580 --> 19:30.080
farmers hey man we're looking for these ogres and I drew my bowstring back why

19:30.080 --> 19:35.080
you drawing it back now because I because it's got a plus two under normal

19:35.080 --> 19:41.080
conditions or do you have to save versus ogre enchantment a good point good

19:41.080 --> 19:51.240
point in my in my largest fantasies Spencer is the dungeon master and you

19:51.240 --> 19:56.280
Dukovny and iced tea are in a campaign together that would be yeah I mean that

19:56.280 --> 20:00.600
would be a fucking do yeah because I see me like I drop my bowstring back and

20:00.600 --> 20:04.760
special well you don't have a bow well you what the fuck

20:04.760 --> 20:10.200
well like Spencer would just dispense I need like start rifling through my shit

20:10.200 --> 20:13.880
like it's like I go like catch him and he'd go it's not it you know it's not

20:13.880 --> 20:19.200
business it's personal or whatever it's all right so one more piece of celebrity

20:19.200 --> 20:25.200
gossip Stephen Colbert loves community I just wanted to tell you all right who

20:25.200 --> 20:28.680
cares he didn't say he loves Harmontown so what do we what do we fuck him

20:28.680 --> 20:32.120
Dino went to New York he hung out with his old buddies Louis UK and Stephen

20:32.120 --> 20:35.640
Colbert I texted Dino Stamatopoulos and I said you back in town yet he's no he

20:35.640 --> 20:39.320
goes but I am going to the Russian tea room right now to have dinner with

20:39.320 --> 20:43.520
Colbert and it was right at the time like it was mid-afternoon here which means

20:43.520 --> 20:49.240
Colbert had just taped and they met at the Russian tea room and sat down like

20:49.240 --> 20:53.920
my dinner was on Dino got to have a real Liam Neeson taken father fantasy

20:53.920 --> 20:59.360
because his daughter who is now what 1516 which is a weird that she's old

20:59.360 --> 21:04.240
enough now to be a Colbert fan that he took her to see Colbert and that during

21:04.240 --> 21:09.760
the warm-up Colbert somebody some some snarky gentleman said like do you love

21:09.760 --> 21:13.560
me more than anything or something Colbert said no I love this guy more

21:13.560 --> 21:16.440
than anything and pointed at Dino and then started telling stories about Dino

21:16.440 --> 21:20.760
in front of his daughter who clearly who's obligated to hate him you know but

21:20.760 --> 21:25.200
but who is a big fan of Colbert and it's you know that's a cool story for a

21:25.200 --> 21:30.280
dad of a teenage daughter all right anyways what do you guys care what the

21:30.280 --> 21:35.680
fuck do you care so it's Oscar night it's Oscar night Tyler yeah Tyler Oscar

21:35.680 --> 21:50.400
update all right best screenplay but 12 years of slaves sweet I haven't seen

21:50.400 --> 21:54.520
but half of the nominated like major features I really liked her I thought

21:54.520 --> 21:58.040
that was fantastic you know the great thing the fucking Oscars they let you

21:58.040 --> 22:02.320
down every year that's just a pageant a goddamn garbage bullshit but the

22:02.320 --> 22:07.840
category of best original screenplay like it's never I have never had a

22:07.840 --> 22:12.000
problem with it like it always is actually the best original screenplay

22:12.000 --> 22:14.320
because that's the one that was nominated because that's the award that

22:14.320 --> 22:18.920
you're only going to win probably no I'm gonna adapt I'm gonna adapt your

22:18.920 --> 22:29.720
your life but I haven't written my it's gonna be called 12 years of fuck a fuckface

22:29.720 --> 22:41.480
I don't know when we became an old such an old-school comedy team all right we

22:41.480 --> 22:45.720
we were having drinks the drawing earlier yes we were you that's part of

22:45.720 --> 22:50.040
the thing is that it's Oscar day and we were we were drinking since I took a

22:50.040 --> 22:54.720
big nap so I'm fine now but I was I was awakened from my slumber by Jared

22:54.720 --> 23:01.680
Leto but like in the in the house well basically like I passed out on my bed

23:01.680 --> 23:05.280
Erin was having a couple people over for Oscars so the tea it's it's playing in

23:05.280 --> 23:10.600
the other room Jared Leto wins for best whatever an adaptation adaptation of a

23:10.600 --> 23:18.520
person okay best adaptation of an actor so his speech like very it's very

23:18.520 --> 23:23.880
tempered sapphire eyes beautifully sculpted eyebrows is wonderful flowing

23:23.880 --> 23:27.880
long river runs through it were you awake during this was no I just well I

23:27.880 --> 23:32.160
just this is what I see in my dreams but I was stirred because I was laying I'm

23:32.160 --> 23:36.360
just I'm just hearing Oscar tripe I don't care and then he go because he goes

23:36.360 --> 23:41.240
like thank you so much this award is important and it's heavy in my hand and

23:41.240 --> 23:47.120
it's great wonderful award first heavy and then he changes gears he shifts on

23:47.120 --> 23:52.800
his pelvis and he goes you know in 1971 there was a thing that happened and I

23:52.800 --> 23:56.160
like my ears perk up in my sleep because I'm like okay here comes the age it comes

23:56.160 --> 24:00.480
to the here comes the Argentina I don't know what something worthwhile I'm sure

24:00.480 --> 24:04.320
1971 this thing goes over the bubble like he keeps talking and talking and

24:04.320 --> 24:09.160
I slowly realized 1971 that he's talking about himself the creation of himself

24:09.160 --> 24:15.840
his own birth I'm not kidding in 1971 a woman was a woman was admitted to the

24:15.840 --> 24:20.440
hospital she had pains in her stomach and no the contractions were getting more

24:20.440 --> 24:26.640
and more severe and she slowly her vagina thrust a naked young man into the

24:26.640 --> 24:31.120
world he didn't know what we fell him are you fucking he didn't know what was

24:31.120 --> 24:35.600
along his path but tonight is the end of that path and I hold the gold and I'm

24:35.600 --> 24:45.000
wallaboo I'm making all of that up for real he he shifted gears it's like in

24:45.000 --> 24:51.320
1971 and he wasn't he didn't then go on to talk about the Spanish Civil War or

24:51.320 --> 24:55.880
something he didn't go on to talk about which was 30 years before that I knew I

24:55.880 --> 25:01.080
knew you'd call me on that so I was like I bolted up because I was

25:01.080 --> 25:05.760
like and and at some point he was like and then it's good to win this Oscar and

25:05.760 --> 25:09.080
it's great my brother's out there in 30 seconds to Mars and it's great he

25:09.080 --> 25:15.680
plugged his band no plugged his band I there's only one thing I like about the

25:15.680 --> 25:25.720
story is that he's older than me I bolted up I was like he's 43 fucking the

25:25.720 --> 25:30.320
world's my oyster this guy's handsome and Aaron Aaron but keep putting your hand

25:30.320 --> 25:35.320
in my arm I drink more water like you could view that you can exactly yeah

25:35.320 --> 25:44.000
you can still do it do some crunches holy fuck but he it was a like as far as

25:44.000 --> 25:48.840
Oscar speeches you know you got Jared Leto who was the opener they've done a

25:48.840 --> 25:52.880
healthy restructuring where they throw you a bone they give you the actors at

25:52.880 --> 25:55.880
the top of the show now they start off with the biggies and then at the end

25:55.880 --> 25:59.520
toward the end of the show right before I got in my car what's her name from 12

25:59.520 --> 26:03.480
years a slave the girl who played Patsy I don't know her at the actress Tyler

26:03.480 --> 26:14.840
what's her name hard name crazy name it's got an ad for net bronca one for

26:14.840 --> 26:20.440
best supporting actress it was it was an intensely beautiful perfect four point

26:20.440 --> 26:24.360
landing speech can you can we can you hear your impression of her she said

26:24.360 --> 26:28.280
something like she's I mean I honestly more are way more articulately than I

26:28.280 --> 26:35.000
could have ever put it she said something to the effect of we win these

26:35.000 --> 26:41.400
awards for portraying people who went through a lot of fucking pain I actually

26:41.400 --> 26:47.640
she said it really beautifully and and and just it was a really really good

26:47.640 --> 26:54.240
speech it didn't go egregiously actory let's let's think about what's going on

26:54.240 --> 26:58.680
in the Sudan or anything like that but it was absolutely about you know like

26:58.680 --> 27:03.600
like like if it was it was good it was a nice sandwich of like those are good

27:03.600 --> 27:07.280
acceptance speeches whatever you think about like these movies whatever you

27:07.280 --> 27:10.720
think about this pageantry and who know like like I'm on your side if you think

27:10.720 --> 27:17.160
it's all a bunch of horseshit however we all have this fantasy of because we

27:17.160 --> 27:21.440
really do and that's what propels this thing like this this telecast this idea

27:21.440 --> 27:26.680
this idea that we're one day going to actually be called up onto a stage and

27:26.680 --> 27:30.040
being given a war and get to do this thing called an acceptance speech that

27:30.040 --> 27:34.320
we're gonna either nail it or or not nail it have you fantasized you gave an

27:34.320 --> 27:37.640
Emmy acceptance speech have you fantasized yeah and I kind of harmed it

27:37.640 --> 27:41.600
you know like I for those of you who don't know I won an Emmy for writing the

27:41.600 --> 27:54.400
Oscars yeah yeah never make the mistake of asking me if I've ever been to the

27:54.400 --> 27:58.360
Oscars because I'll get to say oh yeah yeah I've been to the Oscars so much I

27:58.360 --> 28:05.680
won an Emmy for it and my favorite thing about that is you saying like Dan went

28:05.680 --> 28:10.200
and he won an Oscar I won an Emmy for writing the opening to the Oscars for

28:10.200 --> 28:16.280
Hugh Jackman and he accepted the word and he said my acceptance speech for the

28:16.280 --> 28:22.760
the Emmy for writing the Oscars is nominated for a Tony this is a live

28:22.760 --> 28:27.560
performance that people liked it a lot if the governor's ball is any indication

28:27.560 --> 28:30.760
I had a lot of famous people coming up to me going you're fucking awesome I was

28:30.760 --> 28:38.440
like thanks famous guy I still got it or I now have it I don't know anyways I

28:38.440 --> 28:41.520
was I don't know I don't know what we can do with this but we obviously have a

28:41.520 --> 28:45.960
lot of like wonderful people here and they all came here instead of watching

28:45.960 --> 28:52.280
the end of the Oscars I I don't know how to turn this into a game or a contest

28:52.280 --> 28:55.680
or something but I thought we could do something where we could have people come

28:55.680 --> 29:00.760
up and and I'm and not try to be funny like not try to be ironic but really

29:00.760 --> 29:09.120
actually try as hard as they can to give a really like like a really good acceptance speech what

29:09.120 --> 29:14.120
if you came up with categories and see if you named a category and see if

29:14.120 --> 29:18.200
somebody would like to win the award for that category or ask somebody what

29:18.200 --> 29:20.800
category they would like to right ask them what that I think I said we'll

29:20.800 --> 29:24.520
start with that like what we'll ask people what category they'd like to win an

29:24.520 --> 29:30.920
award for the an Academy Award and then we'll yeah right yeah sure okay so let's

29:30.920 --> 29:34.240
go we got our usual suspects up here I don't think we should exclude them but

29:34.240 --> 29:39.520
also I don't know how to do this how do you initiate this I would say you open

29:39.520 --> 29:42.920
the bidding with a certain category and start not with not with the like the big

29:42.920 --> 29:47.720

29:47.720 --> 29:53.240
animated you think that someone's ambition does anybody here have a weird

29:53.240 --> 29:57.960

45:26.200 --> 45:34.120
well shot well directed bad story stupid and boring fuck it fuck it super

45:34.120 --> 45:41.080
dumb or dumb stupid movie stupid movie you don't send you don't send a crazy

45:41.080 --> 45:45.760
lady up who had just recently had a child die you don't put her in charge of

45:45.760 --> 45:49.840
the goddamn Hubble fucking space telescope it's not it's not it's not

45:49.840 --> 45:55.320
it's George Clooney he's fucking look I love George Clinton he's great but so

45:55.320 --> 45:58.480
many accidents happen in that fucking movie and then at the end when his toe

45:58.480 --> 46:03.120
is hanging by a rope that accidentally tied around his foot and he's there he's

46:03.120 --> 46:08.160
like just let go let me just do it on your own so at that point there's so

46:08.160 --> 46:11.040
many fucking accidents that have happened why not just say fuck it stick

46:11.040 --> 46:15.280
with me I'm accident lady and everything's gonna be fine and then she's

46:15.280 --> 46:19.680
plummets to earth and she was not she's not gonna live and she lands 15 fucking

46:19.680 --> 46:26.560
feet from a fucking coastline and what and where is she cancun it's not bad

46:26.560 --> 46:32.000
weather it's gorgeous 15 feet further inland plunk into the sand dead 15 feet

46:32.000 --> 46:36.560
further out eaten by a shark because of the seaweed almost killed her she almost

46:36.560 --> 46:41.060
diced by seaweed at the end stupid and then my biggest beef with the whole

46:41.060 --> 46:45.440
fucking movie with all the forget all the bad science she gets up and this is

46:45.440 --> 46:49.400
glamour shot from the toes up he's standing there perfectly shaved legs

46:49.400 --> 46:53.480
she's been in space as far as we're told for weeks and she are like just just

46:53.480 --> 46:56.680
she just came back from fucking the wedding that's that's Jeff's biggest

46:56.680 --> 47:02.400
beef like I know I've got bigger beef scientifically her hair does not move

47:02.400 --> 47:06.160
and outer space everything else moves everything else moves her hair doesn't

47:06.160 --> 47:11.960
move why hard to do also apparently hard to do write some fucking dialogue a

47:11.960 --> 47:18.320
fucking job and oh I had a dream that George Clooney I am alive I'm here again

47:18.320 --> 47:21.920
I came back because the story is only about a person that we don't care about

47:21.920 --> 47:25.120
that much I'm a bit another person you don't care about them much I'm back

47:25.120 --> 47:31.080
I woke up oh he's not there anymore as you fucking boo fuck that movie

47:31.080 --> 47:41.800
fucking stupid movie also if a thing blows up in orbit it's gonna move in a

47:41.800 --> 47:45.000
bunch of different directions the debris field does not move counter to the

47:45.000 --> 47:51.520
to the fake orbit of Hubble which is so far out in space that it's the farthest

47:51.520 --> 47:56.920
the fucking space shuttle mission is effort gone the Russian satellites not

47:56.920 --> 48:01.360
gonna come at it so dumb and also in the Russian guy the Russian fucking

48:01.360 --> 48:04.760
counterpart gets a bullet to the fucking helmet and it's just his head no he

48:04.760 --> 48:07.960
would fucking disintegrate and evaporate in the fucking space it's just a

48:07.960 --> 48:11.560
Russian guy with a bullet in his head stupid fuck it

48:11.560 --> 48:17.440
make a movie about two people make a movie about two people who go to fix the

48:17.440 --> 48:24.080
Hubble Space Telescope and make it call it lost in fucking space and then make a

48:24.080 --> 48:27.120
movie about two people who have to actually go through what it's like to

48:27.120 --> 48:31.560
be lost in space don't bore the fuck out of me with oh god fuck it

48:31.560 --> 48:40.080
everybody really I'm surprised I'm surprised a mission specialist was

48:40.080 --> 48:45.000
allowed out of the fucking vehicle with that much emotional trauma fucking

48:45.000 --> 48:48.560
dumb

48:50.560 --> 48:57.080

movies for were nominated for best picture were American hustle okay Captain

50:08.400 --> 50:21.920
Phillips right yeah Dallas Buyer's Club gravity her movie Nebraska I didn't say

50:21.920 --> 50:25.720
it I didn't say it she was nominated actress in that 84-year-old lady she's

50:25.720 --> 50:34.120
awesome filimino didn't say 12 years a slave and the Wolf of Wall Street yeah

50:34.120 --> 50:39.120
I didn't see Nebraska or the other one I don't know man I like I saw 12 years

50:39.120 --> 50:43.040
a slave I didn't I didn't see most of them I thought it was good but not great

50:43.040 --> 50:47.000
I thought it was a good film but not like not a spectacular film but how good

50:47.000 --> 50:51.600
does it need to be if Brad Pitt all of a sudden in the movie at the end that was

50:51.600 --> 50:55.080
very silly and egregious but he's a producer on it and that helps get a

50:55.080 --> 50:58.720
movie made in this day and age it was it wasn't the fucked up thing about that

50:58.720 --> 51:03.120
well I'm curious to I want to read that guy's actual memoirs because is there a

51:03.120 --> 51:09.520
is there an angelic like handsome like a guy from guy is just like all of a

51:09.520 --> 51:13.400
sudden after all of this betrayal and you knew when the guy from Deadwood is

51:13.400 --> 51:19.080
like in the barracks like he's from Deadwood don't like he played two

51:19.080 --> 51:22.680
different guys in Deadwood and they're all bad guys like like don't trust him

51:22.680 --> 51:26.960
he's white he's white don't get out of there it's such a heartbreaker like it's

51:26.960 --> 51:30.520
so funny watching that movie in bed when you're eating a fucking hot wings and

51:30.520 --> 51:35.920
they like just the thing like Aaron Aaron's comments included this guy can't

51:35.920 --> 51:45.160
get a break and my personal favorite which I'd actually like to talk about

51:45.160 --> 51:50.000
which is like after watching a little bit of fastbender in his ways this guy

51:50.000 --> 51:54.840
loves having slaves which is which is actually important to talk about because

51:54.840 --> 51:59.160
that was a I think that's why that movie was very interesting I don't know if

51:59.160 --> 52:02.800
it's because of how it was written or directed or act I certainly the actors

52:02.800 --> 52:06.800
are doing a fantastic job another question we both had while watching it

52:06.800 --> 52:10.960
is what is it what is that set like when they call cut what the fuck happens

52:10.960 --> 52:15.360
when you call cut on a set like that what I don't like any other set like what

52:15.360 --> 52:19.560
the fuck do you do I mean it's probably not a spoiler maybe everybody's seen it

52:19.560 --> 52:27.000
but the well slavery is abolished eventually it was labor loses but the

52:27.000 --> 52:31.440
lashing scene when he went oh my god she gets when she gets lash and that like

52:31.440 --> 52:36.360
the most most movies in my experience like like Denzel and Glory when he's

52:36.360 --> 52:40.520
getting like lashes usually the camera's facing the person getting like getting

52:40.520 --> 52:45.760
whipped yeah and and there's a lot of like horrible I think it for no other

52:45.760 --> 52:49.760
reason when they when they when they turn the camera around and the the effects

52:49.760 --> 52:56.920
the most brutal the most brutal visuals weren't the CG flesh openings on the

52:56.920 --> 53:02.920
ends of the whip but actually right before that the aerosol mist of blood

53:02.920 --> 53:09.600
coming off of backs the the the thing that was most striking to me about that

53:09.600 --> 53:14.960
movie which has nothing to do with how it was written directed acted whatever but

53:14.960 --> 53:19.680
the important thing that sunk into my 41 year old brain about American slavery

53:19.680 --> 53:27.560
which was fucking a minute ago was it was commercial and on top of it it was

53:27.560 --> 53:32.040
like untenable that like it was it was so psychotic the whole thing like every

53:32.040 --> 53:37.800
character in that movie is protesting too much and like I always that my my

53:37.800 --> 53:42.360
image as a child of the 70s is always a guy in a horse with a whip having the

53:42.360 --> 53:48.120
time of his life while a bunch of people ruthlessly like you know just do things

53:48.120 --> 53:53.400
that machines will one day be able to do and and it's horrible and they but but

53:53.400 --> 53:58.120
the the the psychology of all of it it was like I kept I kept thinking throughout

53:58.120 --> 54:02.280
the entire movie like Jesus Christ who the fuck thought this was a good idea

54:02.280 --> 54:06.600
like everybody that's doing it the people that are profiting the most are

54:06.600 --> 54:12.000
all tangled up in it like they they really need to say things to themselves and

54:12.000 --> 54:15.640
to each other over and over and over again to make this all right and more

54:15.640 --> 54:21.240
importantly like the the emphasis on commerce the idea of debt the idea that

54:21.240 --> 54:25.880
this person it wasn't just a choice between is this right or is this wrong

54:25.880 --> 54:33.200
because we as 25 year old hipsters we all go well the fuck's fun about having a

54:33.200 --> 54:37.680
slave that's not cool that's not cool I didn't see any of the nominated films

54:37.680 --> 54:41.200
but as far as that's concerned was there a dissenting voice at all among in the

54:41.200 --> 54:44.600
movie at all among the people who are like just keep your head down don't do

54:44.600 --> 54:47.520
this was there any sort of well is everybody what do you mean like like

54:47.520 --> 54:52.360
like amongst amongst the titular slaves in the film were there any everybody

54:52.360 --> 54:56.400
just people saying like like keep your head down like it's it's easier well

54:56.400 --> 54:59.800
they tell the guy you can't forget you know how to read or write yeah he can't

54:59.800 --> 55:03.320
even you don't tell anybody that you're literate because you'll actually end up

55:03.320 --> 55:07.200
getting killed which is a terrifying belly of the whale realization that he

55:07.200 --> 55:12.720
actually the key to his freedom that he thought was actually in his hand that

55:12.720 --> 55:16.480
he thought couldn't be taken away from him that doesn't mean anything compared

55:16.480 --> 55:19.440
to the color of his skin or the circumstances or what she was born so

55:19.440 --> 55:24.080
in fact the fact that he's literate actually puts him in great peril and

55:24.080 --> 55:28.560
and he walks this weird tightrope between it the the but the amazing like

55:28.560 --> 55:33.080
like I just I was blown away like oh shit this was commerce this was buying a

55:33.080 --> 55:39.000
Snickers bar this was this was the people kept saying I owe the the Shawshank

55:39.000 --> 55:46.240
farm I owe them 50 redemptions for redemptions I have to I my crops aren't

55:46.240 --> 55:49.400
just that it's at the emphasis on capitalism because that's what it fucking

55:49.400 --> 55:55.000
is and that's the thing like we we pat ourselves on the back so much for like

55:55.000 --> 56:00.480
outgrowing this concept but it's not it's just it's just barbarism combined

56:00.480 --> 56:05.960
with rampant capitalism if you in case you if you're allowed to you will abuse

56:05.960 --> 56:11.040
people there were there I this movie is nothing to do with the movie but I

56:11.040 --> 56:15.200
experienced that epiphany while watching the movie even though I I thought I

56:15.200 --> 56:18.640
understood that we had slavery and what that meant and why I should feel bad

56:18.640 --> 56:23.520
about it and I but I kind of didn't and that and that movie made me kind of

56:23.520 --> 56:26.680
think about it on a different level yeah I I sort of get what you're coming from

56:26.680 --> 56:31.400
it in that I mean the stakes are different but sort of the the capitalism

56:31.400 --> 56:36.600
involved in the machine is no different than what it is now except I do you think

56:36.600 --> 56:39.960
that people at some one of them went to the numbers and went if we know actually

56:39.960 --> 56:43.280
pay these people and give them wages they'll last longer they I'm sure it's

56:43.280 --> 56:46.720
one of the time there was a cost analysis done went wait we can make more

56:46.720 --> 56:50.720
money and these are you know our slaves or our people working for us will last

56:50.720 --> 56:55.400
longer if we help them kind of along with a you know we don't have to keep the

56:55.400 --> 56:59.520
bottom line doesn't go up that much more importantly if you were allowed to if the

56:59.520 --> 57:04.920
law said that you were allowed to as as the as the superhuman Amish Brad Pitt

57:04.920 --> 57:09.120
who comes in at the end of the end of the story comes in with this message and

57:09.120 --> 57:16.040
says to this character if if tomorrow the law said that I was allowed to treat

57:16.040 --> 57:20.720
you this way would that make it right and he can't he can't wrap his brain

57:20.720 --> 57:27.560
around it because it's so it's so based on hatred I just the I was stricken by

57:27.560 --> 57:31.000
the amount of work I don't know how much of it was based on reality with the

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
amount of work that went into for instance taking a lantern and going out

57:36.000 --> 57:39.440
to your slave hut and having all of your slaves come into your house and do a

57:39.440 --> 57:44.240
dance for you I that seems so much harder than just having slaves there's so

57:44.240 --> 57:49.240
much work I wouldn't like it was insane how fucking like what there was there

57:49.240 --> 57:53.560
wasn't about saving work he had a lot of free time come in come in come in the

57:53.560 --> 57:57.920
house everybody dance come dance then they're doing a dance the dance has to

57:57.920 --> 58:02.680
be taught to them you have to have a choreographer teach everybody and then

58:02.680 --> 58:06.640
there's all this anger you're fucking that slave I'm not fucking that slave I'm

58:06.640 --> 58:09.600
gonna throw a vase at her it's like like Jesus Christ they put a lot of work into

58:09.600 --> 58:14.000
having slaves these people all right anyways it was I thought it was a good

58:14.000 --> 58:19.600
movie I I I think it's really interesting like my first my first thought as

58:19.600 --> 58:24.880
everyone's is is oh well if you make a movie set in this world you're not allowed

58:24.880 --> 58:30.520
to not be nominated for an ask her much less win one perhaps if gravity is

58:30.520 --> 58:34.080
nominated but I think it's interesting yes of course but I think it's very

58:34.080 --> 58:38.080
interesting at what you do with that thought do you then like but you if you

58:38.080 --> 58:41.840
go to rotten tomatoes and you look at the scores and you sort them by lowest to

58:41.840 --> 58:47.360
highest like the people that I I out of morbid curiosity I went and looked at

58:47.360 --> 58:51.720
the reviews of that movie like what are what are the big detractors of this

58:51.720 --> 59:00.480
movies prestige saying and it's it's it's it's it's very strange I saw I saw a

59:00.480 --> 59:05.120
guy with a one-star review of the movie saying this is this is pornography for

59:05.120 --> 59:11.440
racists and soft-hearted lemmings and I don't I don't know if that's the most

59:11.440 --> 59:15.040
profound thing in the world you can ever say are the most idiotic I don't know

59:15.040 --> 59:18.720
what that is I think that person is generally saying oh this is this is

59:18.720 --> 59:22.520
race bait I don't know I guess if you were trying to if you were to endow that

59:22.520 --> 59:27.000
person with an IQ that's what they would I have to watch it again it's just a

59:27.000 --> 59:31.160
clinically fucking exploration it's an adaptation of the memory it doesn't the

59:31.160 --> 59:35.120
camera doesn't push down a bar while the Rolling Stones play it's not anybody

59:35.120 --> 59:38.360
here first of all black or feel strongly about that film like for better

59:38.360 --> 59:41.600
for worse anybody here we don't have there's no black people that come to

59:41.600 --> 59:46.760
this podcast where's NT when we need him he's he's having an Oscar party are

59:46.760 --> 59:53.480
you kidding me tonight's his night man the I yeah I just think I just think it's

59:53.480 --> 59:57.640
weird like like the conversation that you have between somebody that would

59:57.640 --> 01:00:06.100
bother to insist that that movie not be regarded well like at least at least a

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.880
film that that deals with important stuff like an actual like heavy matter

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.320
like wins and not some of the pithle that was nominated like yeah I'd rather

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.960
it's the only movie that's about class systems it's the only movie why aren't

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.240
the other movies why aren't the other movies dealing with the fact that there

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.320
are poor people being told what to do by rich people isn't that sort of the

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.760
point of the Oscar bait movie there was to sort of specifically go for the

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.640
things that are the hot button issues not to say that they did it just for the

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.560
purpose of the Oscar bait but that's sort of what that's that's films wheel

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.320
houses you want to kind of tackle big issues and bring to light it you know

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.480
things like that what was the film I'm really ignorant about it the the

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:51.320
documentary about Egypt and the the that when what what oh the act of

01:00:51.320 --> 01:01:00.880
killing didn't win there a lot of lot of great documentaries the 25th

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:08.000
start was great but I'm sorry I the act of killing is I threw a shoe at the

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.160
TV I how give give give 20 feet from stardom remake it next year it's two

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.960
hours of people saying over and over again that it's hard to be a backup

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.920
singer I'm sorry it's the act of killing is a fucking exploration of of the

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.840
definition of good and evil and the human condition and our capacity to lie

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.880
to ourselves and each other 20 20 from stardom is fun you know during the

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.280
acceptance speech for 20 feet of stardom they brought one of the backup

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.200
singer speech and the last half of the acceptance speech was her singing about

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.080
how happy she was yeah I don't want to take anything away from no I mean it

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.400
was a good documentary yeah it was fine all those documentaries were great I

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.920
think I saw most of them but boy god the act of killing I felt like I wanted to

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.800
run out in the street and say this is the most important film I've ever seen in

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.320
my life because it's beyond Indonesia it's beyond it's beyond killing it's

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:02.480
it goes into like what the fuck what who are we we are insane we're insane we

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:09.320
are a species of fucking liars and and and just like we swallow it down and it

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:16.120
comes up through vomit you can come to the the point of the you know strong

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.840
issues documentary versus the interesting thing documentaries like is I don't

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.200
think that necessarily one is patently better than the other did you you saw

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.640
both of them did you think that the the the the the square was patently a better

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.640
I didn't see the square I didn't see it okay someone's raising their hand yeah

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:49.200
that's always good what's your name strike one he said I'm not black

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:56.760
but isn't 12 years a slave pornographic like wouldn't you agree with that

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.520
grab a mic and come on stage with Sam or if you want to get over Sam then we

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.600
can hear you if we have to proceed that we can we can hear you for the podcast

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.480
oh yeah take taking the very difficult position of yeah it would be easy to say

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.120
okay 12 years a slave is great movie but you're saying like intellectually yeah

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:23.440
it's just I mean slavery is pretty bad but that's a but showing how bad it is

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:34.560
yeah it's I mean that was the for me was the most like that the bad stuff the

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.840
pornographic stuff was the stuff that was like oh shit this is really good but

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:46.360
other than that that's it that's like it's I mean that's like in Korea like you

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.560
you put a film about the Korean war and like North Korea and the shit that North

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.200
Korea is doing that's gonna win the equivalent of the Korean Oscars which is

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.520
what by the way I want to know it's got it's called the squeegee

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.680
doesn't I don't know are you Korean I'm sorry was it racist for me to assume you

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:15.840
knew Sam are you Korean I am Korean yeah oh it was a bad movie but did you how

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.400
old are you can ask you seem young enough I can ask how old you are that's

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:27.720
racist I'm dirty all right yes no because congratulations thank you American

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:35.120
hustle talked about class in a way I mean I wasn't speaking of class somebody

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:42.360
the crap with black people better than I think 12 years a slave because I feel

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.560
like it was okay I think I understand the point he's trying to make in that

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.240
in that a lot of these films that are these sort of Oscar the ones that are

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.280
going after the heavy issues choose to depict these scenes that are very real

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.040
that were the actual parts of you know violent parts of our history you know

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.040
the dark parts of our history just to sort of to get the reaction of people to

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.920
get them to think this is something we need to consider this is something we

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.200
need to think about and that I would say I would say that that's sort of the

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.720
point of those films isn't it a sort of I think of a lot of the films in the

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.520
past like they show those scenes that are uncomfortable for the purpose of

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.720
like getting the viewer to sort of think about it and go look but Django did a

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:28.240
better job of that but Django obviously yeah it takes place in a mythical

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.320
universe that's the danger I think that I mean you're 30 I'm 41 I think that when

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.240
I think about the concept of slavery in America and the fact that the country's

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.800
built on it all this stuff it's like this is this is right back around the

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.640
corner but the fact that I'm able to actually like in a post roots post

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:51.600
fucking everything world like I was raised in the 70s on awareness of this

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.800
shit and yet I when I watch that movie I'm still I there is something about the

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:02.240
aerosol mist of blood coming off of someone's back that I didn't receive

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:09.000
through the movie glory with Matthew Broderick I didn't I did I needed to I

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.440
needed to be brutalized I needed to watch more pornography about slavery I

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.080
did I don't know if that makes a good movie or not but I don't I don't know

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.760
it doesn't make a best picture though I but compared to these other ones I'm not

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.360
sure I didn't see two of them but I'm not sure yeah I don't I thought I mean it's

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.760
the guys putting the camera in the right places as far as I'm concerned he

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.480
didn't do anything like you know yeah I mean it wasn't it wasn't like holy shit

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.720
what a what a rock star isn't that the point is some of these films then like I

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.880
was saying to use that depiction like to sort of jog the oh wait this is

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.480
something I need to pay attention to so they can get their message across that

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.960
sort of seems to be a common theme but with that hot button going around you if

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.320
you show up to that set you put your styrofoam cup of coffee down and you're

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.800
ready to do the scene with fastbender and these other actors pick up the whip

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.440
okay this scene you're gonna do this and that isn't that a good director isn't

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.340
that a good movie if if if those people are but Django should have won but

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:17.120
Django Django's just silly and gross like that comic book idea of the

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.240
of the big well I think this comes down but this comes into a very interesting

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.440
concept because it creates a dichotomy between good movie versus these things

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.080
that often the Oscars are celebrating which is conscientious for me if you're

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.120
gonna be conscientious and make important films like not documentaries but

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.080
like but but fictional or in this case you know an annotation of a real memoir

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.600
like a really like serious heavy stuff like for me and I'd have to watch it

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.920
again to talk intelligently about it I just feel like it missed for me in some

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.720
ways and I don't know what it was Django or no no fuck Django the 12 years of

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:57.800
slave and and and like lots of films like that they you can deal with heavy

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:03.240
stuff but I don't think it elevates itself to the level of like artistic

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.520
like like achievement and film like even if even if talking to slaves a really

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.560
good adaptation of that of that memoir which I've not read which I'm hoping and

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.480
assuming is you know riveting and better I think it misses on certain levels of

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:22.000
like in terms of making a great film but then what are we replacing it with

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.560
frozen like exactly what's what is a good movie forest gump what the fuck yeah

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.600
what are we talking about I don't know I mean like like these movies that win

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.280
every year and the notable exception is the category of best screenplay which I

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.240
truly feel but now the question is like like what you know hurry I thought was

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.200
it was it was it was a pretty moving important movie I don't I don't know

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:48.200
that's best picture material either but like would it would it film that one

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.440
best picture like some of the great ones of all time like what an all about Eve

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.760
or what a castle blanc could be recognized as even a movie anymore like

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.880
would people see it would people recognize it with the Academy look at

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.400
it like yeah I don't know what their job is anymore I mean it's an institution

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.080
this idea of this like prestigious thing they did this thing tonight where

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.480
they parade it out these this benetton kids where they were like they called

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.800
them team Oscar or something did you see what I'm talking about they had like a

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:22.000
decidedly multicultural multi-ethnic like group of 25 year old kids 20 year old

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.800
kids that they they taught I didn't even understand what it was there was like

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.040
during a dub soap commercial they started teaming it up and then and then

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.320
during this Oscars they brought them out there was like seven kids they were

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.880
like helping with the production or something I was at the kind of gesture

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.480
to them it was such such just proud of station lives which are like we're not

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.160
we're not an oligarchy look look at this look at this band of proletarians and I

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.160
don't know it was weird it was like it was like to during the pre-show was like

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.440
these two the two old white producers who throw the Oscars being like talking

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.200
to all these people over webcam like we're gonna have you and pick you and pick

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.640

noticed that a lot of people were wearing clothes lots of clothes so we

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.940
thought if we could put as many clothes as possible on these people that I think

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:58.140
that would well represent the era so we just kept putting clothes on people

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:02.740

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:24.420
you're not being interviewed he liked that philosophy so much that he was like

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:26.860
well I guess their silence was deference I don't know sounds as

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:35.620
consented okay so you were the silent ones you consented to what's about to

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.540
happen is what I'm saying I think they heard the word consent and assumed that

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.860
that meant that said people want to be raped or I don't know what that's on you

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:50.340
silence is consent is a phrase it's your own weird fetishes and perversions all

don't exist you find it any science textbook you ever read I don't know if

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:20.940
you've ever read a book but if you had you might find it's not the periodic table

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:35.220
of elements so to speak I got a problem with the way you talk to me you got a

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:40.900
certain condescension about you certain heirs you take with me that I won't

01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:49.500

I'm condescending but I don't think you'd understand seems to me like this

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:29.020
killer is doing things because he's some kind of pervert all right he's not a

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:33.820
pervert Marty if anything he's a messiah

at least that's how he sees himself this wasn't about sex excuse me for missing

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:46.420
the part of the Bible where Jesus come down from the cross and diddle a little

01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:52.780

office okay and this time for good why is it in Texas when we see all sorts of

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:15.500
weird shit where every other cop in the bullpen and every other actor standing

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:20.180
behind you and everybody every extra in this seems to look more like a policeman

01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:25.580
than both of you to what makes you think you can be this good looking and mumble

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:31.220

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:37.460
Hollywood and I just gained a little bit of it back what role was that Dallas

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:48.100

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.780
Pakistan hey if you weren't so good-looking

01:34:44.780 --> 01:35:01.780
it's a Pakistani it's a good show I'm looking forward to it's a golden age of

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.980
television when it's a new thing about TV is it's not it doesn't it's it's about

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:09.660
it's now it's it's it they're owning up to the fact that these are just mini

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:13.620
series yeah this thing's gonna have an ending yeah it's great and if it's a

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:19.260
bad ending then he'll own up to it I'm Twitter buddies with the creator I don't

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:25.420
want to suffocate him we're friends he's a big fan of my work I don't want to

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:32.100
suffocate him you're a fan of his show no I hate his show what the fuck I was

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:39.540
gonna say a mumble brag because they mumble a lot in that shit I asked him I

01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:42.660
asked I said there because I noticed he was following me so I started following

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:47.700
him and then I direct message him is this Nick Pizzolato yeah and I said hey

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:52.140
do you want do you ever want to hang out have a drink and or come on Harmon

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:55.900
Town and talk about that and he said in his response was I'd love to have a

01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:02.380
drink sometime he won't be coming on the show have you met him in person no

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:08.340
okay but you will best friends it's a great show it really is I was hooked

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:11.940
from the beginning it didn't take me two and a half episodes I was I was into

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:14.780
I watched you in a half back-to-back I would have made it to three but I felt

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:18.900
sick cuz you know like 3 a.m. so I finally just like dozed off something

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:29.140
strange about a man that refuses to enjoy a TV show a lot of bad ones out

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:36.500
there a lot of good ones so what's the difference between one you choose to

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:40.180
accept why is he talking like that is it is that him doing an accent like he's

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:44.660
trying to be more Texan than what he also did he get in a horrible accident is

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:48.060
it me or is his nose he's not from nose is broken to like he has like a weird

01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:53.580
scar across his nose and his nose he's making his bed for iconography I think

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:59.460
he wants to do impressions of him he's overacting and all the I really like

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:04.180
him in all that I fucking you're a son of a bitch Jeff your son of a bitch you've

01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:10.500
you've been a curmudgeon he's the gravity of actors you're a curmudgeon you

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:15.140
don't like gravity I fucking hate gravity he went off on it for a million

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:20.620
minutes gravity it was all from watching again make them Dan you're a writer it's

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:28.300
not I'm a reader I'm not an aerospace engineer damn it Jim the science flaws

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.780
and they are totally like who gives a fuck what's a lightsaber I don't give a

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.780
fuck tell me the rules make them up the other sound in space if you say so George

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.500
Lucas like maybe tell a story there's no fucking movie in that movie it's just a

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.300
bunch of stupid it could have been caught I could have called I've been

01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.500
called that drive driveway but they could have made a driveway movie I don't

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.620
understand why they make they could have made a driver movie it would have been

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:56.260
just as good or bad no it wouldn't have been it would have been worse you're

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.620
right it would have been worse only because the only thing good about that

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.300
movie is it happens in space but that's a lot of great thing to happen in a

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:09.420
movie certainly then give give give the cinematographer an award they did but

01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:13.020
don't give anybody else an award in that fucking movie because a movie fucking

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:17.340
stinks it stinks nothing happens make a movie about lost in space it's exciting

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:20.860
material and Aaron keeps telling me I'm not a feminist just because I keep

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:25.660
saying Sandra Bullock's ass looks great at 50 listen they knew that her ass looked

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:31.900
great that's why yeah her ass was but not her whole ass that's that's that's

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:37.420
that's like I just I just know they didn't computer generate her ass you

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:42.340
get the end of the movie you you can air breath you can airbrush cellulite and

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:47.180
stuff or whatever but but but she I'm saying I don't I'm making a joke now as

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.780
that because it irritates Aaron because I keep saying like I'm a feminist because

01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:57.020
I'm like you go girl it's funny to me I don't know I think the definition of

01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:01.100
feminism has become very funny because it's about you consume media along with

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:04.140
everyone else and then based on whether you think the frozen lady should have

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:09.180
like worn one outfit or another you can call yourself a feminist people had

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:14.340
tumbler right right right to things and they go like oh Brit is the betrayal of

01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:18.380
but I just think it's funny that we all consume media like a bunch of fucking

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:24.620
disgusting larvae like sucking on these tubes that come from the Ministry of

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:28.260
Propaganda and that the difference between a so-and-so and such and such is

01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:36.500
people who go let's taste like vanilla I got a shamrock one I think it's silly I

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:42.500
don't think it's revolutionary to to post an emoji of an eye roll after

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.820
something that you didn't like on Deadwood I don't think that that counts

01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:51.100
as progress yeah that's contributing yeah but gravity is not a good movie

01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:59.740
frozen also did you float away in space would that I had come out with that I

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:03.660
didn't like it I did I had a great time at the movies watching it I thought it

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:07.100
was gorgeously shot and it is very sexy and good-looking and technically

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:11.420
wonderful I just think that they wasted an awesome opportunity to tell a story

01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:16.460
about what that might be like thank you beef steak bills on my side all right

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.980
the elephant in the room is Spencer once again taking the week off yeah we got

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:24.540
kumail status now he comes and goes as he pleases we have a chair over there like

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:28.700
like that like that it seems like a packing tape on a block died there's

01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:32.820
that photo of the microphone was nobody there I don't want to I don't want to

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:37.820
I mean should I see taking guys through a little two-person adventure well we

little I didn't want some iced tea D&D real quick before we get out I could do

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:57.740

Center Phaser's on fun.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.940
Center bollocks, it's stranded in space.

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.240
She doesn't know what to do.

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.440
She's got a can of mace.

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.460
She's got to spray her tubes all around.

01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.240
George Clooney got a fucking mama like my name was Mickey

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.880
Rooney, got a thing around my foot, got an earth in the

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.520
distance, a bunch of mama like my name was Herbie Instance.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.400
All right, OK, all right.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.840
That's obviously, you can see the writing on the wall there.

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.000
So I'm gonna keep making up new last names.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.360
To rhyme, to rhyme with it.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.680
And the name you made up was Herbie Instance.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.200
These are those as the name.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.600
The first one could easily have been a name.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.880
Dan, what we haven't done is you accepting an award.

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.240
What award would you accept?

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.480
Best person.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.880
Best person.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.240
All right, well.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.720
Best rap and a major motion picture.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.640
Best, somebody in the audience yelled best.

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.760
OK, best rap.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.240
And I'll do each rap for each of the nominees, too.

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.120
But you and Camille have to present them.

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.400
But you picked who we are.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.360
This is going to be the ultimate improv bet, OK.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.160
You and Camille are.

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.080
The presenters, you pick for the best rap.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:44.760
OK.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:45.880
Dan, you announce us who we are.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.000
You throw it to each clip.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:47.760
Do you understand?

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.080
Yes, yes, yes.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.600
All right.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.880
Dan, be the, be the announcer.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.240
OK.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.440
And he's going to say who we are.

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:55.320
OK.

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.720
Oh, presenting the award for best rap and a motion picture.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.480
Here are Dr. Smith and Mr. Pickles.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.040
I want to be the doctor.

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:14.080
You know, Mr. Pickles, when I was a boy, rap was a thing

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.920
that you put on food where you wanted to store it for another

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920
day.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.640
I remember the first time I heard one of these talk songs.

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.440
I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.120
But now there's a whole category.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.720
So, eh.

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.440
And the nominees for best rap, song, and a major motion picture

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.440
are Mr. Fistabut in Gravity.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:46.920
Yo, yo, can't fly.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.640
I've got to float through the outer space sky.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.120
I want to, I can see Africa below me.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.480
But I, I can't puke and I can't even pee.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:57.520
I'm Sandra Bullock in the house and my name is Space Lost.

01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.560
I fucked your mama because my name is Bob Ross.

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.880
I fucked your mama because my name is Bob Ross.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.880
I don't know if that one's going to win.

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.880
I don't know if that's going to win.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.880
Next nominee is The Butt Candle Remix from Wolf of Wall Street.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.360
Yo, butt candle, light in the handle.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.880
I got a wick inside my rectum.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:29.880
I fucked your mama so hard I started to rectum.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.880
It seems like the same word, but I fucked your mama so hard

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:33.880
my dick was a turd.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:36.880
I put it up.

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.880
Very moving.

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:42.880
Very moving.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:48.880
Brad Pitt and The Funky Bunch from 12 Years a Slave.

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.880
Yo, yo, slavery's wrong.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.880
Yo, that's the name of the song.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.880
Brad Pitt and I'm here to say I'd like to deliver your letter today.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.880
You can trust me, I'm a good white man.

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.880
I'm going to do right, man.

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.880

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.880

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:55.880
Frontal lobe's gonna icecapade, gonna go to my dick.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.880
I want to suck your titties till the saliva's slick,

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.880
but then it freezes, my tongue's stuck on it.

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:05.880
I fucked your mama so hard, my name is Henry Bonnet.

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.880
Yo, yeah, gangster rapper.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.880
Put my tongue on your little nipple.

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.880
I'm gonna put my hand in, it starts to slipple down.

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:15.880
Makeup words.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.880
Yo, my dick is like a turd.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.880

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:34.880
All right, should we?

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.880
And the Oscar for Best Rap Song in a Major Motion Picture goes to...

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:44.880
Ice Tea for Snowman Titties is Mighty Cold from Frozen.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.880
Yeah.

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.880
All right, yeah, thank you.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.880
Yeah.

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:55.880
All right, sweet.

01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:00.880
This good Hold This Award is made of gold,

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.880
but not the kind that's important.

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:13.880
In 1938, Amanda T. squirted a fetus out from a baby.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:17.880
A fetus out from her vagina into the world.

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:23.880
And its hand immediately grabbed a microphone.

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.880
What came next was Kismet.

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:34.880
I recorded my first album in 1948,

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.880
and I've been kicking out the jams ever since.

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:43.880
Charles N. Heston tried to stop me and couldn't.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.880
I was in Trespass, New Jack City.

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:53.880
I had a featuring appearance in Mr. T's comic book,

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.880
which I didn't agree to initially,

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.880
but signed off on later after I saw it.

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:01.880
I'm proud.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.880
I digress.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.880
You know what? AIDS is bad.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:08.880
Wait, hold it.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.880
Oh, shit.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.880
Yo, yo, AIDS is bad.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.880
Yo, the worst disease I've ever had.

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:18.880
It attacks your stem cells and gets in your white cells.

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:22.880
I got your T cells in all your HIV.

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:25.880
It's the worst way you can ever be.

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.880
It needs to be health care.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.880
Yo, go up the golden stair to the heaven where there's too many angels,

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.880
too many wings, and too many angels.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.880
This show is dedicated to my friend,

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:38.880
my friend, my friend Angel.

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.880
Everybody's going to be at the gate.

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.880
Yo, AIDS.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.880
Yo, AIDS is bad.

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.880
Best worst disease I've ever had.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.880
It gets in your blood and makes more of itself.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:48.880
You're about to leave.

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.880
I want to put HIV on the shelf.

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.880
It's too many angels in heaven today.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:55.880
I want to fuck, I want to stick up for the gaze.

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.880
It's enough fucking bad disease.

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.880
Yo, get it with ease.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.880
No, but you shouldn't.

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.880
Don't get it.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.880
Wait, you're all allowed to stand up and walk out of the building.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.880
Yo, can't leave if you leave.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:09.880
You love AIDS.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:10.880
Yo, AIDS rap.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.880
That's not true.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.880
AIDS rap because I'm here to say my name is Ice T and I'm going to rap all day.

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.880
I'm going to rap till midnight for the next two hours.

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.880
AIDS is my lyrical flower.

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.880
It's going to grow up from the soil of my mind.

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:26.880
Dropping science is what you will find.

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.880
Ice T and I'm rapping by AIDS.

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.880
Going to put it in the garbage called Rubbermaid.

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:33.880
Going to lift the cover, put it inside.

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.880
Fuck your mama, tell her butthole was wide.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.880
What's this bitch whispering to you?

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.880
What's she think she's going to do?

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.880
Ain't nobody going to leave till I'm done.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.880
The movie is coming out of South by Southwest this weekend.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.880
AIDS is bad.

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.880
Yo, worse disease that you ever had.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.880
Yo, yo, yo, AIDS is bad.

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.880
It's the worst disease that you ever had.

01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:59.880
Number one killer of the best people.

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.880
Church, open the steeple.

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.880
Let them, let them inside.

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.880
Put your butthole open wide.

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.880
You got to, AIDS, AIDS is bad.

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.880
You got to, worse disease that you ever had.

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:12.880
Why is nobody leaving?

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.880
You got to get a cure.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.880
Ice T is the number one.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:19.880
Original gangster, come on down.

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.880
AIDS gets a crown.

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.880
Yo, it's Oscar night.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.880
He's doing it wrong.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.880
Red carpet for AIDS tonight.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.880
You got to, you got to get an award.

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.880
Fuck your mama, what you think is a solo?

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.880
Red carpet for AIDS.

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.880
Red carpet for the AIDS tonight.

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.880
Show's fucking over.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.880
Come to Harmontown in South by Southwest.

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.880
Tell all your friends.
