I'm not racist.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:25.000\nCarlos, Jesus.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nCharlie Jesus is here tonight, everybody.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:33.000\nI am nomenclaturely racist.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:36.000\nI was like, Carlos, Jesus, what's the difference?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nYeah, I'll cop to that.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nI will not cop to what that sounded like,\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nlike I looked at his face and was like,\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nit's either Carlos or Jesus, right?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:50.000\nAnyways, where was I?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nOh, I got dropped off by another Uber driver.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nYeah, by a different guy.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:04.000\nAnd he had his phone on like a holder.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nGood night, folks.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nForget it.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nIt was like, you know, it was mounted on the dash.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:13.000\nAnd so at this time I saw, and he said the same thing.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:16.000\nHe goes, I remember now, he was dropping off at the airport\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nand he goes, thank you very much.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nI make five stars.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nAnd as he said it, he gave me five stars on his app.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nOh.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nI make a five stars.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:34.000\nIt wasn't like Luigi going, I make a five stars.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nIt was like, I make a five stars for you.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nI make a pizza.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nI make a sandwich.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nFor you, I make a five stars.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nFor me, you make a five stars.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:47.000\nIt was like a beauty.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.000\nYeah.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nNow it all of a sudden made sense.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nAll right.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nI had a guy last night say literally,\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nnow please give me five stars.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nLike he just said it straight up.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nYou got to admire the, I don't know if I should call it naivete.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:04.000\nLike the star system, how is this working?\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nLike you got to admire the pluck because of the people\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nwho actually are like, you know what?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nI have been told to value the stars.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nThat that is like a sub currency.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nAnd I will, oh my God, it's already 9-11.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nWe didn't, it's, I mean.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nNo, guys, we fell back a tower last night.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nIt's not, yes, you're right.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nNo, I agree with you.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nIt stops being funny when it stops being about the number\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nand about the significance of it.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nWhenever it becomes anything specific, it's like gross.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nI would deserve it if someone stood up and said,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:50.000\nmy dad died an hour ago.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:55.000\nSo anyways, so, wait, what were you talking about?\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nMake a five stars.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nWe were done with that, but.\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nHave we moved on?\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nHave we?\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nI think, did we move on?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:06.000\nWell, no, you were talking about the pluck of people obsessed.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nOh, the star system.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nThe star system.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nWhat is that?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nI don't get it.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nWhy do I have 4.8 stars?\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nI'll tell you why.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nBecause obviously you can't, you can never trump capitalism.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nThis is the problem.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nI agree.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nWe need a star system.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nWe need Yelp for people.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nI wouldn't even kick that thing out of bed.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nThe meow meow being saying, because what we need is a moral code.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nWe need like a fucking Jedi code so that money can just be about money.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:39.000\nLike if you want a bigger car, if you want to get to work faster, if you want your shoes\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:44.000\nto be made out of licorice, I don't know a lot about luxury.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nI see how you connect those dots.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nThen you use this thing called money, and that's like a thing that you use as a medium\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nof exchange.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nMost of those freemium games have two forms of currency.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:59.000\nThey're using it to fuck you over, because if you had just had one, you could figure\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nout how to funnel it all into one, and you could beat the whole system.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:06.000\nCapitalism is based on one form of currency, which is the dollar.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nYou introduce these stars, here's the problem.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nSo these guys, they're told you're not supposed to accept tips, right?\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nBut somebody's tipping them, and that's why they keep getting out and like wanting to\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nopen the door, because that's when they get the tip.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nSomebody's tipping them.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nAnd that's why I have 4.8 stars.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nI use lift, and they never get out of the car to open the door.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nI want to talk to you about lift.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nWe're talking in circles.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nBut a lot of lift drivers are also Uber drivers.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nThey all have this Uber sticker in their window.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nThey're all moonlight.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nAnd it's all unregulated and dangerous?\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nI have a question, Dan.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nDid you go out last night for Halloween, and I know your back has been hurting you.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nYou did a show last night, right?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:47.000\nYeah, I did a show last night.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nI went to a show, but I drove through West Hollywood.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nI saw a lot of people dressed up.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nThere were a million people dressed up as bananas last night.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nDid anybody else?\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nI saw groups of bananas, like a bunch of bananas walking around.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nWhich I go, okay, there are a bunch of bananas.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nBut also, I saw a bunch of singular bananas all night long.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nI thought you were going to say cops.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.000\nI was blown away, no pun intended, by how many fucking fake...\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.000\nAll right, you know what?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nFuck you pun intended.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nSuck on it.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nGood pun.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nHere's some other things I intended.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nCommunity, Rick and Morty.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nAnd that pun.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nThree, my trilogy.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nIt's your legacy.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nGeorge Lucas without a cause.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nBut no, I saw so many drunk, not real cops.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:52.000\nLike, fratty dudes just like, this will be a fun costume.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nI'm not saying you're a bad person for picking a costume.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nI'm just like, are you insane?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:04.000\nLike, there are shooting people for carrying towels on not Halloween.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.000\nLike, you are dressed as a fucking cop with a gun on your head.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nBut are they going with the safest costume of all time?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nYou think the cops are just like, oh, he's fine.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nNo, I mean, this happened a couple of Halloween's ago.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nThere was that party.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nAnd like, there was a fracas or something happened.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nThe neighbors called the police.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nThe cops came to the door.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:31.000\nOne of the guys in the party was dressed as a cop, had a gun, was like, you know,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nI'll take care of this or whatever.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nAnd the cops are like, bang, boom, bang, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nI don't mean to glorify it.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nBoom, boom, boom, bang, bang.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:48.000\nThe hammer, the trigger, everybody's bigger than life.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nYeah, you applauded my choice of rhyme.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nNow who's racist?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:58.000\nYeah, I just thought, because I was like, I barely went out in public\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nand I encountered so many dudes.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nThere was one guy that was outside the silent movie theater.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nI was like talking to some guys and a window rolled down\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nand a guy went, hey, guys.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nAnd looked over and it was like a, just looked like a, you know,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nlike Michael Sarah dressed as a cop.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nLike just a young looking guy.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nI was just dressed as a guy.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nI was like, hey, you're in arrest for partying.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nWhere's the party?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nWas it Andy Dick?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nIt was like, he was just out of his mind and he was wearing a badge\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nthat said, you know, the Pee Wee Academy.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nBut you know, I bet he had a, I'm just saying like, holy shit, man.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nAlso, I went to the Hollywood Bowl last night\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nto see the Danny Elfin Nightmare Before Christmas thingy.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nDid anybody go to that?\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nNope.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nIt's going on right now. I think they did it two nights.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nSo get over there.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nAnd one of the things, I was pretty surprised.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nYeah, you saw a lot of Jack Skellington's and Sally's,\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:03.000\nbut there was more Beetlejuices than anybody else.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:08.000\nThere was a lot of Beetlejuices at the Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nThat was pretty funny.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nIt's like guys that were a little too old\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nwere kind enough to be Jack Skellington.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:19.000\nI used to be Jack Skellington like five years ago, man,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nbut now it's like...\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nThat's a hard one to pull off. He's pretty thin.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nHe's a Skellington.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nI met Danny Elfin.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nOh yeah, did you?\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nYeah. The end.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nHe was very nice.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nWhat kind of party was it? Did you have to leave your body at the door?\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nI did, but the thing was...\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:45.000\nCan we get a camera on this guy?\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:49.000\nFind your cameras, Dan. Find your camera.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nHe sang the song.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:59.000\nHe sang all the Jack Skellington parts throughout the...\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nThe orchestra played to the movie.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd Pee-wee Herman came out, and Catherine O'Hara came out,\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nand Greg Prips was there, which is why I got together.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nAnd they all sang their bit from the movie.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd at the end, he came out with a guitar on,\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nand everybody flipped out, and he goes,\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nI said I would never do this.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nIt's been 20 years since I played this to the day.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nAnd he was like, I was never going to sing this fucking song again.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:29.000\nAnd he sang Dead Men's Party, and it got off to kind of a rocky start.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nDoes anyone know why he would make a promise like that?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nI think he was like sick of that.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nI got the impression that song was he was sick of playing it.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nOn Halloween, especially probably.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nI get sick of stuff, but I don't always go like,\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nlike, here I go again.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nI'm honest, I'd never jerk off in this position.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nI swore it!\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nYou're welcome. I have returned.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nOne knee.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nEdge of the bed. Lampshade.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nYou knew on one knee?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nI promised I would never would.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nSince the 1989 disc slip.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nWhen you said that you were a kneeler, when you jerk off,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.000\nI always thought you were like in a very supplicant, both knees, you know.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\nYeah, I am. Hail Mary for the grace kind of thing.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nI painted myself into a corner about like,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nhow many positions could you jerk off?\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nAnd which one would you get tired of and then return?\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nSo now I'm pitching you in a full T-bow, you know, on one knee.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nYeah.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nYeah, that takes too much time.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nSee, that's why you subscribed to the show,\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nso you can see that visual company.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nYeah, for those of you listening to the free podcast.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\n$5 buys you the worst visual of your life.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nI jerky-afflected.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nYou can figure it out.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nAlright, so, I know.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nSpencer, did you dress up last night?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nDid you do anything for Halloween?\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nOh, no. Oh, no.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nDo you ever dress up for Halloween?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nNot often. I don't do much.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nWhat was the last Halloween costume that you can recall that you wore?\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nUh...\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nUh...\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nThis seems like a painful place for you.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nYeah, well, it was like my whole life it's been all like,\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\noh, I guess like, no one's doing anything this Halloween.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nI guess I'm not gonna do anything, and then I find out everyone's doing anything.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nBut, you know, these days I'm so popular that I'm like,\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\noh, no one invited me to anything, and then it's like 12.30,\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nand I see there's like five Facebook invitations that I just never saw,\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:42.000\nand I was like, oh, I guess I was invited.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nThis is a completely, it feels exactly the same as not having been invited.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nYeah.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nSo, I guess it's not my fault.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nIf you had seen the invitations like six days ago, would you have tried to...\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nI would have been like, ah, great, this is awesome.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:03.000\nAnd then I would have been in the exact same position at 12.30 p.m. that night.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:09.000\nThey just slide right off like a duck's fat.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nWhat if the duck's fat is sliding off of ducks?\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:18.000\nYeah, you know when you're searing duck meat in the pan and the fat just slides right off?\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nRight.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nOf the pan?\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:22.000\nNo, off of the duck.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nWho is the duck in this metaphor?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:31.000\nWell, I mean, I guess I would be the duck, and then the fat would...\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:39.000\nNo, my memory would be the duck, and then the fat would be the invitations sliding out of my memory.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nAnd into the pan of...\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nOf regret.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nDisappointment, yeah.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nSo the flame is Halloween.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:56.000\nWell, I think the flame is the warmth of other people, and, you know...\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:02.000\nThat's only on because that's sentimental sounding, it still doesn't scan.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:08.000\nYeah, no, the warmth of other people is a catalyst that renders his fat.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nYeah.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:18.000\nBut I'm always wearing the... I'm always wearing the oven mitt of detachment and fear.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nSo this is kind of...\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nYou know, you have to get one of those...\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nIt's the...\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:33.000\nIt's a giant over-the-range vent of child abuse.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nThe fume hood of abuse.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nYeah.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nIt sucks everything right out of the house.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:44.000\nIncluding the vapors of parental mistrust, or...\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nEverything.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nThe stench of drug abuse.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nNothing's ever happening in your kitchen.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nIt's just like...\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nTrust no one.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd you'll never get hurt.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nWhat would, like, if you had a spatula, what would that be?\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:05.000\nCould it be the spatula of rearranged priorities?\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nAll right, one bit.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nAll right.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:13.000\nI was high with Dino, and it came up with a bit.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nThese are always good.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nI think... I can't remember how it came about.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nIt shouldn't be important, right?\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nSmall talk pizza.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nIt was an idea for a pizza place.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nIt's called small talk pizza.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:31.000\nBut it's... after the apocalypse, like, there's these places.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:38.000\nLike, the only... you know, like, you ever see, like, or read or see a boy and his dog, like, kind of post-apocalypse,\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nwhere it's just, like, everything's just a wasteland,\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:44.000\nand all anybody wants to do is create, like, a semblance of the old world,\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:48.000\nbut they just have, like, tents where they're showing, like, porn movies for a piece of aluminum,\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:54.000\nand, like, everything's just sad, and everyone's sterile, and just, like, dying of cancer.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:59.000\nSo, like, in that world, in that post-apocalyptic wasteland,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:04.000\nI think, like, there could be one franchise that would be popular with everybody.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nIt would be called small talk pizza.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nEveryone would respect it.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:12.000\nIt would be, like, a place where you put all your guns down when you go in,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nand, like, while you're in there, you can't acknowledge that the apocalypse happened.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:23.000\nYou can't acknowledge that the stakes have ever been higher than the weather,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:27.000\nor, like, you know, I'm in touch with the wife, you know?\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nAnd it's just, that's what's for sale.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:33.000\nThe pizza's got, like, maggots on it, but it's just, like, it's called small talk pizza,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nand it's, like, people are, like, man, I can't wait to get to this.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nThey're, like, oases in the post-apocalypse.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:44.000\nI want to get to the next small talk pizza, and then people, everyone, just role plays,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\npretending that there's a different world outside the pizza place,\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:52.000\nand then eventually they can't, they don't have any more aluminum to pay,\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nand then they get kicked out, and they get shot,\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:00.000\nand they get turned into more pizza, probably, in the maggot farms.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:04.000\nI learned that from that Mad Max game, maggot farms.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nUm, all right.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nI don't want to work on maggot farms anymore.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nAll right, one more thing.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nWhat? Wait, I didn't get that one.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nIt's a really awesome reference.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nIt's way above you, man.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nOkay, good.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nYou heard those applause. Those were smart people applause.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:25.000\nIt's like an NPR level of a funny bone.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:30.000\nA very sophisticated, vigorous clap from eight people.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nAll right, yes, no, he did paint Starry Night.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:42.000\nUm, the, uh, this is just making fun of somebody, but it's a beloved somebody.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:47.000\nLike, I was, I was with Dino, I was hanging out with my ex-girlfriend, I.O.,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:52.000\nwho some people like, like, like, like, like will know, like, she's like kind of the basis\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nfor Britta from community and the, like, the aspects of her that sort of like.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nShe speaks in yogi-beraism.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nShe's like, she gets a lot of shit wrong, like, like.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:06.000\nBut it ends up making a weird kind of logical sense in a, in a, in a very wrong.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nPolitically, Britta is just me.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nLike, she just wants all the rich people to burn.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nLike, for instance, a long time ago, she's in a band and she said,\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nhey, guys, my band's playing tomorrow night.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nYou should all come.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd I said, what time do you go on?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:21.000\nBetween 7.30, 9 o'clock sharp.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nYeah.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nAnd then sometimes she'll say stuff that like, actually, actually like,\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nactually kind of trumps the, the idiom.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nLike, she was talking about somebody that lost their enthusiasm.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:33.000\nHe has them as like, man, he's been through all these experiences and he almost got this.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nAnd then, and then it got taken away from him.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nIt just took the sales right off his boat.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nLike, actually, that's better.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nYeah.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nThat's, that's worse than the wind out of your sail.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nYeah.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nThat's trivializing.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nThe wind changes.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nLike, you know.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nThe wind might come back.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nYou got no sales.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nYou're fucking doomed.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nHer father was like, like, like, her parents are separated.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:56.000\nHer father was like on the string of, you know, he's kind of a senior citizen.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nAnd he's like, oh, he's just dating this girl and he's dating that girl.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nI mean, he's a real Don Quixote.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nYeah.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nShe met Don Juan.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nSo, so like, so a couple of nights, whenever we were hanging out, like,\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nI had to write it down because we found out, because we were talking about her grandma.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nAnd I was like, when I was, when I was dating her years and years and years ago,\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nI was like, oh, I remember your grandma.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nWe picked you up from the airport.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nAnd we, you know, she, she was already starting to succumb to dementia.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nSo she grabbed someone else's suitcase.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:25.000\nWe didn't know that until I like, clipped the lock on it and like, pulled it open.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nThere's a black family scuba diving in a photo.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:30.000\nAnd it's like, we got to go back to LAX.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nThe, we were just talking about that story.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nAnd it was funny.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nAnd, and, and, and like, she's like, that grandma has passed.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:41.000\nAnd, and, and then I, I know who loved her grandma very much.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\nShe's like, she's like, you know, she's gone now that she, and I was like, yeah,\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nshe lived, she lived for a long time, mission accomplished.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nShe's like, yeah, yeah.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:57.000\nBut still, I mean, yeah, good riddance grandma.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nAnd we were like, wait, what?\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nThis is like, what?\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nI love my grandma.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nI don't think we should joke around about her.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:09.000\nI was like, you, what, no, what did you just say?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nYou said good riddance grandma.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nShe's like, yeah, I loved her.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:15.000\nLike, like, like, like, it's like, I hope she has a good, good, good time.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nAnd like, wherever she is, it's like.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nGood riddance to bad boobies.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nGood riddance.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nBad to explain.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nThat's not what that means.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nShe thought it was like, good riddance.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:27.000\nIt's like, for my homies, you know, like, good, good riddance.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:33.000\nLike, like, like, you've been, you've been rid of existence and.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nAnd good on you.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nIt's funny because it's like, it's like, yeah, well, why do, you know,\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nwhy, why wouldn't good riddance mean that?\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nI mean, it doesn't, it's arbitrary.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:44.000\nIt's just funny that it was like, how did she avoid that?\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nAll right.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nAll right.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nYeah, my chiropractor fucked up my back.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:51.000\nI couldn't go to the Minecraft creators Halloween party.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nYou know what?\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nI got it pretty bad.\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:00.000\nBut I want to know, do you know anything about the Minecraft\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nfor creators Halloween party?\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nI know.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:07.000\nI mean, dude, that guy, he created Minecraft.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:12.000\nHe created Minecraft, which I've been playing for my whole life.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nAnd he lives in LA now.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nAnd he like, what he bought, I don't know how much,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nI don't want to scare him off if he likes his privacy or whatever.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nI talked to him on Twitter.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:23.000\nSo I don't want to, I don't want to fuck up the friendship.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nBut I think it's a matter of public record that like,\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:31.000\nwhen he moved to LA, he, he fucking like, outbid Jay-Z on a house.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:36.000\nIt was like, and, and, and like, you can look up the house and there's a YouTube video.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:40.000\nIt's like, like, like when, when houses get to a certain level,\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:44.000\nthere's like a video for the house that's like,\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nlike Christopher Nolan shot it.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:51.000\nBut like, like, like I got crew and it's like, and it's, and no shame\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nbecause it's like, oh, you're paying this much money for a house.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nThe reason you're going to do, it's like, you click on this YouTube video\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nand it's like, like, like, like a sports car pulls up\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:05.000\nand two women who are clearly professional escorts get out of the car.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:09.000\nLike a Lamborghini and they just walk into the house,\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nbut they don't live there. They clearly do not live there.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:15.000\nAnd so the insinuations are already crazy.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nLooks like that they're just like, oh, here we are.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:20.000\nLike that's always like, yeah, I mean, we're not saying these women come with the house,\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:26.000\nbut let's face it, this house will bring these women to your door\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:31.000\nand a Lamborghini, they'll just be, their ways will tell them like,\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:36.000\nis this guy kind of like, is he kind of dashing figure?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:40.000\nNo, no, no, he's not. He's a nerd, you know, but, but he's a bazillionaire.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nAnd so, and, and, and, but the house is just insane.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nIs this money all just that one game or is he, is he have a budget?\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:50.000\nYeah, basically. I mean, it's like he, he saw it because he created a game\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:55.000\nand like sold a subscription to it, dealt honestly with the marketplace\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nand said, all you have to do ever once in your life.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:02.000\nLike I've put a total of $20 into Minecraft or whatever it is because I got an,\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:07.000\nyou get an account that licenses you to keep playing the game as it develops.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:10.000\nNow it's done developing, but my, I still get to play the game\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:13.000\nand everyone gets to mod it, you know, whatever.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nI'll do it on a different podcast.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nHe sold the game to Microsoft.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nRight. The game is now bought by Microsoft.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:22.000\nThe fucking, they're making a movie at Warner Brothers.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:26.000\nIt's like he himself can't even keep track of like, of what's going on.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nYou know, I, I, I like, I tweeted him after I came out of a like Warner Brothers meeting.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nI was like, man, do you know who's making this movie and what they're talking about?\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nHe's like, nope. I don't know. Fuck you.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.000\nI just, I'm just, I've got to go.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nJay-Z's trying to get onto the compound.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:49.000\nHe's stacking a thousand dollar bills and trying to get Beyonce to like lift him over the gate\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:53.000\nbecause he wants to kiss my garage, but I won't let him.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:57.000\nI would just sneak in the back of one of those Lamborghinis. Those girls are driving.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:03.000\nYeah. You could definitely like easily fit an adult male in one of their cleavages.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:12.000\nYou could have just like kangarooed in there, taken a bottle of wine and bought a normal sized house downhill.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nAnyways, let's bring out our guests.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:19.000\nMy God, what an important guest we have tonight.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:24.000\nI would, is national treasure too high-flown to describe our next guest?\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nYeah.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:33.000\nBut I still feel like, you know, we're entertainers. We work in the entertainment industry,\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nwhether we like it or not, Dan and Spencer.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:40.000\nAnd I think there's a rule of entertainment that says give the people what they want.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nYes. Yes, no, it's true.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:47.000\nWhether they think they deserve it or not, whether they actually want it or not.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:53.000\nNo, most people want it, you know, and I've been honest about the fact that I don't.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nI don't like this person.\n\n25:55.000 --> 26:04.000\nI've known him long enough to make that decision, you know, and there's a peace to that, you know?\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:08.000\nLike, I don't like you. I don't like you. You're a bad person.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:12.000\nYou're immature and you're selfish.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:17.000\nAnd then, but then he says, you know, that's you.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nBut let's just talk to him about...\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:24.000\nBring him out, William H. Macy.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:30.000\nPlease welcome director, writer, artist, close horse...\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nClose horse!\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nHolocaust denier, Rob Schrab!\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:47.000\nOh, shit!\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:52.000\nThe camera likes it if you sit there.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nWhat's that?\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:59.000\nThe camera likes it if you sit there.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:04.000\nIt's a better stage picture.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:08.000\nHow you doing, Dan? Yo?\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:13.000\nHey, everybody, I'm back.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nDon't get excited.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:18.000\nI was away for a while and I don't always listen to the episodes.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nI snuck in while you were gone!\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:24.000\nAnd I got to say, I listened to that one because there was such a media sensation.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nAnd it was really good.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nI loved it.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nYou and Spencer should have a spin-off.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nOh, man, okay.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nMake it happen.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nMake it happen!\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nSo what's going on in the Lego movie?\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nOh, top secret!\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nCan't end a movie with Will Ferrell coming downstairs and going,\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nthey're all Legos!\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nWhat the fuck are you going to do in the sequel?\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:49.000\nWell, the sequel all takes place in reality.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nWe have...\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:56.000\nWill Ferrell is just like, you know something, let's get to know each other.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.000\nYou know, it's just seeing, like, you play with this stuff.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nIt's like, why are we in this basement here?\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.000\nLet's go on a trip and they get in the car and they're driving, driving, driving, driving, driving.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nFlat tire.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nIt's like 12 minutes in.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nAnd then they walk into...\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:15.000\nThey go, wow, maybe there's more tires over here.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:20.000\nThis is actual dialogue that we're working with.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nAre these all people that already have a...\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nWe all know they love Legos?\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nThey're actually not called Legos.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nIn this one?\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:29.000\nNo, no, ever.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nYou know, Lego is...\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:36.000\nBecause I got corrected and I'm trying to remind myself not to say it.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nYou're shaking your head.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nHe's nodding.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nOkay, well, can you explain?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nCan you explain to the...\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nThey are Lego.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nNo, they're Lego bricks.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nRight.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:53.000\nJesus knows because he works at SpaceX and Elon Musk doesn't like it being acknowledged that the ships are made of Legos.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nRight.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nLego.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nThere's a hard and fast rule there.\n\n28:57.000 --> 29:01.000\nYou tell these people these are spaceships you do not say they're made of Legos.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nThey're going to the forest to find another tire.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nBut you don't say Legos, they're totally just a Lego.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nIt's just Lego.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nThat guy's a Lego guy.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nYeah.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nRight, not a Legos.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nWe don't play Legos.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nWe play with Lego.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nRight.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nYou play with Lego bricks.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:17.000\nThat's something that they get really like, because when I was pitching myself as the director, I was like,\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:25.000\nyou know, I play with Legos my whole life and they're like...\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd they're like, Phil and Chris are Lego.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nDon't hate that.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nDo Legos come from...\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.000\nThat's like...\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nDo they come from Scandinavia?\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.000\nLegos.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:37.000\nDo they come from like a European country?\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nWho makes Lego?\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nThey're Danish.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nDanish?\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nYeah.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nAre all the people in the room like Danish people?\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nThey're all like...\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nYeah.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.000\nWell, no, there's people from Lego that work...\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:55.000\nI like what a fanciful idea you have about the Danish.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nSo fancy.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nYeah.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nThey got big gloves.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nBup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nOh!\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nYou're eating croissants.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nYes.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nOur croissants are crazy.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nThe croissants...\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.500\nIs it true?\n\n30:07.500 --> 30:10.000\nWhat about this photo everyone keeps talking about?\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nAbout...\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:12.000\nThe Loch Ness Monster?\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nNo, well, they...\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nLet me guess, let me guess.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nThe guy that invented Legos...\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nHamilton...\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nHamilton...\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nHamilton Legos...\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nHamilton J. Legos...\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nShaking hands with Hitler and they're smiling and they're...\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nYou're making this up.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nOkay, so...\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nSo Paige...\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nPaige trying to...\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nWell, that's why I asked.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nTrying to ruin my career.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\nThat's why I asked.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nThat's why I asked.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nNo, I'm not a scientist.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:37.000\nI hear rumors and then I just re-tweet them.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nSo page 12, they're looking for...\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nThey're looking for tires.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nThey're looking for tires.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nAnd we dissolve.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nIt's a time thing.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nAnd Will Ferrell is like...\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:50.000\nHis shirt's been torn and he's got his tie wrapped around his head to collect sweat.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nAnd he's chopping through the underbrush.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nThe underbrush is everywhere.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nThere's underbrush...\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nAt the tire place?\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nNo, they haven't found the tire place.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nThat's what they're doing, okay?\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nOkay, they're looking for tires.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nThey have to chop through the underbrush.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:02.000\nYou know this.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nThis is, you know, part of the story structure.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nUnderbrush, underbrush.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nAnd then he turns around and he's like,\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nHey, hey, I found some tires.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nHe turns around.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nThe boy's gone.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nThe boy is gone.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:14.000\nThe boy is gone.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nOh, the boy, the Lego boy.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nYou got tired of that.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nHe went back to the car.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nWas it just him and the boy?\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nWere there more people in their party?\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nOr was it just him and the boy?\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nHave you seen the movie?\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nNo.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nOh, my God.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nNo.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nNo.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nThis isn't a movie that hasn't been made yet.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nNo, the first movie.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nNo, okay.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nSo it's just him and the boy.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nIn the first movie?\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nAt the end of the first movie, it's just him and the boy?\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.000\nYes, there's him and the boy.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:36.000\nOkay.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nAre those the only two characters that get into the car?\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nYeah.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nOkay.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nThat's the only one we care about, right?\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nRight?\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nOkay.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nYeah.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:45.000\nYou don't want to violate ten.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\nOkay.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nOkay.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:48.000\nSo anyway, let me back up.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nSo he's chopping through the underbrush.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nBack up.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:51.000\nChopping through the underbrush.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nWe got that.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nAnd he's got the tire.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nAnd he's got his shirt wrapped around his pants and girls.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nIt's so sexy.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nIt's so great.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:00.000\nAnd he's chopping through the underbrush, up underbrush.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:03.000\nAnd he goes, hey, I found the tires.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nAnd he turns around.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:05.000\nThe boy's gone.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nThe boy's gone.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nThe boy got sick of it.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nHe's waiting back in the car.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nOkay.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nDo we know that we cut back to the boy in the car?\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nYeah.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nWe do a hard cut.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nOkay.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nDo a hard cut.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nBecause no dissolves or anything like that.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nThere's no wipes or anything.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nIs this page 25?\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:21.000\nIs this page 25?\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nHere's page.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nHard cut.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:24.000\nIt's like about 25, 26.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:25.000\nYeah.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\n25.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nOkay.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nSo this is the crossing of the threshold.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.000\nYeah.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nYeah.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nYeah.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nAnyway, the kid's screwing around.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nYou know, he's like...\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nYou know, you're like humming it to him like this.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nAnd it sounds kind of Danish.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:40.000\nWell, it's not Danish.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:41.000\nIt's set in America.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nIt's set in 2007.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.000\nAnd so that'll come back.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nThat'll come back.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:53.000\nAnd he's kicking his leg like I do.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:58.000\nWe did that in Milwaukee a couple of times.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:02.000\nHits the brake of the car.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nOkay.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nSo now it's extra stop.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nYeah.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nYeah.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nYou think that.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nYou think that.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nBut then it comes back.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nIt starts rolling down the hill.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nRight.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nIt starts rolling down the hill.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.000\nToggle brake.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nRolling down the hill.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nIt starts rolling down the hill.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nHe dislodged the brake.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nHe dislodged the brake.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nThe emergency brake.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nYeah.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nYeah.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nEmergency brake.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nGotcha.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nAnd now he's rolling down the hill.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nRolling down the hill.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:29.000\nAway from the end of the bridge.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nWill Ferrell left his car parked on a hill in neutral?\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.000\nYeah.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.000\nYeah.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nYeah.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:35.000\nYeah.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.000\nDoes the pop tire affect the rolling of the car down the hill?\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nWhat's that?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nDoes that flat tire?\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nYou should see the shape of this hill.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nOkay.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:45.000\nYeah.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nThat'd be cool though.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:53.000\nIf the car had both all four tires working, it would have clearly just rolled into a\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nnice soft embankment.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nYeah.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nBut the one pop tire makes you in a dark, scary pattern.\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nYeah.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nYeah.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nYeah.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nYeah.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:03.000\nBecause it's doing like that.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nIt's fishtailing.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:08.000\nI feel like he just stole it.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nAll right.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nWell, you can check the date on the document.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:17.000\nSo that's all I'm going to give you, but I think we already know.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nAll right.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nLEGO 2.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nThere we go.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nThanks for the scoop.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:28.000\nNow actually, for real, for real, I'm talking to the BBC on Thursday.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nAbout what?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nOh, I don't know.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:38.000\nThere's a certain character that the BBC owns.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:41.000\nAnd they're asking me, would it be possible?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:44.000\nDoctor Who?\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:48.000\nYou only do fancy eyebrow lifting if there's a Doctor Who character.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:54.000\nThat's a crazy leak that you just leaked.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nHe just told us the first 26 pages of the movie.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nYeah.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nDo you know how sued I'm going to get?\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:04.000\nAll right.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.000\nI'm getting so sued, man, but I can afford it.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\nFuckin' money.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nMoney's like shit to me.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:16.000\nI just throw it out the window.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nLike shit.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:22.000\nRight before he had any money, he used to just throw shit out the window all the time.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:27.000\nYeah, I don't give a fuck about crime.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:28.000\nSanitation?\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nYeah.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nJust throw it.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nWhat's this?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:35.000\nHurling poop at people.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nBut now you can afford to not get poop all over your hands.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nYou can just throw money at people.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:43.000\nPeople pay me not to do that.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nThat's a good racket.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.000\nThat's a good racket.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:52.000\nDo something obnoxious until they go, listen, here's five bucks.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nWill you please stop throwing shit out the window?\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nI'm mowing the lawn here.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:04.000\nBabies are doing hopscotch and there's shit all over my lawn.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nYou remember that show Real People?\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:12.000\nYeah, with Skip Stevenson, Rick O'Casey, Fran Tarkington, Lynn Campbell.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nGordon Lightfoot.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nThe crack of the 80s.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nFred Willard was in it.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nThat was the first time I saw Fred Willard.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nThat's true, yeah.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:30.000\nThey would do little human interest pieces like this guy's lost his leg, but now he's\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\ngot a plastic leg and he can still jump around.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:38.000\nThis guy's so Chinese, fish love him.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:39.000\nClassic Real People.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nIt sounds racist, but that was the story.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nAm I combining Fran Tarkington?\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nWho isn't that incredible and who isn't Real People?\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nFran Tarkington wasn't that incredible.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:51.000\nJim Davis, the creator of Garfield.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nThat's incredible.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:53.000\nHad the severe edge.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:57.000\nThis guy's going to lock himself in a cabinet with a Rubik's Cube and he might suffocate.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nThat's incredible.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:02.000\nAnd then Real People was like, Real People, this guy's got a flag for underwear.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nThat's what it was.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:07.000\nSo one of the guys on Real People was, he lived in a lighthouse.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:08.000\nSkip Stevenson.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:11.000\nNo, that was one of the hosts of the show.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nHe didn't live in a room.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nYes, I was agreeing with him.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:19.000\nOne of the people, the real people that they did the show about, a guy lived in a lighthouse\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:24.000\nand then there was a whole segment, or just remember, they talked about like,\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nbut where do you go to the bathroom?\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nYou live all the way up on this lighthouse.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:29.000\nDo you have to run down every time?\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:32.000\nAnd he goes like, well, we have a system for that.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:37.000\nAnd then they showed this montage of bags full of pee sliding down a fishing line from\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:41.000\na top window and then exploding against a tree trunk.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nAnd just like piss hitting the camera.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:50.000\nAnd I was like, well, they put the camera closer.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nFirst of all, why is this broadcast television?\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:57.000\nBecause this is happening all over the place and no one's celebrating it.\n\n37:57.000 --> 38:02.000\nSecond of all, how do I join the lighthouse union?\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nWhere do I sign up?\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:06.000\nSecond of all, drop it out the window.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:07.000\nWindow, man.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:11.000\nToo gross to, like you want it to like get out there before it explodes.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:15.000\nYou know, we had this discussion about our dogs, our pets, you know,\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:18.000\nyou got to get that stuff far away from where you live.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:21.000\nIf you just drop it, you're going to be walking in that stuff.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:27.000\nBut if you throw it on the tree, it's not next to your car or the mailbox.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:30.000\nSo this is one tree that just soaked in pee and poo?\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:34.000\nIt grows like a motherfucker, though.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:37.000\nThe limbs are all long and stuff.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:43.000\nThe other trees are all jealous going, I want some pee too.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:46.000\nHow come he got all the pee?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.000\nHow come he got no pee?\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:48.000\nHow come he got no pee?\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nHe's getting all the, what did he do?\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:53.000\nThe leafy tree gets the pee.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nAll right.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nWell, are you wearing pants?\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nAre you wearing pants, sir?\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nI just look down.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nFair question.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:01.000\nYou're a duffel bag.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:02.000\nOh, for Halloween?\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nNovember 1st?\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nThat was yesterday.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:07.000\nCan we stand up here?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nHe looks naked, but he's wearing a duffel bag.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nHe was dressed like this last week.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nNow show us your dick.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:16.000\nTake it out.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:17.000\nWhat?\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:18.000\nI am wearing underwear.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nThat's a great costume.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:21.000\nThat's an awesome costume.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:22.000\nIt's inexpensive.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.000\nAlso, loaded with pockets.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nYou can carry your wallet in there.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:27.000\nYou got your phone, your keys.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:30.000\nYou can put your bag of pee in there.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nYou can do everything you can put on.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:36.000\nWho did you think everybody was like, this is the closest to the Harmontown Halloween\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:37.000\nshow, so you thought.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nRight.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:39.000\nYou know what would be cool?\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:40.000\nYou're probably too young.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:41.000\nDo you have children by any chance?\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:42.000\nYou're too young.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nIf you had like a little baby, you'd make them like a fanny pack.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nSo I put them in the...\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nStand up again.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:51.000\nYou get kind of like a Will Forte last man thing going on here.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:54.000\nWhich is kind of awesome.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:58.000\nHow willing are you to just sit up here for the rest of the show?\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.000\nOkay.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:03.000\nSit as close as possible to Dan because of the stage picture.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:06.000\nWell, you slide one over because I have a new friend coming up.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:07.000\nI guess that'll be my second one.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nWhat is your name, Duffelbag, man?\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:10.000\nDoug.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nDoug the Duffelbag.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.000\nYes.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:17.000\nYour name is like this shortened version of Duffelbag.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:23.000\nDoes Doug the Duffelbag have an interesting voice?\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nLike when you're...\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:30.000\nWhat's your mild manner to work a day job?\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nWhat do you do when you're not a Duffelbag?\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nI do freelance PA work and some acting.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:35.000\nIs this the character?\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:36.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:42.000\nBut when you get into costume, when you take scissors and cut holes in a Duffelbag and put\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nit on, say, honey, I'm leaving the house.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:48.000\nOn day's work, I just don't want to be accessed baggage for anyone.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nOh, nice.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nOkay.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:51.000\nSo he's got catchphrases.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:52.000\nOh, man.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:53.000\nHe's got catchphrases.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:54.000\nStrap in.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:55.000\nPlease.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:56.000\nLet's hear some more, man.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.000\nDo five minutes.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:02.000\nDo your whole set.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nActually, for those who are just listening, it does seem to me like you must have tried\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nthis with like a bigger friend.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:12.000\nLike if Steve A.G. was up here, the temptation would be for him to put his arms through.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:13.000\nYeah.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:16.000\nLike and wear you like Chewbacca in Empire.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nLike the straps are...\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nDo you think that would work?\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:19.000\nHave you tried that?\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:20.000\nOh.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:23.000\nIs there the weight of that?\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nThere's nothing bad that's going to happen.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:27.000\nOh.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:28.000\nI'm flying.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:29.000\nI'm flying.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:30.000\nTeach him the force.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:31.000\nThat's pretty good.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:32.000\nAll right.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:33.000\nJug the Duffelbag.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nThat's actually...\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:38.000\nThis is actually a great costume because if you passed out and you...\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:39.000\nYeah.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:40.000\nAnd you have a tall friend.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:41.000\nYou're a fucking man.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:42.000\nOh, shit.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nBetter take...\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:54.000\nBetter take Doug home.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nOh, that would be amazing.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:59.000\nJust keep the tag on you that has your address and your phone number.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:00.000\nDrop me off.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:06.000\nI need to just drink until you pass out anywhere and the cops just like pick you up.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:07.000\nPut you out.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nThere should be a system of carousels.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:10.000\nYeah.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:13.000\nJust don't go to the airport.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nGo to the airport at the baggage claim and just hang out.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:18.000\nThis whole time we've been thinking the airport sucks because it's so incompatible with real\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:21.000\nlife we should be turning the whole city into the airport.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:25.000\nIf it was all that way, Wiz Khalifa could ride his hoverboard.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nLike, there wouldn't be any...\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nYou know, you just...\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:32.000\nYou have a check TSA checkpoint outside your own front door.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nIf you're rich, you have the...\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nLike, you go, hey, Charlie.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nAnd he's like, any weapons, Mr. Harmon?\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nCharlie, what do you think?\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nGo on through.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:45.000\nWould have been a 95% failure rate anyway.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:50.000\nAnd then you just step out and then you're in the concourse of reality in which you are\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nfree to travel the world.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nAnd you are also a bag.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nAnd so everywhere...\n\n42:56.000 --> 43:01.000\nAnywhere you lay down, if you just stop moving, you just certainly start moving towards like,\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:07.000\nlike someone will pick you up and some people could decide to take you home.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:08.000\nAll right.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nI haven't thought it through, but...\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:14.000\nWould airlines be able to fat champion and pay extra if you weigh a lot?\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:15.000\nNo.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:16.000\nThat's illegal.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nYeah.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nThat would be illegal.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:19.000\nThey wouldn't be allowed to do that.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nWell, think about the weight loss incentives.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nPeople love money and they love being fat.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nSo put those two against each other.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nLike, they don't do that enough.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:28.000\nYou know?\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nYou just go, oh, you're fat, huh?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nMust be nice.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nIt costs a lot to be so fat.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:36.000\nOh, yeah, it does.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:41.000\nI should be thinner.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nSo I can get those miles.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.000\nAll right.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:54.000\nI actually did that on purpose because otherwise I would have transitioned from high octane hilarity.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nDoug, are you saying that nobody...\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nI'm assuming you wore this last night in Halloween, right?\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:01.000\nThis guy looks a lot like Justin Roiland.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:02.000\nLet's get him up here.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:03.000\nThat's right.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nThat's right.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nThat's a cavalcade of stars.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:12.000\nYou kept giving him my periphery and I kept thinking, Justin Roiland...\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nWe have tall Roiland with us right now.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:15.000\nI love it.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nWell, this is...\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nI mean, you own this.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nYou brought up a guy that looks like a guy.\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:20.000\nI didn't ask him.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nSo, Justin.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nThat's...\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:24.000\nYes?\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nMy name's Garrett.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nI do get the Justin Roiland thing a lot.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nYeah?\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nWhat do they say?\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nLike, no, like...\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nThis is what my podcast would be like.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:39.000\nOh, you look like somebody I know.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nWhat do they say?\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nWhat do they say?\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nWhat my podcast is like.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nOh, okay.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:48.000\nWhat do they say?\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nWhat do they say to you?\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:53.000\nThey go, hey, man, Mr. Meeseeks is a lot like...\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nScud the disposable assassin.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nWhat the fuck, man?\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nYeah, there was like a guy...\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nWhere are you?\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nAre you in the crowd?\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nSomebody came up to me and was like, are you Justin?\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nWhat?\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nAnd then you went, why?\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nNo, I just said no.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nI just said no.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nWhy do you ask?\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nTry that.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nShould I?\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:15.000\nWith him right now.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nAnd we'll just watch.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:18.000\nOkay.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nI texted that photo to Justin.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:21.000\nIs that enough of this guy?\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:22.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:23.000\nBut we're done.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\nWe're done here.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:25.000\nThanks, guys.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.000\nThank you.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nSo, Doug.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:31.000\nBut try the creepy, you know, back of the hand stroking the arm thing, you know.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nAnd let us know how that works out.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nDoug, the devil bag.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nSo you wore this last night?\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nOr did you have another thing?\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nI wore this last night.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:41.000\nDid you get any pussy?\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:44.000\nRob, beat me to my follow-up question.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nDid you get any pussy?\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nDid you get any pussy?\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:53.000\nI used to say that nobody tried to wear you as a backpack last night.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nNo one tried to wear me as a backpack.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:55.000\nThat didn't happen?\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:56.000\nI know.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:57.000\nWow.\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:58.000\nAll right.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nYou're hanging around with the wrong people, Doug.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:03.000\nI'd like to bring a special friend up to the stage that we've never met.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:06.000\nSo, Jason Pollack, are you here?\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:07.000\nI am.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:08.000\nOkay.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:09.000\nDo you have cold feet?\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:12.000\nOr are you willing to come up?\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:13.000\nI just want to give you...\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:14.000\nYeah.\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:15.000\nAre you willing to come up here?\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nI'd love you to.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:17.000\nHe didn't ask to come up.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:18.000\nI'll tell you why I'm pulling him up.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nNeither did I.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:25.000\nCome on up, Jason Pollack, and I'll explain.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nHello.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:31.000\nJason, this is Rob.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:34.000\nYes, sit there.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:38.000\nSo, you guys remember my neighbor, Beth Bootson, the eucalyptus tree lady?\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nThe tumor lady.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:47.000\nWonderful, wonderful ray of light in my life at this raw time.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:51.000\nShe texted me today and said, there's this guy.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:56.000\nHe's a friend of my neighbors.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:59.000\nHe didn't know they were my neighbors.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:03.000\nHe and his mom listened to the show all the time together.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:09.000\nAnd then he heard my neighbor, his friends, on the podcast.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nAm I getting that right?\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.000\nIs that about the size of it?\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:12.000\nKind of confused.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nNo, that's right, yeah.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nOkay.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nIt is a little confusing.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:20.000\nBut suffice it to say, you texted Beth and Dan at one point and said,\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:23.000\nI just heard you on my favorite podcast that I listened to with my mom.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:26.000\nSo the thing is, what is that podcast?\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:27.000\nHarvard Town.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:28.000\nDon't.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nDon't Schrab the guy that...\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nCould be Daily Groundhouse.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nYou guys just saw Live Schrabbing.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nThat's a...\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:41.000\nSo Beth texted me, this wasn't Jason's idea, but Beth texted me and said,\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:45.000\nlike, the thing is that Jason's mom is very sick right now.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nAnd they listen to the podcast every week together.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:53.000\nSo she's very likely listening now, or now being whenever she listens to it.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:56.000\nI'm not going to assume she subscribes.\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:59.000\nBut that you guys...\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nOnly $5, lady.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nYeah, what's the big deal?\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nYeah.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:08.000\nYou guys listen to it all the time together and she's sick right now.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nWhere is she right now?\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nSalem, Oregon.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nAnd that's where you're from?\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:15.000\nI grew up in Montana and she was there too.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:19.000\nHer parents got divorced and she went to Portland and now it's in Salem.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:24.000\nAnd you're going to visit her regularly and it's like she's sick.\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:25.000\nI don't even know the details.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nDo you want to talk about it?\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:33.000\nYeah, just autoimmune stuff, which kind of leads to a whole cascade of issues.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:41.000\nAnd you guys, since she's become sick, have been listening to the podcast as a...\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:44.000\nYeah, so I actually saw the movie first.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.000\nThat's how I got in the podcast and then sent it to her.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nNot knowing if she...\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nNot like you don't send Harmontown to your mom?\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:52.000\nI think it's normal.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:58.000\nYeah, why would anyone's mom like me and why would anyone have this relationship with their mom?\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nYeah, I think...\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:05.000\nI don't know, when you're sick it kind of forces you to just be more raw and honest about shit.\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:09.000\nAnd I felt that in the movie and podcast and sent it to her and then she just...\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nShe like, flipped out, loved it.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:14.000\nIt's just become like a fun thing to talk about and share.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:15.000\nWhat's her name?\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:16.000\nRenee?\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:17.000\nRenee.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:18.000\nHello, Renee.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:19.000\nHello, Renee.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:20.000\nHello, Renee.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:24.000\nSo was your relationship with your mom...\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:33.000\nAre you just one of these people that I can't relate to at all that just had always an unconditional, nice, healthy partnership with your mom the whole time?\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:39.000\nOr has the sickness transformed as you might have implied a second ago?\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:48.000\nI wouldn't say it wasn't all rosy and perfect that way, but I think she's always a good loving mom trying to love and fucking up and doing it good.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:51.000\nNo crazy distance or anything like that.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nBut yeah, just getting sick has definitely transformed that.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nEverything all of a sudden is like...\n\n49:56.000 --> 50:00.000\nYeah, yeah, and just more honest conversations and more conversations.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:01.000\nWho is it?\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:02.000\nIs it me?\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nIt's probably you.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:10.000\nThere's shame in autoimmune diseases because I always hear people with them, they say I have an autoimmune disease.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nThey never specify what it is.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:16.000\nSo is like their confusion or is their overlap or what's the deal with that?\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:20.000\nIs it just that they're all obscure and it doesn't bear mentioning?\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:24.000\nYeah, I feel there's kind of like a stigma of...\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:27.000\nIt doesn't seem to get as much sympathy as like a cancer or something that's...\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:28.000\nRight.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:29.000\nAnd I don't know why.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:32.000\nA friend of mine has lupus, so that's an autoimmune disease, right?\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nYeah.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:34.000\nSo it's different than that.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:37.000\nThere's many kinds of autoimmune disorders and stuff.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:38.000\nYeah, there is.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nSo what is that?\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:43.000\nLike your white blood cells are just going away or what's happening?\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:47.000\nI asked her to text me today like a list of everything.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nSo she's hospitalized right now?\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nShe's not hospitalized right now.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:56.000\nLike two years ago she was in critical care and didn't know if she'd kind of come back online.\n\n50:56.000 --> 51:04.000\nBut yeah, just it's no energy if anything, she gets a cold or anything bumps her immune system.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:07.000\nLike her reaction to it's really, really bad and severe.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nIt takes a little longer to recover.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nJust no energy.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nWho is it that you talk to that tells you...\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:17.000\nLike you're talking to doctors, she's talking to doctors and what the...\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:21.000\nIt's all so shrouded in like vagaries.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:24.000\nLike are they always scratching their head?\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nYeah, it was... there were years where...\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:32.000\nBecause when you talk to anybody, I feel like one of the first questions you ask is how are you?\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:38.000\nAnd it was like a year ago, I think I just told her like I don't want to ask that anymore.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nWhich you feel so guilty, right?\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nLike especially to your parent.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nBut yeah, just like every time.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:47.000\nLike well, they think it's this and now it might be this.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:50.000\nAnd it's all kind of interconnected.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:57.000\nSo for several years now, just like every time we talk, there's kind of a new idea.\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:00.000\nLike a new hope, a new problem.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nIt always just seems kind of...\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:07.000\nSo they're just kind of chasing the symptoms of what's going on because the immunity is low.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:11.000\nBut they can't get to the bottom of the original cause.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.000\nIs there anything, because for me it's like I have this wall in front of me.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:19.000\nI'm more comfortable saying things into a microphone and a podcast in front of strangers.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nLike I have no relationship with my family.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:27.000\nAnd when one of them gets sick, everything's going to go lateral.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nI have no idea how.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.000\nErin spent our marriage warning me about that.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:37.000\nShe lost her mom at 17 and she's like, you know, she wasn't being mean about it.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:40.000\nShe's just like, you have no idea how fucked you are.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:46.000\nLike you have no method of dealing with this stuff.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:49.000\nAnd it's going to hit you like you're not dealing with it.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nCall your fucking dad at his birthday.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:54.000\nShe wasn't mean about it. She was trying to help me.\n\n52:54.000 --> 53:01.000\nLike for me, it's like it's ironically easier to talk into a microphone to strangers\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:04.000\nthan it is to talk to people.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:11.000\nAnd I was wondering like, is there anything knowing that your mom is listening to her favorite podcast, her favorite?\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:15.000\nWhat is your mom's favorite podcast?\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:19.000\nThis is her favorite one. She's not subscribed to it.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:27.000\nIs there anything that is easier to say when you're not standing next to her?\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:31.000\nLike sharing this channel? I don't know. I thought that would be...\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nNo.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:42.000\nMom, there's $400,000 worth of Nazi Deutschmarks in the floorboards in the Piedoter.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:49.000\nRenee, if you're listening, what we're going to do to send our blessings and stuff,\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:52.000\nwe're going to fill Doug's duffel bag with gifts.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:55.000\nWe're going to mail him to Salem, Oregon.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:58.000\nWell, here's what I thought we really could do, because there should be an upside...\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:01.000\nWe're going to fill him up with Toblerone chocolates.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:05.000\nThe downside with the medical industry when they can't figure out what pill to prescribe\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:09.000\nand what to diagnose it as and what's going on and what to radiate and all this stuff,\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:14.000\nthe downside is Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on and when do I know and all this stuff,\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:18.000\nthe upside should be that uncertainty can be our friend because within that uncertainty\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:22.000\nwe can make things possible.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:29.000\nNot to be corny, but if we just as egomaniacs who love our own podcast\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:36.000\nand who admire this person for listening to a podcast or son listens to,\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:41.000\nwe all want to be proven right, we all want to be proven that our podcast has power\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:45.000\nand that we're good people and whether it comes to anything or not,\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:53.000\nI just want to ritualistically, for one moment, like Renee, close your eyes,\n\n54:53.000 --> 55:04.000\nopen the force fields for one second while the bad things aren't looking, they're napping,\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:10.000\nopen up wide and we're going to flood your system with good energy.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:14.000\nEverybody right now within the sound of my voice, Duncan Trussell couldn't be here,\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nhe'd do this better.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:25.000\nEverybody beam like all of your fucking like shitty ego driven feelings of pride\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:32.000\nand ego and stuff and like thrust them out into space where they turn into laser beams\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:36.000\nand then you shoot across the sky to Renee because when you love yourself\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:40.000\nand want yourself to be right and want your favorite band to be the best band,\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:44.000\nall that stuff is good energy, all you have to do is like just send it to somebody\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:48.000\nwho needs it right now more than anybody and so that's what I'm doing.\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:51.000\nMy beam is stronger than everyone's.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:55.000\nRenee, we are all light.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:58.000\nI'm so tempted to put a rap beat on it and see how you deal with this.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.000\nWell, we'll do that in a second.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:04.000\nPlease don't fuck Renee in a rap right now.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:07.000\nWe want you to recognize that yes, everyone's a beam of light,\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:11.000\nso you would think it was all kind of cohesive but there is one strong stripe of light\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:14.000\nthat represents of course me and in my special light.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nAre you claiming stronger light beams right now?\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:19.000\nYou know, in Gremlins you need like a bad guy, you know?\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nLike, oh, there's Stripe, you know?\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nHe's got a Mohawk.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nRenee knows what I'm talking about.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:29.000\nHe was called Stripe because of the Mohawk?\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:33.000\nWell, he wasn't called Stripe because the word sounded neat.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:38.000\nOkay, well, I never connected that.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nDid you Stripe also have Stripes kind of on him too?\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nWasn't he kind of Stripey?\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:45.000\nHe would like that diagonal like he was in jail, like a hamburger?\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nNo, you fucking dimwits.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nHe had a fucking Stripe.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nI fucking hate all of you.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:55.000\nYour piece is a shit and you don't pay attention to Gremlins.\n\n56:55.000 --> 57:01.000\nRenee, you're feeling your immune system is responding positively.\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:07.000\nOh, I told this lady to lower her defenses and you just made me send toxins into the fucking...\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nYou assholes.\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nNow she has Gremlin hatred in her body.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nVery sorry.\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nI just was asking her a question.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:19.000\nAnyways, God bless you Renee.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:24.000\nThank you so much for having an open-minded relationship with your son\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:28.000\nwhere you share in the same things and I'm so sorry that things are going bad for you\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:32.000\nand like we are all right now in Los Angeles because believe me,\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:35.000\nwe have nothing better to do with our spirits.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:40.000\nWe're sending them all to you and they're going into the middle of your forehead\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:44.000\nwhere there is a little tiny dent that you can't see\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:50.000\nand it's going through your pineal gland to the base of your skull\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:53.000\nwhere there's a stem that has existed since you were a flower\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:58.000\nand it's going down and radiating throughout all of your body\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:09.000\nand it's saving you because nobody else wants that to happen except for you and us\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:15.000\nand like no one's paid any attention to it until now and you're not alone\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:21.000\nand we're doing it, we did it if it's mysterious that it's solved.\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:25.000\nRight now I'm sending you a better beam than Dan is sending right now.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:29.000\nNo, he's talking too much. I'm really concentrating on my beam.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:30.000\nI will admit Renee.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:35.000\nThat feeling you're getting right now of complete pleasure and detachment\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:41.000\nand like spiritual freedom, that's my beam.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:46.000\nWell, I'm not going to be a dick in Renee's unconscious.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:54.000\nI will admit Renee, Jeff's right, I kind of fucked up my, so I accept that\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:58.000\nand that should be more of an example of how healing my energies are\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:03.000\nso in a way they're better than Jeff's because they're more acquiescent\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:08.000\nand that's the thing is like the nature has a way and a healing way\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:12.000\nand my healing way is better than Jeff's because it's not competitive.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:16.000\nAlright, you're healed up, put your shields back up Renee, put them up\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:21.000\nagainst the assholes and the bureaucrats and the licensed serial killers\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:25.000\nwith support systems that call themselves doctors.\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:28.000\nYou have been cured purely by us.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:32.000\nSend us all your checks from now on.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nJust make your checks payable too.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nWe are now tax exempt now.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nHarmontown shield lowers.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:42.000\nKidding about, there's good doctors, everyone's fine, I was just kidding,\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:46.000\nI'm just being a petty asshole when I get sick, I'll love them.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nThey scare me right now.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:52.000\nDan, would you take, because you seem very affected and I'm not joking about this,\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:58.000\nlike you, there's a guy, Jason here, Jason, right, likes the show,\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000\ncame on the show because you know that his mother is sick\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nand you are clearly, it's not just impressed, almost envious of the relationship\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nthat he has with his parents, as you probably, as we all ought to be\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nbecause it's great, would this ever make you more likely to call\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nyour mother and father once in a while to create that thing?\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nLook, I'm not the problem in that relationship.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nDan, I'm going to do something right now, lower your force fields.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nNo.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nLower your force fields.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nNo.\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI'm going to send you a beam.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nMy force fields are amazing and...\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nNo, I'm not, no, no.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nMy mother has my number.\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nShe has my number.\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nShe can call me whenever she wants.\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nBut if she did, would you pick up the phone?\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nShe doesn't.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nAnd she says, except to like tweet me and say like,\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nbut nice to hear from you once in a while, text me, you ape.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nIt's a cold family.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nYes, that did not go the way I thought it was going to go.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nI thought we were going to have a real slam dunk moment there.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nThis is not...\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nThis is...\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nYes, so obviously there's no subtext here.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nYes, of course, I want Renee and Jason to be rewarded for doing it right.\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nOf course I do.\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nI want everybody that has...\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nThis is my family.\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nI want everything that I do, every project I work on, everything,\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nyou know, there's nothing unhealthy about that.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nMy therapist said so.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nYou don't have to love the people that you were born next to.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nIt's like that would be dumb logic, you know, Hitler's dad.\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nHe was supposed to be super cool.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nIt was Hitler's son, whatever.\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nIt doesn't matter, you know, whatever.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nWho cares?\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nIt's coincidence.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nIt's nice when people get along with their family.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nI feel like you're wearing the oven mitt of detachment right now, Dan.\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nIt works.\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nWe got a guy dressed like a bag up here a little bit.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nI know, it's nice.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nWell, Jason...\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nIt's kind of comforting to have a double bag on stage.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nCan I ask about the...\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nIs dad in the picture?\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nYeah, my dad's still in Montana.\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nHim and I get along great.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nThat didn't happen until like 25.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nThey're divorced, yeah, they're divorced.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nI now approve of that a lot, just because I don't want to seem like a bad person.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nI got divorced, so now I'm telling everyone to get divorced.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nHow's divorce too?\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nYou were divorced?\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nReally?\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nHow long are you married?\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nJust over eight months.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nWait, you just got divorced after eight months?\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nDoug Duffelbag for the most part.\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nYou pussy, I went 11.\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nAgain, you win.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nDr. High Road.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nJason, do you have siblings?\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nOne brother and one half sister.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nAre you young enough for me to ask how old you are?\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000\n38.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nOkay, no, you're not.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nYou're an old, old geezer.\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nSo, can we ask more questions about your life?\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nWhat are you career wise?\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nAdvertising.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nLike a writer?\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nWhat's, did you write anything?\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nYou're like, yeah, you know, the idea that Snickers satisfies you?\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nI wrote that.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nDas Mias, PN work last year for NFL Countdown.\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nSamsung spots, stuff like that.\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nHow does that, what do you do?\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nThe TV people.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nWhy don't you have your own podcast?\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nThis is good stuff.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nI wake up every morning going, asking the same question.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nThat was a toothbrush.\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nI don't have a podcast.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nI wake up every morning.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nI don't have a podcast.\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nI should have a podcast.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nHow do you guys know the Bootsons?\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nI worked with Dan at Radical for editing him.\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nSounds like a cool place.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nNice.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nNice restraint on that one.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nDoug, what do you do?\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nYeah, so I do the freelance PA and acting gigs and then I do stand up.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nHow do you be a freelance PA?\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nI just reach out to people who are having productions and then I'm like, you guys need any PAs?\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nOkay.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nI mean, that is something that almost people do as well.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nGuys wearing a bag.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nIt's not as stretch for them to have a box for a house.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nIs the strategy that if you wander up to a hot set and they're understaffed enough that you can get onto it, they need you?\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nBecause there's no, if anyone comes up to you and goes like,\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nhey, can I help you sir?\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nYou're like, no, you can't because you're here.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nIf that doesn't happen, you just walk up to Penny Marshall's trailer, knock on the door.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nAnd she goes, yes.\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nAnd you go like, I could have killed you.\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nHire me as a PA and this won't happen again.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nUsually through Facebook and mutual friends and stuff.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nAll right.\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nI wrote it.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nI wrote it.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nI don't know, I was just amused by the concept.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nYou just stand up, you say?\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nYeah?\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nDid you say where you're from already?\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nI moved up from San Diego a little over a year ago.\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nGood for you.\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nAh.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nRob, you have follow-up San Diego questions?\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nNo, no, I know where it is.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nYour question would have been, where's San Diego?\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nJason, what's the coolest thing your mom ever did?\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nAh, the coolest thing.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nOh, man.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nWe can edit out the pause if it takes really long time for you to...\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nMy mom bought me a typewriter when I was like, you know, nine.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nWhat's a little typewriter?\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nPut your little ring on.\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nWe need a baby typewriter.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nI can't hear you right now because I'm like, nah, I don't have enough toxins in my body\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nto process the organs necessary to perceive you.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nLittle typewriter.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nI don't even know what's next to me.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nIt's like a ghost.\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nHave the full alphabet?\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nOr is it like the mini Crayola only has like seven colors in it?\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nLike, just give them the vowels.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nJust the primaries.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nOne kid is a goo and one's a gah.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nYou got anything, Jason?\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nSuper, this is so cheesy and sweet to ridiculous play.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nYou mean podcast dynamite?\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nWhen I was little, I had asthma.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nI had a really bad attack.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nI was hospitalized and I saw a little stuffed tiger on the way into the hospital.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nAnd just like little kids do, was obsessed and had to have that or the world would end.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nAnd she didn't have enough money to get it for me and then ended up like, you know, somehow the nurses knew\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nand like everyone kind of came together and she was able to get it for me.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nSo now that I say that out loud, it sounds like this is the nicest thing the nurses ever did.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nI hadn't thought that went through all the way.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nBut you know behind every great nursing staff is probably a mom like going, come on, let's snap on this.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nAnd they're going, what do you mean snap on this?\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nThat's not an expression.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nWell, the God is an unreliable narrator, he's drunk.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nOoh.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nThat's very sweet.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nI like that a lot.\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nSo when you got the tiger, did you freak out?\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nAre you very happy?\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nYeah.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nSuper happy.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nBut did you know right away that she had gone through those links to get it for you or did you find out later?\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nYeah, I found out later.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nThat's great.\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nDo you still have the tiger?\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nI did.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nI put it in a box today.\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nThat's great.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nSo what did your mom tell you about when you, what are you going to be when you grow up?\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nDid she ever have a talk with you about when you're supposed to pick your career?\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nIf you were going to be a bird or a bee.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nBecause I remember my mom saying you can be anything you want.\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nThere's another cool thing.\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nYou could be a bird or a bee.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nSo wait, is it this awesome lady that gave you all this support and the typewriter?\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nYou still don't call this woman?\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nWhy do you stick a fucking...\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nMy force fields are down, you can stick it wherever you want right now.\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nHey, have a little ice.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nBoom!\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nDo you want a drink, Jason?\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nI'll have a drink.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nSee?\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nDo you want any ice in it?\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nYou better get it.\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nYou better say yes soon because he's taking it off.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nEmpathy.\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nI just practiced empathy.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nAnd believe me, I really have to practice it.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nYou got a little bubble throat?\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nWhat was that?\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nYou got a little burp?\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nYeah, a little burp.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nI believe you.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nSmells like gum up here.\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nDo you have gum?\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nThat's me.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nYou're like Walter Cronkite.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nI have.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nSo good.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nThere was like an opening here.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nI felt like there's my...\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nYou're busting these scoops right open.\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nI hope that...\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nI hope that...\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nI have this image of my head of Jason going back home, see his mom, and she's like...\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nAnd he's like, did you hear the episode?\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nAnd she's like, yeah, that was great.\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, I just thought...\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI mean, I didn't have any choice.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nLike, he called me up.\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nAnd then she's like, yeah, it's just like...\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nI like the podcast.\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nI don't understand why you had to be on the worst episode.\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nThe worst episode ever.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nWith the worst combination of people, with just terrible people.\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nNow, Doug, you're really fucked up.\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nI guess I'll pack up and go home.\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nA guy dressed as a fucking bag.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nI missed that.\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nWhat was that?\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nI guess I'll pack up and go home.\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nAh, you motherfucker.\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nI can't say that to you.\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nHey, Doug, zip it.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nHere, Jason.\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nThanks.\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nWhat are you going to have?\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nI'm going to have this.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nIt's a red cup.\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nYeah, my chiropractor.\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nWell, I'm not going to say...\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nOh, yeah, that's right.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nBecause of the lawsuit.\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nI will say this.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nThe malfeasance of the malpractice.\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nHe goes by doctor and then his first name.\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nLike, he sounds like a children's show, period.\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nI came in a couple of weeks ago.\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nI've been going to this guy three days a week for six months.\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nBecause I've been committed.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nI've had a terrible back since I was 17.\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nNow I'm like, okay, before I go get back surgery,\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nwhich never works out for anybody,\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nI probably should have talked about this stuff\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nbefore hearing Renee's story.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nNot exactly sounding like a hero right now.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nI go in one day and he touches right above my right buttock.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nAnd I don't really know what happened.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nShow us on the doll.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nAbove the right buttock, the dolls are for kids\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nthat don't have anatomical word power.\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nAbove the right buttock.\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nOoh la la.\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nMy hatred of the two of you tonight.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nSorry, go on.\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nAnd Doug, you keep egging them on.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nWhat?\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nThey oozed like that was a bad pun.\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nThey're like, I'll figure out how eggs are related to luggage later.\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nI have a fucking Android.\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nNow I hate all of you.\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nListen to me.\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nI am pouring myself out to you.\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nI have a bad chiropractor.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nAlright, so he's rubbing your butt.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nHe touches like this area above my butt.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nThe light's on or off.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nThat sounds to me like sciatic nerve area, right?\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nIt definitely sounds sciatic.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nSounds like a sciatic issue.\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nSounds like a right buttock.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nYeah, that's probably sciatic.\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nYou gotta check that out, man.\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nSciatic scope.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nCrazy, man. That shit'll spread.\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nAnd he goes, ooh, and I'm like, wait, what?\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nAnd he goes, it's so responsive.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nMy butt.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nAnd he's like, are you having any trouble there recently?\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nI go, no, not at all.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nMaybe it was just like, yeah, something going on there.\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nSo then he's like, you know.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nYou opt in pain?\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nNo, I didn't do anything.\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nI didn't feel anything.\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nI haven't had any problems since I started going to the guy.\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nI started going to him because I threw out my back as I do every four years.\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nAnd then at this time I'm like, okay, commitment to change in 42.\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nMy back's not going to get better.\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nI'm going to go to one chiropractor.\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nI'm going to go to him and say, just fix my back, quack.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nYackety-ack.\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nDon't, don't, don't adjust back.\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nLike, I'm going to go to one guy and I'm going to listen to his spiel\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nand I'm going to commit to the thing.\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nThree days a week, eat your celery, whatever the fuck he wants.\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nSo, so.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nEat a lot of celery.\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nDoing this. Don't get distracted by everything shiny.\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nI would have rhymed yackety-ack with saccharili-ack.\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nWhy don't you guys, the two of you, it could be such a good podcast.\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nIt was just me and Spencer and Dave the Devilbag.\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nDoug, Doug, Doug.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nAnd Carlos the Jesus.\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nCarlos the, Carlos the Jesus.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nSpaceship builder.\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nSo when you say eating your celery,\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000\ndo you mean to imply that you were doing all the things that the guy told you?\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nSpencer, are you on my shit now?\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nI'm just, you know.\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nYou're being, you're being very defensive.\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nWe're trying to, we're trying to help the story down the river.\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nWell, no, I'm being accusatory.\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nOkay.\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nOkay, so here's something that I didn't do that the guy told me to do.\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nI haven't been not sitting down for more than 30 minutes in a row.\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nThis is, I think, the most important part.\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nBusted.\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nYou know, you know, sitting's the new smoking.\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nOh yeah.\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nSince obviously this story isn't, you know, I'm just going to get through it because\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nobviously it's not, no one's on my side and I'll just get through it.\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nOkay.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nBecause my job isn't to make people like me and it's not to bend the truth.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nIt's to express myself.\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nThat's my job as an artist.\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nOkay.\n\n01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nSo I'm just, so I'm just going to tell you what happened and I'm not, I'm not, I don't\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000\ncare.\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nI don't care if you like it.\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nOne of the things that you're not supposed to sit for more than 30 minutes at a go ever.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nWhich is insane.\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nIt's also a great guide.\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nWhat if you're driving to San Diego?\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000\nYou should stand up every 30 minutes.\n\n01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nIt's, it's, it's not, it's very simple.\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nGive me a fucking break.\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nWe invented sitting.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nIt's come on.\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nWe invented smoking.\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nWhich is the old sitting.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nI think there's a Scandinavian poet as a blessed as he who sits down.\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nOkay.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nI want to hear the rest of the story.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nYou're walking down the street and when the guy comes out and he goes, hey, what story\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nare you listening to?\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nDan comes back from the car pack.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nThe sun is gone.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nThe sun is gone.\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nHey, come on.\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nHey, come on.\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nCome on.\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nCome on.\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nLet's go.\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.500\nI had my butt for a long time and I got, when I got up, I knew it was like, man, he really\n\n01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.500\ngot in there.\n\n01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.500\nHe really did some shit.\n\n01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.000\nAnd I was like, must be, must be for the greater good.\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nGo, I go.\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nWas he smelling his finger?\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nI go.\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nSee?\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nGood.\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nI'm glad.\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nIt's only a matter of time.\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nTurn, yeah.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nTurn on him.\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nI know.\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nI know.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nIt is only a matter of time.\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nHe's a, he's a national treasure.\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nHey, this guy loves Gamergate.\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nIt's not true.\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nI literally do not know what that means at all.\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nI have no idea what that means.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nThis guy's got a Gamergate tattoo on his fist.\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nI don't know what that means.\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nIt's like, so I can punch people that give bad journalism ethics.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nIt's what they, all right.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nThis guy's a bald one.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nHe's not even related to the real bald ones.\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nAll right.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nI was thinking about a bald one.\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nLike, oh man, my butt's weird.\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nI walk around.\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nButt starts hurting like, like day one.\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nButt hurts a little bit.\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nRenee, are you still with us?\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nAre you listening?\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nOkay.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nBut day two.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nButt hurts a little bit more.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nDay three.\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nButt hurts.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nRenee's like, yeah, this is great.\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nI'm pressing like the morphine button.\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nI don't, like you're the worst storyteller and your story is not compelling.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nI go, so the time goes on and I'm like in debilitating pain.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nLike I can't walk.\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nI'm like limping.\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nSo I limp into the chiropractors office the next week and I go, like, and I'm limping.\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nAnd I'm like, I've made up my mind.\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nI just want to hear what this guy has to say.\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nI'm not going to, I'm not doing shit.\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nI'm not going to go with an agenda.\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nI'm just going to limp in and I'm going to answer questions honestly and I'm going to\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nwait for him to like self-destruct.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nGood plan.\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nSo I limp in and he goes, oh, hey, oh.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nWhat's, what happened?\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nAnd I go, I don't know.\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nAnd I limp over to the table and I take out my pocket sundries and I put them on this\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nlittle OCD table.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nAnd I put my face in his fucking rented fucking Frankenstein platform and he lowers me down\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nand it's like, what's going on, what happened?\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nAnd it's like, I don't know.\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nI'm in an excruciating amount of totally new, completely unever felt before pain.\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nLike I've had lots of back pain, but this is a new type of pain and it's in that area\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nyou kept focusing on.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nAnd I just, I got my face down to the thing and he goes like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nThat's why I focused on it and I knew this would happen.\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nAnd I said, somebody hissed.\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nBecause someone took a logic course and is offended by this man having, but also loves\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nold timey pantomime.\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nAnd I was like, I was like, you knew it was going to happen.\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, remember when I was like, oh, this area is special.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000\nYeah, I remember that, but it wasn't giving me a problem before and then you focused on\n\n01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nit and he's like, yeah, I was focusing on it because I knew any day now this is going\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nto go kablooey.\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nAnd I got my face down and I said, that's one interpretation of the data.\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nWell, another way of looking at it would be you caused it.\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nSilence.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nWhat?\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nWhat?\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nNo.\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nWhat are you talking?\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nAnd he just like flew into this flurry of defenses that made me, I'm going to go back\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nand see him on Tuesday, but like this guy's on thin ice.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nHe said, he was like, he just, I said, I'm not going to say another word.\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nI didn't say that.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nI wasn't going to say another word.\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nI didn't say another word.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nI let him say everything.\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nAnd then the next, during the next 15 minutes while he like adjusted me and didn't help\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nat all, he just like, he was just babbling like all these defenses and his two main\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nplanks of argument were at one point he said, I mean, you know, this little, this gun I\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nuse, like, like, does it even seem to you like it can do that much?\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nHe's got a gun.\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nIt's a little spring loaded gun.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nDon't get distracted by that.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nIt's spring loaded.\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nIs it like a little jackhammer?\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nIt's like a little, that's why I liked it.\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nI was like, okay, this is different.\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nBecause I never understood why you get a bad back and like, you go and Jeff, don't start\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nabout your chiropractor.\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nI will fucking like, like, like Jeff, I have a really good chiropractor.\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nLike every, everybody that doesn't have a bad back has a really good chiropractor because\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nchiropractors like, like, lay you on a table and crack your back like a knuckle and it\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nfeels good.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nYou know why?\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nBecause fluid is going back into compressed discs of muscle tissue between your vertebrae\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nand it's like, oh yeah, it feels good to crack your knuckles too.\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nIt doesn't help anything, especially when they crack it both ways.\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nLike you're not aligning anything, you're not doing anything.\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nLike, like, like, and so I was like happy that the guy had a little fucking Willy Wonka\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000\ngun because I was like, actually, this is where I always thought in my head like, well,\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nif you're going to do something, why don't you just take like a little hammer and chisel\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nand like, like, bang the vertebrae around.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nWell, he fucking banged me around.\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nAnd so this was his other argument.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nHe goes, he goes, you've been seeing me for six months.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nWhat about all the other times you came in here and you weren't limping?\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nGood night, folks.\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nYeah, like logic, logic, not a big thing at the, you know, Dr. Carl's chiropractic pavilion.\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nDr. Carl's.\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nYeah, I mean, yeah, don't get offended, chiropractors.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nYou're not real doctors.\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nKid, like that's so, I mean, I don't know.\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nI'm just imagining like a cold reading like psychic and if he's going down\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nand he's telling you all this stuff about your life and then he's just like,\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nand your mom, her name is Melvin, right?\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nAnd you're like, no.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nAnd he's like, but I was right about all that other stuff.\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nIt's like, you're still, you're, you're, you're doing magic tricks.\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nYeah, I told you the thing and he kept, every time he would feel my neck after a while,\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nhe started going like, you mentioned you smoke pot.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nDid you smoke pot Wednesday?\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nOh no.\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nAnd I go like, yeah, I guess so.\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, I can tell.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nYou can tell.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nYeah, your next boggy.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nMy next boggy.\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nAnd he's like, yeah.\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nSo I did that.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nBoggy is not even one of those things.\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nYeah, no, that's what I said.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nBoggy is not a word people use.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nSo, so I did that three times with him where I answered him honestly.\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nRight.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nAnd then, but here's the thing, like, and I don't like being, I don't like lying to people,\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nbut the thing is when I start to suspect that you're so fucked up or dishonest that like\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nyou, it's like, I'm dead.\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nSo it was a, because it would just, no matter what my answer was, because I would go, no,\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nI didn't smoke pot yesterday.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nI smoked pot two days ago.\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, sometimes it takes 48 hours.\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nAnd so I was like, why aren't you trying to sell me on the idea that you can read pot\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nand use by neck feeling?\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nThat's not even on the list of requirements for you to do your job.\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nWhy are chiropractors always, like there's always, it's always different and it's always\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nthis extra thing.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nThey always have to go like, oh yes, of course you lay on the table and I'll crack your back.\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nBut did you know that spines started Christmas?\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nAnd you're always like, what?\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nLike it's always like, I know I have these salt crystals for sale or this candle of the\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nVirgin Mary.\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nAnd you're like, you too?\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nIsn't there a fucking legitimate person among you?\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nNo, there's not.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nSo we always lay a bunch of shit around it, like some weird overzealous shrine that protests\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000\ntoo much.\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nAnd so this guy's whole shtick is like, oh, the chemical abuse and the emotional abuse.\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nLike, oh yeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nWe go, okay, so I'm supposed to stand here and argue with you that I'm a great person,\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000\npsychologically, emotionally, and chemically, in order to prove that you're not a doctor?\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nSo I have to like lead a monastic life and become perfect.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nAnd then I can finally bust you.\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nMaybe that's the treatment.\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nYou're talking about it.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nYou're talking about it.\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nI'd rather, you know, I'm fine, I'm fine with my bad back.\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nI just, I just, I don't like this guy.\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nDon't go.\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nIt sounds like you just shop around a little bit.\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nYou don't have to go, man.\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nI've shopped around for years.\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nDon't go back.\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nDon't go back.\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nI'm going to go back one more time.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nI just want to, I just want to tell him.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nDon't go back to the chiropractor.\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nThat was the joke he was making.\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nIt was bad.\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nOkay, well, you know, I did it again.\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nYou know, I've been on edge lately.\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nYou know, I've been a bad person.\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nI got a divorce.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nThat's not bad.\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nThat doesn't make you bad.\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nIt's made me, I'm on, I'm not a good person lately.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nI'm seeing injustice and dishonesty where there isn't any.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nExample.\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nI'm seeing a lot of it where there is some, but like where you wouldn't normally call it out.\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nI want to read you a, I want to read you.\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nI want to read you a text message.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nPassage from the Bible.\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nJohn 316.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nThere is a guy who installed our aquarium.\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nEvery, every, every week.\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nGolan?\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nThat's right.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nYes.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nWell, I mean, let's respect his privacy.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nI'm sure there's a million Golan's in the aquarium business.\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nAlso, as his name implies, don't fuck with him or he will melt you with a death ray.\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nGolan detects intruders.\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nKneel before Golan.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nGolan resume starter fish protocol.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nGolan has selected live coral.\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nYour aquarium guy texts you.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nYeah. And every week he texts basically the same thing.\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nHey, what's up?\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nI'm sitting around hanging out.\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nNo.\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nNo, he doesn't do that.\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nNo, but that would be hilarious.\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nOkay.\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nI can keep going.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nI want to see that scene play out.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nThe two of you are going to miss me when I'm gone.\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nLike I'm going to jump off a fucking Spalding Gray.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nDon't.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nNo, don't.\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nHis back hurt.\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nNo.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nCome on.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nAnd his friends didn't support him.\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nAnd then one winter night.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nNo.\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nCome on.\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nAll right.\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nBeing overdramatic.\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nBeing weird, man.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nCome on.\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nI was trying to be funny.\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nBut then I remembered that you castaway think I'm going to kill myself.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nWhich is hilarious.\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nTo me.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nI don't think you could kill yourself.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nI think you just could fucking die, man.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nMurder.\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nI always had you packed for just a random bullet coming like flying like just through a car.\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nYou're going to have one of those random gunshot things that happen.\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nLike you're going to, ah shit, I dropped the remote.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nThat was a little time to get up.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nI dropped the remote and ducked into the path of it.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nIf you hadn't dropped the remote, you would have died.\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nIf I had sat in my White House Oval Office chair.\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nBut the ironic thing is I was sitting right there.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nISIS was aiming for the Roomba.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nAnd they get that remote.\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nAh fuck.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nI'm dead now.\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nAh shit.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nSo every week he texts.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nAnd then your ghost is like ah shit fuck.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nEvery week he texts we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow arrival 11 to 1.\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nAnd then sometimes we go thanks or sometimes we ignore it.\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nThey come.\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nThey service the aquarium once a week.\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nServe it.\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nSo then.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nSo then.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nSo this is on the heels.\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nI'm just explaining like my therapist told me.\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nShe's like you're going to notice that you're having like these.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nLike aquarium issues.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nYou're not going to be in control of your judgment about dishonesty and outrage and\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nthings like that.\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nAnd she told me this after I did this.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nAnd I was like okay that makes sense.\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nBut I still haven't apologized to this guy.\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nHe says like last week he goes we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow arrival\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000\n11 to 1.\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nErin texts thank you.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nAnd then he goes please help me.\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nSmile face LOL.\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nAnd then and then and then I think and then and then the next text it goes Yelp.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nHe's correcting himself and then the next thing is not help haha.\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nSo then I said it's notable that when you wanted us to Yelp you an impersonal corporate\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nneed.\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nYou added a smiling emoticon and an abbreviation for laughing out loud.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nBut when you saw you had accidentally expressed a human plea for help.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nGeez Louise.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nCreating a personal human need for clarification.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nYou typed haha which was unmistakably sincere.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nIt's like humanity has never lost its capacity for clarity yet actively seeks the fog of\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nambiguity.\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nAnd technology is only the latest excuse.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nAnd then the next message is from him a week later going.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nWe will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow.\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nI don't think you should apologize.\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nI don't think you should apologize.\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nWell I don't feel any remorse so the apology wouldn't work.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nRight.\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nI don't think I should have done it.\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nThat's regret.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nI think he looked at it and went what the fuck.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nIt's like I'm going.\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nI'm going on.\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nI don't need this shit.\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nHe probably thought you were talking to Erin or something.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nHe probably went this.\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nExactly.\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nIf that shit worked a community would have had higher ratings.\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nSo if he's like washing the tank and you're like sitting there.\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nSorry.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nNo.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nNo.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nI'm not.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nNo.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nNo.\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nHe should be ashamed of himself if he feels anything.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nI know.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nI agree.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nBut he doesn't.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nI'm telling you.\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nYou don't apologize.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nYou're going to.\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nIt's going to be.\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nOh my God.\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nPlease help me.\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nNo.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nNo.\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nIt's shameful.\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nA society.\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nIt's a good bit.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nI was noticing a seam in the cracks but it was like I don't need to.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nI don't need to.\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nI don't have time.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nAin't nobody got time for that.\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nYou don't need to.\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nYou don't need to text the aquarium guy that stuff.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nHe's fine.\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nYou came down a little hard on him.\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nI think.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nI just think.\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nYou know.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nI think you were procrastinating from doing something else.\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nI was writing like one of nine books or movies.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nI could either write something or I could let this guy have it.\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nI could do 300 words on this poor fucking guy.\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nHere's an audience no matter how bad a writer I am.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nI'm a genius.\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nHey aquarium guy.\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nOh my life is in the sear in yellow

birthday song is not a great song\n\n01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.400\nit's not a great song it's a stupid song like a second and most of most national anthems\n\n01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.480\nare
