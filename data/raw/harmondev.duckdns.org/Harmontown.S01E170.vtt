WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
From Hollywood, California at NerdMelt Comics

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
in the Meltdown Theater of the meltiest comic bookstore

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
where the downs are melted.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Wow, we...

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
We got a real crowd in our hands.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Let's get Spencer Crittenden out here.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Spencer!

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
How about the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you very much.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Thank you.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Very, very, very, very nice people.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
This is a boisterous crowd we have here tonight.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
They're supportive.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
And therefore, they're good.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
It's called Conditional Love.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Alright, so, I don't have a lot to talk about.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Although, there is one thing that I was having a conversation on Twitter

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
that I keep realizing, I never bring this up.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Do you remember a long, long time ago

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
in an episode called I Make a Five Stars?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I told that story about the guy.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I got dropped off by an Uber guy.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And I was like, thank you very much.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And he goes, I make a five stars.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And I was like, that was so weird.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
He's like a little Mario character.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
And then this happened a long time ago,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
but I keep on, you know, my brain, as you get older,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
you know, it just becomes a bucket with no bottom.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
It's just like a tube where you kind of feel things

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
as it goes through.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And you don't remember a lot.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
So, I totally forgot that I never shared this with you guys,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
that I got dropped off a second time.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
And, hey, how you doing?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
You've been like a million years since you've been here.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Carlos, Jesus.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Jesus.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm not racist.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
No.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It's just been that long.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm intuitive. I'm not racist.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Carlos, Jesus.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Charlie Jesus is here tonight, everybody.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
I am nomenclaturely racist.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I was like, Carlos, Jesus, what's the difference?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, I'll cop to that.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I will not cop to what that sounded like,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
like I looked at his face and was like,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
it's either Carlos or Jesus, right?

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Anyways, where was I?

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Oh, I got dropped off by another Uber driver.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah, by a different guy.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
And he had his phone on like a holder.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Good night, folks.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Forget it.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
It was like, you know, it was mounted on the dash.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
And so at this time I saw, and he said the same thing.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
He goes, I remember now, he was dropping off at the airport

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and he goes, thank you very much.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I make five stars.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
And as he said it, he gave me five stars on his app.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I make a five stars.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
It wasn't like Luigi going, I make a five stars.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It was like, I make a five stars for you.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I make a pizza.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I make a sandwich.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
For you, I make a five stars.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
For me, you make a five stars.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
It was like a beauty.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Now it all of a sudden made sense.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
All right.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I had a guy last night say literally,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
now please give me five stars.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Like he just said it straight up.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
You got to admire the, I don't know if I should call it naivete.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Like the star system, how is this working?

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Like you got to admire the pluck because of the people

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
who actually are like, you know what?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I have been told to value the stars.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
That that is like a sub currency.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
And I will, oh my God, it's already 9-11.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
We didn't, it's, I mean.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
No, guys, we fell back a tower last night.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I don't know.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
It's not, yes, you're right.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
No, I agree with you.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It stops being funny when it stops being about the number

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and about the significance of it.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Whenever it becomes anything specific, it's like gross.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I would deserve it if someone stood up and said,

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
my dad died an hour ago.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
So anyways, so, wait, what were you talking about?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Make a five stars.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
No, no, no.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
We were done with that, but.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Have we moved on?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Have we?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I think, did we move on?

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Well, no, you were talking about the pluck of people obsessed.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Oh, the star system.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
The star system.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
What is that?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't get it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Why do I have 4.8 stars?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I'll tell you why.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Because obviously you can't, you can never trump capitalism.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
This is the problem.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I agree.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
We need a star system.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
We need Yelp for people.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I wouldn't even kick that thing out of bed.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
The meow meow being saying, because what we need is a moral code.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
We need like a fucking Jedi code so that money can just be about money.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Like if you want a bigger car, if you want to get to work faster, if you want your shoes

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
to be made out of licorice, I don't know a lot about luxury.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I see how you connect those dots.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Then you use this thing called money, and that's like a thing that you use as a medium

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
of exchange.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Most of those freemium games have two forms of currency.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
They're using it to fuck you over, because if you had just had one, you could figure

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
out how to funnel it all into one, and you could beat the whole system.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Capitalism is based on one form of currency, which is the dollar.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You introduce these stars, here's the problem.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
So these guys, they're told you're not supposed to accept tips, right?

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
But somebody's tipping them, and that's why they keep getting out and like wanting to

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
open the door, because that's when they get the tip.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Somebody's tipping them.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And that's why I have 4.8 stars.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I use lift, and they never get out of the car to open the door.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I want to talk to you about lift.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
We're talking in circles.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
But a lot of lift drivers are also Uber drivers.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
They all have this Uber sticker in their window.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
They're all moonlight.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And it's all unregulated and dangerous?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
I have a question, Dan.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Did you go out last night for Halloween, and I know your back has been hurting you.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You did a show last night, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, I did a show last night.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I went to a show, but I drove through West Hollywood.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I saw a lot of people dressed up.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
There were a million people dressed up as bananas last night.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Did anybody else?

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I saw groups of bananas, like a bunch of bananas walking around.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Which I go, okay, there are a bunch of bananas.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
But also, I saw a bunch of singular bananas all night long.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I thought you were going to say cops.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
I was blown away, no pun intended, by how many fucking fake...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
All right, you know what?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Fuck you pun intended.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Suck on it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Good pun.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Here's some other things I intended.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Community, Rick and Morty.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Go fuck yourself.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And that pun.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Three, my trilogy.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
It's your legacy.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
George Lucas without a cause.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
But no, I saw so many drunk, not real cops.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Like, fratty dudes just like, this will be a fun costume.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm not saying you're a bad person for picking a costume.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I'm just like, are you insane?

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
Like, there are shooting people for carrying towels on not Halloween.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Like, you are dressed as a fucking cop with a gun on your head.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
But are they going with the safest costume of all time?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
You think the cops are just like, oh, he's fine.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
No, I mean, this happened a couple of Halloween's ago.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
There was that party.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
And like, there was a fracas or something happened.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
The neighbors called the police.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
The cops came to the door.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
One of the guys in the party was dressed as a cop, had a gun, was like, you know,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I'll take care of this or whatever.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And the cops are like, bang, boom, bang, boom, boom, boom, boom.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I don't mean to glorify it.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Boom, boom, boom, bang, bang.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
The hammer, the trigger, everybody's bigger than life.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, you applauded my choice of rhyme.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Now who's racist?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Yeah, I just thought, because I was like, I barely went out in public

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
and I encountered so many dudes.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
There was one guy that was outside the silent movie theater.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
I was like talking to some guys and a window rolled down

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and a guy went, hey, guys.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And looked over and it was like a, just looked like a, you know,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
like Michael Sarah dressed as a cop.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Like just a young looking guy.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I was just dressed as a guy.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I was like, hey, you're in arrest for partying.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Where's the party?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Was it Andy Dick?

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
It was like, he was just out of his mind and he was wearing a badge

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
that said, you know, the Pee Wee Academy.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
But you know, I bet he had a, I'm just saying like, holy shit, man.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Also, I went to the Hollywood Bowl last night

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
to see the Danny Elfin Nightmare Before Christmas thingy.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Did anybody go to that?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Nope.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's going on right now. I think they did it two nights.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So get over there.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And one of the things, I was pretty surprised.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah, you saw a lot of Jack Skellington's and Sally's,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
but there was more Beetlejuices than anybody else.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
There was a lot of Beetlejuices at the Nightmare Before Christmas.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
That was pretty funny.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
It's like guys that were a little too old

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
were kind enough to be Jack Skellington.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I used to be Jack Skellington like five years ago, man,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
but now it's like...

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
That's a hard one to pull off. He's pretty thin.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
He's a Skellington.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I met Danny Elfin.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh yeah, did you?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Yeah. The end.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
He was very nice.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
What kind of party was it? Did you have to leave your body at the door?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I did, but the thing was...

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
Can we get a camera on this guy?

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Find your cameras, Dan. Find your camera.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
He sang the song.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
He sang all the Jack Skellington parts throughout the...

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
The orchestra played to the movie.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And Pee-wee Herman came out, and Catherine O'Hara came out,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
and Greg Prips was there, which is why I got together.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
And they all sang their bit from the movie.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And at the end, he came out with a guitar on,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and everybody flipped out, and he goes,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I said I would never do this.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It's been 20 years since I played this to the day.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
And he was like, I was never going to sing this fucking song again.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
And he sang Dead Men's Party, and it got off to kind of a rocky start.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Does anyone know why he would make a promise like that?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I think he was like sick of that.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I got the impression that song was he was sick of playing it.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
On Halloween, especially probably.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
I get sick of stuff, but I don't always go like,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
like, here I go again.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm honest, I'd never jerk off in this position.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I swore it!

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
You're welcome. I have returned.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
One knee.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Edge of the bed. Lampshade.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You knew on one knee?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I promised I would never would.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Since the 1989 disc slip.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
When you said that you were a kneeler, when you jerk off,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I always thought you were like in a very supplicant, both knees, you know.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Yeah, I am. Hail Mary for the grace kind of thing.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I painted myself into a corner about like,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
how many positions could you jerk off?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And which one would you get tired of and then return?

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
So now I'm pitching you in a full T-bow, you know, on one knee.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, that takes too much time.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
See, that's why you subscribed to the show,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
so you can see that visual company.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah, for those of you listening to the free podcast.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
$5 buys you the worst visual of your life.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I jerky-afflected.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
You can figure it out.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Alright, so, I know.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Spencer, did you dress up last night?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Did you do anything for Halloween?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Do you ever dress up for Halloween?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Not often. I don't do much.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
What was the last Halloween costume that you can recall that you wore?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Uh...

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Uh...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't know.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
This seems like a painful place for you.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Yeah, well, it was like my whole life it's been all like,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
oh, I guess like, no one's doing anything this Halloween.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
I guess I'm not gonna do anything, and then I find out everyone's doing anything.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
But, you know, these days I'm so popular that I'm like,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
oh, no one invited me to anything, and then it's like 12.30,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and I see there's like five Facebook invitations that I just never saw,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
and I was like, oh, I guess I was invited.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
This is a completely, it feels exactly the same as not having been invited.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
So, I guess it's not my fault.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
If you had seen the invitations like six days ago, would you have tried to...

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I would have been like, ah, great, this is awesome.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
And then I would have been in the exact same position at 12.30 p.m. that night.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
They just slide right off like a duck's fat.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
What if the duck's fat is sliding off of ducks?

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, you know when you're searing duck meat in the pan and the fat just slides right off?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Right.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Of the pan?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
No, off of the duck.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Who is the duck in this metaphor?

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Well, I mean, I guess I would be the duck, and then the fat would...

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
No, my memory would be the duck, and then the fat would be the invitations sliding out of my memory.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
And into the pan of...

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Of regret.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Disappointment, yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So the flame is Halloween.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, I think the flame is the warmth of other people, and, you know...

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
That's only on because that's sentimental sounding, it still doesn't scan.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah, no, the warmth of other people is a catalyst that renders his fat.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
But I'm always wearing the... I'm always wearing the oven mitt of detachment and fear.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
So this is kind of...

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
You know, you have to get one of those...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
It's the...

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
It's a giant over-the-range vent of child abuse.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
The fume hood of abuse.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
It sucks everything right out of the house.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Including the vapors of parental mistrust, or...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Everything.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
The stench of drug abuse.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Nothing's ever happening in your kitchen.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
It's just like...

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Trust no one.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
And you'll never get hurt.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
What would, like, if you had a spatula, what would that be?

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Could it be the spatula of rearranged priorities?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
All right, one bit.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
All right.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
I was high with Dino, and it came up with a bit.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
These are always good.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I think... I can't remember how it came about.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It shouldn't be important, right?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Small talk pizza.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It was an idea for a pizza place.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
It's called small talk pizza.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
But it's... after the apocalypse, like, there's these places.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
Like, the only... you know, like, you ever see, like, or read or see a boy and his dog, like, kind of post-apocalypse,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
where it's just, like, everything's just a wasteland,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
and all anybody wants to do is create, like, a semblance of the old world,

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
but they just have, like, tents where they're showing, like, porn movies for a piece of aluminum,

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
and, like, everything's just sad, and everyone's sterile, and just, like, dying of cancer.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
So, like, in that world, in that post-apocalyptic wasteland,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
I think, like, there could be one franchise that would be popular with everybody.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
It would be called small talk pizza.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Everyone would respect it.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
It would be, like, a place where you put all your guns down when you go in,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
and, like, while you're in there, you can't acknowledge that the apocalypse happened.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
You can't acknowledge that the stakes have ever been higher than the weather,

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
or, like, you know, I'm in touch with the wife, you know?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
And it's just, that's what's for sale.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
The pizza's got, like, maggots on it, but it's just, like, it's called small talk pizza,

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
and it's, like, people are, like, man, I can't wait to get to this.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
They're, like, oases in the post-apocalypse.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
I want to get to the next small talk pizza, and then people, everyone, just role plays,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
pretending that there's a different world outside the pizza place,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
and then eventually they can't, they don't have any more aluminum to pay,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
and then they get kicked out, and they get shot,

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
and they get turned into more pizza, probably, in the maggot farms.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
I learned that from that Mad Max game, maggot farms.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Um, all right.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I don't want to work on maggot farms anymore.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
All right, one more thing.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
What? Wait, I didn't get that one.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It's a really awesome reference.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
It's way above you, man.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Okay, good.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
You heard those applause. Those were smart people applause.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
It's like an NPR level of a funny bone.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
A very sophisticated, vigorous clap from eight people.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
All right, yes, no, he did paint Starry Night.

18:33.000 --> 18:42.000
Um, the, uh, this is just making fun of somebody, but it's a beloved somebody.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
Like, I was, I was with Dino, I was hanging out with my ex-girlfriend, I.O.,

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
who some people like, like, like, like, like will know, like, she's like kind of the basis

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
for Britta from community and the, like, the aspects of her that sort of like.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
She speaks in yogi-beraism.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
She's like, she gets a lot of shit wrong, like, like.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
But it ends up making a weird kind of logical sense in a, in a, in a very wrong.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Politically, Britta is just me.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Like, she just wants all the rich people to burn.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Like, for instance, a long time ago, she's in a band and she said,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
hey, guys, my band's playing tomorrow night.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
You should all come.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And I said, what time do you go on?

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
Between 7.30, 9 o'clock sharp.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And then sometimes she'll say stuff that like, actually, actually like,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
actually kind of trumps the, the idiom.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Like, she was talking about somebody that lost their enthusiasm.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
He has them as like, man, he's been through all these experiences and he almost got this.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And then, and then it got taken away from him.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
It just took the sales right off his boat.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Like, actually, that's better.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
That's, that's worse than the wind out of your sail.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
That's trivializing.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
The wind changes.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Like, you know.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
The wind might come back.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
You got no sales.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
You're fucking doomed.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Her father was like, like, like, her parents are separated.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Her father was like on the string of, you know, he's kind of a senior citizen.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
And he's like, oh, he's just dating this girl and he's dating that girl.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
I mean, he's a real Don Quixote.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
She met Don Juan.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
So, so like, so a couple of nights, whenever we were hanging out, like,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
I had to write it down because we found out, because we were talking about her grandma.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
And I was like, when I was, when I was dating her years and years and years ago,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I was like, oh, I remember your grandma.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
We picked you up from the airport.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
And we, you know, she, she was already starting to succumb to dementia.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
So she grabbed someone else's suitcase.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
We didn't know that until I like, clipped the lock on it and like, pulled it open.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
There's a black family scuba diving in a photo.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
And it's like, we got to go back to LAX.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
The, we were just talking about that story.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
And it was funny.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And, and, and, and like, she's like, that grandma has passed.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
And, and, and then I, I know who loved her grandma very much.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
She's like, she's like, you know, she's gone now that she, and I was like, yeah,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
she lived, she lived for a long time, mission accomplished.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
She's like, yeah, yeah.

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
But still, I mean, yeah, good riddance grandma.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
And we were like, wait, what?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
This is like, what?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I love my grandma.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I don't think we should joke around about her.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
I was like, you, what, no, what did you just say?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
You said good riddance grandma.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
She's like, yeah, I loved her.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Like, like, like, like, it's like, I hope she has a good, good, good time.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
And like, wherever she is, it's like.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Good riddance to bad boobies.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Good riddance.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Bad to explain.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
That's not what that means.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
She thought it was like, good riddance.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
It's like, for my homies, you know, like, good, good riddance.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
Like, like, like, you've been, you've been rid of existence and.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
And good on you.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's funny because it's like, it's like, yeah, well, why do, you know,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
why, why wouldn't good riddance mean that?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I mean, it doesn't, it's arbitrary.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
It's just funny that it was like, how did she avoid that?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
All right.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
All right.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah, my chiropractor fucked up my back.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
I couldn't go to the Minecraft creators Halloween party.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You know what?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I got it pretty bad.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
But I want to know, do you know anything about the Minecraft

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
for creators Halloween party?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I know.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
I mean, dude, that guy, he created Minecraft.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
He created Minecraft, which I've been playing for my whole life.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And he lives in LA now.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And he like, what he bought, I don't know how much,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I don't want to scare him off if he likes his privacy or whatever.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I talked to him on Twitter.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
So I don't want to, I don't want to fuck up the friendship.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
But I think it's a matter of public record that like,

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
when he moved to LA, he, he fucking like, outbid Jay-Z on a house.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
It was like, and, and, and like, you can look up the house and there's a YouTube video.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
It's like, like, like when, when houses get to a certain level,

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
there's like a video for the house that's like,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
like Christopher Nolan shot it.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
But like, like, like I got crew and it's like, and it's, and no shame

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
because it's like, oh, you're paying this much money for a house.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
The reason you're going to do, it's like, you click on this YouTube video

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
and it's like, like, like, like a sports car pulls up

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
and two women who are clearly professional escorts get out of the car.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Like a Lamborghini and they just walk into the house,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
but they don't live there. They clearly do not live there.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
And so the insinuations are already crazy.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Looks like that they're just like, oh, here we are.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Like that's always like, yeah, I mean, we're not saying these women come with the house,

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
but let's face it, this house will bring these women to your door

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
and a Lamborghini, they'll just be, their ways will tell them like,

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
is this guy kind of like, is he kind of dashing figure?

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
No, no, no, he's not. He's a nerd, you know, but, but he's a bazillionaire.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And so, and, and, and, but the house is just insane.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Is this money all just that one game or is he, is he have a budget?

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah, basically. I mean, it's like he, he saw it because he created a game

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
and like sold a subscription to it, dealt honestly with the marketplace

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
and said, all you have to do ever once in your life.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
Like I've put a total of $20 into Minecraft or whatever it is because I got an,

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
you get an account that licenses you to keep playing the game as it develops.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Now it's done developing, but my, I still get to play the game

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
and everyone gets to mod it, you know, whatever.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'll do it on a different podcast.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
He sold the game to Microsoft.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Right. The game is now bought by Microsoft.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
The fucking, they're making a movie at Warner Brothers.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
It's like he himself can't even keep track of like, of what's going on.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
You know, I, I, I like, I tweeted him after I came out of a like Warner Brothers meeting.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I was like, man, do you know who's making this movie and what they're talking about?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
He's like, nope. I don't know. Fuck you.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
I just, I'm just, I've got to go.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Jay-Z's trying to get onto the compound.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
He's stacking a thousand dollar bills and trying to get Beyonce to like lift him over the gate

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
because he wants to kiss my garage, but I won't let him.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
I would just sneak in the back of one of those Lamborghinis. Those girls are driving.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah. You could definitely like easily fit an adult male in one of their cleavages.

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
You could have just like kangarooed in there, taken a bottle of wine and bought a normal sized house downhill.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Anyways, let's bring out our guests.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
My God, what an important guest we have tonight.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
I would, is national treasure too high-flown to describe our next guest?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
But I still feel like, you know, we're entertainers. We work in the entertainment industry,

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
whether we like it or not, Dan and Spencer.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
And I think there's a rule of entertainment that says give the people what they want.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes. Yes, no, it's true.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
Whether they think they deserve it or not, whether they actually want it or not.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
No, most people want it, you know, and I've been honest about the fact that I don't.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I don't like this person.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.000
I've known him long enough to make that decision, you know, and there's a peace to that, you know?

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Like, I don't like you. I don't like you. You're a bad person.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
You're immature and you're selfish.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
And then, but then he says, you know, that's you.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
But let's just talk to him about...

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
Bring him out, William H. Macy.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
Please welcome director, writer, artist, close horse...

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Close horse!

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Holocaust denier, Rob Schrab!

26:34.000 --> 26:47.000
Oh, shit!

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
The camera likes it if you sit there.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
What's that?

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
The camera likes it if you sit there.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
It's a better stage picture.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
How you doing, Dan? Yo?

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
Hey, everybody, I'm back.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Don't get excited.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
I was away for a while and I don't always listen to the episodes.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I snuck in while you were gone!

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
And I got to say, I listened to that one because there was such a media sensation.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And it was really good.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I loved it.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You and Spencer should have a spin-off.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Oh, man, okay.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Make it happen.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Make it happen!

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
So what's going on in the Lego movie?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh, top secret!

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Can't end a movie with Will Ferrell coming downstairs and going,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
they're all Legos!

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
What the fuck are you going to do in the sequel?

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
Well, the sequel all takes place in reality.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
We have...

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Will Ferrell is just like, you know something, let's get to know each other.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
You know, it's just seeing, like, you play with this stuff.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
It's like, why are we in this basement here?

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Let's go on a trip and they get in the car and they're driving, driving, driving, driving, driving.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Flat tire.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
It's like 12 minutes in.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
And then they walk into...

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
They go, wow, maybe there's more tires over here.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
This is actual dialogue that we're working with.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Are these all people that already have a...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
We all know they love Legos?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
They're actually not called Legos.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
In this one?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
No, no, ever.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
You know, Lego is...

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
Because I got corrected and I'm trying to remind myself not to say it.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
You're shaking your head.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
He's nodding.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Okay, well, can you explain?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Can you explain to the...

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
They are Lego.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
No, they're Lego bricks.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Right.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
Jesus knows because he works at SpaceX and Elon Musk doesn't like it being acknowledged that the ships are made of Legos.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Right.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Lego.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
There's a hard and fast rule there.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
You tell these people these are spaceships you do not say they're made of Legos.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
They're going to the forest to find another tire.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
But you don't say Legos, they're totally just a Lego.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
It's just Lego.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
That guy's a Lego guy.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Right, not a Legos.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
We don't play Legos.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
We play with Lego.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Right.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
You play with Lego bricks.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
That's something that they get really like, because when I was pitching myself as the director, I was like,

29:17.000 --> 29:25.000
you know, I play with Legos my whole life and they're like...

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
And they're like, Phil and Chris are Lego.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Don't hate that.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Do Legos come from...

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
That's like...

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Do they come from Scandinavia?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Legos.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Do they come from like a European country?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Who makes Lego?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
They're Danish.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Danish?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Yeah.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Are all the people in the room like Danish people?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
They're all like...

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
No, no, no, no.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Well, no, there's people from Lego that work...

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
I like what a fanciful idea you have about the Danish.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
So fancy.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
They got big gloves.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Oh!

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
You're eating croissants.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Yes.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Our croissants are crazy.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
The croissants...

30:06.000 --> 30:07.500
Is it true?

30:07.500 --> 30:10.000
What about this photo everyone keeps talking about?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
About...

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
The Loch Ness Monster?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
No, well, they...

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Let me guess, let me guess.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
The guy that invented Legos...

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Hamilton...

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Hamilton...

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Hamilton Legos...

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Hamilton J. Legos...

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Shaking hands with Hitler and they're smiling and they're...

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
You're making this up.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Okay, so...

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
So Paige...

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Paige trying to...

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Well, that's why I asked.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Trying to ruin my career.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
That's why I asked.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
That's why I asked.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
No, I'm not a scientist.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
I hear rumors and then I just re-tweet them.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Okay, okay.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
So page 12, they're looking for...

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
They're looking for tires.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
They're looking for tires.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
And we dissolve.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
It's a time thing.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And Will Ferrell is like...

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
His shirt's been torn and he's got his tie wrapped around his head to collect sweat.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
And he's chopping through the underbrush.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
The underbrush is everywhere.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
There's underbrush...

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
At the tire place?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
No, they haven't found the tire place.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
That's what they're doing, okay?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Okay, they're looking for tires.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
They have to chop through the underbrush.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
You know this.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
This is, you know, part of the story structure.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Underbrush, underbrush.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And then he turns around and he's like,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Hey, hey, I found some tires.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
He turns around.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
The boy's gone.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
The boy is gone.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
The boy is gone.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Oh, the boy, the Lego boy.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
You got tired of that.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
He went back to the car.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Was it just him and the boy?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Were there more people in their party?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Or was it just him and the boy?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Have you seen the movie?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
No.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Oh, my God.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
No.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
No.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
This isn't a movie that hasn't been made yet.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
No, the first movie.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
No, okay.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
So it's just him and the boy.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
In the first movie?

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
At the end of the first movie, it's just him and the boy?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Yes, there's him and the boy.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Okay.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Are those the only two characters that get into the car?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Okay.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
That's the only one we care about, right?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Right?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Okay.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
You don't want to violate ten.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Okay.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
So anyway, let me back up.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
So he's chopping through the underbrush.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Back up.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Chopping through the underbrush.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
We got that.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
And he's got the tire.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
And he's got his shirt wrapped around his pants and girls.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
It's so sexy.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
It's so great.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
And he's chopping through the underbrush, up underbrush.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
And he goes, hey, I found the tires.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
And he turns around.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
The boy's gone.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
The boy's gone.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
The boy got sick of it.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
He's waiting back in the car.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Okay.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Do we know that we cut back to the boy in the car?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
We do a hard cut.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Okay.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Do a hard cut.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Because no dissolves or anything like that.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
There's no wipes or anything.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Is this page 25?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Is this page 25?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Here's page.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Hard cut.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
It's like about 25, 26.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Yeah.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
25.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Okay.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
So this is the crossing of the threshold.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Yeah.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Anyway, the kid's screwing around.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
You know, he's like...

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You know, you're like humming it to him like this.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And it sounds kind of Danish.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, it's not Danish.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
It's set in America.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
It's set in 2007.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
And so that'll come back.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
That'll come back.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
And he's kicking his leg like I do.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
We did that in Milwaukee a couple of times.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Hits the brake of the car.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Okay.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
So now it's extra stop.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
No, no, no.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
You think that.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
You think that.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
But then it comes back.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It starts rolling down the hill.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Right.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
It starts rolling down the hill.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Toggle brake.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Rolling down the hill.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
It starts rolling down the hill.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
He dislodged the brake.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
He dislodged the brake.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
The emergency brake.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Yeah.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Emergency brake.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Gotcha.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
And now he's rolling down the hill.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Rolling down the hill.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Away from the end of the bridge.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Will Ferrell left his car parked on a hill in neutral?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Yeah.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Yeah.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Does the pop tire affect the rolling of the car down the hill?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
What's that?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Does that flat tire?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
No, no, no.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
You should see the shape of this hill.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Okay.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Yeah.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
That'd be cool though.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
If the car had both all four tires working, it would have clearly just rolled into a

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
nice soft embankment.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
But the one pop tire makes you in a dark, scary pattern.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Yeah.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Yeah.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Because it's doing like that.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
It's fishtailing.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
I feel like he just stole it.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
All right.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Well, you can check the date on the document.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
So that's all I'm going to give you, but I think we already know.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
All right.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
LEGO 2.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
There we go.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Thanks for the scoop.

34:21.000 --> 34:28.000
Now actually, for real, for real, I'm talking to the BBC on Thursday.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
About what?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Oh, I don't know.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Wait, what do you mean?

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
There's a certain character that the BBC owns.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
And they're asking me, would it be possible?

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Doctor Who?

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
You only do fancy eyebrow lifting if there's a Doctor Who character.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
That's a crazy leak that you just leaked.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
He just told us the first 26 pages of the movie.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Do you know how sued I'm going to get?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
All right.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm getting so sued, man, but I can afford it.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
Fuckin' money.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Money's like shit to me.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
I just throw it out the window.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Like shit.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
Right before he had any money, he used to just throw shit out the window all the time.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, I don't give a fuck about crime.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Sanitation?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Just throw it.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
What's this?

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
Hurling poop at people.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
But now you can afford to not get poop all over your hands.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
You can just throw money at people.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
People pay me not to do that.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
That's a good racket.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
That's a good racket.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
Do something obnoxious until they go, listen, here's five bucks.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Will you please stop throwing shit out the window?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I'm mowing the lawn here.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
Babies are doing hopscotch and there's shit all over my lawn.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
You remember that show Real People?

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah, with Skip Stevenson, Rick O'Casey, Fran Tarkington, Lynn Campbell.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Gordon Lightfoot.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
The crack of the 80s.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Fred Willard was in it.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That was the first time I saw Fred Willard.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That's true, yeah.

36:22.000 --> 36:30.000
They would do little human interest pieces like this guy's lost his leg, but now he's

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
got a plastic leg and he can still jump around.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
This guy's so Chinese, fish love him.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Classic Real People.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
It sounds racist, but that was the story.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Am I combining Fran Tarkington?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Who isn't that incredible and who isn't Real People?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Fran Tarkington wasn't that incredible.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
That's incredible.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Had the severe edge.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
This guy's going to lock himself in a cabinet with a Rubik's Cube and he might suffocate.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
That's incredible.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
And then Real People was like, Real People, this guy's got a flag for underwear.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
That's what it was.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
So one of the guys on Real People was, he lived in a lighthouse.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Skip Stevenson.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
No, that was one of the hosts of the show.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
He didn't live in a room.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yes, I was agreeing with him.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
One of the people, the real people that they did the show about, a guy lived in a lighthouse

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
and then there was a whole segment, or just remember, they talked about like,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
but where do you go to the bathroom?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You live all the way up on this lighthouse.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Do you have to run down every time?

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
And he goes like, well, we have a system for that.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
And then they showed this montage of bags full of pee sliding down a fishing line from

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
a top window and then exploding against a tree trunk.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
And just like piss hitting the camera.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
And I was like, well, they put the camera closer.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
First of all, why is this broadcast television?

37:52.000 --> 37:57.000
Because this is happening all over the place and no one's celebrating it.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
Second of all, how do I join the lighthouse union?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Where do I sign up?

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Second of all, drop it out the window.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Window, man.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
Too gross to, like you want it to like get out there before it explodes.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
You know, we had this discussion about our dogs, our pets, you know,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
you got to get that stuff far away from where you live.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
If you just drop it, you're going to be walking in that stuff.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
But if you throw it on the tree, it's not next to your car or the mailbox.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
So this is one tree that just soaked in pee and poo?

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
It grows like a motherfucker, though.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
The limbs are all long and stuff.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
The other trees are all jealous going, I want some pee too.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
How come he got all the pee?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
How come he got no pee?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
How come he got no pee?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
He's getting all the, what did he do?

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
The leafy tree gets the pee.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
All right.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Well, are you wearing pants?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Are you wearing pants, sir?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
I just look down.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Fair question.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
You're a duffel bag.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Oh, for Halloween?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
November 1st?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
That was yesterday.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Can we stand up here?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
He looks naked, but he's wearing a duffel bag.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
He was dressed like this last week.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Now show us your dick.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Take it out.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
What?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
I am wearing underwear.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
That's a great costume.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
That's an awesome costume.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
It's inexpensive.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Also, loaded with pockets.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
You can carry your wallet in there.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
You got your phone, your keys.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
You can put your bag of pee in there.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You can do everything you can put on.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Who did you think everybody was like, this is the closest to the Harmontown Halloween

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
show, so you thought.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Right.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
You know what would be cool?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
You're probably too young.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Do you have children by any chance?

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
You're too young.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
If you had like a little baby, you'd make them like a fanny pack.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
So I put them in the...

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Stand up again.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
You get kind of like a Will Forte last man thing going on here.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Which is kind of awesome.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
How willing are you to just sit up here for the rest of the show?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Okay.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Sit as close as possible to Dan because of the stage picture.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Well, you slide one over because I have a new friend coming up.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
I guess that'll be my second one.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
What is your name, Duffelbag, man?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Doug.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Doug the Duffelbag.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Yes.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
Your name is like this shortened version of Duffelbag.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.000
Does Doug the Duffelbag have an interesting voice?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Like when you're...

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
What's your mild manner to work a day job?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
What do you do when you're not a Duffelbag?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I do freelance PA work and some acting.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Is this the character?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
No, no, no.

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
But when you get into costume, when you take scissors and cut holes in a Duffelbag and put

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
it on, say, honey, I'm leaving the house.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
On day's work, I just don't want to be accessed baggage for anyone.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Oh, nice.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Okay.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
So he's got catchphrases.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Oh, man.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
He's got catchphrases.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Strap in.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Please.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Let's hear some more, man.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Do five minutes.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
Do your whole set.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
Actually, for those who are just listening, it does seem to me like you must have tried

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
this with like a bigger friend.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
Like if Steve A.G. was up here, the temptation would be for him to put his arms through.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Yeah.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Like and wear you like Chewbacca in Empire.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Like the straps are...

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Do you think that would work?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Have you tried that?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Oh.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Is there the weight of that?

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
There's nothing bad that's going to happen.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Oh.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm flying.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
I'm flying.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Teach him the force.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
That's pretty good.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
All right.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Jug the Duffelbag.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
That's actually...

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
This is actually a great costume because if you passed out and you...

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Yeah.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
And you have a tall friend.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
You're a fucking man.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Oh, shit.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Better take...

41:43.000 --> 41:54.000
Better take Doug home.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Oh, that would be amazing.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Just keep the tag on you that has your address and your phone number.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Drop me off.

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
I need to just drink until you pass out anywhere and the cops just like pick you up.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Put you out.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
There should be a system of carousels.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Yeah.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Just don't go to the airport.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Go to the airport at the baggage claim and just hang out.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
This whole time we've been thinking the airport sucks because it's so incompatible with real

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
life we should be turning the whole city into the airport.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
If it was all that way, Wiz Khalifa could ride his hoverboard.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Like, there wouldn't be any...

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
You know, you just...

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
You have a check TSA checkpoint outside your own front door.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
If you're rich, you have the...

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Like, you go, hey, Charlie.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And he's like, any weapons, Mr. Harmon?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Charlie, what do you think?

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Go on through.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Would have been a 95% failure rate anyway.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
And then you just step out and then you're in the concourse of reality in which you are

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
free to travel the world.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And you are also a bag.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And so everywhere...

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
Anywhere you lay down, if you just stop moving, you just certainly start moving towards like,

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
like someone will pick you up and some people could decide to take you home.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
All right.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I haven't thought it through, but...

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Would airlines be able to fat champion and pay extra if you weigh a lot?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
No.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
That's illegal.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Yeah.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
That would be illegal.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
They wouldn't be allowed to do that.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Well, think about the weight loss incentives.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
People love money and they love being fat.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
So put those two against each other.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Like, they don't do that enough.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
You know?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
You just go, oh, you're fat, huh?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Must be nice.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
What do you mean?

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
It costs a lot to be so fat.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Oh, yeah, it does.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
I should be thinner.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
So I can get those miles.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
All right.

43:46.000 --> 43:54.000
I actually did that on purpose because otherwise I would have transitioned from high octane hilarity.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Doug, are you saying that nobody...

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I'm assuming you wore this last night in Halloween, right?

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
This guy looks a lot like Justin Roiland.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Let's get him up here.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
That's right.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
That's right.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
That's a cavalcade of stars.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
You kept giving him my periphery and I kept thinking, Justin Roiland...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
We have tall Roiland with us right now.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
I love it.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Well, this is...

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
I mean, you own this.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
You brought up a guy that looks like a guy.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
I didn't ask him.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So, Justin.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
That's...

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Yes?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
My name's Garrett.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I do get the Justin Roiland thing a lot.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Yeah?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
What do they say?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Like, no, like...

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
This is what my podcast would be like.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Oh, you look like somebody I know.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
What do they say?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
What do they say?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
What my podcast is like.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Oh, okay.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
What do they say?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
What do they say to you?

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
They go, hey, man, Mr. Meeseeks is a lot like...

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Scud the disposable assassin.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
What the fuck, man?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Yeah, there was like a guy...

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Where are you?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Are you in the crowd?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Somebody came up to me and was like, are you Justin?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
What?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
And then, yeah.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And then you went, why?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
No, I just said no.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
I just said no.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Why do you ask?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Try that.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Should I?

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
With him right now.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And we'll just watch.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Okay.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I texted that photo to Justin.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Is that enough of this guy?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
But we're done.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
We're done here.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Thanks, guys.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Thank you.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
So, Doug.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
But try the creepy, you know, back of the hand stroking the arm thing, you know.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And let us know how that works out.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Doug, the devil bag.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
So you wore this last night?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Or did you have another thing?

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
I wore this last night.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
Did you get any pussy?

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
Rob, beat me to my follow-up question.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Oh, sorry.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Did you get any pussy?

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Did you get any pussy?

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
I used to say that nobody tried to wear you as a backpack last night.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
No one tried to wear me as a backpack.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
That didn't happen?

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
I know.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Wow.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
All right.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
You're hanging around with the wrong people, Doug.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
I'd like to bring a special friend up to the stage that we've never met.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
So, Jason Pollack, are you here?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
I am.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Okay.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Do you have cold feet?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
Or are you willing to come up?

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
I just want to give you...

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Yeah.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Are you willing to come up here?

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
I'd love you to.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
He didn't ask to come up.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
I'll tell you why I'm pulling him up.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Neither did I.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
Come on up, Jason Pollack, and I'll explain.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Hello.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
Jason, this is Rob.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Yes, sit there.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
So, you guys remember my neighbor, Beth Bootson, the eucalyptus tree lady?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
The tumor lady.

46:40.000 --> 46:47.000
Wonderful, wonderful ray of light in my life at this raw time.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
She texted me today and said, there's this guy.

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
He's a friend of my neighbors.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
He didn't know they were my neighbors.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
He and his mom listened to the show all the time together.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
And then he heard my neighbor, his friends, on the podcast.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Am I getting that right?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Is that about the size of it?

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Kind of confused.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
No, that's right, yeah.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Okay.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
It is a little confusing.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
But suffice it to say, you texted Beth and Dan at one point and said,

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
I just heard you on my favorite podcast that I listened to with my mom.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
So the thing is, what is that podcast?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Harvard Town.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Don't.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Don't Schrab the guy that...

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Could be Daily Groundhouse.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
You guys just saw Live Schrabbing.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
That's a...

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
So Beth texted me, this wasn't Jason's idea, but Beth texted me and said,

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
like, the thing is that Jason's mom is very sick right now.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
And they listen to the podcast every week together.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
So she's very likely listening now, or now being whenever she listens to it.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
I'm not going to assume she subscribes.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
But that you guys...

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Only $5, lady.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Yeah, what's the big deal?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Yeah.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
You guys listen to it all the time together and she's sick right now.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Where is she right now?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Salem, Oregon.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
And that's where you're from?

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I grew up in Montana and she was there too.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
Her parents got divorced and she went to Portland and now it's in Salem.

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
And you're going to visit her regularly and it's like she's sick.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
I don't even know the details.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Do you want to talk about it?

48:27.000 --> 48:33.000
Yeah, just autoimmune stuff, which kind of leads to a whole cascade of issues.

48:33.000 --> 48:41.000
And you guys, since she's become sick, have been listening to the podcast as a...

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Yeah, so I actually saw the movie first.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
That's how I got in the podcast and then sent it to her.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Not knowing if she...

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Not like you don't send Harmontown to your mom?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
I think it's normal.

48:52.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah, why would anyone's mom like me and why would anyone have this relationship with their mom?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah, I think...

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
I don't know, when you're sick it kind of forces you to just be more raw and honest about shit.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
And I felt that in the movie and podcast and sent it to her and then she just...

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
She like, flipped out, loved it.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
It's just become like a fun thing to talk about and share.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
What's her name?

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Renee?

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Renee.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Hello, Renee.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Hello, Renee.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Hello, Renee.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
So was your relationship with your mom...

49:24.000 --> 49:33.000
Are you just one of these people that I can't relate to at all that just had always an unconditional, nice, healthy partnership with your mom the whole time?

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
Or has the sickness transformed as you might have implied a second ago?

49:39.000 --> 49:48.000
I wouldn't say it wasn't all rosy and perfect that way, but I think she's always a good loving mom trying to love and fucking up and doing it good.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
No crazy distance or anything like that.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
But yeah, just getting sick has definitely transformed that.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Everything all of a sudden is like...

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
Yeah, yeah, and just more honest conversations and more conversations.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Who is it?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Is it me?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It's probably you.

50:04.000 --> 50:10.000
There's shame in autoimmune diseases because I always hear people with them, they say I have an autoimmune disease.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
They never specify what it is.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
So is like their confusion or is their overlap or what's the deal with that?

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
Is it just that they're all obscure and it doesn't bear mentioning?

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
Yeah, I feel there's kind of like a stigma of...

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
It doesn't seem to get as much sympathy as like a cancer or something that's...

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Right.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
And I don't know why.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
A friend of mine has lupus, so that's an autoimmune disease, right?

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
So it's different than that.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
There's many kinds of autoimmune disorders and stuff.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yeah, there is.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
So what is that?

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
Like your white blood cells are just going away or what's happening?

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
I asked her to text me today like a list of everything.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
So she's hospitalized right now?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
She's not hospitalized right now.

50:51.000 --> 50:56.000
Like two years ago she was in critical care and didn't know if she'd kind of come back online.

50:56.000 --> 51:04.000
But yeah, just it's no energy if anything, she gets a cold or anything bumps her immune system.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
Like her reaction to it's really, really bad and severe.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It takes a little longer to recover.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Just no energy.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Who is it that you talk to that tells you...

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
Like you're talking to doctors, she's talking to doctors and what the...

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
It's all so shrouded in like vagaries.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Like are they always scratching their head?

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah, it was... there were years where...

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
Because when you talk to anybody, I feel like one of the first questions you ask is how are you?

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
And it was like a year ago, I think I just told her like I don't want to ask that anymore.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Which you feel so guilty, right?

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Like especially to your parent.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
But yeah, just like every time.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Like well, they think it's this and now it might be this.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
And it's all kind of interconnected.

51:50.000 --> 51:57.000
So for several years now, just like every time we talk, there's kind of a new idea.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Like a new hope, a new problem.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It always just seems kind of...

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
So they're just kind of chasing the symptoms of what's going on because the immunity is low.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
But they can't get to the bottom of the original cause.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Is there anything, because for me it's like I have this wall in front of me.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
I'm more comfortable saying things into a microphone and a podcast in front of strangers.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Like I have no relationship with my family.

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
And when one of them gets sick, everything's going to go lateral.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I have no idea how.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Erin spent our marriage warning me about that.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
She lost her mom at 17 and she's like, you know, she wasn't being mean about it.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
She's just like, you have no idea how fucked you are.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.000
Like you have no method of dealing with this stuff.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
And it's going to hit you like you're not dealing with it.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Call your fucking dad at his birthday.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
She wasn't mean about it. She was trying to help me.

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
Like for me, it's like it's ironically easier to talk into a microphone to strangers

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
than it is to talk to people.

53:04.000 --> 53:11.000
And I was wondering like, is there anything knowing that your mom is listening to her favorite podcast, her favorite?

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
What is your mom's favorite podcast?

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
This is her favorite one. She's not subscribed to it.

53:19.000 --> 53:27.000
Is there anything that is easier to say when you're not standing next to her?

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
Like sharing this channel? I don't know. I thought that would be...

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
No.

53:33.000 --> 53:42.000
Mom, there's $400,000 worth of Nazi Deutschmarks in the floorboards in the Piedoter.

53:42.000 --> 53:49.000
Renee, if you're listening, what we're going to do to send our blessings and stuff,

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
we're going to fill Doug's duffel bag with gifts.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
We're going to mail him to Salem, Oregon.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Well, here's what I thought we really could do, because there should be an upside...

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
We're going to fill him up with Toblerone chocolates.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
The downside with the medical industry when they can't figure out what pill to prescribe

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
and what to diagnose it as and what's going on and what to radiate and all this stuff,

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
the downside is Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on and when do I know and all this stuff,

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
the upside should be that uncertainty can be our friend because within that uncertainty

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
we can make things possible.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
Not to be corny, but if we just as egomaniacs who love our own podcast

54:29.000 --> 54:36.000
and who admire this person for listening to a podcast or son listens to,

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
we all want to be proven right, we all want to be proven that our podcast has power

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
and that we're good people and whether it comes to anything or not,

54:45.000 --> 54:53.000
I just want to ritualistically, for one moment, like Renee, close your eyes,

54:53.000 --> 55:04.000
open the force fields for one second while the bad things aren't looking, they're napping,

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
open up wide and we're going to flood your system with good energy.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
Everybody right now within the sound of my voice, Duncan Trussell couldn't be here,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
he'd do this better.

55:16.000 --> 55:25.000
Everybody beam like all of your fucking like shitty ego driven feelings of pride

55:25.000 --> 55:32.000
and ego and stuff and like thrust them out into space where they turn into laser beams

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
and then you shoot across the sky to Renee because when you love yourself

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
and want yourself to be right and want your favorite band to be the best band,

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
all that stuff is good energy, all you have to do is like just send it to somebody

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
who needs it right now more than anybody and so that's what I'm doing.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
My beam is stronger than everyone's.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
Renee, we are all light.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
I'm so tempted to put a rap beat on it and see how you deal with this.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Well, we'll do that in a second.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
Please don't fuck Renee in a rap right now.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
We want you to recognize that yes, everyone's a beam of light,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
so you would think it was all kind of cohesive but there is one strong stripe of light

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
that represents of course me and in my special light.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Are you claiming stronger light beams right now?

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
You know, in Gremlins you need like a bad guy, you know?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Like, oh, there's Stripe, you know?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
He's got a Mohawk.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Renee knows what I'm talking about.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
He was called Stripe because of the Mohawk?

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
Well, he wasn't called Stripe because the word sounded neat.

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
Okay, well, I never connected that.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Did you Stripe also have Stripes kind of on him too?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Wasn't he kind of Stripey?

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
He would like that diagonal like he was in jail, like a hamburger?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
No, you fucking dimwits.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
He had a fucking Stripe.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I fucking hate all of you.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Your piece is a shit and you don't pay attention to Gremlins.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
Renee, you're feeling your immune system is responding positively.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
Oh, I told this lady to lower her defenses and you just made me send toxins into the fucking...

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
You assholes.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Now she has Gremlin hatred in her body.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Very sorry.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I just was asking her a question.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
Anyways, God bless you Renee.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
Thank you so much for having an open-minded relationship with your son

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
where you share in the same things and I'm so sorry that things are going bad for you

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
and like we are all right now in Los Angeles because believe me,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
we have nothing better to do with our spirits.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
We're sending them all to you and they're going into the middle of your forehead

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
where there is a little tiny dent that you can't see

57:44.000 --> 57:50.000
and it's going through your pineal gland to the base of your skull

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
where there's a stem that has existed since you were a flower

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
and it's going down and radiating throughout all of your body

57:58.000 --> 58:09.000
and it's saving you because nobody else wants that to happen except for you and us

58:09.000 --> 58:15.000
and like no one's paid any attention to it until now and you're not alone

58:15.000 --> 58:21.000
and we're doing it, we did it if it's mysterious that it's solved.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
Right now I'm sending you a better beam than Dan is sending right now.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
No, he's talking too much. I'm really concentrating on my beam.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
I will admit Renee.

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
That feeling you're getting right now of complete pleasure and detachment

58:35.000 --> 58:41.000
and like spiritual freedom, that's my beam.

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
Well, I'm not going to be a dick in Renee's unconscious.

58:46.000 --> 58:54.000
I will admit Renee, Jeff's right, I kind of fucked up my, so I accept that

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
and that should be more of an example of how healing my energies are

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
so in a way they're better than Jeff's because they're more acquiescent

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
and that's the thing is like the nature has a way and a healing way

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
and my healing way is better than Jeff's because it's not competitive.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
Alright, you're healed up, put your shields back up Renee, put them up

59:16.000 --> 59:21.000
against the assholes and the bureaucrats and the licensed serial killers

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
with support systems that call themselves doctors.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
You have been cured purely by us.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
Send us all your checks from now on.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Just make your checks payable too.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
We are now tax exempt now.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Harmontown shield lowers.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
Kidding about, there's good doctors, everyone's fine, I was just kidding,

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
I'm just being a petty asshole when I get sick, I'll love them.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
They scare me right now.

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
Dan, would you take, because you seem very affected and I'm not joking about this,

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
like you, there's a guy, Jason here, Jason, right, likes the show,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
came on the show because you know that his mother is sick

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
and you are clearly, it's not just impressed, almost envious of the relationship

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
that he has with his parents, as you probably, as we all ought to be

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
because it's great, would this ever make you more likely to call

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
your mother and father once in a while to create that thing?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Look, I'm not the problem in that relationship.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Dan, I'm going to do something right now, lower your force fields.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
No.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Lower your force fields.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
No.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I'm going to send you a beam.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
My force fields are amazing and...

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
No, I'm not, no, no.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
My mother has my number.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
She has my number.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
She can call me whenever she wants.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
But if she did, would you pick up the phone?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
She doesn't.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And she says, except to like tweet me and say like,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
but nice to hear from you once in a while, text me, you ape.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It's a cold family.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Yes, that did not go the way I thought it was going to go.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I thought we were going to have a real slam dunk moment there.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
This is not...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
This is...

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Yes, so obviously there's no subtext here.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Yes, of course, I want Renee and Jason to be rewarded for doing it right.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Of course I do.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I want everybody that has...

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
This is my family.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I want everything that I do, every project I work on, everything,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
you know, there's nothing unhealthy about that.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
My therapist said so.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
You don't have to love the people that you were born next to.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's like that would be dumb logic, you know, Hitler's dad.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
He was supposed to be super cool.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah, you're right.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
It was Hitler's son, whatever.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It doesn't matter, you know, whatever.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Who cares?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It's coincidence.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It's nice when people get along with their family.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I feel like you're wearing the oven mitt of detachment right now, Dan.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It works.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
We got a guy dressed like a bag up here a little bit.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I know, it's nice.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Well, Jason...

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It's kind of comforting to have a double bag on stage.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Can I ask about the...

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Is dad in the picture?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah, my dad's still in Montana.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Him and I get along great.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
That didn't happen until like 25.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
They're divorced, yeah, they're divorced.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I now approve of that a lot, just because I don't want to seem like a bad person.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I got divorced, so now I'm telling everyone to get divorced.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
How's divorce too?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
You were divorced?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Really?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
How long are you married?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Just over eight months.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Wait, you just got divorced after eight months?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Doug Duffelbag for the most part.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You pussy, I went 11.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Again, you win.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Dr. High Road.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Jason, do you have siblings?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
One brother and one half sister.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Are you young enough for me to ask how old you are?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
38.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Okay, no, you're not.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You're an old, old geezer.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
So, can we ask more questions about your life?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Yeah.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
What are you career wise?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Advertising.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Like a writer?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Yeah.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
What's, did you write anything?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
You're like, yeah, you know, the idea that Snickers satisfies you?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I wrote that.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Das Mias, PN work last year for NFL Countdown.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Samsung spots, stuff like that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
How does that, what do you do?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
The TV people.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Why don't you have your own podcast?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
This is good stuff.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I wake up every morning going, asking the same question.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
That was a toothbrush.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I don't have a podcast.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I wake up every morning.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I don't have a podcast.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I should have a podcast.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
How do you guys know the Bootsons?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I worked with Dan at Radical for editing him.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Sounds like a cool place.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Nice.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Nice restraint on that one.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Doug, what do you do?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Yeah, so I do the freelance PA and acting gigs and then I do stand up.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
How do you be a freelance PA?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
What does that mean?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I just reach out to people who are having productions and then I'm like, you guys need any PAs?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Okay.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I mean, that is something that almost people do as well.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Guys wearing a bag.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It's not as stretch for them to have a box for a house.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Is the strategy that if you wander up to a hot set and they're understaffed enough that you can get onto it, they need you?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Because there's no, if anyone comes up to you and goes like,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
hey, can I help you sir?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
You're like, no, you can't because you're here.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
If that doesn't happen, you just walk up to Penny Marshall's trailer, knock on the door.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And she goes, yes.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And you go like, I could have killed you.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Hire me as a PA and this won't happen again.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Usually through Facebook and mutual friends and stuff.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
All right.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
All right.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I wrote it.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I wrote it.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I don't know, I was just amused by the concept.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You just stand up, you say?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yeah?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Yeah.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
What did you say?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Did you say where you're from already?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I moved up from San Diego a little over a year ago.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Good for you.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Ah.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Rob, you have follow-up San Diego questions?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
No, no, I know where it is.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Your question would have been, where's San Diego?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Jason, what's the coolest thing your mom ever did?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Ah, the coolest thing.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Oh, man.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
We can edit out the pause if it takes really long time for you to...

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
My mom bought me a typewriter when I was like, you know, nine.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
What's a little typewriter?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Put your little ring on.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
We need a baby typewriter.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I can't hear you right now because I'm like, nah, I don't have enough toxins in my body

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
to process the organs necessary to perceive you.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Little typewriter.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I don't even know what's next to me.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It's like a ghost.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Have the full alphabet?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Or is it like the mini Crayola only has like seven colors in it?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Yeah.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Like, just give them the vowels.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Just the primaries.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Yeah.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
One kid is a goo and one's a gah.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You got anything, Jason?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Super, this is so cheesy and sweet to ridiculous play.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You mean podcast dynamite?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Oh, no.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
When I was little, I had asthma.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I had a really bad attack.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I was hospitalized and I saw a little stuffed tiger on the way into the hospital.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And just like little kids do, was obsessed and had to have that or the world would end.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And she didn't have enough money to get it for me and then ended up like, you know, somehow the nurses knew

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and like everyone kind of came together and she was able to get it for me.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So now that I say that out loud, it sounds like this is the nicest thing the nurses ever did.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I hadn't thought that went through all the way.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
But you know behind every great nursing staff is probably a mom like going, come on, let's snap on this.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And they're going, what do you mean snap on this?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
That's not an expression.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Well, the God is an unreliable narrator, he's drunk.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Ooh.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
That's very sweet.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I like that a lot.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So when you got the tiger, did you freak out?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Are you very happy?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Yeah.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Super happy.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But did you know right away that she had gone through those links to get it for you or did you find out later?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah, I found out later.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
That's great.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Do you still have the tiger?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I did.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I put it in a box today.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
That's awesome.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
That's great.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So what did your mom tell you about when you, what are you going to be when you grow up?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Did she ever have a talk with you about when you're supposed to pick your career?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
If you were going to be a bird or a bee.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Because I remember my mom saying you can be anything you want.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
There's another cool thing.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
You could be a bird or a bee.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So wait, is it this awesome lady that gave you all this support and the typewriter?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
You still don't call this woman?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Why do you stick a fucking...

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
My force fields are down, you can stick it wherever you want right now.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Hey, have a little ice.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Boom!

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Do you want a drink, Jason?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Yeah.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I'll have a drink.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
See?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Do you want any ice in it?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You better get it.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
You better say yes soon because he's taking it off.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Empathy.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I just practiced empathy.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And believe me, I really have to practice it.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You got a little bubble throat?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
What was that?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You got a little burp?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Yeah, a little burp.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I believe you.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Smells like gum up here.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Do you have gum?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
That's me.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
You're like Walter Cronkite.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I have.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So good.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
There was like an opening here.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I felt like there's my...

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You're busting these scoops right open.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I hope that...

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I hope that...

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I have this image of my head of Jason going back home, see his mom, and she's like...

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And he's like, did you hear the episode?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And she's like, yeah, that was great.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And he's like, yeah, I just thought...

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I mean, I didn't have any choice.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Like, he called me up.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And then she's like, yeah, it's just like...

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
I like the podcast.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I don't understand why you had to be on the worst episode.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The worst episode ever.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
With the worst combination of people, with just terrible people.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Now, Doug, you're really fucked up.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I guess I'll pack up and go home.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
A guy dressed as a fucking bag.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I missed that.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
What was that?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I guess I'll pack up and go home.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Ah, you motherfucker.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I can't say that to you.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Hey, Doug, zip it.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Here, Jason.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Here we go.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Thanks.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
What are you going to have?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I'm going to have this.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It's a red cup.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Yeah, my chiropractor.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
What's his name?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Well, I'm not going to say...

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Because of the lawsuit.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I will say this.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
The malfeasance of the malpractice.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
He goes by doctor and then his first name.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Like, he sounds like a children's show, period.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I came in a couple of weeks ago.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I've been going to this guy three days a week for six months.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Because I've been committed.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I've had a terrible back since I was 17.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Now I'm like, okay, before I go get back surgery,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
which never works out for anybody,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I probably should have talked about this stuff

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
before hearing Renee's story.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Not exactly sounding like a hero right now.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I go in one day and he touches right above my right buttock.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And I don't really know what happened.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Show us on the doll.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Above the right buttock, the dolls are for kids

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
that don't have anatomical word power.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Above the right buttock.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Ooh la la.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
My hatred of the two of you tonight.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Sorry, go on.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And Doug, you keep egging them on.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
What?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
They oozed like that was a bad pun.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
They're like, I'll figure out how eggs are related to luggage later.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I have a fucking Android.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Now I hate all of you.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Listen to me.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I am pouring myself out to you.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I have a bad chiropractor.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Alright, so he's rubbing your butt.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
He touches like this area above my butt.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
The light's on or off.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
That sounds to me like sciatic nerve area, right?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It definitely sounds sciatic.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Sounds like a sciatic issue.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Sounds like a right buttock.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yeah, that's probably sciatic.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
You gotta check that out, man.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Sciatic scope.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Crazy, man. That shit'll spread.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And he goes, ooh, and I'm like, wait, what?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And he goes, it's so responsive.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
My butt.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Okay.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And he's like, are you having any trouble there recently?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I go, no, not at all.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Maybe it was just like, yeah, something going on there.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So then he's like, you know.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
You opt in pain?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
No, I didn't do anything.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I didn't feel anything.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I haven't had any problems since I started going to the guy.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I started going to him because I threw out my back as I do every four years.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And then at this time I'm like, okay, commitment to change in 42.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
My back's not going to get better.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I'm going to go to one chiropractor.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I'm going to go to him and say, just fix my back, quack.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Yackety-ack.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Don't, don't, don't adjust back.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Like, I'm going to go to one guy and I'm going to listen to his spiel

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
and I'm going to commit to the thing.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Three days a week, eat your celery, whatever the fuck he wants.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
So, so.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Eat a lot of celery.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Doing this. Don't get distracted by everything shiny.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I would have rhymed yackety-ack with saccharili-ack.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Why don't you guys, the two of you, it could be such a good podcast.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
It was just me and Spencer and Dave the Devilbag.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Doug, Doug, Doug.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And Carlos the Jesus.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Carlos the, Carlos the Jesus.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Spaceship builder.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
So when you say eating your celery,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
do you mean to imply that you were doing all the things that the guy told you?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Spencer, are you on my shit now?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I'm just, you know.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You're being, you're being very defensive.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
We're trying to, we're trying to help the story down the river.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Well, no, I'm being accusatory.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Okay.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Okay, so here's something that I didn't do that the guy told me to do.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Here we go.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I haven't been not sitting down for more than 30 minutes in a row.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
This is, I think, the most important part.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Busted.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
You know, you know, sitting's the new smoking.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Oh yeah.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Since obviously this story isn't, you know, I'm just going to get through it because

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
obviously it's not, no one's on my side and I'll just get through it.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Okay.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Because my job isn't to make people like me and it's not to bend the truth.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
It's to express myself.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
That's my job as an artist.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Okay.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So I'm just, so I'm just going to tell you what happened and I'm not, I'm not, I don't

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
care.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I don't care if you like it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
One of the things that you're not supposed to sit for more than 30 minutes at a go ever.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Which is insane.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It's also a great guide.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
What if you're driving to San Diego?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
You should stand up every 30 minutes.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
It's, it's, it's not, it's very simple.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Give me a fucking break.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
We invented sitting.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It's come on.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
We invented smoking.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Which is the old sitting.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I think there's a Scandinavian poet as a blessed as he who sits down.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Okay.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I want to hear the rest of the story.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You're walking down the street and when the guy comes out and he goes, hey, what story

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
are you listening to?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Dan comes back from the car pack.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
The sun is gone.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
The sun is gone.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Hey, come on.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Hey, come on.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Come on.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Come on.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Let's go.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.500
I had my butt for a long time and I got, when I got up, I knew it was like, man, he really

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.500
got in there.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.500
He really did some shit.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.000
And I was like, must be, must be for the greater good.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Go, I go.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Was he smelling his finger?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I go.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
See?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Good.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I'm glad.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
It's only a matter of time.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Turn, yeah.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Turn on him.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I know.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I know.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
It is only a matter of time.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
He's a, he's a national treasure.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You know what?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Hey, this guy loves Gamergate.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
It's not true.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I literally do not know what that means at all.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I have no idea what that means.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
This guy's got a Gamergate tattoo on his fist.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I don't know what that means.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It's like, so I can punch people that give bad journalism ethics.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
It's what they, all right.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Here we go.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
This guy's a bald one.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
He's not even related to the real bald ones.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Here we go.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
All right.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I was thinking about a bald one.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Here we go.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Here we go.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Like, oh man, my butt's weird.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I walk around.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Butt starts hurting like, like day one.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Butt hurts a little bit.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Renee, are you still with us?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Are you listening?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Okay.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
But day two.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Butt hurts a little bit more.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Day three.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Butt hurts.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Renee's like, yeah, this is great.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I'm pressing like the morphine button.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I don't, like you're the worst storyteller and your story is not compelling.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I go, so the time goes on and I'm like in debilitating pain.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Like I can't walk.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I'm like limping.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000
So I limp into the chiropractors office the next week and I go, like, and I'm limping.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And I'm like, I've made up my mind.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I just want to hear what this guy has to say.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I'm not going to, I'm not doing shit.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I'm not going to go with an agenda.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I'm just going to limp in and I'm going to answer questions honestly and I'm going to

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
wait for him to like self-destruct.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Good plan.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
So I limp in and he goes, oh, hey, oh.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
What's, what happened?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And I go, I don't know.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And I limp over to the table and I take out my pocket sundries and I put them on this

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
little OCD table.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:04.000
And I put my face in his fucking rented fucking Frankenstein platform and he lowers me down

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
and it's like, what's going on, what happened?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And it's like, I don't know.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I'm in an excruciating amount of totally new, completely unever felt before pain.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Like I've had lots of back pain, but this is a new type of pain and it's in that area

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
you kept focusing on.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And I just, I got my face down to the thing and he goes like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
That's why I focused on it and I knew this would happen.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
And I said, somebody hissed.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Because someone took a logic course and is offended by this man having, but also loves

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
old timey pantomime.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And I was like, I was like, you knew it was going to happen.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
And he's like, yeah, remember when I was like, oh, this area is special.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Yeah, I remember that, but it wasn't giving me a problem before and then you focused on

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
it and he's like, yeah, I was focusing on it because I knew any day now this is going

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
to go kablooey.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And I got my face down and I said, that's one interpretation of the data.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
What do you mean?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Well, another way of looking at it would be you caused it.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Silence.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
What?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
What?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
No.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
What are you talking?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And he just like flew into this flurry of defenses that made me, I'm going to go back

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
and see him on Tuesday, but like this guy's on thin ice.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
He said, he was like, he just, I said, I'm not going to say another word.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I didn't say that.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I wasn't going to say another word.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I didn't say another word.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I let him say everything.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And then the next, during the next 15 minutes while he like adjusted me and didn't help

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000
at all, he just like, he was just babbling like all these defenses and his two main

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
planks of argument were at one point he said, I mean, you know, this little, this gun I

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:14.000
use, like, like, does it even seem to you like it can do that much?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
He's got a gun.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It's a little spring loaded gun.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Don't get distracted by that.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It's spring loaded.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Is it like a little jackhammer?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It's like a little, that's why I liked it.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I was like, okay, this is different.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Because I never understood why you get a bad back and like, you go and Jeff, don't start

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
about your chiropractor.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I will fucking like, like, like Jeff, I have a really good chiropractor.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Like every, everybody that doesn't have a bad back has a really good chiropractor because

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
chiropractors like, like, lay you on a table and crack your back like a knuckle and it

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
feels good.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
You know why?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Because fluid is going back into compressed discs of muscle tissue between your vertebrae

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
and it's like, oh yeah, it feels good to crack your knuckles too.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
It doesn't help anything, especially when they crack it both ways.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Like you're not aligning anything, you're not doing anything.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Like, like, like, and so I was like happy that the guy had a little fucking Willy Wonka

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
gun because I was like, actually, this is where I always thought in my head like, well,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
if you're going to do something, why don't you just take like a little hammer and chisel

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and like, like, bang the vertebrae around.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Well, he fucking banged me around.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And so this was his other argument.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
He goes, he goes, you've been seeing me for six months.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
What about all the other times you came in here and you weren't limping?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Good night, folks.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah, like logic, logic, not a big thing at the, you know, Dr. Carl's chiropractic pavilion.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Dr. Carl's.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Yeah, I mean, yeah, don't get offended, chiropractors.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
You're not real doctors.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Kid, like that's so, I mean, I don't know.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I'm just imagining like a cold reading like psychic and if he's going down

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
and he's telling you all this stuff about your life and then he's just like,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
and your mom, her name is Melvin, right?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And you're like, no.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And he's like, but I was right about all that other stuff.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It's like, you're still, you're, you're, you're doing magic tricks.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yeah, I told you the thing and he kept, every time he would feel my neck after a while,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
he started going like, you mentioned you smoke pot.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Did you smoke pot Wednesday?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Oh no.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And I go like, yeah, I guess so.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And he's like, yeah, I can tell.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
You can tell.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Yeah, your next boggy.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
My next boggy.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And he's like, yeah.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So I did that.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Boggy is not even one of those things.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Yeah, no, that's what I said.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Boggy is not a word people use.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
So, so I did that three times with him where I answered him honestly.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Right.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And then, but here's the thing, like, and I don't like being, I don't like lying to people,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
but the thing is when I start to suspect that you're so fucked up or dishonest that like

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
you, it's like, I'm dead.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
So it was a, because it would just, no matter what my answer was, because I would go, no,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I didn't smoke pot yesterday.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I smoked pot two days ago.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And he's like, yeah, sometimes it takes 48 hours.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And so I was like, why aren't you trying to sell me on the idea that you can read pot

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
and use by neck feeling?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
That's not even on the list of requirements for you to do your job.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Why are chiropractors always, like there's always, it's always different and it's always

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
this extra thing.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
They always have to go like, oh yes, of course you lay on the table and I'll crack your back.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
But did you know that spines started Christmas?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And you're always like, what?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Like it's always like, I know I have these salt crystals for sale or this candle of the

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Virgin Mary.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And you're like, you too?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Isn't there a fucking legitimate person among you?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
No, there's not.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000
So we always lay a bunch of shit around it, like some weird overzealous shrine that protests

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
too much.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
And so this guy's whole shtick is like, oh, the chemical abuse and the emotional abuse.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Like, oh yeah, yeah.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
We go, okay, so I'm supposed to stand here and argue with you that I'm a great person,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000
psychologically, emotionally, and chemically, in order to prove that you're not a doctor?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So I have to like lead a monastic life and become perfect.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And then I can finally bust you.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Maybe that's the treatment.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Yeah.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You're talking about it.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000
You're talking about it.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I'd rather, you know, I'm fine, I'm fine with my bad back.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I just, I just, I don't like this guy.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Don't go.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
It sounds like you just shop around a little bit.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
You don't have to go, man.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I've shopped around for years.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Don't go back.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Don't go back.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I'm going to go back one more time.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I just want to, I just want to tell him.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Don't go back to the chiropractor.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
That was the joke he was making.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
It was bad.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Okay, well, you know, I did it again.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
You know, I've been on edge lately.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
You know, I've been a bad person.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
What did you do?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I got a divorce.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
That's not bad.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
That doesn't make you bad.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
It's made me, I'm on, I'm not a good person lately.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I'm seeing injustice and dishonesty where there isn't any.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Example.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I'm seeing a lot of it where there is some, but like where you wouldn't normally call it out.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I want to read you a, I want to read you.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Here we go.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I want to read you a text message.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Passage from the Bible.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
John 316.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
There is a guy who installed our aquarium.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Every, every, every week.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Golan?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
That's right.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yes.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Well, I mean, let's respect his privacy.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I'm sure there's a million Golan's in the aquarium business.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yeah.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Also, as his name implies, don't fuck with him or he will melt you with a death ray.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Golan detects intruders.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Kneel before Golan.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Golan resume starter fish protocol.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Golan has selected live coral.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Your aquarium guy texts you.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah. And every week he texts basically the same thing.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Hey, what's up?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I don't know.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I'm sitting around hanging out.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
No.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
No, he doesn't do that.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
No, but that would be hilarious.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Okay.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I can keep going.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I want to see that scene play out.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
The two of you are going to miss me when I'm gone.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Like I'm going to jump off a fucking Spalding Gray.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
No, no.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Don't.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
No, don't.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Yeah.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
His back hurt.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
No.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Come on.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Yeah.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
And his friends didn't support him.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And then one winter night.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
No.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Come on.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
All right.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Being overdramatic.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Yeah.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Being weird, man.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Come on.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I was trying to be funny.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
But then I remembered that you castaway think I'm going to kill myself.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Yeah.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Which is hilarious.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
To me.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I don't think you could kill yourself.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I think you just could fucking die, man.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Murder.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I always had you packed for just a random bullet coming like flying like just through a car.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
You're going to have one of those random gunshot things that happen.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Like you're going to, ah shit, I dropped the remote.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
That was a little time to get up.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I dropped the remote and ducked into the path of it.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Yeah.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
If you hadn't dropped the remote, you would have died.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
If I had sat in my White House Oval Office chair.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
But the ironic thing is I was sitting right there.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
ISIS was aiming for the Roomba.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And they get that remote.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Ah fuck.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I'm dead now.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Ah shit.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So every week he texts.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And then your ghost is like ah shit fuck.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Every week he texts we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow arrival 11 to 1.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And then sometimes we go thanks or sometimes we ignore it.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
It doesn't matter.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
They come.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
They service the aquarium once a week.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Serve it.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So then.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
God damn it.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So then.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So this is on the heels.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I'm just explaining like my therapist told me.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
She's like you're going to notice that you're having like these.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Like aquarium issues.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.000
You're not going to be in control of your judgment about dishonesty and outrage and

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
things like that.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And she told me this after I did this.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And I was like okay that makes sense.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But I still haven't apologized to this guy.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
He says like last week he goes we will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow arrival

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
11 to 1.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Erin texts thank you.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And then he goes please help me.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Smile face LOL.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And then and then and then I think and then and then the next text it goes Yelp.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
He's correcting himself and then the next thing is not help haha.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So then I said it's notable that when you wanted us to Yelp you an impersonal corporate

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
need.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
You added a smiling emoticon and an abbreviation for laughing out loud.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
But when you saw you had accidentally expressed a human plea for help.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Geez Louise.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Creating a personal human need for clarification.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
You typed haha which was unmistakably sincere.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It's like humanity has never lost its capacity for clarity yet actively seeks the fog of

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
ambiguity.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And technology is only the latest excuse.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And then the next message is from him a week later going.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
We will be there to service the aquarium tomorrow.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I don't think you should apologize.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I don't think you should apologize.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Well I don't feel any remorse so the apology wouldn't work.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Right.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Yeah.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I don't think I should have done it.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
That's regret.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I think he looked at it and went what the fuck.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Yeah.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
It's like I'm going.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I'm going on.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I don't need this shit.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
He probably thought you were talking to Erin or something.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
He probably went this.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Yeah.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Exactly.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
If that shit worked a community would have had higher ratings.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000
So if he's like washing the tank and you're like sitting there.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Sorry.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
No.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
No.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I'm not.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
No.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I don't know.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
No.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
He should be ashamed of himself if he feels anything.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I know.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I agree.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But he doesn't.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I'm telling you.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
You don't apologize.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
You're going to.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It's going to be.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Oh my God.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Please help me.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
It's fine.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
No.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
No.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It's shameful.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
A society.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000
It's a good bit.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I was noticing a seam in the cracks but it was like I don't need to.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I don't need to.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I don't have time.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
No.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
No.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
You don't need to.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
No.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You don't need to text the aquarium guy that stuff.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
He's fine.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
You came down a little hard on him.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I think.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I just think.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
You know.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I think you were procrastinating from doing something else.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Yeah.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I was writing like one of nine books or movies.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I could either write something or I could let this guy have it.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I could do 300 words on this poor fucking guy.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Yeah.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Here's an audience no matter how bad a writer I am.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm a genius.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Hey aquarium guy.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Oh my life is in the sear in yellow leaf.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Holy cow.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You're like Shakespeare.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Thank you.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
The fish tank is in the corner.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I know.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I put it there.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
She saw the text and then read it and then.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Just realized that he didn't need to text back.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Yeah.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Probably one of those clarity.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Yeah.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Probably one of those.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
He probably didn't show it to all of his friends and go look at this fucking shit.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
He's probably not talking about that right now at a bar.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yeah.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Well I'd like to think that when he looked at it he was like I don't know what any of

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
this is but I guess I guess I should just always just I guess I should only use this

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
phone number to say I'm coming to service the aquarium.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I think I think maybe I maybe I guess I stepped over a little bit of a tripwire when I started

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000
using it to engage in my fucking off market branding like like what the fuck you fuck

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
you man I already gave you money.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I used your aquarium.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
No you're a hero.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
You're definitely.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:58.000
You're definitely the Batman in this situation here.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You're totally to the John McClain of this guy.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Thank God.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Thank God you're out there.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Thank God you're out there protecting us.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Holy shit.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Oh my god.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Well like yeah it's a delusion.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It's a I'm not in my right mind.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Nope.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Nope.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Like it's what it's what you know what I'm used to is you can't control your you're either

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.520
in control or not in control of your impulses but your thoughts are pure like I'm not even

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:34.080

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.640
time is it and I'll think they're saying you're working too slowly you know and I'll like

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.640

control freak I'm just saying like Rob is like undiagnosed and won't admit it I think

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.320
if he could just realize it's like a guy that's good at drawing should look forward to

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.360
Pictionary no Rob doesn't look forward to Pictionary it says nothing to do with him

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.840
being able to draw it's like he doesn't like here's another thing Rob doesn't like the

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.480
happy birthday song I fucking hate that I hate it because it's compulsory nobody nobody

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:23.040
likes the happy birthday song nobody likes to sing it but nobody like to hear it right

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.040
because you have no choice because the cake comes out if you don't say happy birthday

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.680
you're a dick and if you don't smile until this song's over with your fucking asshole

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.360
nobody likes doing it no he has ever liked doing it and there's always some fucking

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:48.440
dick at the end that has to harmonize and I get the fuck out of here man I didn't live

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:56.360
this long to hear your shit on my day on my day yeah I hate you don't like the happy birthday

01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:01.520
song no matter whose birthday it is no you don't like having to do anything that other

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:09.560
people have to do yeah does anybody I can relate to it but you have to do this no nobody

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.960
goes nobody wants I'd love that yeah you're like I hate the happy birthday song because

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.940
you have no choice you have to do it right but you have to do it there's a million things

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:22.360
you have to do that you some of some of you do some of you don't write you're like focused

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:28.360
on the happy birthday song and Pictionary put the blinker on I know I have I have a pitch

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.520
that I've tried to get this like a groundswell of support for this that this becomes the

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.480
new but happy birthday song so because I don't have a birthday song is not a great song

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.400
it's not a great song it's a stupid song like a second and most of most national anthems

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.480
are stinkers yeah there's this thing yeah like like South America's got some really

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:48.640
cool ones they sound like crazy like circus marches yeah yeah yeah you know how you guys

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:59.240
sound let's make let's make some let's make some improvements to Christmas hey what's

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:05.640
a tree doing in the living room it can't grow here we should put it back outside where

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:11.520
there's dirt what are you left with THX 1138 you guys have no you have no culture you have

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.520
no tradition who cares if the song's good or bad it's a goddamn tradition yeah but I'm

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.480
saying here's my fix on it's a pitch I think this should be a thing you still keep it it's

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:26.400
still the same thing not a fan when that when that when the cake comes you go happy birthday

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:41.920
to you and that's the end of it why do you have to fucking sing I'm scared of you should

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:49.040
be scared well they are but they don't they don't believe in them so you say you're an

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.720
abusive person wow man you're edgy you know I like you when you're this on edge because

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.840
you're you're you're a TNT right now you're you're you're fucking like nitro blisterin

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.800
what's that movie like wages of fear where Eve Montana's to drive a truck full of a high

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:09.240
explosive try to own my own ability I'm owning you right now you know you don't I'm bigger

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.080
than your butterfly nut I'm a butterfly the size of the fucking mothra you know the smartest

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:17.240
person's room is the person that clapped when I said wages of fear even on 10th smartest

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:20.480

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.360

clothes why aren't why aren't my big giant weird balls hanging out making my dick look

01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:07.680
small which is an illusion it's like a bus parked next to the Epcot Center buses are

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:14.720
big if you if you didn't have a podcast and weren't weren't kind of a celebrity you just

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:21.400
said this in the corner you'd be fucking locked away for good here's a tangent you're

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:25.920
one microphone and a couple of cameras away from being a crazy person here's a here's

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:33.440
a tangent surely not no no no you said Epcot Center and I was thinking about this the other

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.320
day and I forgot to I forgot to go look on Wikipedia does anybody know what the EO and

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:58.320
Captain EO stands for I mean anybody new day ND Captain ND EO Eon but they ran out

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:06.960
of end what endocrine omission that's probably that's I think that's what happened to Michael

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:23.600
Jackson right so that was a Hail Mary you okay then now you're not okay I already said I

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.000
wasn't your body language now is you're going into hugging yourself mode you're somebody

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:40.120
has to I you know I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't care about any of you so not

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:48.480
true I mean I wish you all the best but like I don't need you to love me and I because

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.560
I can tend my own garden I can I can I can I can I can meet my own emotional needs what

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:59.680
if we loved you anyway without your consent it would go into a trough outside my moat

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.400
which is guarded by laser turrets for a good reason and you can leave it there as an offering

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:11.800
and maybe one day I'll come out and go oh thank you symbolically but this place is solar

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:20.280
powered it runs a soy saying thank you is like saying happy birthday to me is me saying

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:26.040
yes on a micro level I'm like I'm an even worse person than you because I like when

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:31.280
people like fish for an apology or gratitude like I do like I get thrown I can sing happy

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:35.520
birthday but I like if I'm in a situation where I feel like I like oh this person's

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:41.120
expressing what they've been offended my first thought is not oh by default like you know

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:47.000
whether I mean it or not I'm sorry like my first thought is like fuck you phony your

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.520
feelings weren't hurt you piece of shit you fucking lying piece of shit you're trying

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.440
to hurt me with your fucking fake feeling her this is exactly how I feel about the happy

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:02.480
birthday song word for word it's let's just you know it's it's a big enough world for

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:08.560
both of us I never said I was saying and you're crazy I was saying like Keeper Sutherland's

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:15.760
character in Lost Boys saying to the other guy how's there maggots just be a vampire

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:27.000
with us and fly around okay I'll do it just take that old record off the shelf I don't

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.840
know if that was in the soundtrack I'd watch that I'd watch that movie all right six minutes

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.080
why are there there well what Rob just successfully filibustered his way out of us playing those

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:46.280
games what was this about Captain EO you really just dropped that like a captain was supposed

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.120
to stand for a new day why everybody just take one do we know why I just read it was

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:56.200
named after EOS the goddess of the new dawn so something like that why why do you ask though

01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.640
that's what I want to know Rob Schrab Rob Schrab we've spoken about this before why

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.400
did you ask that question I need to know because I because Dan said Epcot center and I remembered

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:14.520
like about a week ago I was going I wonder what Captain EY what EO stands for and then

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.000
I should look it up on Wikipedia and I was driving don't you shouldn't do that while

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
you're driving oh my time I got home I forgot until now I always would recommend that's my

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.960
thought process yeah it was really disappointing I'm sorry I asked I always get Aaron how come

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:38.120
every time I'm on the show I get you can Aaron match these trade with Doug or Jason yeah

01:48:38.120 --> 01:49:01.760
he'll do anything he wore a bag oh shit all my secrets fell out my phone oh my god for

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:08.240
a what was it what would you estimate it six months of our friendship early on when every

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:14.040
time I took a bite of anything in front of you you made a fart sound for entire meals

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:23.520
and I was just like you get so mad I mean if you if you only knew that you getting mad

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:33.520
maybe wanted to oh yeah I never figured that out that it was obvious yeah yeah yeah well

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:40.240
that's you never you never tried it once never tried it once never tried it once never tried

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:50.480
to enjoy yourself and my company once once I'm gonna be on a respirator cuz I'm ten years

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:59.160
older than you are and and you won't be there so it's all right so it's all right you'll

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:03.240
have sit to do you know you gotta that'd be funny though if he came in and like he hadn't

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.440
talked for a long time and so you guys kind of went through different ways for a the respirator

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:14.440
thing is going up and down every time it went down he went if you do that I'll live an extra

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:22.920
day how about that all right you do that deal I'll one more day one more day I'll go all

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:27.760
right no the last six months because that's that's my estimate it was like it was just

01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:34.080
like yeah so anyways I and then I like take a bite it's like like I've said yes he ended

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.800
this it's like an entire burger like what we're gonna every time with the fart every

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:46.960
time they take a bite it was never not funny it was always funny also Kate hates it too

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:54.440
Kate hates it also I love we started hanging out the three of us we would go to movies

01:50:54.440 --> 01:51:00.760
and every anytime it was kind of a sexual innuendo it was zip so you you had a really

01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.520
great one that made the whole theater laugh one time I forget what it was you remember

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:12.800
what it was no Dan Dan had it for the matrix like what was it like after Neo had was working

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.120

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:24.200
tired he was asleep and then this guy comes out you better get rested up because you're

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:33.120
gonna get it even more tomorrow or something like that and Dan went zip and the guy in

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:47.080
front of us with this guy's really funny I knew he said in the right place I told the

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:51.920
story before that when we went to see when we were in Milwaukee we went to see Mortal

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:57.600
Combat the movie and the guy goes because the evil villain has a wallet dinner and then

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:07.840
he goes and now it's like me and Schrab the 3 p.m. matinee so it's two dudes million kids

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:12.560
just kids all their parents dropped him off to see the Mortal Combat movie and two fucking

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:19.120
loser like like like nowadays it would be against the law like they would be like guys we don't

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:24.000
just to be safe get out of here we got a special and we would be like yeah you probably you're

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.560
probably I mean better safe than sorry you're right I don't even want to get out I don't

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:34.800
even want anything to be awakened and there's a lot of kids here so some of them like look

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:40.160
it's it's it's it's summer they got the overalls they're adorable get to the story get to the

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:47.440
story it's not funny now because the chair chair is still funny but why are they leaking

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:55.800
those audio it's fucking what is that okay so the Mortal Combat guy goes and now a taste

01:52:55.800 --> 01:53:08.000
of things to come Schrab does that and a fucking sea of children they were like I was and I

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.960
in 2001 when they're all like like fast forward through all of them being scared of the monolith

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:19.880
and like that and then the one the monkey kills the other monkey with the bone and it was

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:25.240
just like like because they didn't know you could do that it's like now a taste of things

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:36.920
to come and the whole theater was like what you could make your own movie about farts and

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:42.120
it's got fucking my favorite video game and farting in it and like like it's oh and for

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:51.360
the rest it was our win stock and I'm not and I'm not complaining about this at all

01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:54.560
because it's not like the movie was good but it was like yeah the rest of the movie of

01:53:54.560 --> 01:54:02.320
course as you could imagine every single line of dialogue I was just like do you want to

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:09.920
like like 4,000 children all trying their hand at this new technology ape must not kill

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:16.360
ape but they all got the AK-47 and they're just like shooting it everywhere the best

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:20.360
day of their lives we were the cool we were we were we had unfinished business from when

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:26.640
we were that age we walked out of there pretty cool man I was I walked out in slow motion

01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:33.120
to put our sunglasses on hi-fiving like that Adam Sandler movie like when he tried out

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.120
at home when your folks are watching TV they all went home and made crude sculptures out

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:42.240
of you guys in the backyard and I feel kind of like for some reason because I remember

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:47.840
we went to see land before time to and I feel only reason is because we wanted to repeat

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:57.600
our success and a dinosaur was like how can I reach that tree nothing crickets I've only

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.840
tried that out like trying to crack wise for the whole crowd it was a hard target directed

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:08.280
by John Woo and it's like John Claude Van Damme and Wolfram Brimley and Lance Henrickson

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:14.040
directed by John Woo I just really from the back row really quite went whoo got a pretty

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:27.720
good laugh yeah not as funny as a fart no no not even close we I think Rob I recall

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:30.640
I don't remember what it would be but we went and saw the triplets of Belleville remember

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:35.160
the animated movie I think so yeah and you you laid one no you did a you did a zip and

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:40.360
triplets of Belleville I think you did where would I do it I don't know I don't know triplets

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.520
of Belleville I think yeah but you just kind of have a head of your crowd but you you did

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:51.880
a you did a poopy joke and it still works okay I believe you Dave Kline you like triplets

01:55:51.880 --> 01:56:01.000

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.520
the mirror and I'm like I'm staring at myself and I'm like not blinking until my eyes dry

01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.840
out so that my face like looks the way it really is in my unconscious mind which is more

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:46.680
reptilian than human I like fantasizing about tearing the reptile skin off and finding something

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:56.280
