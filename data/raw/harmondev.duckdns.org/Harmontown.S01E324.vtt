{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.000\nWelcome to Harmontown. How are you tonight? You look so beautiful. I am Brandon Johnson.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:18.000\nI'm sitting in for the lovely Jeff Davis and we want to wish Sherry Hill a happy birthday.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:24.000\nWe want to wish Steve Levy a happy birthday. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, let's\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:34.000\nbring him out. He's renowned, the best around, Dan Harmon, followed by the most amazing Rob.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:35.000\nRob!\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:49.000\nYeah. Happy birthday, Steve Levy. Steve Levy's birthday.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:56.000\nI never really texted him, Steve, just a happy birthday.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nWe took care of it for you.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:02.000\nWe assisted your assistants on his assistant.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:07.000\nI saw it on my calendar and then I, because Steve's the first guy I got a text in the morning\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:11.000\nand I was like, well, get this stuff out of the way first.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:15.000\nHe should have left you a note.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:22.000\nLike a calendar? He's in charge of my calendar. His birthday was on it. He did the best he could\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:29.000\nto humanize himself. He just couldn't get through the fucking membrane.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:36.000\nCouldn't break the titanium ceiling, the whatever material you use when you're just\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:42.000\noppressing everyone human. It's beyond glass.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nGlass is elegant. It's for the ladies. You want to be able to see through it.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:49.000\nHello. I'm oppressing you. I can see through the ceiling.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nWhat, too soon?\n\n01:54.000 --> 02:04.000\nIf you guys think you're sick of me, you should be sick of yourselves for a change.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nWhat would you use for Levy?\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:12.000\nI don't know. Well, obviously, I'm using something that you can't see through.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nI think that's my elegant point. I think that's where the term glass ceiling probably came from,\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:23.000\nis that men are like, they're like, oh, it's transparent.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:28.000\nNot because it's invisible, but because the men are like, yeah, it's there.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nI can see you. I think it's insidious.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:37.000\nAnd then I'm saying, then what about the way that you oppress everybody,\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:42.000\nthat you don't even think about at all? You don't even see them.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nI feel like women came up with the term.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:51.000\nWomen came up with a term?\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:56.000\nBecause from their vantage point, it's a ceiling.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:02.000\nIt's like a...\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:05.000\nBut the show is called Harmon Time.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nAnd February is over, so I'll be quiet.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nHappy March, happy International Women's Month.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\nGot that right?\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:16.000\nYeah, point well taken.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:25.000\nThe term ceiling probably coined by the people beneath it.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nUnless you're like that jazzed about oppression, that you're like,\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nwe need a ceiling over these people.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:35.000\nYou're like looking down and going, you don't call it a floor.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nBut because you're a little concerned, you don't want to oppress them too much,\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nyou want to be able to see them.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nIt's like the opposite of empathy.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nThe opposite of love is indifference, not hate.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nThe opposite of empathy isn't non-empathy.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nIt's like, I know exactly how you feel.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nI'm going to crush you.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nI'm thinking about things from your perspective,\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nso I can know how to hurt you more.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nIs there a word for that? Antipathy?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nFree time?\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:10.000\nSpeaking of antipathy, here's a phrase.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nAntipathy.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nI remember going to my antipathy's house\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nfor rhubarb pie\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nand mac and cheese, eronies.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nAntipathy.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nSpencer's been very depressed lately.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nI asked him if it was okay to share that with people,\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nand he said, yeah, that was several weeks ago.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nI haven't checked in with him about that since.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI'm giving him his space, and he's like, I mean, I see him all the time.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\nBut if somebody doesn't want to, you know, I figure, give him space.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nIs that what you've been doing?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:55.000\nOh, to you.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nNo, you're here.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nYou reminded me.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nYou, interrupting with the antipathy wordplay,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nreminded me that Spencer wasn't here.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nAnd that made me think about the fact that I actually hadn't shared something\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nthat I did ask Spencer at one point.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nWould you mind if I shared that with the audience?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nHe's like, yeah, I don't care, because I did think it was interesting,\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nit was a real shit mood.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd it's hard to say these days if it's connected to anything\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nextrinsically causal.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:35.000\nThe world is so whack-a-doodle from my perspective at this point.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nHow would you know if it was because it was raining\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:42.000\nor because of something you saw on the internet?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:47.000\nBut you ever have one of those funks that's so deep\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nthat you're like, this has got to be biochemical.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nI've never been this depressed about anything real in my life.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nThis has got to just be a real thing,\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nand it almost makes it a little easier to deal with intellectually,\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:03.000\nbecause you're like, oh, this is just blue crayon in my butt.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nDon't Google it, but it's a real expression.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:11.000\nAnd in the midway into that, I was not sharing it with people.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nThat's the thing, because it was like, oh, this too shall pass.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:18.000\nYou complain enough.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:22.000\nWho are you going to tell?\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nEven saying this is going to be uncharismatic,\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nbut I was having this conversation with a colleague\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nwhere I said they were talking about being depressed,\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nand I was like, you are having a lot of good fortune right now,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nand there is an effect that I've noticed\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:45.000\nwhere that lasso of when you're allowed to complain\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nkind of tightens in your own mind,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nyou guys are thinking, well, nothing's stopping you.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:53.000\nThat lasso is not tight, but that's because I think I have this.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nI feel like I have a little license to kvetch,\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nbecause I'm talking to people who would never judge me.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:07.000\nBut anyways, I got way too high.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nI'm sorry, that's my fourth tangent.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nSpencer came to work in this funk,\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nand I got out of my car, I got in the elevator,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nand Spencer happened to be in the elevator at the same time,\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nand he hadn't done the show for, I think,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nhe just had taken one week off at that point.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nAnd I said, good morning.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nHe said, hey, sorry, I didn't do the show.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, everything OK.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nHe's like, nah, I'm really depressed.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nAnd my mood, I was so excited.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nIt was like when you see somebody wearing the same shirt,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nor somebody mentions the same Netflix show\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nthat you were coming into work ready to talk about.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnd it was so instantly measurable how happy it made me\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nto hear someone else say, I've been depressed,\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nand I don't know why.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nAnd I think that that's both, look, I know that that's,\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nI know, it was also funny.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:11.000\nI was like, God, that's so ridiculous and almost cruel\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nthat it makes you feel better.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nYou hear the misery loves company and stuff,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\nand it's like, I never bothered to ask Spencer,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nis it also making you feel better?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nOr is it just, I was afraid to ask.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nYou ever take like a swim class when the teacher says,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\ndon't go near a person that's drowning.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nThey won't know what they're doing.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nAnd they might grab your head and hold it under them\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nwith their kind of reptile part of their brain\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nif they're scared they're drowning.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nSo you have to have these techniques.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nThat's what I was doing.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nI was like, Spencer saying he had been depressed.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nI just grabbed it and pushed myself up with it.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nI was like, that makes me feel so much better.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:02.000\nBut there's a, you know, there is this thing.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nYou've witnessed somebody be brave.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nYou're able to be brave.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nAnd there's this great honesty.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nYou get, you get a little kick from that.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nWe all do.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nIt's why we sort of stress, reach out to people.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nSo there is this moment like when you peel,\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nI know this is nerdy, but you know,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nwhen you open a bandaid in the dark\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nand you see that little spark when you peel the paper.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nI love that.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nThat's not nerdy.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nThat's magic.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nRight. So this is the same thing.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nIt is magic, right?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nIt's the same thing in Carl's Bad Caverns\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nwhere there's no light.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd then you open a bandaid and you like,\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nit's one little thing and it doesn't,\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nit doesn't mean you're going to live longer.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nIt doesn't mean anything, but it's like,\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nit's, yeah, it's so important.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt doesn't mean the wound went away.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nThat's like, you know, the opposite of\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nyou got to pull that bandaid off.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nIt's usually...\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nYou got to open that bandaid package.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nYou got to open that bandaid package.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nAnd a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:08.000\nOkay, so antipathy reminded me of a, like, something.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nA better time.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nAnd then you did that.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nThat reminded me of Spencer.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nSpencer reminded me.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nSo I would say, I mean, I want to say also,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nI don't think I have the word power right now.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nI'm on a deadline.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nI'm kind of like clumsy and fumbling,\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nbut I did imagine sharing it with you that Spencer's\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nbeen bumped out.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nAnd I know that Spencer's not going to enjoy\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nanybody saying to him, like, you know,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nit's tough with him.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nLike, he's such a smart guy.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:44.000\nLike, you know, it's, I feel like it's important\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:49.000\nto share that he's been in a funk.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nI don't, even though, I bet, I'm sure he would,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nif he had a butt and he'd go, well, no,\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nthen don't, don't mention it because he's,\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nhe doesn't, he's not, I don't think he's going\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nto get joy out of, like, a flood of digital get wells,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nyou know?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nI, I, I.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nI do.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nEven if we don't, well, let's see what happens.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nWell, sometimes, oh, that's right.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nThat's how I felt about wishing him a happy birthday was,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nI kind of, I was like, you know, well, he probably\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nhates having happy birthdays said to him,\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nbut this isn't for him.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nWhen did he tell you he was a miserable motherfucker\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nwho hated good shit?\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nNo, he didn't tell me.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nHe's a pretty love and light kind of guy,\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nas far as I've seen, and, and get sort of that,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nyou get what you give and, and that.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nYeah, I don't need to make him sound like a curmudgeon.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nYeah.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nHe's, he's, he's not.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nI think he would love a little love.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nNo, he's just very, he doesn't like.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nHe's shy.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nYeah.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nHe's, he's like, I don't want to say social anxieties\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:50.000\nbecause the term, I mean, is it an anxiety\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nif you don't want to be in a crowd of fucking\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nwarbling strangers?\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nIt's like, it's like when people used to say\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nI had a Christ complex.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nHow do you know I'm not actually Christ?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nIt's true.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nThose shoes.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nYeah.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nDid you ever, this is a kind of a tangential thing,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nbut did you ever go to like Milwaukee days?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nDo you guys have any of those festivals?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nSummer Fest.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nSummer Fest, were you that kind of person\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nwho could do those?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nWe were back in the comedy tent.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nI mean, we would traverse like the crowds,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nbut we wouldn't stay there very long.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nWe would spend the rest of the day or the night\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nin the comedy tent.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nI don't think I would have gone to Summer Fest\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nvery often if, if we didn't have that like,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nthat little feeling of like you're going there\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nto work and there's a kid.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nYeah.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nThere's like this hidden area full of all the people\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nthat you see every day, plus the occasional Bobcat Goldthwait.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nThird Tom Kenny are going to show up\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nand you can hang out with them.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nYeah.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nSo Comic Con is the same.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nWhen you guys are Comic Con,\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nyou don't really walk the floor.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nI can't do the exhibit floor anymore,\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nexcept maybe like Sunday before they like,\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nafter they close.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nIt's like, it's really, that's pretty crazy.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nI think everyone would agree,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nbut I think some people are maybe just more able\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nto handle something that they know is egregious,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nwhich is like absolute zero control over your personal space\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nand when you walk and don't walk.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nLike that gets, that's pretty, that seems,\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nthat seems criminal, the exhibit floor at Comic Con.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnyways, all right.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nSo, yeah.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.000\nOkay.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nSo this has been a long time coming.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nI think I've, I think I've been thinking about this\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nfor 30 years and I, it's like one of those things,\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nit's just a little thing in my, a little be in my bonnet\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nthat I think it's come up recently\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nbecause of the amount of true crime I'm listening to.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nSo this phrase gets used a lot.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nI hate this phrase.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nThere's no guest tonight, so fuck you.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nWelcome to the show.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nOh God.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nOh God.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:06.000\nI guess I won't be talking when I shouldn't talk anymore.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:12.000\nI guess it's always my turn to say something about myself.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nYou gonna fuck that up.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:23.000\nUm, I, I accidentally read the fucking reddit before I came.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.000\nIt's because I started going back there for porn\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nand like, I like the gone wild audio.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nYou ever do the gone wild audio?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:37.000\nIt's, it's, it's like a, you can't get that anywhere else.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nIt's like a, it's like an open source community of people\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nthat are just doing like audio porn.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.000\nSo like role playing stuff like, like, oh hello,\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nyou're here for your three o'clock appointment.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nJust sit over here.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhat do you mean you're French?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nI don't, I made, I make, I'm making one up\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nbecause I've been conditioned now to not share.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nAre you telling me?\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nLike what I'm going there for.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nIs there, is there a Michael Winslow?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nYeah.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nThe Michael Winslow of, of gone wild audio.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nIt is, it is fascinating which people decide to use props.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nUm, it's, it's very funny.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:18.000\nLike, like sometimes like, like, like, like, like women who,\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:22.000\nwho like, where did you get the impression it would sound like\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nthat to fillate someone?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:27.000\nLike, like, like, like, like, are you, are you,\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nare you really good at it?\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nIs that why it sounds like that?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nLike everyone else pretending to fillate?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nLike, like, like, like, why does it sound like, like,\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nand then the other people like, whether or not they're going\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nto do space work and like, here, let me,\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nwhy don't you sit in this chair and then some people just\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\naren't content to let that be silent.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nThere's, there's like a chair sound.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nUm, which is actually more distracting to me\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nbecause I'm picturing them like, like,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nputting their foot on a chair or something.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nIt's like they're a one man band or a,\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:01.000\nit's like a full act from SCTV or something.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:04.000\nLike, they got cowbells next to them.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:08.000\nIt's like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:11.000\nWhat do you do with that finger?\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:16.000\nI can't seem to maintain my erection.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:21.000\nI've got to shake this lightning paper.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nThere was, there was, there was one lightning paper.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\nThat kind of was like, um, it involved, uh, two women.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nThere's like, there's, there's codes that,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nthat they use to put brackets.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:40.000\nAnd so it'll be like F4M, it means female voice recorded\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nfor a male listener, assuming heterosexuality,\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nI suppose, the, the, uh, and then it's M4F,\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nwhich I should listen to a couple of times.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nI'm sort of like, like, like, I've never actually heard\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nlike a M4F, like, like, like, that seems like\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nthat would be a whole world of like, I should do one.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI, I, like, like, um.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nRight now?\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nWow.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nShoes for sale.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nHello?\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nUh, what?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nOh.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nAll right.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nNo, let me, I'm wearing like five tangents deep.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nI just want to, I want to get to this thing.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nBut I, I went, I went to the, uh, I went to the subreddit\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nand it was like, oh, like somebody was like,\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nwell, I listened to all 800 episodes and, uh,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nuh, I'm all caught up.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nAnd then everyone was like, I can read that thread.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nThat's not going to hurt me.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nThat's going to be like a fucking warm embrace\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nthat's not even sugar coated.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nIt's just going to be like a general,\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nwhat do you, you know, 800 episodes.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nAnd then it was just like everybody's chance\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nto just go like, when you get to this one,\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nthat's when it really bad.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nAnd all this gentleman was like, I don't, I don't,\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nI just, can you still say suck my dick?\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nLike, are you, is it like, is that like a suck my dick?\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nYou know, just to say suck my dick to people,\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nlike as a way of saying like a fuck yourself\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nor is that, is that, is that,\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nis that problematic because,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nbut anyone can suck a dick, right?\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nNo, it takes a real genius.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nFor the clip show.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nThat one's for the 600th anniversary special.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nNo, you got better.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nYou got better than suck my dick.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nYeah, no, I mean, I imagine it's just like,\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\neven if it's not technically,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nI'm not one of these guys that's like,\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nis this, is this technically like,\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nI'm still allowed to, I just,\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nI was just kind of thinking about it\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nbecause I'm like, I know that more than ever.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nLike I used to have a real addiction\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nto like saying the F word,\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nlike as the gay derogatory F word,\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nlike just real conversationally,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nlike probably all over this podcast, I bet,\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nbecause I was like, it was a hard habit to break.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nLike, like, like,\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nIsn't that crazy?\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nYeah, I mean, it's a lot of,\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nshit changes fast.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nYeah.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd just gay and retarded all over the place and,\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:02.000\nand the, the, so therefore I,\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nI'm, I'm, I'm, I guess what I'm,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nthe thing, okay, well,\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nI guess my point is that the thing that,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nout of all the habits that have,\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nfeel like I've successfully killed verbally,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nthe, the thing that remains rattling\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nagainst the inside of my skull constantly\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nis I'm constantly wanting to just tell people\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nto suck my dick.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nLike I haven't lost that.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nEven though I have, I don't know,\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nI don't say it anymore.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nIt hasn't gone away.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nLike the craving,\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nI just like feel like it's the thing\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nthat I really want to say to everyone all the time.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nThis is like my dick.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nYeah.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nLike, like, come on.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nYou got better.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nBut it, yeah, of course we've all got better.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nWe could all, we could all do better.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nSome of us don't.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nBut, but really, you know,\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nthere's a couple,\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nbecause of the great thing about suck my dick,\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nsort of being retired,\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nthere's all these new ways of saying\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nawful shit to people.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nOh yeah.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nWell, did you, did you see John Mulaney's\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nset?\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nThe SNL set?\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nDidn't.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nI mean, it's like,\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:00.000\nI, I, I, I, it was really striking to me\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nbecause it was like,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nyou know, it was like debates\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nabout like political correctness,\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nis it killing comedy, blah, blah, blah.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nAnd it's like, it's a non-question.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nIt's just like, like,\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nthe, the, the answer is sort of like,\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\ndo you, if you watch John Mulaney's set\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\non Saturday Night Live,\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nfeel the craft,\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nfeel the,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nthe unmistakable kind of objective humor\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nif there is such a thing.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nLike, he kills it.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nIt's what you might call like just a,\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\njust a, just a perfect set,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\na solid set.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nLike,\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nand then,\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nand then you,\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nlike,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\noh, do you think that he did this?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nDo you think he wrote and performed this\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nby first having a debate about\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nwhether he's allowed to say things?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nThe answer is, no,\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nI mean, if you haven't seen it,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nI'll answer for you.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, it's clearly coming\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nfrom a place of joy.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:51.000\nIt just doesn't go into air.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.000\nIt's, it's, it's, he, he's not,\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nhe's not either mad that, that\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nthe times have changed,\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nnor is he like,\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:03.000\nwantonly stoked about\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:07.000\nthe new way to think things and stuff.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nHe's just nailing it, doing it.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nAnd I think it just has to do with like\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nsincerity and kind of like being in the moment,\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nwhich I can no longer do.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nBut here's my,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nhere's the thing that I would like to\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nchange about language.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nBecause I feel like it has antipathy,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\ninherent antipathy to it, this phrase.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nI don't like it.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nI'd like to eliminate it.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:34.000\nThey were in the wrong place\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nat the wrong time.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.000\nSuck my dick.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nLike, like, like,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nfirst of all, forget about the fact,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:44.000\nI'm not, I'm not,\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nforget about the fact that if you're\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nin the wrong place at the wrong time,\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nyou probably nailed it, right?\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nYou probably avoided something terrible.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nI would just think verbally,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nbut forget about that.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nLike, like, because if you,\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nyou're already in the wrong place,\n\n21:57.000 -->

time to be there is\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nso something's wrong is going to happen.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nRight.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nForget about that.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nI just don't like the general,\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nlike, it was just like,\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nlike, like, I don't like the general,\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nlike, way that it's

I heard about love after lock up\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nI just immediately first of all pictured\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nthe kind of\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nthe women that\n\n36:58.000

deserve to be lumped in this way\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nand I don't want to\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\njudge anybody ever for\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nthe rest of my life but I'm like

live in LA so\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nthat many people do have to\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nprovide us with the foundation of a society\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nwhich is for

that\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nis by complaining about the shit that we build\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nbecause we missed Wisconsin\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nwe missed Kansas

Joe?\n\n01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.160\nWhat's Frozone?\n\n01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160\nWho's Frozone?\n\n01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160\nIncredibles.\n\n01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160\nFrom the Incredibles.\n\n01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160\nIncredibles.\n\n01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160\nHe said it's Frozone?\n\n01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.160\nWe had a toy tie-in, so they asked me to stop by.\n\n01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.160\nThis is my super suit.\n\n01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160\nHis name's Frozone?\n\n01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.160\nFrozone.\n\n01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160\nFrozone.\n\n01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.160\nI should watch that movie.\n\n01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.160\nActually, I saw the first Incredibles.\n\n01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.160\nDid everybody suffer this effect when the Incredibles 2 came out?\n\n01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.160\nDidn't you think it was Incredibles 3?\n\n01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.160\nBecause the Incredibles was so long ago, but also to their credit, it was so...\n\n01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.160\nIt hit the spot.\n\n01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.160\nIt felt like you had...\n\n01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:06.160\nYou're like, I must have been two Incredibles movies because it's been long enough to be a third one.\n\n01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160\nThey referenced it.\n\n01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.160\nIf I was a person working... Oh, they did?\n\n01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.160\nThey referenced the amount of time it took.\n\n01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.160\nIf you worked on the Incredibles, I didn't see the second one, but...\n\n01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160\nLoved it.\n\n01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:28.160\nBut I wanted to let you know that my reaction to your advertising was good job on the first movie.\n\n01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:35.160\nSo get that gun out of your mouth, you little 3D modeler.\n\n01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.160\nYou're in a cubicle on a sun ray.\n\n01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:46.160\nThat thing's going to slowly move up like the handicapped lady in the Gremlins chair.\n\n01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.160\nTake you all the way upstairs to a Gremlin-free retirement.\n\n01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.160\nSo let's show that clip.\n\n01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.160\nWe don't have it?\n\n01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160\nWe don't have it.\n\n01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:06.160\nGeorge R.R. Martin as the Flash.\n\n01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.160\nI have formed a perimeter around the bank.\n\n01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.160\nOkay, so there's a Flash TV series, right?\n\n01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160\nYes.\n\n01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.160\nRight.\n\n01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160\nOkay.\n\n01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160\nAre there...\n\n01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.160\nIt's already

fast?\n\n01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160\nOh.\n\n01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.160\nBecause if there are, why am I tuning in?\n\n01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160\nYou know?\n\n01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.160\nI mean, seriously, okay, like, okay, well, at the end of the episode, shit, how are we\n\n01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160\ngoing to get that?\n\n01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160\nWe're going to run fast.\n\n01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160\nLike, na na na na na.\n\n01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160\nI mean, like, really?\n\n01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.160\nI mean, like, is there any episodes like, you know, I'm not going to run fast this week.\n\n01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.160\nI'm just going to use my detective mind to figure out who stole the jewels and all the\n\n01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:09.160\ncops are like, yeah, maybe just maybe run fast.\n\n01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.160\nLike, we'll tell you, we'll tell you the clues and you can, like, cover more ground.\n\n01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.160\nYeah, you're not, you're not really here because, because you're a really good detective.\n\n01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160\nYou're here because you run fast.\n\n01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.160\nBut why don't you, why don't you run fast and leave the drive into us?\n\n01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.160\nOkay, you know, why don't you run fast?\n\n01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.160\nI mean, what do they do the third episode?\n\n01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.160\nDo we have, do we have any hardcore flash fans?\n\n01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.160\nLike, like, like, like it's like your jam.\n\n01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.160\nOh, good.\n\n01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160\nIt's that section.\n\n01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160\nIs it the, are you?\n\n01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160\nNo one.\n\n01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.160\nYeah, I love that this audience was like, no, you're not, man.\n\n01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:48.160\nKnowing that this is a temple in which honesty is rewarded above all, are you Tiger Man?\n\n01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160\nOkay.\n\n01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.160\nDo you want to come up and talk about the flash?\n\n01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160\nOkay.\n\n01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.160\nWe won't pick on you.\n\n01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.160\nBecause also you could have been Tiger Man.\n\n01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160\nThat was my point.\n\n01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.160\nLike, like we don't, we don't judge anybody here.\n\n01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.160\nSo you know, you know a lot about, you want to come up and share your love of the flash.\n\n01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160\nWell, you could also stay right there.\n\n01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.160\nOh, that'd be great too.\n\n01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.160\nIt was just a fucking passing impulse.\n\n01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.160\nI mean, it's not the price, right?\n\n01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:25.160\nIf you're waiting for him to ask a fourth time, if you come up on stage, it might not happen.\n\n01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160\nOkay.\n\n01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:31.160\nOh, there you go.\n\n01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.160\nFor a fan of the flash, you are walking pretty slow.\n\n01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:43.160\nWell, that might be, that's, Superman was created by the two, like, like, like Jewish kids that\n\n01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160\nare like, what'd you say to Brandon?\n\n01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.160\nWhat'd you say to Brandon?\n\n01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160\nBrandon left.\n\n01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160\nBrandon just left.\n\n01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.160\nWhat'd you say to Brandon?\n\n01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.160\nJacob.\n\n01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.160\nJacob?\n\n01:19:57.160 -->

doxed you.\n\n01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.160\nI guess the kid's calling that.\n\n01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.160\nWe can edit your full name out if you want.\n\n01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160\nThat's easy.\n\n01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160\nI don't mind, it's fine.\n\n01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.160\nAll right.\n\n01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.160\nPeople will find you on Facebook and you'll, your life will be ruined.\n\n01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160\nOkay.\n\n01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.160\nYou having a donut with an Oreo on it?\n\n01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160\nSomebody gave those to us as a gift.\n\n01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.160\nThank you, whoever gave us the donuts.\n\n01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.160\nThank you.\n\n01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:39.160\nJacob, give us some background.\n\n01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.160\nIf you look a little young, can you tell us how old you are?\n\n01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.160\nOtherwise, I won't ask.\n\n01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.160\nI'm 36.\n\n01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.160\nOkay.\n\n01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.160\nWell, you're taking good care of yourself.\n\n01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.160\nI gave up a little while ago.\n\n01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.160\nI never ask people I think are over 30 how old they are.\n\n01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.160\nSo I thought you were like 12.\n\n01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160\nFantastic.\n\n01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160\nYou have as many donuts as you want.\n\n01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.160\nI would keep going, yeah.\n\n01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.160\nSo you live in LA?\n\n01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.160\nYeah, I live in Venice Beach.\n\n01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160\nOkay.\n\n01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.160\nWhat's the, do you drink alcohol?\n\n01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160\nAll the time.\n\n01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160\nGreat.\n\n01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.160\nDo you want some?\n\n01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.160\nI just wanted to make sure that you did because there's alcohol.\n\n01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.160\nOkay.\n\n01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.160\nWhen does your relationship with the flash start?\n\n01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:30.160\nI read comic books my whole life, but I watched even the old 90s series of the flash, but\n\n01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.160\nI've watched a new one too.\n\n01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.160\nWas there a TV series in the 90s that was the flash?\n\n01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160\nYeah.\n\n01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.160\nI vaguely remember it as a kid.\n\n01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160\nMark Hamill was on it.\n\n01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.160\nWas it like CWB?\n\n01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.160\nWhat was it?\n\n01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.160\nIt was right after like the first Tim Burton Batman.\n\n01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160\nWait, what?\n\n01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160\nIt was right after the first like Tim Burton Batman.\n\n01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160\nIt was like 1990.\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160\nYeah.\n\n01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.160\nI think I vaguely remember that.\n\n01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160\nYeah.\n\n01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.160\nIt was David Duchovny, right?\n\n01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160\nIs the flash?\n\n01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160\nI don't think it was David Duchovny.\n\n01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160\nIt just didn't work.\n\n01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:04.160\nHe just has this like natural kind of, I don't want to say he's sluggish, but people don't\n\n01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.160\nadmire him for his speed.\n\n01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160\nYeah, it's not quite him.\n\n01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.160\nYou slow down on that donut, man.\n\n01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160\nYou got a lot of work to do.\n\n01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160\nYou got a lot of work to do, bro.\n\n01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160\nYou can put it down, man.\n\n01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.160\nDon't let him flash shame you, man.\n\n01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.160\nMaybe you eat your donuts fast.\n\n01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.160\nBut yeah, just take us into your...\n\n01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160\nSo here's my thing with the flash.\n\n01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:30.160\nYou were mentioning him and you were asking about his cop work.\n\n01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.160\nHe's a CSI agent.\n\n01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160\nHe's a CSI agent.\n\n01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.160\nYeah, so he does like the background work and he's more than just fast.\n\n01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160\nSo he doesn't need the superpower.\n\n01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160\nIt's just a bonus.\n\n01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160\nNo, no.\n\n01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.160\nI would imagine...\n\n01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:49.160\nI would imagine it's pretty valuable as a CSI agent to get...\n\n01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.160\nYeah, it's just a bonus.\n\n01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160\nBest superhero ever.\n\n01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.160\nOh my God.\n\n01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160\nHe's a really good detective.\n\n01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.160\nHe contributed to society before he had the flash powers and then he was flashed.\n\n01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.160\nIt was great.\n\n01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:09.160\nIs the CSI agent gig, is that like the equivalent of Clark Kent's Daily Planet gig?\n\n01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.160\nThat's his alter ego?\n\n01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.160\nYeah, basically.\n\n01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.160\nIs that Barry Allen?\n\n01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.160\nIs that his name?\n\n01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160\nBarry Allen, yeah.\n\n01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.160\nAnd so when he's fighting crime, he's not.\n\n01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160\nHe's like, okay, does he...\n\n01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.160\nThis is the thing about the flash that I don't understand because it's sort of like if there\n\n01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:34.160\nwas a character named the breather and he was like, I breathe, I get more oxygen per...\n\n01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.160\nThere's a so what question of it.\n\n01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.160\nIt's kind of like he's moving...\n\n01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.160\nHe's going to move faster than regular narrative.\n\n01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:45.160\nSo if he's fighting the kingpin, the kingpin is going to be like, I'm going to rob that\n\n01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.160\nbank and then the flash is like, I heard you're going to rob...\n\n01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.160\nAnyways, what does he do?\n\n01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.160\nWhat does the flash do?\n\n01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.160\nDoes he punch people?\n\n01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.160\nYeah, mostly at the end of episodes, he'll punch people sometimes.\n\n01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.160\nFaster than they can block it, which is just punching down.\n\n01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.160\nEat that mic a little bit.\n\n01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.160\nHow... me?\n\n01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.160\nNo, you always...\n\n01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:15.160\nHow does being fast make him a better detective other than catching somebody that's running\n\n01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.160\naway?\n\n01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.160\nOther than that, I mean, like, does he find clues faster?\n\n01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.160\nDoes he clean up his desk quicker?\n\n01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.160\nIt's mostly all camera, but I think he's running the test faster, maybe.\n\n01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160\nTests.\n\n01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160\nWhat tests?\n\n01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160\nHe has to take tests?\n\n01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160\nBlood tests.\n\n01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160\nBlood tests with a mixing motion.\n\n01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.160\nHe does that faster than a human being.\n\n01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160\nYeah, you gotta...\n\n01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160\nHe's titrating really fast and...\n\n01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160\nAll right.\n\n01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160\nBut that's all.\n\n01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160\nThat's like Clark Kent maybe types faster when no one's looking.\n\n01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.160\nBut that's him when he goes to work.\n\n01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160\nRight.\n\n01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.160\nThe flash doesn't fight crime by swabbing anything, I assume.\n\n01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.160\nOtherwise, he wouldn't wear that outfit.\n\n01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.160\nHe would just wear a lab coat and be fast.\n\n01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.160\nHe gets in that outfit when something requires it.\n\n01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160\nRight.\n\n01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:07.160\nAnd so he's out there and he's gonna run fast, and by running fast, he's saving the day from\n\n01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160\nvillains.\n\n01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.160\nRight.\n\n01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160\nBy catching them.\n\n01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.160\nCatching them, hitting them with lightning.\n\n01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.160\nHe has lightning powers?\n\n01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.160\nIf he runs in a circle fast enough, he can shoot lightning at people.\n\n01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.160\nAnd he does that all the time.\n\n01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160\nEvery third episode, at least.\n\n01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.160\nWhy not every episode?\n\n01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.160\nI mean, you should be using that to open the door.\n\n01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.160\nYou would think, but no, he kind of saves it.\n\n01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160\nThat's his budgetary reason.\n\n01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160\nThat's his blazing sword.\n\n01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160\nDoes he punch and kick a lot?\n\n01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:46.160\nBecause it seems like you could say, I mean, Jackie Chan's efficacy is a lot of training,\n\n01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.160\nbut also like, oh my god, he's so fast.\n\n01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160\nRight.\n\n01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160\nSo here we have the fastest guy in the world.\n\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.160\nSo like, even if he's not Jackie Chan, which would actually be kind of funny if he wasn't.\n\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:01.160\nThat would be amazing if he was just like, kind of like, and but he's just so fast.\n\n01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160\nHe gets like nine attacks in before.\n\n01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160\nThat's actually more like what he does.\n\n01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.160\nHe's not very effective, but he throws them out a lot.\n\n01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.160\nOkay.\n\n01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160\nOkay.\n\n01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.160\nLet me ask you this.\n\n01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.160\nOkay.\n\n01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.160\nSo he can run fast.\n\n01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.160\nHe could move his legs really fast.\n\n01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160\nAnd he can move his arms fast.\n\n01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.160\nHe can move his fingers fast.\n\n01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.160\nAnd he could probably blink fast, right?\n\n01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160\nHe could read fast.\n\n01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160\nHe could read fast.\n\n01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.160\nOkay.\n\n01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160\nSo he can mentally.\n\n01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160\nSo his brain is faster.\n\n01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160\nRight.\n\n01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160\nBrain is faster.\n\n01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160\nSo is his heart beating faster?\n\n01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160\nIs his blood going faster?\n\n01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160\nI mean, here's where I'm getting at.\n\n01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160\nDoes he digest food faster?\n\n01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.160\nThere's some people who write him like that where he needs to eat more food, but.\n\n01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.160\nSo he's like, I just, I have to shit.\n\n01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.160\nI just, I just ate a Cheerio and now I got poop.\n\n01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160\nThat would make sense.\n\n01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160\nYeah.\n\n01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.160\nHe must be shitting a lot.\n\n01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.160\nWhich is, was there an issue about that?\n\n01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160\nI haven't read that one yet.\n\n01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.160\nIt's interesting that you say some people write him that way.\n\n01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.160\nRight.\n\n01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.160\nAre there other things like that?\n\n01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.160\nAre there things that don't exist in certain writers flash version?\n\n01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.160\nAll comic books.\n\n01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160\nSorry.\n\n01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.160\nThis is the podcast for Dan Harmon interrupting people and go ahead, Jacob.\n\n01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:16.160\nApparently I'm the expert on the flash, but yeah, I think different writers take different liberties with him.\n\n01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.160\nI remember, yeah, kid flash jumped out there and he got shot in the knee one episode.\n\n01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.160\nAnd then the next issue, he was in the library for the whole time and learned a bunch of stuff.\n\n01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160\nHe wasn't.\n\n01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160\nHe, he didn't.\n\n01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.160\nSo he can't heal fast.\n\n01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160\nThat too.\n\n01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.160\nThat was just one issue that he was out with the knee.\n\n01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:38.160\nI think it's really important to know whether or not he thinks faster because I want to know if Martian mindhunter,\n\n01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:44.160\nmanhunter, he hunts more minds than men usually.\n\n01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.160\nSo to be fair, but whose name makes sense in the DC universe?\n\n01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:54.160\nBut if Martian manhunter was reading Flash's mind, maybe that would be a fun thing where he's like,\n\n01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.160\nwell, I can't fucking understand a goddamn thing he's thinking because it's like,\n\n01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.160\nit's like listening to a squirrel.\n\n01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.160\nI think you might have just broke something there.\n\n01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.160\nThat's something that hasn't been done.\n\n01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.160\nI think it's like flat.\n\n01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:15.160\nIt'd be fun to think about the dialogue that way because they always treat the Flash like he's either a cut up or he's an idiot.\n\n01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:22.160\nLike he's sort of like the, like the, they treat him like in the current like DC film universe.\n\n01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.160\nLike he's kind of like the combination of like the Troy community.\n\n01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.160\nI'm referencing classics.\n\n01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.160\nSo then we have a benchmark.\n\n01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160\nI'm a big fan.\n\n01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.160\nLike he's like, he's the every man kind of thing.\n\n01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.160\nOr he's just like, well, here's how dope that was kind of thing.\n\n01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.160\nHe's like, he's the youngster down, honestly.\n\n01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.160\nWhere he's like, I just want to be part of the team.\n\n01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160\nRight.\n\n01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.160\nI'm a really good detective.\n\n01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.160\nI'm a really good detective.\n\n01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.160\nI mean, we got Batman here.\n\n01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.160\nSo I don't know who's the world's greatest detective.\n\n01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.160\nSo, but he don't run fast.\n\n01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.160\nSo it evens out.\n\n01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.160\nBut I think the most interesting thing in the world because, oh, I mean, I did.\n\n01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160\nYeah.\n\n01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.160\nCause it was like every, like every line of dialogue for the flash.\n\n01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.160\nIf you were just to like run through the exercise of like, all right, I've got,\n\n01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:08.160\nI'm going to take three hours to edit this and write it and all this stuff.\n\n01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.160\nAnd that he, like, you know, knowing that he has the power to do that,\n\n01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.160\nhow does shit come out?\n\n01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.160\nAnd like the end result of that when you look through the comic book and you're like,\n\n01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.160\nit might, it would probably manifest itself as he would be very stoic.\n\n01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.160\nAnd which would make him, it would be like, oh, I get it.\n\n01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:31.160\nHe talks very infrequently and he only says like a couple of things.\n\n01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:36.160\nAnd, and so they're doing this contrast thing.\n\n01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:42.160\nBut then every once in a while he'd have like this full dialogue balloon because it took him exactly three hours to like,\n\n01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.160\nhe's like, I'm just fucking sending this.\n\n01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.160\nLike, like, you know, you like edited it as much as he could, but it was like,\n\n01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.160\nhe got triggered so much that he had that.\n\n01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:54.160\nAnd it's like, you, without warning this guy who usually talks like Groot, like,\n\n01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160\nlike all of a sudden it's like, well, the thing is you've been,\n\n01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.160\nit's twice about that. There's 70% income.\n\n01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.160\nYou should be more considerate of people.\n\n01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.160\nAnd you're just like, what the fuck?\n\n01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.160\nDoes he listen?\n\n01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.160\nDoes he?\n\n01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.160\nDoes he listen faster?\n\n01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.160\nLike if he heard himself, does he mature?\n\n01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.160\nDoes he, does he, does he get woke faster?\n\n01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:25.160\nWas he like, did he realize he had been fucking women up like,\n\n01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:28.160\nlike, like in 2016?\n\n01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.160\nHe got out ahead of it.\n\n01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.160\nIs he constantly shaving?\n\n01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.160\nI mean, like, is, I mean, like,\n\n01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.160\nHe's growing faster, huh?\n\n01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.160\nWell, if he does everything faster.\n\n01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:43.160\nDoes his favorite color look like a Nintendo power-up?\n\n01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.160\nOh, no.\n\n01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:53.160\nYeah, I didn't, I mean, I rift Nintendo power-up.\n\n01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160\nThat's what you're sensing.\n\n01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.160\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.160\nWhat does that mean, Dan?\n\n01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.160\nFake it till you make it?\n\n01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.160\nI was trying to imagine like a, like a 16-bit thing where like the color is cycling,\n\n01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.160\nbut, you know, cause his favorite, his favorite color keeps changing.\n\n01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.160\nIt's between like red and yellow, gold.\n\n01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160\nYou don't know those are his favorite colors.\n\n01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.160\nWhat if he, what if he's like Batman and he's like,\n\n01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.160\nthis will strike fear in my enemies, red and gold.\n\n01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:23.160\nIt'll strike fear in slow things.\n\n01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:27.160\nIt'll go away from me and I'll go the opposite way.\n\n01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.160\nI am most interested in his metabolism.\n\n01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.160\nDidn't they talk about that a little bit when Ben Affleck went to his...\n\n01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.160\nYeah, they did a little bit in the New Justice League,\n\n01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.160\nbut yeah, they talked a little bit about,\n\n01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.160\nbut they've changed him now into a person that's actually creating,\n\n01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.160\nhe's, oh, he's not actually fast because that raises too many questions.\n\n01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.160\nProbably it's easier to say that he travels through a fucking, excuse me,\n\n01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.160\na conduit of lightning.\n\n01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.160\nYeah, my favorite rendition of him is he accesses the speed force\n\n01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:02.160\nwith another dimension and gives him all sorts of access to slowing down reality\n\n01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160\nfor the way he proceeds.\n\n01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.160\nI kind of like that idea that he's,\n\n01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:15.160\nof him as a walking inception pop-up during a battle,\n\n01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.160\nthat he's going to do what he's going to do.\n\n01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.160\nAnd the key to using the flash right is to give him explicit instructions\n\n01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.160\nbecause you're not going to have another chance.\n\n01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.160\nAnd it's better to use him like,\n\n01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:34.160\nif you don't have a really good plan for him, you should just tell him like,\n\n01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.160\nwhen in doubt, stop everyone from being hurt or something like that\n\n01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.160\nand that you're checking back in with him in a way that's like,\n\n01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.160\nhow it would look from the perspective of like plant life or something.\n\n01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:52.160\nHe's behind the scenes making all sorts of moves and we're all just,\n\n01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.160\noh, you're here, you're doing your thing.\n\n01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.160\nJacob, why do you know so much about the flash?\n\n01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.160\nI've been reading comic books since I don't know, I was 10 years old.\n\n01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.160\nYeah, eat that mic, Jacob.\n\n01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.160\nHe's been reading, I've been reading comic books since I was like 10 years old.\n\n01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.160\nAnd brothers and sisters?\n\n01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.160\nYeah, I have an older sister. She lives here in Los Angeles.\n\n01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:17.160\nOn an emotional level, on a personal level, is there a connection to the flash\n\n01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:21.160\nthat's like, you're like, okay, so just an example,\n\n01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:26.160\nlike the day it was like Tony Stark was like,\n\n01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.160\nhere's my kryptonite, I love booze.\n\n01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:36.160\nI was like, sold, like, how can you get better than this person?\n\n01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.160\nIt was there like a flash thing.\n\n01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.160\nA moment for me with flash?\n\n01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.160\nWell, for me, the flash moment for me was when Kid Flash got shot in the knee\n\n01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.160\nand he said, who am I?\n\n01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.160\nI think I'll go to the library.\n\n01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.160\nYeah, he went to the library and he said, I'm going to read some things.\n\n01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.160\nI'm going to be better, a better person.\n\n01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.160\nAnd then I thought, you know, it was more than just the powers.\n\n01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.160\nHe got shot in the knee.\n\n01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.160\nHe was a baby flash and he was already fast.\n\n01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.160\nYeah, so actually this wasn't even Barry Allen.\n\n01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.160\nThis was his grandson or whatever.\n\n01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.160\nAnd he gets shot in the knee by Deathstroke in an issue.\n\n01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.160\nOh, because Deathstroke can't, even the flash,\n\n01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.160\neven a baby flash he can't miss.\n\n01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.160\nHe figured it out.\n\n01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.160\nHe timed him out and he shot him in the knee, took him out, sent to the library.\n\n01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.160\nCongratulations, Mrs. Deathstroke, Deathstroke's mom.\n\n01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.160\nYou must be very proud.\n\n01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.160\nHe shot baby flash in the knee.\n\n01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.160\nHe is officially, yes, good job.\n\n01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.160\nAll right, I'm thinking of Deadshot.\n\n01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.160\nThat's the guy who's always bragging about how he never misses.\n\n01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.160\nYou said Deathstroke.\n\n01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160\nDeathstroke.\n\n01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.160\nHe's different from Deadshot.\n\n01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.160\nDeathstroke is just like, it looks like Deadpool and he just strokes to death.\n\n01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.160\nYeah.\n\n01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160\nAll right, sorry, I didn't mean to derail you.\n\n01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:02.160\nThat's probably my favorite flash moment, but Captain America's always been like that.\n\n01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.160\nWait, so is it because baby flash having been shot in the knee was like,\n\n01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.160\nwell, I'm still fast, I'm going to go to the library and get like a PhD?\n\n01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160\nYeah, it was more about self-examination.\n\n01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.160\nHow do I grow as a person?\n\n01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.160\nI'm not a good superhero.\n\n01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:17.160\nI let down my whole team and I'm shot in the knee.\n\n01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:20.160\nI can't run fast anymore, so what am I worth?\n\n01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.160\nHe went and explored himself and he came back and, you know, he made a difference.\n\n01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.160\nDid he like learn any new talents?\n\n01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.160\nHe learned all sorts of chemistry and bio.\n\n01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.160\nI don't know exactly what he was.\n\n01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.160\nWas he learning faster?\n\n01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.160\nYeah, he was learning way faster.\n\n01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.160\nHe read the library.\n\n01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160\nHe had a PhD by the end of it, you know.\n\n01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160\nWho's fast?\n\n01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.160\nWho's faster?\n\n01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160\nWho's faster?\n\n01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160\nOkay.\n\n01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.160\nOkay.\n\n01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.160\nFlash is Superman.\n\n01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.160\nGo.\n\n01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160\nFlash, no doubt.\n\n01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.160\nFlash is Superman.\n\n01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.160\nNo doubt.\n\n01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160\nWho swims faster?\n\n01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160\nFlash or Aquaman?\n\n01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.160\nSpins faster.\n\n01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.160\nSwims faster.\n\n01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.160\nSwims faster.\n\n01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.160\nOh.\n\n01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.160\nBut who does?\n\n01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:00.160\nWhat?\n\n01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.160\nSpam faster.\n\n01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:08.160\nI'll go with the flash in any scenario, space, water, air, anywhere.\n\n01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.160\nFlash is the fastest.\n\n01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.160\nHow come Superman and the Flash are always having races and they're like neck and neck?\n\n01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.160\nI think Flash is just, you know, trying to throw him a bone.\n\n01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160\nReally?\n\n01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.160\nHe seems so uptight about it.\n\n01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.160\nThe Flash?\n\n01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.160\nYeah, he doesn't seem like he's throwing anyone a bone.\n\n01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.160\nOf the two of them, who's more uptight?\n\n01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160\nSuperman or Flash?\n\n01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.160\nFlash is having fun.\n\n01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.160\nI don't think, I think Superman wishes he was slower.\n\n01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.160\nI don't think Superman is the kind of guy that's like, I should race you.\n\n01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.160\nI think that's why he enjoys racing the Flash.\n\n01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.160\nHe's like, oh, this is one time I can let loose.\n\n01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.160\nIt's one time I might lose.\n\n01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.160\nAnd I'm gonna lose.\n\n01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.160\nWhich says a lot about Superman.\n\n01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.160\nAnd that's okay.\n\n01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.160\nThat he, yeah, he's coming in low.\n\n01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.160\nHe wants to lose.\n\n01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.160\nSo that flies in the face of the theory that Flash is throwing Superman a bone.\n\n01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160\nOh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.160\nMaybe we're both right and wrong.\n\n01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.160\nI get it.\n\n01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.160\nI get it now.\n\n01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.160\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.160\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.160\nSo Superman is the provocateur because he's so masochistic.\n\n01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:06.160\nHe's like, hey, you want to race?\n\n01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160\nI hope I lose.\n\n01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.160\nI hope I lose.\n\n01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.160\nOh, Superman.\n\n01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.160\nSo dark.\n\n01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160\nI think so.\n\n01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.160\nI think that's like the most forgiving rating of Superman, but yeah.\n\n01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.160\nHas the Flash.\n\n01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160\nOkay.\n\n01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:23.160\nSo the Flash, I know he can run across water because he's so fast.\n\n01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.160\nYeah.\n\n01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.160\nSo can Superman.\n\n01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160\nThey often race around the world.\n\n01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.160\nRight.\n\n01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160\nOkay.\n\n01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:33.160\nSo, so, so, so my question is, and I think you've already answered it.\n\n01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.160\nHas the Flash ran across the ocean?\n\n01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.160\nYeah.\n\n01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.160\nHe's run all across the whole planet many times.\n\n01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160\nYeah.\n\n01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.160\nHe'll do it.\n\n01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160\nHe won't even get on a plane.\n\n01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160\nHe's like, I'd rather run across the ocean.\n\n01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160\nYeah.\n\n01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160\nI'm not even going to put on the suit.\n\n01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160\nRight.\n\n01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160\nDoes he put that on that?\n\n01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160\nBecause also no one's going to go.\n\n01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160\nDoes he what?\n\n01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.160\nBarry Allen is the Flash.\n\n01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.160\nThis changes everything.\n\n01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160\nYeah.\n\n01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.160\nCatch me.\n\n01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.160\nFuck your head.\n\n01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.160\nOh my God.\n\n01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.160\nThat's Arthur Curry.\n\n01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160\nYeah.\n\n01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160\nTry to catch him.\n\n01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.160\nI'm carrying him.\n\n01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.160\nAlex Haley is Frozone.\n\n01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:15.960\nThe Flash is running across the ocean and Aquaman is trying to, let's say the Riddler\n\n01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.160\nis in the water.\n\n01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.160\nOkay.\n\n01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:23.760\nAnd he's drowning because Wonder Woman's ropes are around him and so the Riddler is\n\n01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.660\nsaying, honestly, I'm drowning.\n\n01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.160\nI swear to God.\n\n01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.040\nI have no reason to lie to you, I'm drowning.\n\n01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.400\nAnd so Aquaman's heading towards the Riddler, so is the Flash.\n\n01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:44.040\nIs it possible that the Flash would kick Aquaman in the face and if he did would he\n\n01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.040\nfall?\n\n01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040\nKill him.\n\n01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.040\nKill him.\n\n01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.040\nKill him because it's like a bullet.\n\n01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.040\nWell, he's the king of Atlantis.\n\n01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.040\nYou could probably shoot Aquaman in the face with a gun.\n\n01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.040\nWith the Flash?\n\n01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.040\nWith those hips?\n\n01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.040\nOh yeah.\n\n01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.040\nI don't know why not.\n\n01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040\nDid you shoot Aquaman in the face?\n\n01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:01.680\nI think the Flash could kill Aquaman in pretty much any scenario.\n\n01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.440\nI don't know how y'all feel about that, but I give the Flash KO in that scenario for\n\n01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.440\nsure.\n\n01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.360\nWhat I was going to say is if the Flash is running across water and he steps on anything\n\n01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:22.280\nother than water, be it Aquaman's face in this case, would he trip and then he would\n\n01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.960\nfall in the water, right?\n\n01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.960\nYeah.\n\n01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.960\nOkay.\n\n01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960\nGood because I'm just working on the script tonight.\n\n01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:39.200\nI just wanted to run this scene by you and ridiculous.\n\n01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.360\nSo you said the Flash could move the fastest in space.\n\n01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:49.120\nYeah, he's been in space and how did dude wait the Flash could run in space?\n\n01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.200\nIt's all about it's all about the speed force.\n\n01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:58.680\nThe speed force is an interdimensional force that allows him to access speed in any dimension.\n\n01:39:58.680 --> 01:39:59.680\nOh, cool.\n\n01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.040\nThat's not, thank you for taking that.\n\n01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.480\nThat's not a very nice way to respond to an answer to a question you asked.\n\n01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.960\nHe wanted the answer, yeah.\n\n01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960\nIt doesn't have to make sense.\n\n01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.760\nHe does answer me a lot.\n\n01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.760\nHe's like, oh, tell me what you know, do you really, really care?\n\n01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.760\nTell me what you're doing.\n\n01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:26.920\nAnd he'll go like, nerd, wow, okay, so he can run in space.\n\n01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.200\nHe can run on water.\n\n01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:38.280\nHe can run on space, but he's not running, he's going to interdimensional, what's it?\n\n01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.240\nWait, how can he get, how does speed force make it so that he can move through space?\n\n01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.240\nSpeed force.\n\n01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240\nIsn't it the need?\n\n01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.400\nI assumed that that, I have to say, when I heard speed force, I immediately pictured\n\n01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:57.760\nthis whole fucking subset of comic books about all the people that hang out with the flash,\n\n01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:06.120\nand I was like, I will fully ignore, I didn't want to hear a goddamn thing about it.\n\n01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:15.800\nWell, there's, laser foot and, Shortcuts 12 has red hair and pigtails.\n\n01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.600\nGet back here, Shortcut.\n\n01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:25.560\nBut wait, is speed force, does it refer, I assumed like a task force, no, it's like\n\n01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.560\na force of nature.\n\n01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.560\nYeah, it's a force of nature.\n\n01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.560\nOh, okay, okay.\n\n01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.320\nIt's like a dimension that he accesses to do his thing.\n\n01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.040\nAnd there are people there, there's Jesse Quick, and all sorts of folks, Jesse, I knew\n\n01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:39.040\nit.\n\n01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.040\nI knew it, I knew there was a speed force, Jesse Quick.\n\n01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.320\nI mean, they're not going to stop printing these comic books.\n\n01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.840\nThey're not going to, they're not going to be like, well, maybe no one will want to read\n\n01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840\nthis one.\n\n01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.640\nThey're going to keep doing it until it, until it's fucking, until it's dry as a\n\n01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640\nball.\n\n01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.200\nHow did he become the flash?\n\n01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.280\nHe spills some chemicals on himself, they got struck by lightning, it's bullshit.\n\n01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:06.240\nHe's, wait, wait, wait, I mean, it's true, it's lazy, but it is true, but it's so lazy.\n\n01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.320\nHe spills some chemicals.\n\n01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320\nWhat were they?\n\n01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320\nJanitorial supplies.\n\n01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.280\nYou can find them in any home hit by lightning by lightning, yeah, but on the same day that\n\n01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.280\nhe spills something.\n\n01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.240\nIf you want to get, like, really into the flash lore, he is the lightning bolt that struck\n\n01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:26.280\nhimself and he gave himself his powers, it gets really complicated, yeah.\n\n01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280\nWhat?\n\n01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280\nYeah.\n\n01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:38.240\nOh, because of the infinite crisis, did Brainiac make Power Girl into a fucking storm cloud\n\n01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.400\nafter Earth 2 was...\n\n01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.080\nYou made fun, but you know too much.\n\n01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:48.560\nI'm getting too much from Wikipedia, I'm like, just tell me who fucking Black Canary\n\n01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560\nis.\n\n01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.920\nLike, any of the first paragraph of every single one of these fucking people is like,\n\n01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.000\nthis is the name of several characters, I'm like, no it's not, just tell me who the fuck\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nshe is.\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.480\nWhat, has she got a knife in her boot?\n\n01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.440\nProbably, but I'm not the one to help you with her.\n\n01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.720\nYeah, well, she sings in people's faces and stuff, she sings.\n\n01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:17.480\nSuperman and Batman, Public Enemies, here's a new segment, here's a new segment, Dan Harmon\n\n01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:23.480\nproblematizes the things that don't need to be problematized.\n\n01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:34.480\nSometimes you gotta problematize.\n\n01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.320\nSuperman, oh man, we're done, I fucking did it, okay.\n\n01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.720\nSuperman and Batman, Lex Luthor's president in this Public Enemies thing, and Superman\n\n01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:43.880\nand Batman are like...\n\n01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.520\nThey have to move in together.\n\n01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:51.000\nI can't remember the circumstance, but they're like, it's like, oh, Superman goes for a meeting\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nwith...\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.480\nThere's a comet coming towards Earth, it's Kryptonite comet, yeah.\n\n01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.800\nAnd Superman goes to have a meeting with Lex Luthor, and Batman's like, don't go to that\n\n01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.080\nmeeting, and whatever, you know, fast forward.\n\n01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:08.280\nSo it turns out, Batman and Superman are like buddy cops who are framed for trying to get\n\n01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.880\ntrying to kill President Luthor, and they're like on the lamb together.\n\n01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:22.400\nAnd Lex Luthor puts a bounty on their heads, so all of the DC villains are trying to kill\n\n01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.280\nSuperman and Batman, and one of them is Banshee.\n\n01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:36.440\nYou guys know Banshee, she comes flying out of the woods, and goes, and Superman's like\n\n01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:45.680\nthe fuck, fuck, and he just takes her up into space, and she passes out, and he flies her\n\n01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:55.560\ndown, and he says to Batman, these guys don't hang out that much, but Superman says to Batman,\n\n01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:04.520\nshe'll be out for a while, but do you have anything for her screaming?\n\n01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:12.800\nAnd Batman responds like he's been asked for Advil, he's like, yeah, and he puts a disc\n\n01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:20.320\non her throat and says, this hypersonic electromagnetic thing will conduct her scream power and make\n\n01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.840\nit hurt her, make her screams hurt her more than they hurt other people.\n\n01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.080\nBatman, why is that in your pocket?\n\n01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.920\nSuperman, why does your first move to fly them up to the exact height where they fall\n\n01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.920\nunconscious?\n\n01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.000\nWhy are the two of you so fucking simpatico?\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.560\nThere was barely any conversation, it was like fuck it, it was like a fuck, she comes\n\n01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:49.240\nout of the woods, and Superman's just like, who the fuck, who the fuck, all I know is\n\n01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.440\nthis bitch won't fuck you, try screaming without air, takes him down to his vigilante\n\n01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.000\nfriend and goes, look, here's what I know, she'll be out for a while, Superman's done\n\n01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000\nthis a thousand times.\n\n01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.560\nHey, Bats, I just invented a new way to killing people.\n\n01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.520\nI'm not gonna mouth.\n\n01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:16.800\nI could grab him by the lapels and go up to space where there's no air and he implodes\n\n01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.720\nand then I just drop him the fuck down, why does he do that like that?\n\n01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.920\nSuperman does it so many times in that series that I watch regular Superman stuff and I'm\n\n01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:33.440\nlike, well, you got them, and whenever he throws someone, I'm like, why'd you throw\n\n01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.560\nhim, do your fucking moves?\n\n01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.360\nYou got, I would never stop mashing that A button, that is, take him to space, see\n\n01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.360\nhow they like that.\n\n01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:51.240\nThat is so fucking dark, like he went, oh, I never thought of that before, there's a\n\n01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:57.320\nbank robbery, I got this, I ready everybody put your gun in the air, I'm gonna blow your\n\n01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:03.600\nfucking head up, excuse me, going up, what are you, oh my god, no.\n\n01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.320\nHow about this, hey, Martian manhunter, scan for all the people that are thinking they\n\n01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:20.240\nmight want to rob a bank, hey, Flash, quickly learn to forge a contest entry for people\n\n01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.600\nwho all get to rob a bank, like if you start just like, he just like gathers people in\n\n01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.200\nbuses and like full of people who are thinking about robbing a bank, I just like soaring\n\n01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.720\nthem into space and they're like, ugh, ugh, and they just like take them down, like there's\n\n01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.360\njust like filling stadiums full of buses, full of people who might fucking have the\n\n01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360\nwrong thoughts.\n\n01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.520\nHe's like, why am I making this so hard for myself, making them empty, Superman, emptying\n\n01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.640\ntheir guns while, while they're shooting at my chest, I could just grab the fuckers and\n\n01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640\ngo up to space.\n\n01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:57.120\nI mean, you're an alien, you can't die, use it or lose it, you're not gonna fit in while\n\n01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.120\nyou're helping people, no one likes people saving them, everyone needs it, stop fitting\n\n01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:09.640\nin, save us, Christ, like just fucking like, shoot, like kill

01:48:16.040\nversion.\n\n01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.680\nHe's like, son, it's a great story about Superman being a Russian fuck, he's like a\n\n01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.680\nRussian, it's

finish it, you, you earned it.\n\n01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.800\nSo I think it's next, next week we'll talk, we'll talk true crime with some, with some\n\n01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.040\nwonderful British imports, I really think you're gonna love them.\n\n01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.080\nThe red handles.\n\n01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.720\nThe red hand podcast, uh, you think you're sick of true crime, but, uh, you know, like\n\n01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.640\nI, I, they're, they're, they're really, uh, kind of graceful and crisp about it in a\n\n01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:01.000\nway that makes
