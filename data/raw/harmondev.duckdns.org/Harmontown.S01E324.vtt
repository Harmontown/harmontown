00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Welcome to Harmontown. How are you tonight? You look so beautiful. I am Brandon Johnson.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm sitting in for the lovely Jeff Davis and we want to wish Sherry Hill a happy birthday.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
We want to wish Steve Levy a happy birthday. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, let's

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
bring him out. He's renowned, the best around, Dan Harmon, followed by the most amazing Rob.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Rob!

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah. Happy birthday, Steve Levy. Steve Levy's birthday.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
I never really texted him, Steve, just a happy birthday.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
We took care of it for you.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
We assisted your assistants on his assistant.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
I saw it on my calendar and then I, because Steve's the first guy I got a text in the morning

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
and I was like, well, get this stuff out of the way first.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
He should have left you a note.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Like a calendar? He's in charge of my calendar. His birthday was on it. He did the best he could

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
to humanize himself. He just couldn't get through the fucking membrane.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Couldn't break the titanium ceiling, the whatever material you use when you're just

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
oppressing everyone human. It's beyond glass.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Glass is elegant. It's for the ladies. You want to be able to see through it.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Hello. I'm oppressing you. I can see through the ceiling.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
What, too soon?

01:54.000 --> 02:04.000
If you guys think you're sick of me, you should be sick of yourselves for a change.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
What would you use for Levy?

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I don't know. Well, obviously, I'm using something that you can't see through.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
I think that's my elegant point. I think that's where the term glass ceiling probably came from,

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
is that men are like, they're like, oh, it's transparent.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Not because it's invisible, but because the men are like, yeah, it's there.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
I can see you. I think it's insidious.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
And then I'm saying, then what about the way that you oppress everybody,

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
that you don't even think about at all? You don't even see them.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I feel like women came up with the term.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Women came up with a term?

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
Because from their vantage point, it's a ceiling.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
It's like a...

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
But the show is called Harmon Time.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And February is over, so I'll be quiet.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Happy March, happy International Women's Month.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Got that right?

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, point well taken.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
The term ceiling probably coined by the people beneath it.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Unless you're like that jazzed about oppression, that you're like,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
we need a ceiling over these people.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
You're like looking down and going, you don't call it a floor.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
But because you're a little concerned, you don't want to oppress them too much,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
you want to be able to see them.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It's like the opposite of empathy.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
The opposite of love is indifference, not hate.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
The opposite of empathy isn't non-empathy.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
It's like, I know exactly how you feel.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm going to crush you.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm thinking about things from your perspective,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
so I can know how to hurt you more.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Is there a word for that? Antipathy?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Free time?

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Speaking of antipathy, here's a phrase.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Antipathy.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
I remember going to my antipathy's house

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
for rhubarb pie

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
and mac and cheese, eronies.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Antipathy.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Spencer's been very depressed lately.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I asked him if it was okay to share that with people,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
and he said, yeah, that was several weeks ago.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I haven't checked in with him about that since.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm giving him his space, and he's like, I mean, I see him all the time.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
But if somebody doesn't want to, you know, I figure, give him space.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Is that what you've been doing?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh, to you.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
No, you're here.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
You reminded me.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You, interrupting with the antipathy wordplay,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
reminded me that Spencer wasn't here.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
And that made me think about the fact that I actually hadn't shared something

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
that I did ask Spencer at one point.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Would you mind if I shared that with the audience?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
He's like, yeah, I don't care, because I did think it was interesting,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
it was a real shit mood.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
And it's hard to say these days if it's connected to anything

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
extrinsically causal.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
The world is so whack-a-doodle from my perspective at this point.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
How would you know if it was because it was raining

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
or because of something you saw on the internet?

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
But you ever have one of those funks that's so deep

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
that you're like, this has got to be biochemical.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I've never been this depressed about anything real in my life.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
This has got to just be a real thing,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
and it almost makes it a little easier to deal with intellectually,

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
because you're like, oh, this is just blue crayon in my butt.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Don't Google it, but it's a real expression.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
And in the midway into that, I was not sharing it with people.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
That's the thing, because it was like, oh, this too shall pass.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
You complain enough.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Who are you going to tell?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Even saying this is going to be uncharismatic,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
but I was having this conversation with a colleague

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
where I said they were talking about being depressed,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
and I was like, you are having a lot of good fortune right now,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
and there is an effect that I've noticed

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
where that lasso of when you're allowed to complain

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
kind of tightens in your own mind,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
you guys are thinking, well, nothing's stopping you.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
That lasso is not tight, but that's because I think I have this.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I feel like I have a little license to kvetch,

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
because I'm talking to people who would never judge me.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
But anyways, I got way too high.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm sorry, that's my fourth tangent.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Spencer came to work in this funk,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
and I got out of my car, I got in the elevator,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and Spencer happened to be in the elevator at the same time,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
and he hadn't done the show for, I think,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
he just had taken one week off at that point.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
And I said, good morning.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
He said, hey, sorry, I didn't do the show.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And I was like, yeah, everything OK.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
He's like, nah, I'm really depressed.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And my mood, I was so excited.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
It was like when you see somebody wearing the same shirt,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
or somebody mentions the same Netflix show

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
that you were coming into work ready to talk about.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
And it was so instantly measurable how happy it made me

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
to hear someone else say, I've been depressed,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and I don't know why.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
And I think that that's both, look, I know that that's,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I know, it was also funny.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I was like, God, that's so ridiculous and almost cruel

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
that it makes you feel better.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You hear the misery loves company and stuff,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
and it's like, I never bothered to ask Spencer,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
is it also making you feel better?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Or is it just, I was afraid to ask.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
You ever take like a swim class when the teacher says,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
don't go near a person that's drowning.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
They won't know what they're doing.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
And they might grab your head and hold it under them

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
with their kind of reptile part of their brain

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
if they're scared they're drowning.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
So you have to have these techniques.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
That's what I was doing.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I was like, Spencer saying he had been depressed.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I just grabbed it and pushed myself up with it.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I was like, that makes me feel so much better.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
But there's a, you know, there is this thing.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You've witnessed somebody be brave.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
You're able to be brave.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And there's this great honesty.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
You get, you get a little kick from that.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
We all do.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
It's why we sort of stress, reach out to people.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So there is this moment like when you peel,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I know this is nerdy, but you know,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
when you open a bandaid in the dark

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and you see that little spark when you peel the paper.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I love that.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
That's not nerdy.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That's magic.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Right. So this is the same thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It is magic, right?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
It's the same thing in Carl's Bad Caverns

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
where there's no light.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And then you open a bandaid and you like,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
it's one little thing and it doesn't,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
it doesn't mean you're going to live longer.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It doesn't mean anything, but it's like,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
it's, yeah, it's so important.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
It doesn't mean the wound went away.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
That's like, you know, the opposite of

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
you got to pull that bandaid off.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's usually...

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You got to open that bandaid package.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You got to open that bandaid package.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Okay, so antipathy reminded me of a, like, something.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
A better time.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
And then you did that.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
That reminded me of Spencer.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Spencer reminded me.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So I would say, I mean, I want to say also,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I don't think I have the word power right now.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I'm on a deadline.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm kind of like clumsy and fumbling,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
but I did imagine sharing it with you that Spencer's

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
been bumped out.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And I know that Spencer's not going to enjoy

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
anybody saying to him, like, you know,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
it's tough with him.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Like, he's such a smart guy.

10:34.000 --> 10:44.000
Like, you know, it's, I feel like it's important

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
to share that he's been in a funk.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I don't, even though, I bet, I'm sure he would,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
if he had a butt and he'd go, well, no,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
then don't, don't mention it because he's,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
he doesn't, he's not, I don't think he's going

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
to get joy out of, like, a flood of digital get wells,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
you know?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I, I, I.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I do.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Even if we don't, well, let's see what happens.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, sometimes, oh, that's right.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That's how I felt about wishing him a happy birthday was,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I kind of, I was like, you know, well, he probably

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
hates having happy birthdays said to him,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
but this isn't for him.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
When did he tell you he was a miserable motherfucker

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
who hated good shit?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
No, he didn't tell me.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
He's a pretty love and light kind of guy,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
as far as I've seen, and, and get sort of that,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
you get what you give and, and that.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, I don't need to make him sound like a curmudgeon.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
He's, he's, he's not.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I think he would love a little love.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
No, he's just very, he doesn't like.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
He's shy.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
He's, he's like, I don't want to say social anxieties

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
because the term, I mean, is it an anxiety

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
if you don't want to be in a crowd of fucking

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
warbling strangers?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's like, it's like when people used to say

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I had a Christ complex.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
How do you know I'm not actually Christ?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's true.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Those shoes.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Did you ever, this is a kind of a tangential thing,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
but did you ever go to like Milwaukee days?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Do you guys have any of those festivals?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Summer Fest.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Summer Fest, were you that kind of person

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
who could do those?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I mean, yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
We were back in the comedy tent.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I mean, we would traverse like the crowds,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
but we wouldn't stay there very long.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
We would spend the rest of the day or the night

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
in the comedy tent.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't think I would have gone to Summer Fest

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
very often if, if we didn't have that like,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
that little feeling of like you're going there

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
to work and there's a kid.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
There's like this hidden area full of all the people

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
that you see every day, plus the occasional Bobcat Goldthwait.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Third Tom Kenny are going to show up

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
and you can hang out with them.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
So Comic Con is the same.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
When you guys are Comic Con,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
you don't really walk the floor.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I can't do the exhibit floor anymore,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
except maybe like Sunday before they like,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
after they close.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
It's like, it's really, that's pretty crazy.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I think everyone would agree,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
but I think some people are maybe just more able

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
to handle something that they know is egregious,

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
which is like absolute zero control over your personal space

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
and when you walk and don't walk.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Like that gets, that's pretty, that seems,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
that seems criminal, the exhibit floor at Comic Con.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Anyways, all right.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
So, yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
So this has been a long time coming.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I think I've, I think I've been thinking about this

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
for 30 years and I, it's like one of those things,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
it's just a little thing in my, a little be in my bonnet

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
that I think it's come up recently

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
because of the amount of true crime I'm listening to.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
So this phrase gets used a lot.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I hate this phrase.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
There's no guest tonight, so fuck you.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Welcome to the show.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Oh God.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh God.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
I guess I won't be talking when I shouldn't talk anymore.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
I guess it's always my turn to say something about myself.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You gonna fuck that up.

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
Um, I, I accidentally read the fucking reddit before I came.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
It's because I started going back there for porn

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
and like, I like the gone wild audio.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
You ever do the gone wild audio?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
It's, it's, it's like a, you can't get that anywhere else.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
It's like a, it's like an open source community of people

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
that are just doing like audio porn.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
So like role playing stuff like, like, oh hello,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
you're here for your three o'clock appointment.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Just sit over here.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
What do you mean you're French?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I don't, I made, I make, I'm making one up

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
because I've been conditioned now to not share.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Are you telling me?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Like what I'm going there for.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Is there, is there a Michael Winslow?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
The Michael Winslow of, of gone wild audio.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
It is, it is fascinating which people decide to use props.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Um, it's, it's very funny.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Like, like sometimes like, like, like, like, like women who,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
who like, where did you get the impression it would sound like

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
that to fillate someone?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Like, like, like, like, like, are you, are you,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
are you really good at it?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Is that why it sounds like that?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Like everyone else pretending to fillate?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Like, like, like, like, why does it sound like, like,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
and then the other people like, whether or not they're going

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
to do space work and like, here, let me,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
why don't you sit in this chair and then some people just

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
aren't content to let that be silent.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
There's, there's like a chair sound.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Um, which is actually more distracting to me

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
because I'm picturing them like, like,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
putting their foot on a chair or something.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
It's like they're a one man band or a,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
it's like a full act from SCTV or something.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Like, they got cowbells next to them.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
It's like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
What do you do with that finger?

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
I can't seem to maintain my erection.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
I've got to shake this lightning paper.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
There was, there was, there was one lightning paper.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
That kind of was like, um, it involved, uh, two women.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
There's like, there's, there's codes that,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
that they use to put brackets.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
And so it'll be like F4M, it means female voice recorded

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
for a male listener, assuming heterosexuality,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
I suppose, the, the, uh, and then it's M4F,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
which I should listen to a couple of times.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm sort of like, like, like, I've never actually heard

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
like a M4F, like, like, like, that seems like

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
that would be a whole world of like, I should do one.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I, I, like, like, um.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Right now?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Wow.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Shoes for sale.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Hello?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Uh, what?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
All right.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
No, let me, I'm wearing like five tangents deep.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I just want to, I want to get to this thing.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But I, I went, I went to the, uh, I went to the subreddit

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and it was like, oh, like somebody was like,

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
well, I listened to all 800 episodes and, uh,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
uh, I'm all caught up.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And then everyone was like, I can read that thread.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
That's not going to hurt me.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
That's going to be like a fucking warm embrace

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
that's not even sugar coated.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
It's just going to be like a general,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
what do you, you know, 800 episodes.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And then it was just like everybody's chance

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
to just go like, when you get to this one,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
that's when it really bad.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
And all this gentleman was like, I don't, I don't,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I just, can you still say suck my dick?

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Like, are you, is it like, is that like a suck my dick?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You know, just to say suck my dick to people,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
like as a way of saying like a fuck yourself

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
or is that, is that, is that,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is that problematic because,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
but anyone can suck a dick, right?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
No, it takes a real genius.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
For the clip show.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
That one's for the 600th anniversary special.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
No, you got better.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
You got better than suck my dick.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, no, I mean, I imagine it's just like,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
even if it's not technically,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm not one of these guys that's like,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
is this, is this technically like,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm still allowed to, I just,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I was just kind of thinking about it

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
because I'm like, I know that more than ever.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Like I used to have a real addiction

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
to like saying the F word,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
like as the gay derogatory F word,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
like just real conversationally,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
like probably all over this podcast, I bet,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
because I was like, it was a hard habit to break.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Like, like, like,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Isn't that crazy?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
shit changes fast.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And just gay and retarded all over the place and,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
and the, the, so therefore I,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I guess what I'm,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
the thing, okay, well,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I guess my point is that the thing that,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
out of all the habits that have,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
feel like I've successfully killed verbally,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
the, the thing that remains rattling

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
against the inside of my skull constantly

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
is I'm constantly wanting to just tell people

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
to suck my dick.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Like I haven't lost that.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Even though I have, I don't know,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't say it anymore.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It hasn't gone away.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Like the craving,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I just like feel like it's the thing

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
that I really want to say to everyone all the time.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
This is like my dick.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Like, like, come on.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
You got better.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
But it, yeah, of course we've all got better.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
We could all, we could all do better.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Some of us don't.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
But, but really, you know,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
there's a couple,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
because of the great thing about suck my dick,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
sort of being retired,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
there's all these new ways of saying

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
awful shit to people.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Well, did you, did you see John Mulaney's

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
set?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
The SNL set?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Didn't.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
I mean, it's like,

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
I, I, I, I, it was really striking to me

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
because it was like,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
you know, it was like debates

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
about like political correctness,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
is it killing comedy, blah, blah, blah.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And it's like, it's a non-question.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It's just like, like,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
the, the, the answer is sort of like,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
do you, if you watch John Mulaney's set

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
on Saturday Night Live,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
feel the craft,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
feel the,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
the unmistakable kind of objective humor

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
if there is such a thing.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Like, he kills it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's what you might call like just a,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
just a, just a perfect set,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
a solid set.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Like,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
and then,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
and then you,

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
like,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
oh, do you think that he did this?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Do you think he wrote and performed this

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
by first having a debate about

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
whether he's allowed to say things?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
The answer is, no,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I mean, if you haven't seen it,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I'll answer for you.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's clearly coming

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
from a place of joy.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
It just doesn't go into air.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
It's, it's, it's, he, he's not,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
he's not either mad that, that

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
the times have changed,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
nor is he like,

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
wantonly stoked about

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
the new way to think things and stuff.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
He's just nailing it, doing it.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And I think it just has to do with like

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
sincerity and kind of like being in the moment,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
which I can no longer do.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
But here's my,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
here's the thing that I would like to

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
change about language.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Because I feel like it has antipathy,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
inherent antipathy to it, this phrase.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I don't like it.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I'd like to eliminate it.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
They were in the wrong place

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
at the wrong time.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Suck my dick.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Like, like, like,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
first of all, forget about the fact,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I'm not, I'm not,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
forget about the fact that if you're

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
you probably nailed it, right?

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
You probably avoided something terrible.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I would just think verbally,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
but forget about that.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Like, like, because if you,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
you're already in the wrong place,

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
so you don't want to be,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
you don't want to be there at the right time.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
It's the wrong place.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
The right time to be there is

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
so something's wrong is going to happen.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Right.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Forget about that.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I just don't like the general,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
like, it was just like,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
like, like, I don't like the general,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
like, way that it's used,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
where it's always like,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
yeah, I guess, I guess,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I guess the term is victim-blaming now.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Where it's like, like, like,

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
because it's just like,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
something horrible happens

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
in these, uh,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
podcasts you're listening to,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
or you're like, oh,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
and then you get ripped in half

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
by a gator or the,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
the, the, the...

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, it's like the true crime podcast.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
And you're just listening

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
because you're like,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
oh, God, I, I, I hope nothing bad

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
ever happens to me.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
And, uh,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I don't know why you're listening.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It was just slowly going insane.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And, uh, it's just constantly

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
saying that over and over again.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Like, the people,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
oh, they were just in the wrong place

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
at the wrong time.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Like, like,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
the, the, the, the idea that

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
if I die tragically,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
that's, that's the way it will be

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
characterized.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
It kind of really makes me mad

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
in advance.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Like, my, I want to haunt people.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I wasn't in the wrong place

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
at the wrong time.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
If I get hit by a bus,

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
I, I, I, it was, it was, it was,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
it was a bad thing that happened.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I mean, do you have,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
if you have plans

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
on how you want to die,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
then sure, we can judge you.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Like if you were like,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
man, I wanted to die somewhere sexy,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
but I was at a gas station

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
at like three.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Right.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
It's the wrong place

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
at the wrong time.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Type of death that I wanted.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
You know, I wanted something bigger.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Is it the wrong place

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
for the kind of activity

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I had in mind?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Right.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Right.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
That's like, it is like,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
the wrong place at the wrong time.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Again, just to come back to that,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
it is like saying two lefts.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I mean, like you're,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
you're, you've now turned right.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Because obviously it was the wrong

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
time.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Yeah.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
It was already the wrong place.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Yeah.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Just don't be, don't be the right

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
place at the, at the wrong time.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
What's the other one?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
However, it doesn't work

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
in reverse.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
If you're at the right place

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
at the wrong time,

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
you're in the best place.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
I think it works the way zero

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
is in math do probably.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Or integers or whatever they call

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
them.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Two negatives.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I think that's about all I got.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I don't know.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
I heard, I, okay.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So this happened.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So I have a trainer

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
and I go to the gym regularly,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
but I'm going out of town.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Thank you.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
There's a couple of trainers in

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
the audience.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Couple of clubs for self-care.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Yeah.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Okay.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
So I'm going out of town.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I'm going.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Excuse me a second.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Going out of town next month.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
So, uh, so, uh, I canceled my

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
trainer, my trainer.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
So like, but they, but I've been

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
going there for like about four

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
years and they said, well, you've

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
accrued through like your trainer

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
canceling or you canceling or

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
whatever.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
You've accrued like, like 30

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
extra days in there that you

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
paid for, you know, and if you

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
cancel it, if you cancel it,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
they're just going to disappear.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
And I was like, well, how many,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
how many, uh, well, when, when

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
is my, if I cancel it today, when

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
does it up?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Well, it's up like in two weeks.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
So I said, well, I'll just do

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
them in, in two weeks.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
So I've been going to the fucking

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
gym.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Oh, you're just doing it every

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
single day for like two hours

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
thinking that I'm going to get

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
fucking stathom for Kate when she

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
comes back from her vacation.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Gotta get stathomed.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
But I fucked up my back and I

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
can't like bend over to pick up

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
my socks.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
So I'm the opposite of stathom.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Opposite of stathom.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I'm a 50 year old ex comic

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
book artist who can't pick up his

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
socks.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Have you seen Stathom's latest

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
movie?

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
It sounds like you have.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
No, but I'll check it out on

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Reddit.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
He's got his own shop.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Oh, my God.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Chinese, Chinese gangsters come

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
in and kill everybody inside.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I need these comic books picked

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
up and socks.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I'm the man for the job.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Are you 50?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Yeah.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah, govna.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
What they didn't know.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Hey, you didn't pick up one sock.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
That's because there was a baby in

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
it.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
That's Chinese baby.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
We take it to comic book store.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm afraid I'm going to have to

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
break my only rule.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Meow, meow, meow.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Jason Stathom is the 50 year old

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
ex comic book artist.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Who I actually I already I

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
conflated your job with the stuff

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
you're picking up off the floor.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
No, no.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
I added comic books all over the

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
floor.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
But my my back is all fucked up.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It's like really like it's it's

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
fucked up and I've got like one

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
more session tomorrow and I'm

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
like, I don't know if I can do it.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm so close to the finish line,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
but I don't know why I'm fucking

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
doing this.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm hurting myself because I'm

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
too much.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I'm like, the guy's going to go,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
you know what?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Because what they were trying to

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
do, this is why I'm doing it.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
They were trying to do, well, if

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
you pay for another month, you'll

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
be able to have more time to get

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
rid of those.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
I'm like, I'm not going to give

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
you more money so I can use the

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
stuff I already paid for.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
What planet are you from?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And planet drug dealer.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Planet drug dealer, he said.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
All right.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
But all right.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
But you did.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
It's not a zero sum game.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
You rung a certain quantity out of

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
a rag and you're, okay, so one

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
drip is, this is my therapist

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
said, here's your expectation.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Which one?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Here's what you got.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That's how much you grieve.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
So like, oh, I thought there was

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
going to be toothpaste this

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
morning.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Oh, there's no toothpaste.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
You got to squeeze the fucking

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
crust out of a weird, like,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
random toothpaste thing that you

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
found in the, but where you keep

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
the plunger.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Well, I wish that wasn't the

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
case.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I don't let that, you know, it's

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
like, one little, it's like, here's

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
what I wanted.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Here's what I got.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Here's how much I grieve.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Sorry, I got, I got, I got high.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's better than, like, the, it's

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
better than me.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
It's better than me just, I'm

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I'm very frazzled right now.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I've been, I've been on a, I'm in

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
that, I'm letting people down on

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
a deadline.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm like, I'm in my pajamas in

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
bed and I'm like failing to write.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You know, we were talking to Adam

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Conover about the blowback effect.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I, the thing that was most

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
striking to me about it in his

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
show is what they mentioned is

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
that the human brain receives not

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
knowing something as pain.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Which means guys like us, Rob,

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
we're like boxers.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
We're just as macho, like,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
like firefighters.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But if every call was, if there

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
were, there were no kitten calls.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
I haven't gotten a kitten call.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
By the way, why is that heroic

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
getting a kitten out of a tree?

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Fucking easiest gig in the world.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
They'd say a kitten, it's scared

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
to be in the tree.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Oh, finally.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Got a ladder, now you're a hero?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Come on.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
You thought it was you two

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
he was talking about.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Wait, what?

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Every time, every time

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
I bend over to pick up a sock,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
my ass hurts.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
My ass.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
It's like a sciatic?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Yes.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Yes, exactly.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
You pulled the nerve.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Yeah.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
And it hurts.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
You gotta keep stretching, man.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Do you want to go to my guy?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
What?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
My guy.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
For your ass.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
You want to go to his guy?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
For your ass.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Simple.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
What?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
My guy did help me, but...

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
With your sciatic?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah, I don't have back pain

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
anymore.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
In fact, I stopped going to him.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Because one of the things he said

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
was like, you need better core

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
strength, so now I'm like doing...

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So you stopped going?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
He said...

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Give it a long time.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
You need more core strength.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Okay, can we cancel next week?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
So I don't need you?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Yeah.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I mean, in a sense, but...

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Problem solved.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
I don't need...

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
How are you saying?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
He's like, the reason...

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
You're going to continue to have a bad

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
back at your age because you're not...

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
You don't have a strong core,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
so you get the belly in the front

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
and you got the back in the back.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
You got the party in the back.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And so you should be...

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
You don't have any core, you know?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
What?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Well, yeah, you're...

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
But that's what I've been doing.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
I've been doing core.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I've been doing my shoulders.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I've been doing my legs.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I've been doing my back.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I've been doing my triceps.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Pussy and my crat.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah, I'm not saying...

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
I'm not sending you to a coreologist.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I'm sending you to a chiropractor.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And just for some reason,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
on my left ass,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
every time I bend over to...

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Or get out of a car

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
or walk the dog,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm in terrible pain.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
Like, my left ass

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
is in a lot of pain.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Like, I'm almost...

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
I think I'm gonna fucking die sometimes.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Like, I'm like...

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Like, getting out of the car

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
when I was...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Just to go to the show,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I thought I was gonna cry.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I was crying.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
It's like an electrical jolt sometimes, right?

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Like, from your ass down into your shoe.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And so, like a fucking genius,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I did this morning, I go,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
oh, well, what I need is

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
which we've talked about before.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I get out of the bathtub

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
and I put Ben gay on my left ass

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and it mixes with the water

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
that's already on my ass

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
and it drips down my ass crack.

32:24.000 --> 32:36.000
My ass is on fire.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Did you see that?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Like, I was gonna do this and I went,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
oh, there's a pylon and I went...

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
No.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I can't, I'm not gonna look

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
at the guy that's making the tiger sound.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I'm not gonna look at him.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I'm afraid that I can't touch

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
the guy that wants to get on the show so bad.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Tigerman!

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I only listened past episode 400

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
because that's when Tigerman gets involved.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Remember when that blind guy came

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
and he was great and then we were like,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
you're gonna come again and he was like,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
fuck you.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I was using you, I'm blind.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I don't remember this.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, it was just one show.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
He came up and he killed, the audience loved him

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
and it was like, oh man,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
this fun,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
this sharp,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
out of nowhere blind guy

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
that starts coming up on the show

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and I'm sure he's like,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
yeah, I'm sure everyone feels that way.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I'm fucking blind and dealing with it.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm not your fucking

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
candle to put on your coffee table.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I really miss that guy.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Anybody remember that episode?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Was that Meltdown?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I feel like it was still Meltdown.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Well, we'll have to

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
look up

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
what episode that is.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I think there's a reference

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
to him in the title.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
New favorite show, almost through it

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
because there's only two seasons.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Love After Lock Up.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I'm telling you, man.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Love After Lock Up.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Tiger Man

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
wants to say what?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Love After Lock Up.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I don't know why I thought that would discourage him.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I don't know why

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
bringing attention to him

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
didn't discourage him from doing it more.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It's about people

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
and it's about people

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
who

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
mostly

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
who meet

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and then

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
who meet their mates

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
through

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
meetandinmate.com

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
and sites like that.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah, well that's the first thing

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
it was a mindblower.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I'm telling you,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
it's like

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
there's a lot of VH1 style

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
editing to it where

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
you play Minecraft

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
or watch it with a partner

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
because there's a lot of opportunity

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to just talk

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
because every time someone says

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
well,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Damon,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm starting to have doubts about

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
whether he's playing it this way

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
because of what happened at the airport

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
and as soon as they reference anything

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
it's going to immediately cut to a senior

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
you already saw at the airport real quick

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
but if you can get over that

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
you can.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
It's crazy, these stories

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
get through the first season, the second season

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
is like three times

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
crazier.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Example,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Jamarius didn't tell me that he had another family

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
before he was locked up

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
and now we all live together.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Well, there is

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
what's his name?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Jamarius.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
There is one girl

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
who doesn't know.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
There's a lot of

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
there's going to be a lot of like

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
didn't he wrestle Cerberus?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
When Christina

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
first looked me up on

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
prisonday.com, you know

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
she told me she was okay with my situation

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
but she's not okay with my situation.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Well, here's what's crazy.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Murder.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
They did, it's

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
it's all across

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
the gender and racial spectrum

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
like

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
you gotta stop, man.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
You gotta stop.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It's going to go Adam Goldberg so fast.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
That's another that's something first

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I didn't know I had preconceptions about this stuff

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
but when I heard about love after lock up

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I just immediately first of all pictured

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
the kind of

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
the women that

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
like to the inmates

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
and then it's like

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
what's going on with them

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and you got these preconceived notions

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
like, okay, no, there's just as many

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
guys doing it

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
with these female inmates

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
and here's the crazy thing is

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
what's the similarities

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
the crazy thing is the stuff that crosses

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
all lines of

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
of gender and race

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I guess are the two lines I don't know

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
say class like the monopoly guys getting out of prison

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
there's no episode like that

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
but I was kind of like

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
blown away at an almost

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
uplifting humanistic

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
way to say like, oh my god

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
like

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
stories this extreme

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
like

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
gender is an artificial construct because

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
what's really defining these people

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
is whether you're out of prison

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
or in prison, that's the two

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
genders in these relationships

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
and the people who are out of prison

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I hope

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I hope there's not an exception

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
to this because they would definitely

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
not deserve to be lumped in this way

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and I don't want to

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
judge anybody ever for

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
the rest of my life but I'm like fascinated

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
by the fact that like it seems

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
like all the people that are out of prison

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
that are going to

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
these prison sites

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
to find a mate

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
it's like

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
they all are

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
going there because in every

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
sense of the phrase on both

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
levels of the phrase

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
they like the idea of having

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
a prisoner for a mate

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
so that includes

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
after they get out like these

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
in whatever way that you're capable

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
of expressing it like these people are like

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
oh this is their recourse to control

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
like they want

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
to be

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
awarding in a relationship

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
now that sometimes that takes the form of

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
like toxic masculine

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
like there's like crazy

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
the characters on this show

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
you're going to learn their names

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
and be like

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
there's no boring ones

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
and actually

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I feel like I'm learning about relationships

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
because it's so extreme

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
it's so dysfunctional

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
out of the gate that it's sort of like

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
that's not good learning

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
no

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
don't use this guide man

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
use this as a guide man

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I'm sure

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
there's a metaphor that would suffice about it though

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
because it's like you're talking about

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
going down

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
to the shore and watching

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
where ocean

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
pounds into a rock

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
so that you can build better

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
pneumatic pipes and things

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
where you're like I want to understand

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the dangerous forces

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
that are at play

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
when two people that don't want to be alone

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
got their

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
hooks in each other in various ways

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
because

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
in more healthy

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
relationships then oh I went

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
to a prison site and started

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
writing this person

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
relationships with more healthy starts to that

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
the

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
undercurrent of

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
of materialism this idea

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
of like well this person just needs to eat

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
they just got out of the joint

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
like they're trapped in this relationship

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
or they're taking advantage

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
of someone

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
usually exactly both

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
in this crazy

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
like ants

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
mating

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
colliding in the air and tumbling

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
as they fuck to the earth

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
where like both needs being filled

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
both killing each other

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
it's like I need

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
control over a human being

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I have a you know and the other person is like

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I need a sandwich

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and it's just like

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
it is truly

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
intense man

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I can't recommend it enough there's a

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
there's a million

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
reality shows I'll recommend one more just to

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
show that it's not like oh Dan you watch

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
a reality show and you're like

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
not desensitized to them so your

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
old man thinks reality shows are interesting

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
no I don't

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
but I but it's this kind of real quick

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
it's this kind of a point that you had when he

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
asked last week about is it

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
real life and real life does

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
it adapt to script

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and I think there's something interesting about what you point out is the very

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
rawness of the lack of storyline

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
these are just real characters that are super dynamic

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
yeah and but you and you're also like

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
pulling these characters out of it because it's like it goes through

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
these shades of like

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
you can eat you can so easily

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
go oh he's the mark

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
he's the trick you know she's

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
she's a sociopath like it's the same

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
way like like on any

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
sidewalk or shopping mall

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
where you might be people watching and you

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
it's not like we

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
it's not like the human mind

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
has a question mark in place of an opinion

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
about a stranger you know like until

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
they get more data it's like we know exactly

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
who's racist like

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
that man's racist you'll find out later if you're right

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
but

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
it like like so you watch

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
these stories and it's like you go like oh

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
oh I feel bad for him

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
because like the guy the way he's talking

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
about it's like well I've known Sasha for

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
nine months I mean I've never talked

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I've never seen her in person but I've been sending her

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
money and and and all that stuff and you're like

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
okay my pity's going over there

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and then she I'm making one up

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I don't want to spoil it really any other real ones

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
but it's like and then and then and then she gets

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
out and you're like this poor guy

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and and it's just like

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
it's not even just like it flips to

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
oh this guy's a monster

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
it's like while it's flipping to

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
it's he's he's a monster

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
it's also you're

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
you're kind of like you're learning more

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
about why she might

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
be well why was she in prison and

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
like like like and and what is she

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
supposed to fucking do and and again

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
like it's it's

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
it makes no difference if it's

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
a dude like the dudes

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
are like fucking you know

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
they could snap the woman's

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
neck but it changes nothing about

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
the dynamic on that fundamental level

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
that there's one person who's like

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I just got out of prison I really want to

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
sit in a lawn chair in my backyard

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and drink a beer and stare at the sun

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
and and the other

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
person is like

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I have decided

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
a year ago that I am in love with this

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
person and they need them to get a job

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and and and it's

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
just like wow away we go

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Rock'em Sock'em Robots

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
like like and and and

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
and I really magic casting that shit

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
and the thing about it is

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
is that after a while

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
you kind of like start to realize that

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
oh you know

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
yeah nobody's

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
getting out of prison with

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
autonomy like it's just sort of like

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
that starts to feel like

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
like like the bullet a bull

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
fight coming out and they're like

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
what's that dirt in the in the back

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
well that's like

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
right blend of chemicals that they're used to

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
handicap this animals natural

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
strengths over the humans that have

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
the swords so like

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
it's like well everyone's coming out of prison

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
completely addicted to being told

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
what to do and also

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
having some kind of oppositional defiant like

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
impulse in them they're probably addicted to

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
some chemical that they were either being supplied

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
in prison and or it certainly

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
did not get like adequate treatment

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
for their addiction to and

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
and a slew of other crazy

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
like personality

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
dysfunctions that it's just really fun

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
to watch I mean I would I would

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I would stop talking about it but I don't

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
there's no you got number two

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
what's the recommendation number two

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
it's it's it's not

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
as exciting I just thought it was a really good well produced

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
reality show it's about like the

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
remember I think I might have mentioned it before

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
that

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
that it's the

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
real life version of the movie Nightcrawler

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
it's the guys that I can't remember the name

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
of the show now it's the it's the guys that go

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
around LA and they shoot

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
like news footage at like three in the morning

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
like car accidents and like

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
chases and whatever news

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and there is like three

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
three companies that are in competition

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
with each other and they all have histories with each other

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
and as that was a really

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
really fun show to watch

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
are those um are those

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
guys the same as paparazzi in that

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I know it's paparazzi but I say paparazzi

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
are they the same

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
are they the same background

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
are they like LA locals

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
or are they transplants from like Eastern Europe

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
uh well it's the the show

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
opens with and is produced by

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
and you're kind of like oh these are the these are the guys that are

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
my favorite and they also it's their the show

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
that they made but uh

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
but it's it's like

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
British brothers and the

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
the first guy is just like he

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
he he's an adrenaline junkie

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
like he he

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
he as far as he is concerned

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
chasing police

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
and ambulances or

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
or or or just trying to

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
use the freeway system to get

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
to an intersection point where

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
you're gonna get the perfect like that adrenaline

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
is his idea of a perfect job

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and then the only dilemma is

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
how am I gonna get paid to do this

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
like in a way that's gonna also feed my family

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
and like while other people

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
are like doing it differently in a way that's gonna

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
box the mon-pop

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
uh uh corpse filming

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
uh out of the market

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
it's a real crime what happened to the small

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
business

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
it's sort of like uh uh cheaters

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
there's two uh two hosts but

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
one of them is clearly like into it

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
cheaters yeah oh that

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
show where they go catch the people cheating

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
yeah there's two hosts because the

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
first guy got stabbed

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
didn't they get stabbed I always thought they were I thought they were

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
am I wrong about this aren't there two

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
dude yeah there's two thank you

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
only one dude out here watching cheaters

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
um

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
one of them is like okay let's go

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and the other one's like why are you here

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
don trail

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
like he's just really takes it personal

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
maybe maybe maybe one of them's a cheater

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
yeah so they're like

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
well I'm I'm good

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
at hosting the show because I have cheated

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I'm not

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
gonna lie my heart's not in it

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I kind of wish the guy would get

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
away

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
just what I just want to feel a little

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
vicarious calm about

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
cheating

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
but I do know where they're gonna be

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
and like that's part of their job

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
if you guys see the commercial for the show

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
about the like the task force that

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
handles child abduction

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
and the gimmick is that

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
there's a new member of the team

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
she was a child abductee

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
and they don't but and I was like

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
that's a little

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
that's a little silly and Cody's like well no it's not

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
she would do that on SVU like

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
you can relate to victims the

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
no I'm like yeah as a victim like if you

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
had a trauma like that that's

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
but but they play it in the commercial

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
like she like like it's like

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
her superpower like she's like

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I was abducted once check that

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
shed

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
they love sheds

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
you only

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
knew one of them

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
you're not a ghost buster

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
you're not men in black

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
there was a shadow in men and

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
what have you been doing since you've had a house to yourself

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
um no no no

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
no no no

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
no no no no no no no

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I've been I've been watching a lot of TV

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
been talking to my masturbate

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
past the point where like nothing comes out

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
just a little bang

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
sign

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
not for a while

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Cody went away for a week

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
she's gone

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
no she's back now

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Kate's gone until Saturday

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
it's hooked up when

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
when they leave because you really do

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
you really do beat the little man up

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and then they come back and they look at it

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
and they're like what the fuck did you do

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
while I was gone

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and you're like

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
yeah

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
yeah

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
the little man

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
it's just not uh

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
he's got a suit on

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
the little man

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
you beat the little man up

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
it's very good with Cody

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
like I never had a really

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
like well

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
like now when I

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
it's just like

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
it's like a hafsey thing now

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
like I'm like oh

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
you can't simulate

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
anymore

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
like a relationship where it's like kind of

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
it's uh

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
what is this it's not humble bragging

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I'm just bragging

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
but I never

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
experienced it before where it was like

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
like okay well

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
there's like a habit in my head where I'm like ooh

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
time to jerk off

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
like carte blanche but

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I can jerk off whenever I want

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
in a healthy relationship and then on top of that

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
the real thing is

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
kind of open and

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
deep and

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
deep

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
and loose and there's an echo

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
and um

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
the real

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
the real thing is

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
it's voluminous

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
and then it's like

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
now it's kind of like this childish thing

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
where I'm like it's like a compulsion

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and then

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
it just feels like a little

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
craft project

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
like it's just like a

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
but it won't stop me from doing it again

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
and I was wondering if you

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
like a craft project

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
like Elmer's glue

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
like what is that

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
glitter glue

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
yeah it's the

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
closest thing you'll ever hear in your life

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
no

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
can we pretend we have a guest so I can

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
sit down? sure

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
alright

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
wow the stage is empty tonight

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
three lonely microphones

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
sitting alone

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
why don't you interview the microphones

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
pretend they're guests

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
yeah let's get a little feedback

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
microphone number one

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
good evening

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
it was for all the dads

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
not proud of it

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
had to do it

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
we've got our

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
uh

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I say this just in case

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
you know there's an episode coming up

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
where I'm going to be interviewing people

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
and they have a podcast so

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
if you want to get out

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
in front of it you'll have

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
familiarity with that

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
don't we have a clip from that episode

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
that we could show tonight to get people

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
interested why don't we just check out the clip

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
check out the clip there

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
just turn around and look

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
you fucking idiot there's no clip

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
how would we have a clip

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
it's in the future

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
do you stand up the whole time

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
it depends

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
why don't you be the guest

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
take a take a load off

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
nobody will hear about me

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
now not true we can

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I'm not that good an interviewer

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
we're not gonna learn that much about you

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I uh I

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
we can always pull somebody up too

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
no don't

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I wish I could go back in time

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and stop just let me

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
let me

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
let me

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
let me come around

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
to that idea

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I just want to have

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
a sense of control and comfort in my life

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I just want

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
permission to like myself again

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I just want to

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
get over my approval addiction

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
my narcissism

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
my

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
fluctuating weight

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I would like

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I need a new pair of shoes

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
my

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
my here's something relatable

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I uh

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
like at least

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
two of my

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
six surveillance cameras are hardly

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
weatherproof

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
like hello

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
when it's raining

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
is when I want to see

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
if there's someone outside

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I'm sorry I'm foggy

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
when it's raining oh great

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
great because when does anyone ever

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
had a creepy

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
person outside their house in the rain

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
you you got to get on those neighborhood

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
things on on like Facebook

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
those uh the next door app

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I got my next door next door is too much

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
they want too much info they'll give out

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
like your fucking location I know it feels like it's

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
such a weird thing I'm like I might my name

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
is uh night writer

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
on there because I'm like well it just

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
seemed like well my

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
because

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
like because like Cody used like a code name

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
and I'm like but other people are clearly not

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
using a code name and then I'm like like

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
because because I gave my first

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
piece of advice because somebody lost their cat

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
and I was like hey I think

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I saw your cat in my backyard and

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
they had identified it as an outdoor cat

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and I was like you I really don't want to

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
be this this guy and I wouldn't say

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
this if if I had seen anyone

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
else say it because I you're none of

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
my beeswax but got major

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
coyote shit going on up here

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
and uh

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
and I had to say where I was

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm like oh I'm right up here and I'm like

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
well so what is it yeah

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I'm agreeing with you I'm like

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
how can you have like a next door

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
app kind of thing without everybody just

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
having your address here it's

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
it's not like there's a

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Facebook

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
on the old Facebook every neighborhood

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
has a group right and you can get on

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
you don't have to you don't have to like

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
do anything other than just look at that page

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
because it'll tell you what's going on immediately

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
like somebody will be like I heard

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
gunshots and then four or five people will

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
be like I heard gunshots in this look at and you

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
can you don't have to use you know

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
you don't have to give up your actual like info

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I had a friend

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
I don't know I I

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
don't know if they want credit for this insight

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
or not so I'm going to give them their anonymity

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
but I have a friend who

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
we were talking about the next door app

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
and they said

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
it's just a

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I don't know how they phrased it but they basically

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
implied like

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
it's just making people more racist it's just

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
a bunch of people

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
saying there's a

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
a brown skin girl

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
casing my house

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
and people are like now just using the word

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
casing to

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
refer to pedestrians in their neighborhood

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
like everyone wants to be the first person

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
to notice someone casing their house

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
that's why Facebook's great

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
because there's a

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
there's a lot of different ethnicities watching people

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
post

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
so if somebody's like took a picture of this dude

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I think he stole my bike

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
but 50 people

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I need to try to understand

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
this thing though because to the

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
extent that it's

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
accountable to the planet

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
how is it

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I guess the idea is

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
if you seal it off

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
then that's like the psychological

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
equivalent of a gated community it kind of promotes this

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
sort of white flight maybe mentality

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
where it's like

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
our neighborhood is precious

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
as opposed to our neighborhood

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
is something that only we care about

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
and it keeps it positive it's a permeable membrane

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
it's like greenhouse gas

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
like you need to get that shit

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
out

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
you can't trap it in

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
you can't have them in the greenhouse for sure

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
if you're comporting yourself

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
when you talk to your neighbors about your neighborhood

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
in a way that is

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
suitable for the planet to comment on

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
that's a good

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
exercise

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
yeah it keeps us all neighborly

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
if you know that you have to speak about the neighborhood

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
in a way that your neighbors won't get pissed about

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
here's the thing that I already hate

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I knew I was going to see it

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
it's the

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
architecture snobbery

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
the way people force it in

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
it's like a running gag

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
someone will go lost cat

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I lost my cat

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
it's named vanilla it answers to anything

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
because it's a fucking cat

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
it's never answered anything in its life

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
its brain is a cluster of nerves in its head

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
and it owns us

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
but I love cats

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
sorry

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I derailed myself

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I haven't seen my cat

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
there will be a couple comments

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I had a cat like that once

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I think I saw that cat

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
third one will be

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
well maybe

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
it broke its own neck

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
while turning it

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
away from the eyesore

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
on the corner of

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
and then everyone's like that fucking piece of shit

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
who builds

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
right out to the property line

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I hate modern architecture

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I don't know

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
you will lose hours looking at that shit

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
because on Facebook they're mad that the Whole Foods

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
360 is now just going to be a regular Whole Foods

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
it's like a huge deal

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I guess some of that stuff I find important

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
but I draw the line

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I know why I draw the line because it's something

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I don't know about

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
but I just feel like

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
well god damn

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
we sell each other

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
lots of land

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
in these

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
parcels

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
you're not even allowed to dig down

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
just AT&T owns

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
everything five feet underneath your

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
fire hydrant and mobile

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
it's licensing any aluminum

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
you might find from

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
you don't even really own the fucking land anymore

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
if you want to build a tree house

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
and

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
if they want to they can come kick it down

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
and right

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Jew on your forehead

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
maybe I'm exaggerating

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
but it just feels like those are the times we're living in

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
the

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
if you

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I just can't stand that idea that on top of

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
that then your neighbors are like

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
judging you based on

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
like

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
his front door is like

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
right next to the sidewalk

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
that's what they want

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
who cares

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
who cares

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
because they have a general

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I understand that they're maybe more classically educated

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I don't think there's something wrong with me

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
because I just don't care

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I definitely would never notice

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
the fucking eyesore

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I would be like

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
how does that affect me

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
why spend time thinking about it

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
the only thing that I'll think is that I'll go

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
like well maybe for those people

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
maybe when they look out their

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
front door when they walk their dog

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
maybe they're having

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
maybe they have the same

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
uncontrollable reaction to looking down

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
their sidewalk

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that I have maybe looking at your punctuation

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
or something

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I'm not a grammar master but like if you use the wrong form of your

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
or something

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
maybe some people just couldn't give a piss

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
about that and they won't get hung up about it

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
and

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and maybe

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
maybe if it's

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
if I could understand that everyone was

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
just being the way that they really are

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
yeah but you're a writer

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
and you're a word person

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
like your

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
your life is words

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
these people are just looking at a house

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and they're not architects

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
they're not door builders

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
they're not like

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
lying drawers

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
but my vocation isn't the reason why I

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
that's a

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
product of the fact that I

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
care about the aesthetics

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
of letters on a screen

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
you know like

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I'm not

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
it's kind of an LA thing

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
to shit talk

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
architecture

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I guess it makes me feel insecure

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
because I feel like a

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
lower class person that like made good

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and moved to LA and I was just like

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I've never felt like

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
like I understand you can't buy

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
this you know and then like I just have this

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
panic when people are like

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
you know

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
what are these people Armenian

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
what do they have columns in their

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
thing and it's like

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
because they work their whole life

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
to fucking have a house

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
they're like columns

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
they want their house to look like yours

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
everyone wants to be the first act of beetle juice

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I just

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
we always give this place a hard

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
it's a weird thing I think

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
people in LA tend to shit talk it

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
you get to this period where you don't shit talk it

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
and then I think you shit talk it again

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
after like after your first year here you're like

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
fuck this place there's no jazz and no tall buildings

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and there's no downtown and then you love it

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
there's no jazz and tall buildings

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
right and then

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
where should I live where should I live

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and then five years later you're like fucking traffic

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and I can't pay my rent and then ten years later

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
you're like into the groove and you're not complaining

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
about that shit but you're complaining you're like

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
look at this fucking French gate

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Spanish house with this Japanese

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
roof

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
who put astroturf on a porch I paid too much

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
rent to have to live across the street

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
from that hodgepodge house

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
it's like settling in it's like

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
the Steve Martin observation

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
about how it's beautiful that everyone that

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
comes out here can be in their own world

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
that actually is

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
still a valid observation

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I think

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
but like there maybe

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm gonna sound like a really

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
jaded nasty

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
person but I'll just

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
if I choose my words

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
right everyone's gonna like me right

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
it almost

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
seems like what you're describing is like

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
you settle into kind of a

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
well I guess I live in LA

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
now in spite of the fact that I really

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
don't want to anymore

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
or you're like you're

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
kind of like well I guess this is where I live now

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
like and it's not because

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I'm like I got an audition on Thursday

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
that might like mean

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
my few like like LA is like

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
very much thrives on

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
this anticipation energy

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
but there's certainly not

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
enough anticipation to go around for the

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
however many millions

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
of people live in LA so

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
that many people do have to

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
provide us with the foundation of a society

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
which is for them to settle in and go like

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
well this neighborhood hasn't been the same

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
since they opened

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
that booby-boob you know

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
but most people are like

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I don't give a fuck

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I'll throw a stickers bar out the window

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I'm about to be Spielberg

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
it makes you feel that's why

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I always send a special shout out

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
to people from Los Angeles

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
because I'm like you guys have to put up with so many people

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
coming here and fucking this place up

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
it's amazing that they hang on to any authenticity

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and I think one of the ways that they do that

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
is by complaining about the shit that we build

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
because we missed Wisconsin

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
we missed Kansas so we're like

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I gotta build the fucking house out of wood

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
instead of building what they actually build without it

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
here so you see these neighborhoods that are like

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
ding dong ding all sorts of different shit

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and I think that's how we live

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
we live by complaining about the place

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
but loving it

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
well I wish they could put a

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I wish they could remember the love a little bit

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I think Los Angelinos love it

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
love hating

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
gaudy

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
houses

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I just want them to smile then

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
when you love something

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I think the locals

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
love it they're from here they don't leave

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
they don't kick us out

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
they don't make it too hard to transplant here

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I think it's

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I think it's us we get here and we're like

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
oh give me my shit

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and then LA is like

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and if you're lucky

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
you live here long enough to complain

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
about the pogoda

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
that just got built

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I mean I guess

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
but then okay I'll

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I'll

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
join in I'll process

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
myself I'll go

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
okay but Dan you're telling me that there's nothing

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
that your next door neighbor can do

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
to make you want

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
to raise a complaint

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
with some council or something

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
well I think probably not

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
ever never I mean I can't imagine that

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
but I will I mean

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
a thing that would make me

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
wish that they would do something

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
different I guess it would just be about the kind

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
of empirical

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
demonstrations of

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
squalor they're like like like so

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
while I while here I am sitting here

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
saying to people who have an opinion about

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
a

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
gray slab of concrete like

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
right that you have to steer around

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
when you drive past their house

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
because they wanted to make the most out of every

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
square inch of the property they

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
they they they're built on

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and I'm saying to those people have a complaint

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
about that hey relax

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
but well okay it's

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
worth noting that if you had an engine block

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
on your front lawn

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
well I probably would never come to

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
say anything about it except to

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Cody I would I would

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
every time I saw it I'd be like well you make it

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
look like we're unhappy

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
you know so I have I have aesthetic opinions

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
they're just lower class ones

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
band practice

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
those are the two words that would get you to speak

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
to your neighbor

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I don't know I mean I've sat

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
in my bed and there's been like

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
people playing music so loud

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
that I got neighbors

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
texting me yeah they're like

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
is that you know it's not

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I think that so-and-so I don't know who it is

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
it's loud over here too

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I Cody

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
while I wasn't there once

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
went over and talked to some people I think there's a near B&B

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
near my place Rob

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Cordry stayed there snitch

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
no he

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
he snitched

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
he was doing work at his house

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and he saw my Wi-Fi

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
at the Airbnb he was staying at

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
remember

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
how did he know it was yours

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
it's this Harmon Wi-Fi

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and I still

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
haven't changed it I still haven't changed it

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
you got to encrypt that shit

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
come on

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
my Wi-Fi you get what you deserve

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I hope

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
you I hope you access my camera

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
at just I hope you're in the

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
wrong place at the wrong time

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
choke on it

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
choke on me rubbing my nipple while I

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
grunt horrible

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
minotaur like

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
expressions under my breath

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I love it

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I don't know if I say anything while I

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
check it out

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
like I'm a Superman

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
can tell you

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Superman

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
if you were in a feud with Superman

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
like you could

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
the cool thing is that if you had like a

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
confrontation with him in public he could be like

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
you fucking cocksucker

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
you know I can hear you right

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
what are you talking about nerd

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
wanna kill your fucking family

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
my family's not on earth

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
everyone has a why are you talking to me

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000

wanna fucking

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
destroy your life

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I would love it if Lex Luthor

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
talk like that

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
why are you talking to me I don't even know you

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
stop it leave me alone

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
oh my god

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
get over yourself

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
once

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I've been watching a lot of DC

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
stuff

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
last couple weeks

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
there's a

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
there's a

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
there's a

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
there's an episode

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
it's a series of comic books and then they made a

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
direct to video movie out of it

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
now you've got my attention

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
DC

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
DC you think

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
well because he's paying attention he's like

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
oh you've been staying in bed for two weeks in your

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
pajamas and you're watching a lot of DC stuff

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
and you're chasing a deadline

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and you're not

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
but the

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
there's this

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
there's this series where Batman and

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Superman it's called Batman and Superman

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and it's about public enemies

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
you see that one

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
they made a direct to video movie

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
with it and

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Lex Luthor's president

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and it's not live action

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
who's playing Batman

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I don't know who's playing Batman and Superman

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
that's interesting to see all of the same guy

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
watching all the Lego and the Paldini and the whatever's

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
on the Frinnie Mini

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
sometimes it's Chris Parnell is playing Superman

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.440
It's funny, like recognizing voices and see how Tom Clancy,

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.800
Tom Clancy, Clancy Brown.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.080
Tom Clancy.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.360
You know, Tom Clancy.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.800
I have never not called Clancy Brown Tom Clancy

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.560
the first time.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.280
Clancy Brown is all this so consistently Lex Luthor.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.120
I really like his voice.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.800
We got Tom Clancy to be the voice of Superman.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.040
That's amazing.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.920
What does he sound like?

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.400
I've only read his voice.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.720
Do you think Tom Clancy is at all alive?

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.840
Has anyone ever seen him?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.480
Isn't he like Chef Boyardee?

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.680
There's no, how could he ever?

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.960
There's no fucking way Tom Clancy is anything but a

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.960
talking night vision scope on the mantle of a unicorn's dream.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.280
What would he be?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.640
He's more idea than person.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.200
I mean, he's like a heart and lung machine

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:20.800
like going like, what's the latest kind of assault rifle?

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.560
Are they like bringing video games by and going like, Tom,

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.760
it's another call of duty type thing,

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.720
but there's a zombie add-on pack and it's just,

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.960
it's still got your name on it.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.320
Give me that.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.080
Put my glasses on, Sophia.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.200
Yeah.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.800
Alone in a world he didn't create.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.280
What is this shoe leather?

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.000
Get rid of that.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.840
Get rid of that.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.960
Is this first person?

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.480
It's actually over the shoulder third person.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.600
Wrong answer.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.880
Goodbye, Clancy out.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:06.200
Add another Ion lithium cell to my space station.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.120
Tom Clancy's 240 years old if he's a day.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.120
Yeah.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.440
Or was he, when we were watching a hunt for red October,

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.200
was Tom Clancy like a greaser?

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.360
Was he like, hey, chickadees, hey, baby, relax.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.400
I'm 16, I'm wearing a leather jacket.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.800
I just wrote this hunt for red October, baby.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.080
Because otherwise he's 200 years old today.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:34.680
Right.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.200
Because that was a million years ago.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.800
It's the greatest impression of a 16 year old ever.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.480
Hey, we're going to go to lovers lane.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.840
Come on, it's all about so we locked.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.760
We locked Tom Clancy for the voice of Superman

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.760
and Mr. Warner Bros.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.440
I think you're going to like what we've done.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:00.320
We've watched the tape here comes super big.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.000
Is this a private party?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.520
Or can anyone join Luther?

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.960
You've gone mad.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:24.640
Do you really think the Justice League will bow to your campaign?

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.920
You need to get out of here, Superman.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.720
It's me, Anne Rice.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.880
This party doesn't need you.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.840
I'm Catwoman, Anne Rice.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.760
Anne Rice is Catwoman.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.520
Is she supposed to say her name?

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.160
Was I supposed to say my name?

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.160
No.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.160
No.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.160
I can see through your clothes.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.160
I've got vampire sight of Anne Rice, Catwoman.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
Oh, my God.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.160
She's combining her own mythology with the...

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.160
Stop looking at the camera when you're thinking

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.160
about saying stuff out loud.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.160
I can't go to Atlantis.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:09.160
Aquaman's depth filters out the radiation from the yellow sun.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.160
Sapping my strength.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.160
Hey, I'm Dean Arcoons, and I'm Aquaman.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.160
Dean Arcoons.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
I'm Dean Arcoons.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.160
I'm Aquaman.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.160
All right, everybody.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:26.160
Let's get into my Aquabush.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.160
And Dean Arcoons is going to take you all the way down.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
Everybody get on board, you know?

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.160
Why is everyone identifying themselves?

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.160
Okay, okay.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160
Let's just cut the chatter.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.160
I know I talked to fish.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.160
Let's get past that.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.160
That joke hasn't been funny for 30 years.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.160
All right, everybody get on the bus.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160
We're going down.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160
Which way?

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160
Where are we going, Supes?

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
I hope up.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.160
So I can gather strength.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.160
All right.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.160
We can only go to the surface of the water, though.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.160
This isn't a flying Aquabus.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.160
We can't go anywhere we want to.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:13.160
It's me, Frozone, played by Alex Haley of Roots fame.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.160
Frozone?

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160
It's a crossover.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.160
From an incredible...

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.160
From a Blacksploitation G.I. Joe?

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.160
What's Frozone?

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160
Who's Frozone?

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160
Incredibles.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160
From the Incredibles.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160
Incredibles.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160
He said it's Frozone?

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.160
We had a toy tie-in, so they asked me to stop by.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.160
This is my super suit.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160
His name's Frozone?

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.160
Frozone.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160
That's kind of cool.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160
Frozone.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.160
I should watch that movie.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.160
Actually, I saw the first Incredibles.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.160
Did everybody suffer this effect when the Incredibles 2 came out?

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.160
Didn't you think it was Incredibles 3?

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.160
Because the Incredibles was so long ago, but also to their credit, it was so...

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.160
It hit the spot.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.160
It felt like you had...

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:06.160
You're like, I must have been two Incredibles movies because it's been long enough to be a third one.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160
They referenced it.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.160
If I was a person working... Oh, they did?

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.160
They referenced the amount of time it took.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.160
If you worked on the Incredibles, I didn't see the second one, but...

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160
Loved it.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:28.160
But I wanted to let you know that my reaction to your advertising was good job on the first movie.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:35.160
So get that gun out of your mouth, you little 3D modeler.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.160
You're in a cubicle on a sun ray.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:46.160
That thing's going to slowly move up like the handicapped lady in the Gremlins chair.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.160
Take you all the way upstairs to a Gremlin-free retirement.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.160
So let's show that clip.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.160
We don't have it?

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160
We don't have it.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:06.160
George R.R. Martin as the Flash.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.160
I have formed a perimeter around the bank.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.160
Okay, so there's a Flash TV series, right?

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160
Yes.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.160
Right.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
Okay.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160
Are there...

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.160
It's already canceled after 10 seasons.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.160
It premiered yesterday.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.160
It's such a fast show.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.160
For the dads out there.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.160
I want to know this, and I know I've never watched the show.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:40.160
Are there any episodes where it doesn't end with him not running fast?

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160
Oh.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.160
Because if there are, why am I tuning in?

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160
You know?

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.160
I mean, seriously, okay, like, okay, well, at the end of the episode, shit, how are we

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160
going to get that?

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160
We're going to run fast.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160
Like, na na na na na.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160
I mean, like, really?

01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.160
I mean, like, is there any episodes like, you know, I'm not going to run fast this week.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.160
I'm just going to use my detective mind to figure out who stole the jewels and all the

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:09.160
cops are like, yeah, maybe just maybe run fast.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.160
Like, we'll tell you, we'll tell you the clues and you can, like, cover more ground.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.160
Yeah, you're not, you're not really here because, because you're a really good detective.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160
You're here because you run fast.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.160
But why don't you, why don't you run fast and leave the drive into us?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.160
Okay, you know, why don't you run fast?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.160
I mean, what do they do the third episode?

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.160
Do we have, do we have any hardcore flash fans?

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.160
Like, like, like, like it's like your jam.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.160
Oh, good.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160
It's that section.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160
Is it the, are you?

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160
No one.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.160
Yeah, I love that this audience was like, no, you're not, man.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:48.160
Knowing that this is a temple in which honesty is rewarded above all, are you Tiger Man?

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160
Okay.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.160
Do you want to come up and talk about the flash?

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160
Okay.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.160
We won't pick on you.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.160
Because also you could have been Tiger Man.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160
That was my point.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.160
Like, like we don't, we don't judge anybody here.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.160
So you know, you know a lot about, you want to come up and share your love of the flash.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160
Well, you could also stay right there.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.160
Oh, that'd be great too.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.160
It was just a fucking passing impulse.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.160
I mean, it's not the price, right?

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:25.160
If you're waiting for him to ask a fourth time, if you come up on stage, it might not happen.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160
Okay.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:31.160
Oh, there you go.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.160
For a fan of the flash, you are walking pretty slow.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:43.160
Well, that might be, that's, Superman was created by the two, like, like, like Jewish kids that

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160
are like, what'd you say to Brandon?

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.160
What'd you say to Brandon?

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160
Brandon left.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160
Brandon just left.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.160
What'd you say to Brandon?

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160
What's your name?

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.160
Jacob.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.160
Jacob?

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.160
Yeah.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.160
Do your friends call you Jocko?

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160
Is that what you said, Jocko first?

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.160
Eat that, eat that mic as a rule.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160
Jocko is my last name.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Oh, wait, your name's Jacob Jocko?

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.160
Jocko, yeah.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160
Oh, Jacob Jocko?

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.160
Yeah.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.160
Okay.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.160
Well, sorry, we, I guess we doxed you.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.160
I guess the kid's calling that.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.160
We can edit your full name out if you want.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160
That's easy.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160
I don't mind, it's fine.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.160
All right.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.160
People will find you on Facebook and you'll, your life will be ruined.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160
Okay.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.160
You having a donut with an Oreo on it?

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160
Somebody gave those to us as a gift.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.160
Thank you, whoever gave us the donuts.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.160
Thank you.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:39.160
Jacob, give us some background.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.160
If you look a little young, can you tell us how old you are?

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.160
Otherwise, I won't ask.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.160
I'm 36.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.160
Okay.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.160
Well, you're taking good care of yourself.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.160
I gave up a little while ago.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160
Yeah.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.160
I never ask people I think are over 30 how old they are.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.160
So I thought you were like 12.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160
Fantastic.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160
You have as many donuts as you want.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.160
I would keep going, yeah.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.160
So you live in LA?

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.160
Yeah, I live in Venice Beach.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160
Okay.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.160
What's the, do you drink alcohol?

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160
All the time.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160
Great.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.160
Do you want some?

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.160
I just wanted to make sure that you did because there's alcohol.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.160
Okay.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.160
When does your relationship with the flash start?

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:30.160
I read comic books my whole life, but I watched even the old 90s series of the flash, but

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.160
I've watched a new one too.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.160
Was there a TV series in the 90s that was the flash?

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160
Yeah.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.160
I vaguely remember it as a kid.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160
Mark Hamill was on it.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.160
Was it like CWB?

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.160
What was it?

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.160
It was right after like the first Tim Burton Batman.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
Wait, what?

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160
What did you say?

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160
It was right after the first like Tim Burton Batman.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160
It was like 1990.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160
Yeah.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.160
I think I vaguely remember that.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.160
Yeah.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.160
It was David Duchovny, right?

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160
Is the flash?

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160
I don't think it was David Duchovny.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160
It just didn't work.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:04.160
He just has this like natural kind of, I don't want to say he's sluggish, but people don't

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.160
admire him for his speed.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160
Yeah, it's not quite him.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.160
You slow down on that donut, man.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160
You got a lot of work to do.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160
You got a lot of work to do, bro.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160
You can put it down, man.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.160
Don't let him flash shame you, man.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.160
Maybe you eat your donuts fast.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.160
But yeah, just take us into your...

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160
So here's my thing with the flash.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:30.160
You were mentioning him and you were asking about his cop work.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.160
He's a CSI agent.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160
He's a CSI agent.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.160
Yeah, so he does like the background work and he's more than just fast.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160
So he doesn't need the superpower.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160
It's just a bonus.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160
No, no.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.160
I would imagine...

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:49.160
I would imagine it's pretty valuable as a CSI agent to get...

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.160
Yeah, it's just a bonus.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.160
Best superhero ever.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.160
Oh my God.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160
He's a really good detective.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.160
He contributed to society before he had the flash powers and then he was flashed.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.160
It was great.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:09.160
Is the CSI agent gig, is that like the equivalent of Clark Kent's Daily Planet gig?

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.160
That's his alter ego?

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.160
Yeah, basically.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.160
Is that Barry Allen?

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.160
Is that his name?

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.160
Barry Allen, yeah.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.160
And so when he's fighting crime, he's not.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160
He's like, okay, does he...

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.160
This is the thing about the flash that I don't understand because it's sort of like if there

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:34.160
was a character named the breather and he was like, I breathe, I get more oxygen per...

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.160
There's a so what question of it.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.160
It's kind of like he's moving...

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.160
He's going to move faster than regular narrative.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:45.160
So if he's fighting the kingpin, the kingpin is going to be like, I'm going to rob that

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.160
bank and then the flash is like, I heard you're going to rob...

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.160
Anyways, what does he do?

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.160
What does the flash do?

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.160
Does he punch people?

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.160
Yeah, mostly at the end of episodes, he'll punch people sometimes.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.160
Faster than they can block it, which is just punching down.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.160
Eat that mic a little bit.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.160
How... me?

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.160
No, you always...

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:15.160
How does being fast make him a better detective other than catching somebody that's running

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.160
away?

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.160
Other than that, I mean, like, does he find clues faster?

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.160
Does he clean up his desk quicker?

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.160
It's mostly all camera, but I think he's running the test faster, maybe.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160
Tests.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160
What tests?

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160
He has to take tests?

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160
Blood tests.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
Blood tests with a mixing motion.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.160
He does that faster than a human being.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160
Yeah, you gotta...

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160
He's titrating really fast and...

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160
All right.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160
But that's all.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160
That's like Clark Kent maybe types faster when no one's looking.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.160
But that's him when he goes to work.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160
Right.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.160
The flash doesn't fight crime by swabbing anything, I assume.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.160
Otherwise, he wouldn't wear that outfit.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.160
He would just wear a lab coat and be fast.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.160
He gets in that outfit when something requires it.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160
Right.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:07.160
And so he's out there and he's gonna run fast, and by running fast, he's saving the day from

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160
villains.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.160
Right.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160
By catching them.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.160
Catching them, hitting them with lightning.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.160
He has lightning powers?

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.160
If he runs in a circle fast enough, he can shoot lightning at people.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.160
And he does that all the time.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160
Every third episode, at least.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.160
Why not every episode?

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.160
I mean, you should be using that to open the door.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.160
You would think, but no, he kind of saves it.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160
That's his budgetary reason.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.160
That's his blazing sword.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160
Does he punch and kick a lot?

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:46.160
Because it seems like you could say, I mean, Jackie Chan's efficacy is a lot of training,

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.160
but also like, oh my god, he's so fast.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160
Right.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
So here we have the fastest guy in the world.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.160
So like, even if he's not Jackie Chan, which would actually be kind of funny if he wasn't.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:01.160
That would be amazing if he was just like, kind of like, and but he's just so fast.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160
He gets like nine attacks in before.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160
That's actually more like what he does.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.160
He's not very effective, but he throws them out a lot.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.160
Okay.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160
Okay.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.160
Let me ask you this.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.160
Okay.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.160
So he can run fast.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.160
He could move his legs really fast.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160
And he can move his arms fast.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.160
He can move his fingers fast.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.160
And he could probably blink fast, right?

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160
He could read fast.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160
He could read fast.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.160
Okay.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160
So he can mentally.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160
So his brain is faster.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160
Right.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160
Brain is faster.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160
So is his heart beating faster?

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160
Is his blood going faster?

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160
I mean, here's where I'm getting at.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160
Does he digest food faster?

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.160
There's some people who write him like that where he needs to eat more food, but.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.160
So he's like, I just, I have to shit.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.160
I just, I just ate a Cheerio and now I got poop.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160
That would make sense.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160
Yeah.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.160
He must be shitting a lot.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.160
Which is, was there an issue about that?

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160
I haven't read that one yet.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.160
It's interesting that you say some people write him that way.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.160
Right.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.160
Are there other things like that?

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.160
Are there things that don't exist in certain writers flash version?

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.160
All comic books.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160
Sorry.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.160
This is the podcast for Dan Harmon interrupting people and go ahead, Jacob.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:16.160
Apparently I'm the expert on the flash, but yeah, I think different writers take different liberties with him.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.160
I remember, yeah, kid flash jumped out there and he got shot in the knee one episode.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.160
And then the next issue, he was in the library for the whole time and learned a bunch of stuff.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160
He wasn't.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160
He, he didn't.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.160
So he can't heal fast.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160
That too.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.160
That was just one issue that he was out with the knee.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:38.160
I think it's really important to know whether or not he thinks faster because I want to know if Martian mindhunter,

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:44.160
manhunter, he hunts more minds than men usually.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.160
So to be fair, but whose name makes sense in the DC universe?

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:54.160
But if Martian manhunter was reading Flash's mind, maybe that would be a fun thing where he's like,

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.160
well, I can't fucking understand a goddamn thing he's thinking because it's like,

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.160
it's like listening to a squirrel.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.160
I think you might have just broke something there.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.160
That's something that hasn't been done.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.160
I think it's like flat.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:15.160
It'd be fun to think about the dialogue that way because they always treat the Flash like he's either a cut up or he's an idiot.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:22.160
Like he's sort of like the, like the, they treat him like in the current like DC film universe.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.160
Like he's kind of like the combination of like the Troy community.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.160
I'm referencing classics.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.160
So then we have a benchmark.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160
I'm a big fan.

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.160
Like he's like, he's the every man kind of thing.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.160
Or he's just like, well, here's how dope that was kind of thing.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.160
He's like, he's the youngster down, honestly.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.160
Where he's like, I just want to be part of the team.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160
Right.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.160
I'm a really good detective.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.160
I'm a really good detective.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.160
I mean, we got Batman here.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.160
So I don't know who's the world's greatest detective.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.160
So, but he don't run fast.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.160
So it evens out.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.160
But I think the most interesting thing in the world because, oh, I mean, I did.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160
Yeah.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.160
Cause it was like every, like every line of dialogue for the flash.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.160
If you were just to like run through the exercise of like, all right, I've got,

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:08.160
I'm going to take three hours to edit this and write it and all this stuff.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.160
And that he, like, you know, knowing that he has the power to do that,

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.160
how does shit come out?

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.160
And like the end result of that when you look through the comic book and you're like,

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.160
it might, it would probably manifest itself as he would be very stoic.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.160
And which would make him, it would be like, oh, I get it.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:31.160
He talks very infrequently and he only says like a couple of things.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:36.160
And, and so they're doing this contrast thing.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:42.160
But then every once in a while he'd have like this full dialogue balloon because it took him exactly three hours to like,

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.160
he's like, I'm just fucking sending this.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.160
Like, like, you know, you like edited it as much as he could, but it was like,

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.160
he got triggered so much that he had that.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:54.160
And it's like, you, without warning this guy who usually talks like Groot, like,

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160
like all of a sudden it's like, well, the thing is you've been,

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:01.160
it's twice about that. There's 70% income.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.160
You should be more considerate of people.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.160
And you're just like, what the fuck?

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.160
Does he listen?

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.160
Does he?

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.160
Does he listen faster?

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.160
Like if he heard himself, does he mature?

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.160
Does he, does he, does he get woke faster?

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:25.160
Was he like, did he realize he had been fucking women up like,

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:28.160
like, like in 2016?

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.160
He got out ahead of it.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.160
Is he constantly shaving?

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.160
I mean, like, is, I mean, like,

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.160
He's growing faster, huh?

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.160
Well, if he does everything faster.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:43.160
Does his favorite color look like a Nintendo power-up?

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:48.160
Oh, no.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:53.160
Yeah, I didn't, I mean, I rift Nintendo power-up.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160
That's what you're sensing.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.160
What do you mean?

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.160
What does that mean, Dan?

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.160
Fake it till you make it?

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.160
I was trying to imagine like a, like a 16-bit thing where like the color is cycling,

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.160
but, you know, cause his favorite, his favorite color keeps changing.

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.160
It's between like red and yellow, gold.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160
You don't know those are his favorite colors.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.160
What if he, what if he's like Batman and he's like,

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.160
this will strike fear in my enemies, red and gold.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:23.160
It'll strike fear in slow things.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:27.160
It'll go away from me and I'll go the opposite way.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.160
I am most interested in his metabolism.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.160
Didn't they talk about that a little bit when Ben Affleck went to his...

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.160
Yeah, they did a little bit in the New Justice League,

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.160
but yeah, they talked a little bit about,

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.160
but they've changed him now into a person that's actually creating,

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.160
he's, oh, he's not actually fast because that raises too many questions.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.160
Probably it's easier to say that he travels through a fucking, excuse me,

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.160
a conduit of lightning.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.160
Yeah, my favorite rendition of him is he accesses the speed force

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:02.160
with another dimension and gives him all sorts of access to slowing down reality

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160
for the way he proceeds.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.160
I kind of like that idea that he's,

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:15.160
of him as a walking inception pop-up during a battle,

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.160
that he's going to do what he's going to do.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.160
And the key to using the flash right is to give him explicit instructions

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.160
because you're not going to have another chance.

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.160
And it's better to use him like,

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:34.160
if you don't have a really good plan for him, you should just tell him like,

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.160
when in doubt, stop everyone from being hurt or something like that

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.160
and that you're checking back in with him in a way that's like,

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.160
how it would look from the perspective of like plant life or something.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:52.160
He's behind the scenes making all sorts of moves and we're all just,

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.160
oh, you're here, you're doing your thing.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.160
Jacob, why do you know so much about the flash?

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.160
I've been reading comic books since I don't know, I was 10 years old.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.160
Yeah, eat that mic, Jacob.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.160
He's been reading, I've been reading comic books since I was like 10 years old.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.160
And brothers and sisters?

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.160
Yeah, I have an older sister. She lives here in Los Angeles.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:17.160
On an emotional level, on a personal level, is there a connection to the flash

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:21.160
that's like, you're like, okay, so just an example,

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:26.160
like the day it was like Tony Stark was like,

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.160
here's my kryptonite, I love booze.

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:36.160
I was like, sold, like, how can you get better than this person?

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.160
It was there like a flash thing.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.160
A moment for me with flash?

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.160
Well, for me, the flash moment for me was when Kid Flash got shot in the knee

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.160
and he said, who am I?

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.160
I think I'll go to the library.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.160
Yeah, he went to the library and he said, I'm going to read some things.

01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.160
I'm going to be better, a better person.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.160
And then I thought, you know, it was more than just the powers.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.160
He got shot in the knee.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.160
He was a baby flash and he was already fast.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.160
Yeah, so actually this wasn't even Barry Allen.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.160
This was his grandson or whatever.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.160
And he gets shot in the knee by Deathstroke in an issue.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.160
Oh, because Deathstroke can't, even the flash,

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.160
even a baby flash he can't miss.

01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.160
He figured it out.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.160
He timed him out and he shot him in the knee, took him out, sent to the library.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.160
Congratulations, Mrs. Deathstroke, Deathstroke's mom.

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.160
You must be very proud.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.160
He shot baby flash in the knee.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.160
He is officially, yes, good job.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.160
All right, I'm thinking of Deadshot.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.160
That's the guy who's always bragging about how he never misses.

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.160
You said Deathstroke.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160
Deathstroke.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.160
He's different from Deadshot.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.160
Deathstroke is just like, it looks like Deadpool and he just strokes to death.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.160
Yeah.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160
All right, sorry, I didn't mean to derail you.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:02.160
That's probably my favorite flash moment, but Captain America's always been like that.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.160
Wait, so is it because baby flash having been shot in the knee was like,

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.160
well, I'm still fast, I'm going to go to the library and get like a PhD?

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160
Yeah, it was more about self-examination.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.160
How do I grow as a person?

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.160
I'm not a good superhero.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:17.160
I let down my whole team and I'm shot in the knee.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:20.160
I can't run fast anymore, so what am I worth?

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.160
He went and explored himself and he came back and, you know, he made a difference.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.160
Did he like learn any new talents?

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.160
He learned all sorts of chemistry and bio.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160
I don't know.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.160
I don't know exactly what he was.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.160
Was he learning faster?

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.160
Yeah, he was learning way faster.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.160
He read the library.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160
He had a PhD by the end of it, you know.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160
Who's fast?

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.160
Who's faster?

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160
Who's faster?

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160
Okay.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.160
Okay.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.160
Flash is Superman.

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.160
Go.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160
Flash, no doubt.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.160
Flash is Superman.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.160
No doubt.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160
Who swims faster?

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.160
Flash or Aquaman?

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.160
Spins faster.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.160
Swims faster.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.160
Swims faster.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.160
Oh.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.160
But who does?

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:00.160
What?

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.160
Spam faster.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:08.160
I'll go with the flash in any scenario, space, water, air, anywhere.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.160
Flash is the fastest.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.160
How come Superman and the Flash are always having races and they're like neck and neck?

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.160
I think Flash is just, you know, trying to throw him a bone.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160
Really?

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.160
He seems so uptight about it.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.160
The Flash?

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.160
Yeah, he doesn't seem like he's throwing anyone a bone.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.160
Of the two of them, who's more uptight?

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160
Superman or Flash?

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.160
Flash is having fun.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.160
I don't think, I think Superman wishes he was slower.

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.160
I don't think Superman is the kind of guy that's like, I should race you.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.160
I think that's why he enjoys racing the Flash.

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.160
He's like, oh, this is one time I can let loose.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.160
It's one time I might lose.

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.160
And I'm gonna lose.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.160
Which says a lot about Superman.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.160
And that's okay.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.160
That he, yeah, he's coming in low.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.160
He wants to lose.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.160
So that flies in the face of the theory that Flash is throwing Superman a bone.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.160
Maybe we're both right and wrong.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.160
I get it.

01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.160
I get it now.

01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.160
I'm sorry.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.160
So Superman is the provocateur because he's so masochistic.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:06.160
He's like, hey, you want to race?

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160
I hope I lose.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.160
I hope I lose.

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.160
Oh, Superman.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.160
So dark.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160
I think so.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.160
I think that's like the most forgiving rating of Superman, but yeah.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.160
Has the Flash.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160
Okay.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:23.160
So the Flash, I know he can run across water because he's so fast.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.160
Yeah.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.160
So can Superman.

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160
They often race around the world.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.160
Right.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160
Okay.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:33.160
So, so, so, so my question is, and I think you've already answered it.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.160
Has the Flash ran across the ocean?

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.160
Yeah.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.160
He's run all across the whole planet many times.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160
Yeah.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.160
He'll do it.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160
He won't even get on a plane.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160
He's like, I'd rather run across the ocean.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160
Yeah.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160
I'm not even going to put on the suit.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160
Right.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160
Does he put that on that?

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160
Because also no one's going to go.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160
Does he what?

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.160
Barry Allen is the Flash.

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.160
This changes everything.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160
Yeah.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.160
Catch me.

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.160
Fuck your head.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.160
Oh my God.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.160
That's Arthur Curry.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160
Yeah.

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160
Try to catch him.

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.160
I'm carrying him.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.160
Alex Haley is Frozone.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:15.960
The Flash is running across the ocean and Aquaman is trying to, let's say the Riddler

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.160
is in the water.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.160
Okay.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:23.760
And he's drowning because Wonder Woman's ropes are around him and so the Riddler is

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.660
saying, honestly, I'm drowning.

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.160
I swear to God.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.040
I have no reason to lie to you, I'm drowning.

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.400
And so Aquaman's heading towards the Riddler, so is the Flash.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:44.040
Is it possible that the Flash would kick Aquaman in the face and if he did would he

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.040
fall?

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040
Kill him.

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.040
Kill him.

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.040
Kill him because it's like a bullet.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.040
Well, he's the king of Atlantis.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.040
You could probably shoot Aquaman in the face with a gun.

01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.040
With the Flash?

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.040
With those hips?

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.040
Oh yeah.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.040
I don't know why not.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040
Did you shoot Aquaman in the face?

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:01.680
I think the Flash could kill Aquaman in pretty much any scenario.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:07.440
I don't know how y'all feel about that, but I give the Flash KO in that scenario for

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.440
sure.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.360
What I was going to say is if the Flash is running across water and he steps on anything

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:22.280
other than water, be it Aquaman's face in this case, would he trip and then he would

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.960
fall in the water, right?

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.960
Yeah.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.960
Okay.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960
Good because I'm just working on the script tonight.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:39.200
I just wanted to run this scene by you and ridiculous.

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.360
So you said the Flash could move the fastest in space.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:49.120
Yeah, he's been in space and how did dude wait the Flash could run in space?

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.200
It's all about it's all about the speed force.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:58.680
The speed force is an interdimensional force that allows him to access speed in any dimension.

01:39:58.680 --> 01:39:59.680
Oh, cool.

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.040
That's not, thank you for taking that.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.480
That's not a very nice way to respond to an answer to a question you asked.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.960
He wanted the answer, yeah.

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960
It doesn't have to make sense.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.760
He does answer me a lot.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.760
He's like, oh, tell me what you know, do you really, really care?

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.760
Tell me what you're doing.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:26.920
And he'll go like, nerd, wow, okay, so he can run in space.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.200
He can run on water.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:38.280
He can run on space, but he's not running, he's going to interdimensional, what's it?

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.240
Wait, how can he get, how does speed force make it so that he can move through space?

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.240
Speed force.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240
Isn't it the need?

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.400
I assumed that that, I have to say, when I heard speed force, I immediately pictured

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:57.760
this whole fucking subset of comic books about all the people that hang out with the flash,

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:06.120
and I was like, I will fully ignore, I didn't want to hear a goddamn thing about it.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:15.800
Well, there's, laser foot and, Shortcuts 12 has red hair and pigtails.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.600
Get back here, Shortcut.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:25.560
But wait, is speed force, does it refer, I assumed like a task force, no, it's like

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.560
a force of nature.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.560
Yeah, it's a force of nature.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.560
Oh, okay, okay.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.320
It's like a dimension that he accesses to do his thing.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.040
And there are people there, there's Jesse Quick, and all sorts of folks, Jesse, I knew

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:39.040
it.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.040
I knew it, I knew there was a speed force, Jesse Quick.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.320
I mean, they're not going to stop printing these comic books.

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.840
They're not going to, they're not going to be like, well, maybe no one will want to read

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840
this one.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.640
They're going to keep doing it until it, until it's fucking, until it's dry as a

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640
ball.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.200
How did he become the flash?

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.280
He spills some chemicals on himself, they got struck by lightning, it's bullshit.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:06.240
He's, wait, wait, wait, I mean, it's true, it's lazy, but it is true, but it's so lazy.

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.320
He spills some chemicals.

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320
What were they?

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.320
Janitorial supplies.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.280
You can find them in any home hit by lightning by lightning, yeah, but on the same day that

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.280
he spills something.

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.240
If you want to get, like, really into the flash lore, he is the lightning bolt that struck

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:26.280
himself and he gave himself his powers, it gets really complicated, yeah.

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280
What?

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280
Yeah.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:38.240
Oh, because of the infinite crisis, did Brainiac make Power Girl into a fucking storm cloud

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.400
after Earth 2 was...

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.080
You made fun, but you know too much.

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:48.560
I'm getting too much from Wikipedia, I'm like, just tell me who fucking Black Canary

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560
is.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.920
Like, any of the first paragraph of every single one of these fucking people is like,

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.000
this is the name of several characters, I'm like, no it's not, just tell me who the fuck

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
she is.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.480
What, has she got a knife in her boot?

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.440
Probably, but I'm not the one to help you with her.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.720
Yeah, well, she sings in people's faces and stuff, she sings.

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:17.480
Superman and Batman, Public Enemies, here's a new segment, here's a new segment, Dan Harmon

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:23.480
problematizes the things that don't need to be problematized.

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:34.480
Sometimes you gotta problematize.

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.320
Superman, oh man, we're done, I fucking did it, okay.

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.720
Superman and Batman, Lex Luthor's president in this Public Enemies thing, and Superman

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:43.880
and Batman are like...

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.520
They have to move in together.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:51.000
I can't remember the circumstance, but they're like, it's like, oh, Superman goes for a meeting

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
with...

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.480
There's a comet coming towards Earth, it's Kryptonite comet, yeah.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.800
And Superman goes to have a meeting with Lex Luthor, and Batman's like, don't go to that

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.080
meeting, and whatever, you know, fast forward.

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:08.280
So it turns out, Batman and Superman are like buddy cops who are framed for trying to get

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.880
trying to kill President Luthor, and they're like on the lamb together.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:22.400
And Lex Luthor puts a bounty on their heads, so all of the DC villains are trying to kill

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.280
Superman and Batman, and one of them is Banshee.

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:36.440
You guys know Banshee, she comes flying out of the woods, and goes, and Superman's like

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:45.680
the fuck, fuck, and he just takes her up into space, and she passes out, and he flies her

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:55.560
down, and he says to Batman, these guys don't hang out that much, but Superman says to Batman,

01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:04.520
she'll be out for a while, but do you have anything for her screaming?

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:12.800
And Batman responds like he's been asked for Advil, he's like, yeah, and he puts a disc

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:20.320
on her throat and says, this hypersonic electromagnetic thing will conduct her scream power and make

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.840
it hurt her, make her screams hurt her more than they hurt other people.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.080
Batman, why is that in your pocket?

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.920
Superman, why does your first move to fly them up to the exact height where they fall

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.920
unconscious?

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.000
Why are the two of you so fucking simpatico?

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.560
There was barely any conversation, it was like fuck it, it was like a fuck, she comes

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:49.240
out of the woods, and Superman's just like, who the fuck, who the fuck, all I know is

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.440
this bitch won't fuck you, try screaming without air, takes him down to his vigilante

01:45:54.440 --> 01:46:00.000
friend and goes, look, here's what I know, she'll be out for a while, Superman's done

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
this a thousand times.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.560
Hey, Bats, I just invented a new way to killing people.

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.520
I'm not gonna mouth.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:16.800
I could grab him by the lapels and go up to space where there's no air and he implodes

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.720
and then I just drop him the fuck down, why does he do that like that?

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.920
Superman does it so many times in that series that I watch regular Superman stuff and I'm

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:33.440
like, well, you got them, and whenever he throws someone, I'm like, why'd you throw

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.560
him, do your fucking moves?

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.360
You got, I would never stop mashing that A button, that is, take him to space, see

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.360
how they like that.

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:51.240
That is so fucking dark, like he went, oh, I never thought of that before, there's a

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:57.320
bank robbery, I got this, I ready everybody put your gun in the air, I'm gonna blow your

01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:03.600
fucking head up, excuse me, going up, what are you, oh my god, no.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.320
How about this, hey, Martian manhunter, scan for all the people that are thinking they

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:20.240
might want to rob a bank, hey, Flash, quickly learn to forge a contest entry for people

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.600
who all get to rob a bank, like if you start just like, he just like gathers people in

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.200
buses and like full of people who are thinking about robbing a bank, I just like soaring

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.720
them into space and they're like, ugh, ugh, and they just like take them down, like there's

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.360
just like filling stadiums full of buses, full of people who might fucking have the

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360
wrong thoughts.

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.520
He's like, why am I making this so hard for myself, making them empty, Superman, emptying

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.640
their guns while, while they're shooting at my chest, I could just grab the fuckers and

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640
go up to space.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:57.120
I mean, you're an alien, you can't die, use it or lose it, you're not gonna fit in while

01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.120
you're helping people, no one likes people saving them, everyone needs it, stop fitting

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:09.640
in, save us, Christ, like just fucking like, shoot, like kill everyone, that's bad, and

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:15.040
tell us how to be, we'll wear red capes, he just, I'm sure he does it in like some Joker

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.040
version.

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.680
He's like, son, it's a great story about Superman being a Russian fuck, he's like a

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.680
Russian, it's going.

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:27.840
All right, well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.760
Jacob, how was that doughnut, bro?

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.760
It was delicious.

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.960
So they got you a napkin, I put it down.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.840
You can have it now and you can finish it, you, you earned it.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.800
So I think it's next, next week we'll talk, we'll talk true crime with some, with some

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.040
wonderful British imports, I really think you're gonna love them.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.080
The red handles.

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.720
The red hand podcast, uh, you think you're sick of true crime, but, uh, you know, like

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.640
I, I, they're, they're, they're really, uh, kind of graceful and crisp about it in a

01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:01.000
way that makes me like happy, but I still listen to every single true crime podcast.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.720
Yeah, you don't have to pretend you're interested.

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.400
Hey, what, what I would say is check out deadly class, you might enjoy it.

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.400
Deadly class?

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.480
Yeah, it's a, it's a new TV show, Russo Brothers produced it, great comic book writer wrote

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480
it.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480
You might enjoy it.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.480
What is it?

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480
What's the deadly class?

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.480
What is it all about?

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.560
Deadly class is, it's about a group of assassins who, uh, are, are kids who are being trained

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:28.800
to be assassins as children and it's good.

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.800
You'll, you'll enjoy it.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.800
What is it?

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.800
What medium?

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.800
It's TV, it's on sci-fi.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.800
Okay.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.800
Yep.

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.800
There's still a sci-fi?

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.800
Sci-fi network.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.800
I know the last thing they did was.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.800
How do they spell it now?

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:49.280
Like PSI dash to upside down threes shaped like a mouse, it's like half food shows.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.520
It's bad, but it's the only good thing they got going.

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.760
That is the, uh, that's the slogan for the network.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:01.360
It's bad, but, but check it out.

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.720
Well, how can you have branding now?

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:08.000
Like everybody's kind of like, uh, like, I, I, that's the networks are panicking because

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.080
they're like, well, what if you spent 20 years like figuring out, well, you know, how to make

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.520
people understand what, what, what you mean when you say FX and now FX is a guy to look

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.400
forward to a world where they're like, how are we going to make, how are we going to

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:29.680
sell ourselves on Netflix, which is just like Walmarting the fucking, uh, world vid escape

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.560
coined it, uh, interesting, interesting.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:44.360
People have to save that for the next step, but so international women's mom, please find

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.360
a charity.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.040
We always do one, but find a charity that supports the women in your neighborhood or around the

01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040
world.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.040
