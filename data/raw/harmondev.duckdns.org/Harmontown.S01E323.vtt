Yeah, I'm going to tell you, like, that's J.K.\n\n03:43.880 --> 03:48.640\nRollins and I'll even be the first to say, like, maybe you haven't even read Harry Potter\n\n03:48.640 --> 03:51.760\nand that happens and you're kind of like, there's a little blurry line, but I will\n\n03:51.760 --> 03:56.840\nsay the people that usually come up to me because I'm not like, you know, if you recognize\n\n03:56.840 --> 04:05.120\nmy face in a bar, probably means that you're kind of deep in and it's usually a very pleasant\n\n04:05.120 --> 04:11.400\nexperience and sometimes it's a little socially awkward. I think I could name two times, including\n\n04:11.400 --> 04:16.800\nnow this last time, this is two in like 10 years, where I've been like, well, that guy\n\n04:16.800 --> 04:23.120\nis kind of evil and a dick, but both times, I don't think the person didn't really know\n\n04:23.120 --> 04:29.680\nme that. And I've done that too. I remember in Milwaukee, we were famous for, one of our\n\n04:29.680 --> 04:35.800\nexports was a band called the Bodines. What was their big famous song?\n\n04:35.800 --> 04:43.600\nOh, I'm looking for a runaway. Or is it going to take my heart away for me? I'm going to\n\n04:43.600 --> 04:52.560\nget the runaway. I'm a Bodine. Yeah. And I was at my, the drawing room of Milwaukee,\n\n04:52.560 --> 05:01.760\nwhich was called the Uptowner and a very fancy place. And it wasn't, there was a guy drinking\n\n05:01.760 --> 05:06.640\nat the end of the bar and a friend of mine said, that's so and so from the Bodines. And\n\n05:06.640 --> 05:13.520\nthey gave me a name and I went up to them. My mom loved that song. I'm looking for a\n\n05:13.520 --> 05:19.520\nhideaway, going to get a runaway. And I lived in Milwaukee. I was 19 years old. I shouldn't\n\n05:19.520 --> 05:24.400\nhave been at a bar, but and I was like, I went up and I said, like Jimmy or Jody or\n\n05:24.400 --> 05:31.480\nGigi or whatever the name was, my mom's a big fan of your band. Could I get an autograph\n\n05:31.480 --> 05:35.800\nand he signed some shit that I looked at later. And it was basically like, Oh, fuck yourself\n\n05:35.800 --> 05:40.120\nor something like, like, like not, not, not like aggressive, but it was sort of like whatever\n\n05:40.120 --> 05:43.160\nI had said to him, it was, you know, it was kind of clear that he was like, here's what\n\n05:43.160 --> 05:48.800\nyou get for not knowing who I am, what my song is and telling me your mom likes me,\n\n05:48.800 --> 05:53.480\nlike here's your fucking, you know, worthless thing for sure. You're not walking out of\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:58.080\nhere with anything worth anything. Yeah. And I remember that still because I'm embarrassed\n\n05:58.080 --> 06:06.040\nthat I did that. But like, do I I mean, therefore I guess I should say not but I I don't I don't\n\n06:06.040 --> 06:12.240\njudge anybody whoever like kind of maybe has like a moment where they're like, Oh my God,\n\n06:12.240 --> 06:17.720\nlike it's you. It's like such a flattering thing, obviously. And and if they then like\n\n06:17.720 --> 06:21.800\nhave spit come out of their mouth or they or they or they do the mental equivalent, which\n\n06:21.800 --> 06:26.760\nis like they try to nag me, you know, like there's some people that do that. They're\n\n06:26.760 --> 06:31.440\nlike, people think sometimes if they're rude to celebrities, it'll be cool. I mean, so\n\n06:31.440 --> 06:35.720\nI feel like I hopefully have just claimed that enough to say like, this is not me going\n\n06:35.720 --> 06:44.120\nlike I met the biggest douchebag and here's blow by blow, everything he did wrong. But\n\n06:44.120 --> 06:51.480\nit I mean, it is that but it's like it's not that is not. It's just to I still I if this\n\n06:51.480 --> 06:55.160\nguy was listening, I would want him to know and I at the point of the stories, there's\n\n06:55.160 --> 06:59.680\nno way this guy's listening. But the I would also want to know you did nothing wrong. You\n\n06:59.680 --> 07:04.240\ndon't have to you could erase this from your head. It is not on your karma. There's so\n\n07:04.240 --> 07:11.400\nyou were at a bar and somebody came up to you and started talking to you. I'm just trying\n\n07:11.400 --> 07:21.480\nto find. So that was the setup. Okay, I'm trying to figure out what to type so I can\n\n07:21.480 --> 07:33.440\nfind it. I'm never going to find it. Are you? Are you? No, Schrab, do you have any advice\n\n07:33.440 --> 07:43.680\nfor people who come up to celebrities? Do I have any advice? No, no, not really. I mean,\n\n07:43.680 --> 07:47.560\nI think we just told the we told the company story last time, right? Yeah, we told that\n\n07:47.560 --> 07:52.240\nsorry. I mean, I think we were we were having we were having a pretty good time. That was\n\n07:52.240 --> 07:58.160\na pretty historical night for me at least. Yeah, I met red buttons Tony. Oh, no, you\n\n07:58.160 --> 08:00.720\nthought you're thinking of Hasselhoff. That's the Hasselhoff story. We've also told that\n\n08:00.720 --> 08:07.600\na couple times. Yeah. What's the finish to this story? The company story. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\n08:07.600 --> 08:11.720\nWe told that here. Yeah, we told it here. Yeah. Okay. What about the finish to this\n\n08:11.720 --> 08:16.360\nstory? Okay, all right, all right, all right. Okay, you're not getting out of this. You're\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:20.320\nnot getting out of this one. All right, so I'm going from memory because it was like\n\n08:20.320 --> 08:25.720\nin my mind it's like a it's like a flow chart where every time this guy has a chance to like\n\n08:25.720 --> 08:34.360\ngo left but he drills down. Okay, so I'm sitting at this billiard hall in Burbank where I write\n\n08:34.360 --> 08:41.640\nmost of Rick and Morty and I like there's this it's a sometimes inexplicably in Burbank\n\n08:41.640 --> 08:45.160\nthere's this like, I don't know if it's like billiard leagues or something like the place\n\n08:45.160 --> 08:51.640\nis packed. And I'm like typing and then as a guy comes up and I see him peripherally\n\n08:51.640 --> 08:59.720\nand he's kind of like he's he's he's bobbin and weaving and he's like captivated. And\n\n08:59.720 --> 09:06.840\nthen he he walks away for a second and he comes back and he goes, excuse me, has anybody\n\n09:06.840 --> 09:16.960\never told you you look exactly like Justin Roiland? And I think I think I've gotten that\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:23.360\none before like like as a as a bit now now now zoom in on my flow chart where you go.\n\n09:23.360 --> 09:29.600\nOkay, like this could be this could be a great guy, right? That could be a funny bit, right?\n\n09:29.600 --> 09:36.720\nOf course. Um, it actually didn't even occur to me that it did not occur to me. I assumed\n\n09:36.720 --> 09:44.960\nautomatically. I was like, I was like, okay, what he means is a big fan of your your who\n\n09:44.960 --> 09:50.800\nyou are. And not that I would mind if he doomed to not recognize me and confuse me with someone\n\n09:50.800 --> 09:54.480\nelse. That would be fine too. But it didn't occur to me. I just assume I processed it like\n\n09:54.480 --> 09:58.880\nhe's doing a bit. He doesn't he doesn't want to he doesn't want to be regular, right? He wants\n\n09:58.880 --> 10:04.080\nto do it. He wants to be he wants to be fun. And and I could just laugh it down. I can go, ha, ha, ha.\n\n10:06.160 --> 10:14.160\nAnd and I go, yeah, I get that a lot. So that's me. Yes, Andy. Him. I get that a lot.\n\n10:14.160 --> 10:21.680\nAnd then and then and then he goes, whoa, whoa, uh, wait, God damn it. See, the thing is I needed\n\n10:21.680 --> 10:26.080\nmy fucking notes because it's like he did so many things wrong, so many things. And they were all\n\n10:26.080 --> 10:32.800\nlike one after another for the first one. But I can't I skip if I could skip to easily because\n\n10:32.800 --> 10:39.440\nhe just I mean, I should I should bail on the whole thing. Can we can we just try one more time?\n\n10:39.440 --> 10:43.280\nAll right. Well, that's just because he's a great part. Let me let me think about it. Just like,\n\n10:43.280 --> 10:48.240\ndon't don't drop. Give us advice. Help me with my phobia of uncomfortable pauses. We got you\n\n10:48.240 --> 10:51.440\nshop. Let me advice and take off your shirt.\n\n10:55.040 --> 11:02.080\nCold. Okay, okay. Yes, he's a genius. Trab is a genius. That's good. That's good. Okay, so he said\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:07.040\nyou just arrived and I said, yeah, I get that a lot, which had just occurred to me. And I remember\n\n11:07.040 --> 11:14.000\nlike, well, yes, that's yes, ending the joke. But it's also if it's technically in a technical\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:23.360\nnarrative, it's saying, I'm not who you think I am. Yes. So he reacted as if that were the case and\n\n11:23.360 --> 11:30.000\nand just went like, okay, and walked away. But he like did like a two foot lap like around like an\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:36.000\ninvisible sunflower that he was pollinating. That was just like his own self loathing or something\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:41.520\nor like the ghost of his dad, I don't know. And then like, and then he came back and he like,\n\n11:41.520 --> 11:51.120\nhe was like, no, no, it is you. It's you. I do I'd know you anywhere. And I was like, yeah,\n\n11:51.120 --> 11:56.080\nyeah, yeah, hey, how are you doing? And he's like, dude, Justin, what are you doing here?\n\n11:56.080 --> 12:02.480\nOh, shit. And I was like, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I work here. I work or work\n\n12:02.480 --> 12:07.920\naround the back and and he and he goes, he goes, he goes, well, I don't know that.\n\n12:10.080 --> 12:14.960\nI'm not some sycophantic fucking ass kiss fan. I don't like worship your fucking life and know\n\n12:14.960 --> 12:18.960\nevery goddamn detail of it. And I was like, that's cool. You don't have to.\n\n12:20.560 --> 12:26.240\nDid you, but it is Los Angeles. And what am I, what am I doing here?\n\n12:26.240 --> 12:30.880\nI thought you would, I thought you would shake him down in Justin's voice.\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:38.880\nAnyways, but, but, but, but why didn't you just say, I'm not Justin, you're wrong about that\n\n12:38.880 --> 12:45.120\nshit too, bitch. No, no, that's not fair. You don't, you don't have to say no, big, you're\n\n12:45.120 --> 12:50.640\nputting I am not because, because I also, I didn't, but he shit on you. Once he shit on you,\n\n12:50.640 --> 12:54.160\ncan't you be like, motherfucker, you don't even know who you talking to. No, because, well,\n\n12:54.160 --> 12:59.600\nwait a minute. I'm going to be right about this. You're going to see because, because yeah, he\n\n12:59.600 --> 13:06.160\nshit on me. I'm thinking what I'm thinking at this point is he, he's, he's going to be embarrassed\n\n13:06.160 --> 13:10.400\nat some point and I could keep him from embarrassment. You know, it's like, like a parsley in your\n\n13:10.400 --> 13:15.200\nteeth, but it's like, if someone with parsley in their teeth was like biting you, like he's,\n\n13:15.200 --> 13:20.800\nhe's, he's already being a bad person. So I was like, well, good, I can't wait for you to get the\n\n13:20.800 --> 13:29.040\nselfie, tag it and feel like a terrible piece of shit. Just enough. Like it's fine. And then every,\n\n13:29.040 --> 13:34.640\nall justice is done. And, and then, and so he, there were some other things he, god damn it,\n\n13:34.640 --> 13:39.200\nI swear they were like 90 fucking things. And I was like, really that decision, that choice,\n\n13:39.200 --> 13:43.680\nthat's amazing. Like, like, like you, like the flow chart just has these clear, like the, you\n\n13:43.680 --> 13:46.960\nknow, like the thing goes, this is like two of them, you know, one that like,\n\n13:46.960 --> 13:53.200\nyou actually kept it going after he was being aggressive. I didn't keep shit going. I'm a\n\n13:53.200 --> 13:58.160\ndude sitting at a bar. Did you shut it down? Did you shut something down? You, that, that's you\n\n13:58.160 --> 14:02.400\nbeing like, I kind of respect that you were like in for the bit so you could fuck him up with this\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:07.440\nselfie. That is some game master type shit. I will always yes, and you I'm never going to be like,\n\n14:07.440 --> 14:14.160\nexcuse me, I'm eating. Like, like, if I, that means like my mom died or like you have a hockey\n\n14:14.160 --> 14:18.800\nmask on, I don't know. Like, like, I'm never going to be like, I don't consider that fair to like\n\n14:18.800 --> 14:24.880\nturn me into the, you know, like to put that on me that I have to become the person that, that,\n\n14:24.880 --> 14:30.080\nthat radiates negativity because you decided to pee in the pool. You know, like, I'm just like,\n\n14:30.960 --> 14:36.240\nbest I could do is be like, I'm swimming in pee now. So I love it. So after he was like going,\n\n14:36.240 --> 14:42.400\nI'm not some kind of sick fan. You went, you just went, okay. I was like, yeah, that's fine.\n\n14:42.400 --> 14:47.520\nYeah, that's what you would do to it. You know, and you and I are not good people. We're passive\n\n14:47.520 --> 14:52.960\naggressive. We're from Wisconsin. You know, I've seen you interact with a million terrible people,\n\n14:52.960 --> 14:58.080\nand you always do the exact same thing. The shittier they get, the more you're like, okay, yeah,\n\n14:58.080 --> 15:02.240\nall right. Yeah. And then you'll throw in something like, like, if they're giving you a note on your\n\n15:02.240 --> 15:06.160\ncomic book, you'll go like, okay, yeah, well, I'm probably going to keep doing whatever the fuck\n\n15:06.160 --> 15:10.960\nI wanted to do. But it was nice talking to you, you know, like that's, but I don't have anything\n\n15:10.960 --> 15:18.080\nto say in this situation because he's not telling me how to do the voices better. Okay. So, so keep\n\n15:18.080 --> 15:24.400\ndoing whatever the fuck you want to do. What? Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.\n\n15:25.920 --> 15:28.160\nI get it. Game record math game.\n\n15:28.160 --> 15:38.400\nAll right. What is that? What is that? Is that a candle? It's a hot signature.\n\n15:39.440 --> 15:44.560\nThat's a hot signature. All right. Let me just let me just like teleport to the end and we'll bring\n\n15:44.560 --> 15:52.640\nour guests out. It's a hot signature. I got the thing that blew my mind is he goes like, hey,\n\n15:52.640 --> 15:58.240\nlet me get it. Like, can I get a selfie with you? And I was like, yeah, no problem. And I took the\n\n15:58.240 --> 16:03.920\nselfie with it. Then it's not a selfie. I guess it is. I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n\n16:03.920 --> 16:09.680\nI shouldn't be doing it. And then and then he and then he walked away and my Mike, Mike Waldron\n\n16:09.680 --> 16:13.360\nand I were sitting there, we're working on Rick and Morty and I was like, and we he was marveling\n\n16:13.360 --> 16:17.440\nat the whole thing and we were comparing notes and it was like, he was like, well, how often and\n\n16:17.440 --> 16:26.560\nit was like not not like that. No. And he's like, so he's gonna he's gonna go post it, tag it. And\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:32.800\nif I know, if I know our fan base, like he's gonna know in five seconds that he should kill\n\n16:32.800 --> 16:41.440\nhimself and die by fire and all this stuff. What happened? But the crazy thing is that the guy,\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:46.640\nthe guy absolutely like it was a selfie on the way out, like he was there for stuff. And then he\n\n16:46.640 --> 16:50.800\nwas like, one last thing. Can I get a picture? That was the thing like he waited until the end\n\n16:50.800 --> 16:55.120\nbecause why wouldn't you and then he and then he and then he and so then he left and it was like,\n\n16:55.120 --> 16:59.120\nwe really thought I was like, I was like, and so that the epilogue of that story will be forever\n\n16:59.120 --> 17:06.720\nunseen. And and then and then and then but then five minutes later, he came back and he was like,\n\n17:06.720 --> 17:18.400\ndude, Dan, I just wanted to congratulate you on out trolling me on that joke I was doing,\n\n17:19.120 --> 17:26.800\nwhere I pretended to think you were Justin and you fucking just stuck it out. And I didn't\n\n17:26.800 --> 17:31.200\nthink you'd do that. But that was, you know, congratulations. That was amazing, you know,\n\n17:31.200 --> 17:36.800\nbut whatever. I knew who you were the whole time. Yeah, well, guess what? Amateur hour.\n\n17:38.400 --> 17:43.920\nFucking with a real comedian and you're walking up with your whack ass basement bargain joke.\n\n17:43.920 --> 17:49.120\nIt was cute until you got aggressive. But now that you've met the real Dan Harmon and\n\n17:49.120 --> 17:55.840\nfucked up in front of them, leave. But you know, you know, he was gonna just come over and say,\n\n17:55.840 --> 18:02.160\ncan I buy you a drink, motherfucker? But you know, he wasn't he wasn't because I read through this\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:08.880\na thousand times. Like he he was he was he was he was revising he came back. Yeah,\n\n18:08.880 --> 18:14.720\nto salvage completely needless like salvage. It's like you didn't have anything to salvage\n\n18:14.720 --> 18:20.000\never. Like, like, what are you? You're like that. I was the one blower. But in whose eyes was like,\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:24.640\nOh, remember that guy. Hey, remember me like this. I'm not gonna remember. I'm gonna get I'm\n\n18:24.640 --> 18:27.280\nnot even gonna remember the details of the story while I'm shit talking you.\n\n18:29.680 --> 18:30.880\nDamn, dude, I'm blowing up.\n\n18:33.440 --> 18:34.080\nShit, it's him.\n\n18:36.720 --> 18:40.320\nHer during real time, Justin didn't like what you said.\n\n18:41.760 --> 18:47.120\nAnd it was it was it was a bad it was I will forever regret this because I was I was like I\n\n18:47.120 --> 18:50.720\nknew it. It's been like three weeks. I was like, Oh, you never told that story. I would have had\n\n18:50.720 --> 18:56.000\nlike some I would have had the whole thing in my head. It was it's bad podcasting. But that's why\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:03.840\nyou're here. I mean, otherwise, you're just you're you're you're you're you're you're experimenting.\n\n19:03.840 --> 19:08.240\nI guess you're walking around downtown and you're like, let's go to a podcast we don't know is bad\n\n19:08.240 --> 19:13.120\nyet. Let's see if it's bad. If those people I feel bad for the rest of you, you're getting what you\n\n19:13.120 --> 19:21.120\npaid for, you know that. But sometimes we also have guests come on. This one is no exception.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:32.560\nJust gets better and better. Really, really. That was a fun like kind of alt comedy intro.\n\n19:32.560 --> 19:37.520\nYeah, I wrote a new dry alt comedy kind of like way of introducing people.\n\n19:37.520 --> 19:47.200\nI just I this is one of those one of those one of those shows that I've been hearing about forever.\n\n19:47.200 --> 19:50.400\nThat's always like you should watch this. It's really funny. I could see from the ads. It probably\n\n19:50.400 --> 19:56.560\nwas never did just dove into it. I fully admittedly because he was coming to the to the show. I'm so\n\n19:56.560 --> 20:01.040\nimpressed with his stuff. Can't wait to talk to him about it and other stuff because there's a lot\n\n20:01.040 --> 20:05.200\nof stuff he's able to talk about and he ruins it all. Please welcome Adam Conover from Adam ruins\n\n20:05.200 --> 20:24.640\neverything. So nice to be here. What do they call a person that is it a polydact? Is that a word?\n\n20:25.680 --> 20:32.560\nYeah, a person who's got more than one hand. Oh, no, I think it's a person who knows more than\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:38.400\none thing. Is that is that will that be polydact? I think so. I think so. Polymath, polymath.\n\n20:38.400 --> 20:44.640\nI think it might be polymath. Anyways. Yeah, I thank you. This has been great.\n\n20:46.160 --> 20:50.720\nI watched like five episodes of your show today. Thank you. Popped around multiple seasons and\n\n20:50.720 --> 20:56.960\nstuff. I was really, really impressed now. And we'll get the plug in out of the way is that\n\n20:56.960 --> 21:02.560\nit's a it may be an ill timed plug, but like there's stuff coming up in July. Was that it?\n\n21:02.560 --> 21:08.080\nYeah, yeah, we've got new episodes. We got new episodes up in July. We are on Netflix now,\n\n21:08.080 --> 21:11.760\nwhich is very exciting. And we also have new episodes coming out at the end of March on\n\n21:11.760 --> 21:16.800\nNetflix. They're not new, but they're new to Netflix. So but it's weird because people who\n\n21:16.800 --> 21:21.200\njust have Netflix are like behind everybody else, but they don't even know that there's\n\n21:21.200 --> 21:25.120\nmore episodes of the show to watch. It's a very strange state of affairs. That's cool because\n\n21:25.120 --> 21:31.360\nyeah, that satisfaction of when that Netflix seal opens and you know, you're going to get like\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:39.120\n0.03 cents more. Is that what happens? We have not we have not gotten a like a residuals round\n\n21:39.120 --> 21:44.000\non it yet. I don't know how that Netflix doesn't do back end. If you didn't get any money the day\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:48.800\nNetflix came into your life, then you're never going to see any. No, it means they just they\n\n21:48.800 --> 21:53.760\njust came in your window and took your dresser. It's a weird they're like what you wanted people\n\n21:53.760 --> 22:01.520\nto see you. Yeah, it's really weird. The state of affairs of being like a modern creative person\n\n22:01.520 --> 22:08.160\nis like just hoping that a platform bestows its unearned like sea of eyeballs on you in like a\n\n22:08.160 --> 22:14.080\nwindfall and then hoping to God it doesn't go away for no reason later that you don't get\n\n22:14.080 --> 22:19.440\nfucked by some algorithm tweak that they made to try to stop anti-vaxxers or something. Suddenly\n\n22:19.440 --> 22:25.680\nno one's watching you now. It's bizarre. What's the what's the viewership like on true TV? What\n\n22:25.680 --> 22:32.560\nkind of world are you mired in? Are they are they are they are they are you mired or are you more\n\n22:32.560 --> 22:39.040\nin a quagmire and are you I just mean like do you get emails that are like well 0.7 last night\n\n22:39.040 --> 22:44.880\nnot as good as we hoped but is it still that world in basic cable or yeah I mean it's I don't\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:50.720\nknow the you know I sort of don't find out the week to week you know I get told hey the premiere\n\n22:50.720 --> 22:56.000\nwas good and then I get told later on you know oh we did you know you did okay or it was flat or\n\n22:56.000 --> 23:03.040\nwhatever but I mean the numbers are crazy like we heard last year that like oh well you know we\n\n23:03.040 --> 23:08.400\nyou know the numbers were other it was flat your ratings didn't go up from year two to year three\n\n23:08.400 --> 23:13.200\nright and I say oh it's a little disappointing and then I found out later that the ratings for\n\n23:13.200 --> 23:19.600\nall of cable television had dropped 10% in one year so we were flat we went up yeah like we're\n\n23:19.600 --> 23:24.000\nwe're beating everybody else it's like I keep telling me people about my weight I'm 46 years old\n\n23:25.360 --> 23:31.040\nif I get a little bit fatter that means I'm like fucking like ripped like I'm like I'm like\n\n23:31.040 --> 23:36.400\nactively not acroding like I'm not exploding you know anyways but but that was the same as like\n\n23:36.400 --> 23:42.160\nlike when I was at NBC it was like but except the worst part was like they didn't that at least you\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:49.360\ncould well you said you found out later but like it was it was years of Venice sinking and being\n\n23:49.360 --> 23:53.680\nmeasured as sinking but everyone just kept blaming the shows like yeah like how can you\n\n23:53.680 --> 24:00.000\nblame all of the shows for all shows failing in ratings like if the office is also failing\n\n24:00.720 --> 24:06.240\nby the same amount you have to take that part off of yelling at me now now they're starting I\n\n24:06.240 --> 24:10.720\nam totally with that and now they're they're starting to get it and you I have conversations\n\n24:10.720 --> 24:16.080\nwith TV executives more where they say like yeah you know we gotta we gotta get on some new platforms\n\n24:16.080 --> 24:22.480\nI mean cable television just is not doing well I'm like you're a cable executive where are you\n\n24:22.480 --> 24:28.400\ngonna go no it's cool I just found out my company's buying an oil company uh next week like I pretty\n\n24:28.400 --> 24:34.400\nsoon we're gonna be Time Warner Mobile um they're they're trying to start you know Turner's starting\n\n24:34.400 --> 24:41.120\na streaming service sometime hopefully before LA collapses into the ocean and I think that's\n\n24:41.120 --> 24:45.280\ntheir next big thing but we're doing what I mean look we have true TV is a great audience\n\n24:45.280 --> 24:49.920\nyou know in practical jokers is on our network and that's the best thing ever because in practical\n\n24:49.920 --> 24:55.760\njokers if you guys have seen the show wonderful show wonderful prank show they run it like 23\n\n24:55.760 --> 25:01.120\nand a half hours a day it's just true TV is on demand in practical jokers and it's one of the\n\n25:01.120 --> 25:05.440\nmost popular shows on cable right and then people who are just sitting there watching practical\n\n25:05.440 --> 25:09.840\njokers and after a while my show comes on and they go oh what's this hey I like that too and so\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:16.000\nthat's good for me we always have the best lead in on the network no matter what happens and yours\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:20.240\nisn't yours isn't constantly being run because that's another factor yeah they do right they\n\n25:20.240 --> 25:24.400\nwe do pretty good in reruns too they give us you know they'll do two hour blocks throughout the year\n\n25:24.400 --> 25:28.640\nand stuff like that I'll say adult swim they don't they don't either maybe this is privileged maybe\n\n25:28.640 --> 25:34.960\nbecause we're a gigantic hit you're welcome yeah I don't think it is because I mean we were I mean\n\n25:34.960 --> 25:43.360\nadult swim never they I haven't heard a goddamn decimal number since I left NBC really I adult\n\n25:43.360 --> 25:47.680\nswims well they're making their money a thousand ways they've got it you know like you're you're\n\n25:47.680 --> 25:53.360\non lunch boxes yeah not lunch boxes but they run their programming like yeah just on this big round\n\n25:53.360 --> 26:01.200\nclock a big round clock um Harmon explains television uh but and then and then and this how would you\n\n26:01.200 --> 26:05.920\neven be able to yell at anybody like oh it looks like you're taking a dip it's like what what what\n\n26:05.920 --> 26:12.320\ndip like maybe maybe yeah maybe you've accidentally adequately captured the appeal of the show maybe\n\n26:12.320 --> 26:17.200\n80 people want to watch it at 9 a.m. yeah and then another 10 people want to watch it an hour later\n\n26:17.200 --> 26:23.440\num but anyways but uh I just well so that that's that's us ruining television maybe\n\n26:23.440 --> 26:30.000\nruining a cable but um I'm very happy to be surviving in the it's so it's there's it everything\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:33.840\nis exploding right now in a million ways and everything's being disrupted so it's I'm very\n\n26:33.840 --> 26:38.480\nhappy to just be surviving at all it's a great it's a great show I did that that's the that's the\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:45.360\nthat's the important news is that creatively and I biggest compliment uh I I have is that I was so\n\n26:45.360 --> 26:51.360\nI had so much shit to do today I I I'm in I'm in big trouble I'm like I'm like really really\n\n26:51.360 --> 26:55.440\nbehind on a draft and I wasn't using you to procrastinate because I really did want to\n\n26:55.440 --> 27:01.200\nfinish my fucking draft but I knew I had to watch at least an episode of your show thank you and I\n\n27:01.200 --> 27:07.120\nand I did and then I watched five and I had to peel myself away I was really I really thank you\n\n27:07.120 --> 27:13.040\nlike it I I I let's figure out later if this was a good or a bad idea how many people in the\n\n27:13.040 --> 27:19.200\naudience by applause have seen this show oh my gosh that's pretty nice I mean I that's a good way\n\n27:19.200 --> 27:24.480\nand if there's anybody if you're focusing on the negative space that means potential yeah that's\n\n27:24.480 --> 27:28.080\nnow there now we're now we're marketing and then yeah those other people are like well what are\n\n27:28.080 --> 27:34.240\nthe clapping people know I don't know uh I want to be a clapping person one one one reason why\n\n27:34.240 --> 27:40.880\nmaybe people I to use my eye statements like I think a reason I didn't I didn't flock to it\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:48.240\nis I live in fear of my own cynicism and stuff I struggle so hard to stay positive yeah even\n\n27:48.240 --> 27:55.520\nhumanity and stuff and uh I remember I think the dark kind of clubfooted cousin of your show is\n\n27:55.520 --> 28:03.040\nPenn and Teller's bullshit on Showtime yeah I I have a I love that show when it came out and uh\n\n28:03.040 --> 28:06.960\nbut there were certain things that that there's certain things totally that that show did that\n\n28:06.960 --> 28:11.920\nI knew that I wanted to do something a little bit different from um but I love I'm a huge fan of\n\n28:11.920 --> 28:16.960\nPenn and Teller um and uh and what those guys do their show in Vegas is incredible if you've\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:22.080\nyou've never seen it um just a little myth busters in there as well in oh and myth busters in terms\n\n28:22.080 --> 28:27.440\nof influence on on our show uh a little bit except we're not we never do experiments and things\n\n28:27.440 --> 28:34.240\nlike that I'm like not handy at all you know like there's no like live demos um but uh yeah a little\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:39.360\nbit you know but I do think I think that the the incredible exception that made a difference which\n\n28:39.360 --> 28:43.760\nis immediately apparent from the pilot and then it's there in every show I mean one of the things\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:50.160\nis that tonally there is just a clear difference in that it's like comedy versus tragedy kind of\n\n28:50.160 --> 28:56.880\nthing like it's like at the end of the day either your show believes the viewer should kill themself\n\n28:56.880 --> 29:04.800\nor not um and and your show like it has this it it has this heart to it in fact it's inviting\n\n29:04.800 --> 29:10.880\npeople up to skepticism and yeah set us as if it's not implying that uh if you didn't already know\n\n29:10.880 --> 29:18.960\nthis you it's because you're dumb and um and and also like um now that you know this you know that\n\n29:18.960 --> 29:24.400\nlife means less yeah it's the opposite I mean the the one of the modos of the show is that my\n\n29:24.400 --> 29:28.880\ncharacter has and that I have personally is it's always better to know that I don't believe that\n\n29:28.880 --> 29:32.720\nthere's any you know there's any virtue and ignorance whatsoever and that you're always\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:37.920\nbetter knowing the truth and the reason is because that makes you more powerful and capable and\n\n29:38.640 --> 29:44.800\nyou know more able in the world um and so we want to make a show that that shows that um but I'm not\n\n29:44.800 --> 29:50.320\na negative or cynical person by nature um and so it was important to us to have that positive\n\n29:50.320 --> 29:54.480\nthing at the end although I think it was actually on the pilot I think it was the best network\n\n29:54.480 --> 29:58.480\nnote I've ever gotten where they were like you need something positive at the end like the four oh\n\n29:58.480 --> 30:03.840\nman we're a four we're a four act show and they were like the fourth act should be just an uplifting\n\n30:03.840 --> 30:08.560\nmessage of some kind you know um and that's the best on paper that sounds like the it's a\n\n30:08.560 --> 30:13.920\nprototypical terrible studio yeah exactly like oh come on I gotta find a positive spin every time\n\n30:13.920 --> 30:21.680\nright can they can can can can the can can I I was gonna try to riff the name of like a character\n\n30:21.680 --> 30:25.840\nthat's like a guy you love to hate I was like can Rick can Rick from Rick and Morty can he be good\n\n30:25.840 --> 30:30.480\nat his job yeah I was like yeah no exactly it's not a dog that he loves just to show us that you\n\n30:30.480 --> 30:38.400\nknow yeah it sounds too polyanna but in this case what was the hardest uh positive fourth act piece\n\n30:38.400 --> 30:43.600\nlike what was the hardest one you think you did that or are they all like oh it's actually\n\n30:43.600 --> 30:47.760\nthere's always something positive on well there's somewhere the ones that work the best are where\n\n30:47.760 --> 30:52.240\nthere's a specific thing that people can do where it's like now that you know this instead of doing\n\n30:52.240 --> 30:55.440\nthe bad thing that you were doing before here's the good thing that you can do you know instead of\n\n30:55.440 --> 31:00.800\nlike giving you know instead of buying Tom shoes in our pilot you can give money to people directly\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:05.520\nand that's much better for them right um the hard ones are where it's like really diffuse like what\n\n31:05.520 --> 31:11.360\nthe solution is um like our climate change episodes are the most difficult ones and we did\n\n31:11.360 --> 31:17.840\nthis whole episode where about climate change um that uh was very important to me we did it in uh\n\n31:18.480 --> 31:25.200\n2016 and the big takeaway at the end and this was like literally me go that a lot of times\n\n31:25.200 --> 31:30.640\nI'm working through it myself you know um like I I was literally wrestling with what the fuck\n\n31:30.640 --> 31:36.240\nare we gonna do about climate change no one is making any progress um how do I think about this\n\n31:36.240 --> 31:41.600\nbecause it seems really dire and we talked to this um climate thinker and philosopher Dale\n\n31:41.600 --> 31:46.000\nJameson who made the point that like look it's not when people talk about climate change and they\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.880\nsay the end of the world is coming if we don't do this the world is gonna end that's always false\n\n31:50.880 --> 31:55.680\nright um you can always make a choice today to make a better tomorrow no matter how things no\n\n31:55.680 --> 31:59.760\nmatter how bad things are gonna get you're never off the hook right um because there's no there's\n\n31:59.760 --> 32:04.080\nno such thing as the apocalypse right because there'll always be people who are living um and\n\n32:04.080 --> 32:08.080\nhe said the best reason to be positive is because of the Paris agreement because every country came\n\n32:08.080 --> 32:13.120\ntogether and it just happened every country came together and made this agreement and so we did an\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:17.200\nepisode where we talked about that you know that that was the fourth act thank god for the Paris\n\n32:17.200 --> 32:22.720\nagreement because this is the best sign we've ever had and then and then and then between\n\n32:22.720 --> 32:30.480\nshooting and airing was november 2016 um and uh we had to release a we released a little bumper\n\n32:30.480 --> 32:36.560\nat the end which was like okay so the Paris agreement is uh uh we're kind of worried about\n\n32:36.560 --> 32:44.240\nit now and um you should like phone call somebody call get one of those apps and um and call it\n\n32:44.240 --> 32:53.920\ncongressperson fuck you know um you got a little bobcat there oh shit yeah i become bobcat gold\n\n32:53.920 --> 33:04.560\nwait in my darker moments the uh the what the episode that really uh i i've done a five i watched\n\n33:04.560 --> 33:09.600\nbut i i saw obviously when the title of the episode is different i'm like okay i'm zooming in on that\n\n33:09.600 --> 33:15.520\nand uh there's this character emily in the show who's your oft antagonist slash whatever play by\n\n33:15.520 --> 33:21.760\nemily ruining everything for her and she she wrote with you on the original college humor series he\n\n33:21.760 --> 33:27.520\nsaid yeah yeah um and uh plays herself i put you know her her name's emily she's not playing herself\n\n33:28.960 --> 33:34.400\nshe's playing a bro it's a based on her loosely yeah but that she's um you know she she gets these\n\n33:34.400 --> 33:42.000\nepisodes where she gets to ruin you yeah and um which is a combination of a corrections segment\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:47.680\nyeah which your character is excited about which i was really impressed by i thought it was such\n\n33:47.680 --> 33:53.680\ngreat meta storytelling like i that i love i'm really impressed with the amount of character\n\n33:53.680 --> 33:58.480\nthat you're doing in a show that's just like a true tv like hey it's me this is my name and\n\n33:58.480 --> 34:04.080\nhere's the thing i'm going to ruin it's like you have arcs and and each episode has a story to it\n\n34:04.080 --> 34:09.760\nit like there's and this is so cathartic for someone to finally because nobody points out this\n\n34:09.760 --> 34:13.760\npart of the show to me very rarely does someone say oh i like the story arcs you know and we\n\n34:13.760 --> 34:19.520\nput so much work into that part of the show i truly believe that that everyone notices it\n\n34:19.520 --> 34:23.840\nenjoys it but they don't in the back of their minds yeah because they're uh they're inferior\n\n34:23.840 --> 34:32.800\nnon-elites um they don't have our galaxy hollywood they haven't earned the the conscious pleasure\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:41.200\nbut they're allowed the unconscious they feel it deep down in their animal brain stems it's the\n\n34:41.200 --> 34:47.440\nit's the scars on my back that are shaped like joseph cambell circles that the wounds\n\n34:48.480 --> 34:54.000\nallow his work to seep in at every level for you you'll think oh i like this show\n\n34:55.840 --> 34:56.800\ni know why\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:10.080\nbut uh it really i truly it really i i i here's the thing like i it for a non-fiction show to\n\n35:10.080 --> 35:14.960\nlike i'm like it was like it was a little it reminded me a doctor who kind of like like\n\n35:17.120 --> 35:22.640\nbecause there's a consistency to your character and you have a companion yeah and she was like\n\n35:22.640 --> 35:27.520\nit's my turn to fuck with you which is like first of all here's all the shit that people have\n\n35:27.520 --> 35:32.960\ncorrected us on that we did in the past and but here's the really impressive thing to me as a\n\n35:32.960 --> 35:41.040\nmaster storyteller in the first act of that story adam is like oh goody i love being ruined\n\n35:41.040 --> 35:44.800\nbecause it's like the adam's family right like like hey what if you ruined a ruin or will\n\n35:44.800 --> 35:49.440\nthe ruin or would love it he loves ruination oh good more ruining and i was like well that's\n\n35:49.440 --> 35:54.000\nprobably gonna just be the thing right she's gonna get increasingly frustrated but then there's this\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:59.360\nthreshold that's crossed where they they get they get through the corrections and they start talking\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:04.240\nabout this thing called the backfire effect which is a thing you may have heard about probably since\n\n36:04.240 --> 36:11.920\nthe election um uh or maybe i mean maybe but not by that name but this idea that um uh when we uh\n\n36:11.920 --> 36:17.840\nwhen we're when we're emotionally connected to something that we believe um uh unlike with\n\n36:17.840 --> 36:23.040\nsomething else like if i said what's that you're eating and you go slim gyms and i go you know\n\n36:23.040 --> 36:28.640\nit's better is slim gyms ultra if you don't care you're probably gonna be like i'll try those yeah\n\n36:28.640 --> 36:33.360\nyeah um you love those conversations like what are you listening to the pixies that you should\n\n36:33.360 --> 36:38.960\nlisten to the pokes okay uh do they both have pee in them okay i wish we had used these actouts on\n\n36:38.960 --> 36:44.080\nthe show these would have been a great demonstration i wish the backfire effect happens when you tell\n\n36:44.080 --> 36:52.000\nsomebody as the obvious example is who'd you vote for oh natalie portman well she rapes children\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:57.920\num you should and she pollutes the rivers and um you didn't know that and so you should vote for\n\n36:57.920 --> 37:02.880\nbernie uh i'm trying to change the name so that we don't play so you're gonna change bernie sanderson\n\n37:04.560 --> 37:09.280\nnatalie portman and bernie sanderson i'm not good at names\n\n37:13.120 --> 37:16.560\neverybody in your shows are is named who they were named i just tried to imagine\n\n37:16.560 --> 37:23.520\nsomeone's like no queen she was good as queen amadala is that her okay thank you um but they\n\n37:23.520 --> 37:29.120\nthey it actually not only is there a deflector shield yeah actually studies have shown that if\n\n37:29.120 --> 37:34.960\nyou just lob a kind of like you're wrong about everything the earth is actually round at a flat\n\n37:34.960 --> 37:41.040\nearth or if or if they're a flat earth that has linked their fucking sexuality or their their\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:45.280\nheart to flat earth which how else would you be a flat and it can be even more powerful than that\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:49.840\nmy favorite example that i've ever heard is like imagine shon hanity right if shon hanity woke up\n\n37:49.840 --> 37:54.320\ntomorrow and read a study that convinced him climate change was real and we had to do everything to\n\n37:54.320 --> 38:00.640\nstop it now right his whole life is based around the opposite his career is his family his relationships\n\n38:00.640 --> 38:05.200\nto his friends are you know if he was like no no i think climate change is real he'd become a pariah\n\n38:05.200 --> 38:09.520\namong everybody he knew it's not just his emotional identity it's his social identity it's everything\n\n38:09.520 --> 38:15.440\nhe is as a person so there's no way for him right your money yeah i forget heart and soul and testicles\n\n38:15.440 --> 38:20.080\nlike your your it could be your wallet it could be your social standing it could be your anything if\n\n38:20.080 --> 38:28.320\nthere's an investment there the the the invasion of of an alternative fact can actually make you\n\n38:28.320 --> 38:34.160\njust double down yes it's almost like your muscles your muscles tense up and and uh it this is that\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:38.960\nthe so not only was this an incredible episode just to learn about this stuff in a digestible\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:44.640\nway but also that i'm watching it as master storyteller um your character in the show\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:48.560\nthat's the threshold he crosses where he's like yeah i don't want to hear about this\n\n38:49.600 --> 38:55.200\nyeah because it implies that your show doesn't have any value which is what my identity both the\n\n38:55.200 --> 38:59.600\ncharacters at any and my own personal identity is wrapped up in the premise idea that ruining\n\n38:59.600 --> 39:06.160\neverything doesn't mean anything yeah it may is how you get dr who to like yeah question himself\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:11.760\nyeah and i love that so much and it all happens just within one boxing ring with emily just dressed\n\n39:11.760 --> 39:16.320\nshe's just punching you in the face telling you yeah so it's not about like uh there didn't need\n\n39:16.320 --> 39:20.320\nto be a car chase in order for this to be like a dynamic story i thought it was really cool and\n\n39:20.320 --> 39:27.360\ni'm only learning this amazing thing which it uh okay Harmon uh landed use a period\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:36.080\nyou did it the back the backfire effect though so how do we oh oh the one it was like as it is\n\n39:36.080 --> 39:40.800\nexplained in your show the reason for the backfire effect the software we're working with or maybe\n\n39:40.800 --> 39:48.240\nwe should call the hardware yeah the hardware um the emotional wires they run faster than the logical\n\n39:48.240 --> 39:53.920\nones yeah but you're never gonna win like we may as well just accept that humans are passionate\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:59.840\nillogical well and if we do that then it that gives us the tools that we need to overcome the\n\n39:59.840 --> 40:06.240\nbackfire effect right like that my favorite thing uh about the uh segment was you know we went uh\n\n40:06.240 --> 40:11.520\nthis guy who we interviewed on the show steven luandowski and his uh partners in academia wrote\n\n40:11.520 --> 40:16.160\nlike a debunkers handbook um and you know that explains here's how to debunk things better um\n\n40:16.160 --> 40:19.920\nand it's a lot of stuff we already do on the show and the the thing that sticks between the most is\n\n40:19.920 --> 40:24.240\nit's about the power of stories right um that uh people so often when they believe something that's\n\n40:24.240 --> 40:30.400\nwrong they have a story about it like here's and you know you just uh like any fact that you know\n\n40:30.400 --> 40:35.600\nyou probably have a story for how things got that way right america is like this because george\n\n40:35.600 --> 40:39.760\nwashington chopped down the thing and the person wrote the thing and whatever right um and so if\n\n40:39.760 --> 40:46.000\nyou can replace the bad story the incorrect story with a story that is both truer and more interesting\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:50.880\nright right that's how you uh can convince them and when he told me that i was like oh that's the\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:58.160\nthat's our fucking show that's like all we do black history rosa parks yeah uh i i okay let's\n\n40:58.160 --> 41:03.440\nlet's do it i i'm ready i'm white and i'm ready to talk about it happy february brandon\n\n41:03.440 --> 41:12.480\num the can we give you like a list can we give you like a list of things to that you could ruin\n\n41:12.480 --> 41:19.200\nright here tonight well let's call out some stuff if we do that now then i'll be the guy that just\n\n41:19.200 --> 41:23.920\npointed at people snapped and said black history rosa parks and then we moved on i i i have to\n\n41:23.920 --> 41:28.720\njust explain that i i i've been i've been doing like an hour of reading in the mornings before\n\n41:28.720 --> 41:34.640\nmy instagram workouts now i have more to explain but i won't um but uh i'm proud of you but that i i\n\n41:34.640 --> 41:40.000\ni initially here's the here's the path that i went through i'm gonna be a hipster uh artisanal\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:44.400\nblack historian for my workout so why would i do anything that we learned about in high school so\n\n41:44.400 --> 41:49.280\nlet's skip rosa parks then i think first of all what that probably takes a lot of work how do you\n\n41:49.280 --> 41:54.880\nskip rosa parks probably by being smarter and spending more time so let's do rosa parks yeah\n\n41:54.880 --> 41:59.440\nthen i but then so then like oh i guess what the first step is going back to like sixth grade\n\n41:59.440 --> 42:03.680\nwhere you you you have this george washington cherry tree story right yeah rosa parks was an\n\n42:03.680 --> 42:09.840\nold black lady who was on a bus and she had a lot of bags and she was very tired and and the climate\n\n42:09.840 --> 42:17.200\nof of racial injustice was was just like uh uh bubbling and a and a brewing and this innocent\n\n42:17.200 --> 42:23.520\nperfectly uh unaffiliated like woman who just represented all of america because she didn't\n\n42:23.520 --> 42:28.640\nwant nothing to do with none of this um she was just tired and she wanted to sit down and from that\n\n42:28.640 --> 42:33.920\nsparked a revolution because and it's like now i'm realizing like that was the sinister that george\n\n42:33.920 --> 42:38.880\nwashington cherry tree tree story is propaganda about hey you don't have to be an activist you\n\n42:38.880 --> 42:44.000\nshould just sit down and shut the fuck up if you want to cause change like just do what makes you\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:50.480\nwell but the truth is she was 40 she was so later when you're 20 you learn you you you hear these\n\n42:50.480 --> 42:55.600\nlike whispers of these like hey you know that rosa parks thing it's all bullshit it was orchestrated\n\n42:55.600 --> 43:00.080\nthere were a million rows of parks before rows of parks a million people sat on buses that were\n\n43:00.080 --> 43:04.560\nthey weren't supposed to yeah and she and she was a she works for the n double acp what do you\n\n43:04.560 --> 43:09.760\nthink about that and and it's like i got i got whispers of that i remember at some point i was\n\n43:09.760 --> 43:16.080\nlike oh boy i you know yeah then you then you just read her fucking wikipedia page yeah which is not\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:23.840\nthe truth probably no wikipedia but the truth is it's an amazing story yes yes she worked for the\n\n43:23.840 --> 43:31.840\nn double acp shout out to claudette colvin yeah claudette roda's oh sorry sorry claudette colvin\n\n43:31.840 --> 43:40.480\nwas the 29th of february claudette colvin was the uh the original rosa parks yeah she's 15 years\n\n43:40.480 --> 43:45.600\nold yeah and she was she was pregnant so it's a little darker skinned so they were like we got\n\n43:45.600 --> 43:50.480\nthis rosa parks and the wings to sort of fully illustrate your point there was a pregnant yes\n\n43:50.480 --> 43:54.720\nthere was a yes and she would not have withstood yeah this is also a thing it's like do you want\n\n43:54.720 --> 43:59.360\nto put that kind of pressure on it on a young woman that is going to yeah you have to go\n\n43:59.360 --> 44:02.880\nall the way up to the supreme court everyone is going to attack you for the rest of your life\n\n44:02.880 --> 44:09.200\nrosa parks died uh she was like she was attacked for the rest of her life she lost her job as a\n\n44:09.200 --> 44:13.680\nseamstress her husband lost his job because he wasn't allowed to talk about his famous wife at work\n\n44:13.680 --> 44:20.880\nthey had to change states she died alone in an apartment that was robbed like like she was robbed\n\n44:20.880 --> 44:27.040\nbut then she was moved to a higher uh income apartment beautiful beautiful apartments owned by\n\n44:27.040 --> 44:33.040\nthe pizza pizza people little seizures we won't name them because we have a you'll hear the ads for\n\n44:33.040 --> 44:40.880\ndomino so we we have to call little seizures the pizza pizza people pizza people because what\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:44.800\nhappened was she did get robbed people had sort of forgotten about her she was in detroit and then\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:50.400\nlovingly the community stepped in and said you can't rob her anymore and then she was living in\n\n44:51.840 --> 44:56.080\nhey that's rosa parks don't rob her usually they broke into her house they took all of her chairs\n\n44:58.960 --> 45:05.680\nwait really come on come on so she could never sit down is that true yeah it's awful\n\n45:05.680 --> 45:11.120\nit's awful black history month now you know the fucking truth\n\n45:13.360 --> 45:17.040\nanyways my point i just got excited because when you said that you're watching today i was like i\n\n45:17.040 --> 45:21.360\njust experienced that exact same thing is my only point well this gets to your point about about\n\n45:21.360 --> 45:25.200\ncynicism right because this is what our show this is why our show is not a cynical show because you\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:29.440\nhear those that cynical version like oh yeah rosa park she wasn't the first one there's this other\n\n45:29.440 --> 45:34.720\ngirl claudette colvin who they fucked her over because they she was pregnant the first whispers\n\n45:34.720 --> 45:38.880\nare like if you knew as much as we knew you'd hate life and you'd hate everyone and you'd hate\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:46.080\nrosa parks but no it's the fact is the true story i believe is always a better story and the true\n\n45:46.080 --> 45:51.840\nstory is that she was an activist and they were and they were thinking strategically and so yeah\n\n45:51.840 --> 45:56.000\nthey were like hey claudette colvin that's happened to her you know what i bet we can find\n\n45:56.000 --> 46:00.880\nsomeone who will play better in the press it was purely strategic also claudette was sort of a\n\n46:00.880 --> 46:05.280\nbitch she was really rude and she would not do press she was like i don't like sitting down on\n\n46:05.280 --> 46:13.520\nnothing so they were like we got to swap somebody in but like that that goes to show you that goes\n\n46:13.520 --> 46:19.200\nto show you how smart and committed those activists were the nc double eight then double acp was at\n\n46:19.200 --> 46:25.440\nthat time and uh and how good a job they did and the story about her being a little old lady was\n\n46:25.440 --> 46:29.360\nyou know more or less created by that movement because it's a good story you know like it's it's\n\n46:29.360 --> 46:34.240\nnot it's not an evil story it's like it's helpful to the movement it's it's yeah it's putting a\n\n46:34.240 --> 46:38.880\ndifferent face on what is the set yeah the uh and that's and that's press and that's politics and\n\n46:38.880 --> 46:42.480\nthat and you know there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that but you have a you have a furlough\n\n46:42.480 --> 46:46.560\nyou have a fuller understanding of what the movement actually accomplished if you understood no these\n\n46:46.560 --> 46:49.920\nwere activists who were trying to accomplish something and they went about it in a very smart\n\n46:49.920 --> 46:54.560\nway and you can too right and so then when you look at those kids like i don't know the kids who\n\n46:54.560 --> 46:58.400\nlike want to die in feinstein this week and like went to her office and like look how smart that is\n\n46:58.400 --> 47:03.600\nyou know to like hey we're children we're literal children saying hello we would like the planet to\n\n47:03.600 --> 47:08.960\nbe around when we're here you know we are a and feinstein was like uh well then let me drink your\n\n47:08.960 --> 47:17.440\nblood we are we are we are a pack who has pushed these children into a senator's office the children\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:21.120\ncan't tell you what school they're from because they're not supposed to be part of they're not\n\n47:21.120 --> 47:26.720\npolitical pawns but there is a group called the sunrise organization that hires a bunch of people\n\n47:26.720 --> 47:33.120\nto pound their way into democratic senator's offices the same move that they did to polosi\n\n47:33.120 --> 47:37.200\nit's not a bunch of kids it's not random it's a it's an orchestrated event where people have\n\n47:37.200 --> 47:45.200\ncameras where they set up old female democrats that is not a cool tactic at all oh interesting\n\n47:45.200 --> 47:49.200\nthey didn't go to republic and always always always always well those those kids went to\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:53.440\nmitch mcconnell's office today they were in mitch mcconnell's up oh i don't i i right couldn't tell\n\n47:53.440 --> 47:58.960\nyou the details look well we that's how you know it's a scam is that we didn't send first of all\n\n47:58.960 --> 48:03.040\nwe don't use kids as pawns that that's number one number two they don't they don't send them\n\n48:03.040 --> 48:08.480\nthey don't send them into a candidate who doesn't have a green plan shit a green plan right for them\n\n48:08.480 --> 48:12.960\nand when they did the same thing to polosi polosi handed them a plan why weren't those kids giving\n\n48:12.960 --> 48:17.280\nthat plan before they walked in why weren't those kids hooked up with the knowledge they needed\n\n48:17.280 --> 48:22.880\nand how come those adults allowed those kids to yell at an older senator that's shit bullshit\n\n48:22.880 --> 48:27.440\ncalifornia is the greenest state in the nation take your ass to the kentucky senator's office\n\n48:27.440 --> 48:32.160\ngo to philadelphia go to go to pennsylvania's office don't don't just fuck with the female\n\n48:32.160 --> 48:38.160\ncandidates the female senators jam these are these are these these are don't make a two minute\n\n48:38.160 --> 48:43.120\ndon't make a two minute edited tape you lost me when you posted a two minute edited tape the whole\n\n48:43.120 --> 48:49.920\ntape has her receiving those kids with love uh this brings up something i did i i was gonna\n\n48:49.920 --> 48:56.000\nlike lead with tonight which would not not which was just this fascinating fact that we've now here\n\n48:56.000 --> 49:06.720\nwe go here we go again two years well actually kind of three years later i i remember distinctly\n\n49:06.720 --> 49:14.320\nthe point where it was where the primary season was upon us and um and i remember if you if you go\n\n49:14.320 --> 49:19.760\nback i swear if you rewind the podcast you'll listen to me being absolutely silent about politics\n\n49:19.760 --> 49:26.320\nand the reason is because it was the whole it was like hillary people versus elizabeth waran\n\n49:26.320 --> 49:31.520\npeople versus bernie people versus things and i was like i through pure cowardice not through\n\n49:31.520 --> 49:35.840\nnobility because as you saw later as soon as the election happened i was like what this world's\n\n49:35.840 --> 49:42.720\nfucked i gotta say some shit um but i was just sort of like it's time for the groundhog to go\n\n49:42.720 --> 49:49.680\nback in his hole and i mean what is the it it relates to the backfire effect this idea that\n\n49:49.680 --> 49:55.680\nwe're we're we all know now we're watching this we're there's a shit storm coming it's a shit\n\n49:55.680 --> 50:01.120\nstorm that includes our best friends yelling at each other uh it includes this podcast possibly\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:06.720\ngetting inflammatory if there's somebody out here that that that that says something it's like\n\n50:06.720 --> 50:11.680\ni remember i remember years ago you know i remember my friend heath being up here and going like well\n\n50:11.680 --> 50:16.160\nwhat about elizabeth waran and just like i remember other people that i respected and who i wanted to\n\n50:16.160 --> 50:23.040\nbe happy like fucking basically how can i describe it other than bullying him like like like like\n\n50:23.040 --> 50:30.560\nshouting him down and like our this backfire effect means that like that's why the age old\n\n50:30.560 --> 50:34.000\ntradition of we don't talk about religion and politics right because those are the those are the\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:41.440\nthose are the facts that we're all invested in which means that every time we hear something\n\n50:41.440 --> 50:47.600\nother than what we already thought we constrict right i mean people are already attaching their\n\n50:47.600 --> 50:53.520\nidentities to specific candidates and specific you know like platforms and like i don't know\n\n50:53.520 --> 50:59.280\nif that's necessarily a bad thing right um i think that is kind of how it works yeah yeah i thought\n\n50:59.280 --> 51:04.320\nlike 80 of the country doesn't right like they're not helping us and i think we i think we are\n\n51:04.320 --> 51:10.800\nkind of doing actual i think what it is is it's actual politics like that's actual you know\n\n51:10.800 --> 51:16.560\npolitical action is it's nice those conversation those arguments sounds more like people are\n\n51:16.560 --> 51:22.800\nusing the words socialist fascist authoritarianism it's like we're actually doing politics in this\n\n51:22.800 --> 51:27.920\ncountry for the first time or at least yeah for the first time in like 50 years and so people\n\n51:27.920 --> 51:32.000\ngot to like learn how to do it over again because i remember people oh don't talk about politics at\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:37.040\na dinner party i was like why not you just say i like the president the end you know like there\n\n51:37.040 --> 51:41.520\nwasn't much or i don't like like it was i don't know it was kind of easy during the bush years\n\n51:41.520 --> 51:47.040\ntoo i don't like it all right moving on you know we got a couple years till the election now there's\n\n51:47.040 --> 51:54.960\nlike uh you know there's actual shit to be worked out yeah i mean i didn't recognize them as politics\n\n51:54.960 --> 52:00.320\nbecause the morning after the election it was this thing that was making all the women cry\n\n52:00.320 --> 52:05.200\nit that that wasn't politics to me which means i'm a misogynist i was like waking up to that i'm\n\n52:05.200 --> 52:12.000\nlike yeah why why is that waitress eyes so red well because something horrible happened last night\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:18.080\nthat sent her a signal after like her entire life but etc etc and it'd be and as i gained access to\n\n52:18.080 --> 52:24.240\nthat it wasn't the political thing to me it was me realizing i was i was part of a problem without\n\n52:24.240 --> 52:29.760\nrealizing etc etc so for me it was like a journey of self-discovery and then as as my self-discovery\n\n52:29.760 --> 52:35.120\nis unfolding i'm triggering people who are going like jesus fucking christ stop talking about politics\n\n52:35.120 --> 52:44.640\nyou fucking lump of fat hairy shit with gross flappy tits you disgusting soyboy fucking virtue\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:50.640\nsignaling cock beta fucking pedophile fuck how did they know you were a cock\n\n52:53.760 --> 52:57.840\nwell you know it's it would be cool if we didn't talk about behavior\n\n52:57.840 --> 53:04.640\nand we just talked about policy it'd be good if we got back to like let's just talk policy\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:11.760\nyeah i mean on our show like you know we do i don't want to say our show is is not political\n\n53:11.760 --> 53:16.480\nbecause it is because we talk about issues that can only be resolved through politics politics\n\n53:16.480 --> 53:21.120\nhas all defined it half-assedly right now being like the process of how we decide what we're going\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:25.600\nto do you know in a in a country of people who have differing beliefs right how do you create a\n\n53:25.600 --> 53:30.720\nconsensus or create like a dominant majority for a particular issue right but we talk about you\n\n53:30.720 --> 53:36.160\nknow so we talk about like mass incarceration and and you know criminal justice and climate change\n\n53:36.160 --> 53:42.400\nand things like that we don't talk about you know we rarely say the name of a political party or\n\n53:42.400 --> 53:47.600\nlike use that sort of like angle that you're going to get on it from the daily show right\n\n53:48.400 --> 53:54.480\nand part of that reason is we're trying to get to people in a more we're trying to hit people at\n\n53:54.480 --> 54:00.080\ntheir best and at their most thoughtful and their most open to new ideas rather than activating\n\n54:00.080 --> 54:04.640\nthat identity based part of them is there an operation board game aspect to the to the back\n\n54:04.640 --> 54:10.560\nfire effect you can actually avoid let's call them trigger trigger phrases yeah a little bit\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:18.080\nyou know yeah we we will we will try to make arguments that we think nobody could disagree\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:24.720\nwith right like uh you know for the most part for instance when we're making an argument about uh\n\n54:24.720 --> 54:30.640\nabout like that such and such a policy is like discriminatory you know everyone if you present\n\n54:30.640 --> 54:35.760\nto people the basic premise of like you know policies shouldn't be racially discriminatory\n\n54:35.760 --> 54:40.560\nright we can all agree that everyone should be treated the same by the government everyone will\n\n54:40.560 --> 54:44.880\ngo yes i agree with that and then we say okay here's a case that it's not happening and then\n\n54:44.880 --> 54:49.200\nthey'll go okay that probably shouldn't happen you know like though if you engage with them that\n\n54:49.200 --> 54:53.360\nway they'll they'll all agree with that that premise if you start with it where it's like\n\n54:53.360 --> 54:58.960\nthis person is you know like this party is destroying america people will get there we'll\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:04.080\nget there it almost seems like we're defining diplomacy a little bit yeah yeah it seems like\n\n55:04.080 --> 55:09.280\nlike like our our country was founded by a bunch of diplomats people who were like really fond and\n\n55:09.280 --> 55:16.000\ngood at like talking around a topic yeah uh in in such high-flown terms that how are you\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:22.320\ngonna argue with this yeah and that maybe that's what good diplomacy is when you like every time\n\n55:22.320 --> 55:28.560\nthat that every issue tends to get like pulled down into factionalism and they they love to\n\n55:28.560 --> 55:32.480\nattribute catchphrases to it yeah and those catchphrases are often indistinguishable from\n\n55:32.480 --> 55:37.760\nperfectly logical words like up in this cloud but as soon as they're down there they're off the table\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:43.280\nand so you have to be like this weird person who speaks like they sound like a fucking\n\n55:44.320 --> 55:49.760\nthesaurus because that's what we're doing is kind of like rising above everything and floating and\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:57.120\ngoing like well it's uh is this belief that a mankind that should prosper should but you know\n\n55:57.120 --> 56:00.560\nit's like why why aren't they just talking about the tories that we know what this is about\n\n56:01.280 --> 56:06.400\nfucking tories rule and it's uh and if they mentioned tomatoes because of that tomato riot\n\n56:06.400 --> 56:11.200\nlike i know that's dog whistling yeah we we we try to avoid all that stuff you know we did an\n\n56:11.200 --> 56:17.440\nepisode about about guns for our season premiere this year and we um uh in the past like our first\n\n56:17.440 --> 56:21.440\nyear i was like we'll never do an episode about guns because that's like one of the big fault lines\n\n56:21.440 --> 56:25.680\nof american society like as soon as you do that episode because how do you ruin guns yeah well\n\n56:25.680 --> 56:30.080\nthe well that's a good question um but you know as soon as we talk about people will be like as\n\n56:30.080 --> 56:32.800\nsoon as you say okay i'm gonna do an episode about guns everyone folds their arms and they say well\n\n56:32.800 --> 56:36.640\nyou better say what i want you to say well yeah i'm gonna change i'm gonna change the channel if\n\n56:36.640 --> 56:40.720\nyou don't i'm gonna be watching you like a hawk you better say my side right now you know and so\n\n56:40.720 --> 56:45.200\nafter doing the show for a couple years i was like i think we can do it i think we can at least\n\n56:45.200 --> 56:51.520\nmake an attempt to do an episode that like gets people a little bit off balance um and hits the\n\n56:51.520 --> 56:56.400\nissue in a way that destabilizes them that hopefully they'll be a little more open-minded to that\n\n56:56.400 --> 57:01.120\nyou know we we we try to hit things where everybody misunderstands about that everybody's\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:05.360\nwrong about this do you think when you ruined guns i didn't watch that episode do you think when you\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:16.240\nruined guns that you um uh was there fixed it yes no no no i think we did it was there a uh\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:23.040\ndid you kind of ruin it for everybody uh that was that was our that was our attempt i mean\n\n57:23.040 --> 57:26.960\nit was really interesting because we really want to do an episode that would speak to everybody\n\n57:26.960 --> 57:33.120\nspeak to i hate saying both sides because i don't actually believe in i love for you to ruin dichotomy\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:40.240\nyeah just ruin fucking binary ruin the hegele and dialectic um the i mean that that's what\n\n57:40.240 --> 57:43.920\nwe're that is what we were trying to do you know because these these coalitions are based around\n\n57:43.920 --> 57:49.200\nthese catchphrases and these buzzwords that are very narrow sort of cognitive troughs that they're\n\n57:49.200 --> 57:54.640\nlike stuck in you know and so we were trying to get people out of that and say hey here's a couple\n\n57:54.640 --> 57:59.520\nbasic things that we can agree on and then here's a couple things that everybody is getting wrong\n\n57:59.520 --> 58:05.600\nright um so for for instance our our third act was was entirely about how guns interact with\n\n58:05.600 --> 58:08.960\nrace in america which is something that you know is very rarely people who are pro gun\n\n58:08.960 --> 58:12.400\ncontroller very rarely having that conversation people who are pro gun rights are very rarely\n\n58:12.400 --> 58:19.280\nhaving that conversation um and uh uh yeah that was our that was our approach um and then we\n\n58:19.280 --> 58:25.280\nyeah i mean it was very difficult to do that without falling into both sidesism because\n\n58:25.280 --> 58:30.720\nthat's the you know that's the shitty version of that hey there's a lot of shit to go around\n\n58:30.720 --> 58:34.640\nyou know you're wrong you're wrong here i am in the middle like standing on top of my bullshit\n\n58:34.640 --> 58:39.200\nmountain right um but uh and i think we were if someone were to come up to me and tell me\n\n58:39.200 --> 58:43.440\nhey this was both sides bullshit i'd be like okay we did our best you know um like i'm not\n\n58:43.440 --> 58:48.640\ngonna argue with you but we tried not to do that very hard i mean that's a remarkable and chilling\n\n58:48.640 --> 58:55.840\nlike description of the of the ice we're walking across where it's like there's a term now for both\n\n58:55.840 --> 59:04.560\nsidesism yeah um but yeah like i wish there weren't sides and uh yeah now the term both sides is\n\n59:04.560 --> 59:09.760\nabsolutely attributable to what let's call him new hitler i don't know what i don't know what to call\n\n59:09.760 --> 59:14.400\nhim bad hitler dumb hitler but yeah but literally like came out of his mouth i'm like you could never\n\n59:14.400 --> 59:22.160\nsay both sides ever again yeah uh while taking yourself seriously as a uh arbiter yeah you because\n\n59:22.160 --> 59:28.480\nnow and i i've actually detected that with the i've started to notice like i won't talk about\n\n59:28.480 --> 59:33.680\nfreedom of speech anymore because the truth is that millennials have heard enough uh have heard\n\n59:33.680 --> 59:41.440\nthat phrase so many times um yeah during um arguments about why they shouldn't uh complain about\n\n59:41.440 --> 59:47.040\ntheir rights their other other why they shouldn't speak up in defense of themselves even though i\n\n59:47.040 --> 59:53.840\nfeel like the day i die it's it's either going to be prostate cancer a heart attack or i'm being\n\n59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.320\nshot specifically about first amendment shit um that i won't i won't talk about it anymore\n\n01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:06.640\nbecause i sound racist when i say freedom of speech yeah yeah um because because the dialectic\n\n01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.760\nthe dialogue changes yeah i know what's going on back something happened back there uh blue screen\n\n01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:19.600\nuh oh god oh no brandon's uh i mean this segways into well rob wanted to you want to you do you\n\n01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.760\ndo you have any random things you want to see if adam can ruin because he truly has ruined okay here\n\n01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:33.440\nwe go here we go here we go skateboards oh shit i mean uh say pass what is that i mean those i've\n\n01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.960\nnever seen anyone do a trick okay there is the oldest joke in the book but they always fall off\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.640\nthey're always like you see the guy do the flip and then he's like ah fucking he takes a couple\n\n01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.720\nstutter step says the only thing i've ever seen anyone do on a skateboard awesome apples\n\n01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.960\napples uh yeah okay um apples are really interesting because uh they uh if you just like\n\n01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.520\nplant an apple seed in the ground this is weird and true you get like a random apple like something\n\n01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.920\nabout apples mean they don't breed true they like breed in crazy ways you know so you'll get like\n\n01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.200\njust a weird fucking probably inedible apple um and as a result people for most of the time\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.640\njohnny apple seed he wasn't planting apples to uh you know eating they were only usable for cider\n\n01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.680\nso he was actually planting booze trees all over america is a hundred percent true that's in michael\n\n01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.720\npollin's book the botany desire um and as a result what happened is if you randomly got an edible\n\n01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.320\napple you'd be like holy shit i'm gonna be a billionaire because then you would start grafting\n\n01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.960\nthe tree and cloning it right off of your original uh tree and so it was sort of like a striking oil\n\n01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:44.880\nlike to find uh an apple like oh i i uh granny smith i got it like you know um and uh so most\n\n01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:53.200\napples are clones that's uh what i know about apples yeah i mean i'm just i'm literally just\n\n01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.000\nrepeating things from new yorker articles like that's all that's all that's from michael pollin's\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.320\nbook the botany desire is that you say in the pilot you go by the way every time i say something\n\n01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.360\nthere's a bug up in the corner of the screen there's yeah it cites the reference i did that\n\n01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.240\nspecifically because i was just a comedian and i was like why should anybody believe anything i\n\n01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.800\nsay i need to let them know it's you know books somewhere well why else would they believe it\n\n01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.800\ni do and i glance up there when you say something and i go like god damn it what and then i'll see\n\n01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.720\nlike slate 2011 i'll go like well you know i i'm sure that person did their reason you know what\n\n01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.040\ni mean like but it's it's a proper kind of like yes it makes me feel more comfortable that's a big\n\n01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:38.000\ntheme of your show too is the idea that peer review and the idea of being wrong builds trust it's okay\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.680\nto be wrong be wrong admit you're wrong it's the corrections page in a newspaper you know uh it's\n\n01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.680\nwhen someone is we try to be transparent about our process so that people like uh one of our our\n\n01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.560\nhead of research natalie sure has a great um uh phrase for this i can't remember exactly what\n\n01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:01.600\nit was but um it's uh not the idea that someone is perfect or that you know oh sorry it's uh\n\n01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.000\ncredibility is more important than accuracy right um because you're not going to be a hundred percent\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.560\naccurate but what you can be is as credible as you can and so you can say about someone hey they do\n\n01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:16.400\ntheir research they uh they approach these issues in a credible you know respectful uh you know top\n\n01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.880\nof their intelligence way when they're wrong they fess up to it like this is a person who i can trust\n\n01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.200\nin a way right and so that's the that's the ideal that that we go that we go for yeah all you have\n\n01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.600\nis your word so always you my therapist would say always use your eye statements if you're\n\n01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.320\ntaught you know if you're talking to somebody about emotional issues just always always make sure\n\n01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.920\nyou're always talking about how you feel yes that way like well you know you could be you could be a\n\n01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.200\ncrazy person but yeah you would be constantly people could rely on you yes you could be like\n\n01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.040\nlike yeah Dan's always he's nuts but i know exactly how he's nuts because he's always like\n\n01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:58.400\nthose windmills make me want to eat more salt and um but yeah i am now very upset about my\n\n01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.960\ncircumcision by the way i saw the sex episode and i did not i wasn't sure what to think about\n\n01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.440\ni guess the one the what the one nice thing about it is that if i have a kid i don't think\n\n01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.400\nthere we go i'm pretty sure i'm not gonna have him circumvent that's my favorite thing that uh\n\n01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.240\npeople will come up to me and say and they'll say they'll say i didn't they'll say we didn't\n\n01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.560\ncircumcise our kid because of you and i say yes if you could change one life if you if you could\n\n01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:32.160\nchange one uh small child's penis in a positive way if now look i i just i want to say that uh\n\n01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:39.200\ncircumcision our position is there's no particular reason to do it right it's not a terrible thing\n\n01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.880\nto do and if people do it for religious reasons that that's fine or whatever there's no medical\n\n01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.560\nreason to do it and so if you're of the general position that i am which is don't perform unnecessary\n\n01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:54.560\nsurgeries unless you have a really good reason then hey why not not do it you know and like\n\n01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:00.240\nthere's certain you know uh uh yeah that that's about it but i don't i don't want to i went on\n\n01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.880\nthe business shame in anybody's hygiene thing but then i thought i was like wait a minute why would\n\n01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:12.560\ncavemen have a piece of their penis that if left untended gives you an infection no there's no sense\n\n01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.360\nthey roll around in dirt the the forest can serves a the forest can serves a purpose it\n\n01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.520\ncut it it covers the penis which is a sensitive area that could get dirty it's kind of time on\n\n01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:30.000\nHarmontown in that same episode i mean you you could have broke these into three episodes but\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.040\nin that same episode herpes and hymens i i was wrong about all of them two h's herpes herpes\n\n01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.480\n90 of people have some form of herpes some form of herpes herpes isn't extremely uh so the problem\n\n01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.240\nwith herpes is that people the real scourge of herpes is that people get a herpes test and then\n\n01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.600\nthey're told they have herpes and then they're like oh no i have a horrible std and now i can't\n\n01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.440\nhave sex with normal people you know i can't i'm a pariah and they sort of feel you know like but\n\n01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.160\nmost people who have herpes 90 of people have some form of herpes um and then you know mouth\n\n01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.400\nherpes like there's that's talking all over the body right but like so many people have herpes\n\n01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.080\ndon't know that they have it and that's fine because it never affects their lives at all\n\n01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.160\nis it because they don't get tested or is it because it's because it's for most people it's\n\n01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.960\nso asymptomatic you wouldn't know that you had it and so sometimes people i've i've talked to people\n\n01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.040\nwho are like i went to get an std test and i told the doctor i wanted a herpes test too and they\n\n01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:37.040\nsaid don't get one because doctors know that you're you probably have it and finding out that you\n\n01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.800\ndo have it is just going to make you put a social stigma on yourself so you're better off because\n\n01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:46.080\nit's a thing that like everybody everybody has now that's now you know there there are like\n\n01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.480\nyeah everybody has it see\n\n01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.640\nthe jokes are too good to resist despite that everybody has but that yeah it's uh\n\n01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.800\nit's shame i mean i love that that that uh your your episode on sex we try to remove\n\n01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.240\nshank circumcision to hymen to herpes yeah and it comes around to the fourth act of\n\n01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.920\nwhat explains all this stuff all the things that were wrong about shame yeah shame surrounding\n\n01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:23.920\nsexuality little boys are having their their dick tips cut off at birth based on at best now\n\n01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.520\nwe're not questioning anybody if you're if you're getting your dick tip cut off for a 5000 year old\n\n01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.200\nreason we're i'm not saying this podcast is not saying hey storm the gates i i i have no business\n\n01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:42.720\nthere but um but truthfully if you if you're just uh it's it's questionable reasons we don't there's\n\n01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.840\nno science that suggests it was a fad in the 19th century that that they thought would stop kids\n\n01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.480\nfrom masturbating yeah and that's why i took off in the united states but not in most of the world\n\n01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.400\nright it was a us i do wonder what my life would be like if i masturbated more if that would be a\n\n01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.120\nbad thing but i i apparently this this procedure does not stop people from masturbating i gotta say\n\n01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:07.680\nit probably the main thing it's done is it's probably really increased lube sales in america\n\n01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.640\nbecause uh the foreskin's a natural lubricant and uh if you don't have i think you need more lube\n\n01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.920\nit's because it's a mucous membrane i assume because you cited you said that if you're if you're\n\n01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:28.720\ngay um uh not being circumcised uh a person uh being circumcised will reduce the hiv uh uh risk\n\n01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.440\nright but but but not but we're talking about so there's back versus condoms condoms reduce it by\n\n01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:44.640\n80 percent i i he points at me like to continue um i uh yeah there's there's a small effect that's\n\n01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:51.840\nbeen shown that being circumcised can really can reduce the risk of std transmission in\n\n01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.760\ncertain cases by some percentage right but it's like some small percentage it's like your chances\n\n01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.960\nof transmitting it are like 10 less or something like that um which is to my mind not a good reason\n\n01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.560\nto chop off part of your body you can wear a condom right or if you can practice safer sex you\n\n01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.000\ndon't need a surgical right like nothing nothing beats a condom in the first place which is the\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nimportant i read an article the ones that said if we were to uh if we were to circumcise a third of\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.600\nmen on earth we could reduce the cases of uh cervical cancer which is caused by hpv by a\n\n01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.440\ncouple thousand per year right like you're going to circumcise two billion people like billions\n\n01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.480\nof people in order to just give out condoms you know like it's a better that that's a better\n\n01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.000\nthat's a better plan than hey we're going to go around with scalpel still like everywhere in\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.600\nin the world right uh that's my that's my feeling about it anymore i just think about my dog\n\n01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.480\nthey get they get that little lipstick comes out and then well the reason that lipstick isn't always\n\n01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.360\nout is because they're not circumcised yeah yeah yeah like like so i'm like looking at imagine if\n\n01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.360\nwe circumcised dogs it was that all the time that would be horrible like the dog would be so bummed\n\n01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:05.840\nout like yeah but again again it's like the the thing of one of the reasons it's been able to\n\n01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.920\npersist is because it's not a particularly bad thing to be circumcised right um and so uh it's\n\n01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.400\nlike fine it's totally great and the reason the myth around hymens has persisted because it\n\n01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.280\nit blends perfectly in with our kind of like bullying yeah young girls are saying like oh there's\n\n01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.280\nthis event that's going to happen when you have sex for the first time you should think about it more\n\n01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.480\nthan the guy does because the guy could just stick it in and go away yeah and uh you however you're\n\n01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.680\nthe recipient of this thing and we're trusting you with this like drum skin that's like and\n\n01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.840\nthen oh god boy you better not yeah you'll be changed forever yeah it's actually it's practicality\n\n01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.600\nthat that perpetuates that myth it's a little more insidious than the circumcision oh it's\n\n01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.200\nincredible yeah it's incredibly insidious and it's simply not true it's just that the hymen does\n\n01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.120\njust doesn't exist that way hymen is just a thing it's not has nothing to it's all i got the\n\n01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.360\nimpression it's unrelated to sex like that it's just a fucking thing you know i don't want to get\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.920\ntoo outside of my lane um uh talking about it because you know we did that as a episode a couple\n\n01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.280\nyears ago we made our claims there and you know i'm not an expert on on female anatomy i've never\n\n01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:15.440\nseen a woman but but yeah i mean the hymen is not a barrier that is covering the you know vagina\n\n01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.320\nand then the first time it comes through it's like you know ruptured forever like that doesn't\n\n01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.640\nthat's literally what i pictured my entire life was i was like it's like a freshness seal it's\n\n01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.400\nlike a fucking capri sun boom you go through there you're never going to close that capri sun again\n\n01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.560\nand that's what i thought it was and i had sex ed in you guys characterize it as that paper thing\n\n01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.400\non a football field that the band comes through but i but i really love this this goes back to\n\n01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.880\nhow much heart this show has on that football field this character of emily uh uh uh uh adam\n\n01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:55.440\nis is standing with emily's uh boyfriend murph who's a health teacher but you guys are are are\n\n01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.520\npreoccupied with the uh the myths surrounding the hymen because the first one on the list is the\n\n01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:08.160\ncherry popping daddy's uh band and and the two of you as men are just like looking at at a cd case\n\n01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.280\nand like arguing about why it's bad which leaves emily to like walk away from you guys down the\n\n01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:20.240\nfootball field in a beautiful haunting shot where she just basically says without preaching that like\n\n01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:27.280\nthis is also by the way you can use this myth of the hymen there are countries where women have to\n\n01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.760\nshow proof of hymen to get a fucking yes food stamp or whatever the show proof of something\n\n01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:37.040\nthat doesn't exist in that form right that doesn't even food stamp i'm rift don't don't i just say\n\n01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.760\nlike like it's like if you if you accept something as clinical and cause and effect it can be used\n\n01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.200\nto like really hurt people yeah if it's a myth it's crazy it's like the same thing as iq tests\n\n01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:54.080\nwhich you also ruin which have been used extensively for racism yeah anyway so uh but that's that's\n\n01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.240\njust like like please watch the show i mean it's really thank you it is not a show that wants you\n\n01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.400\nto be unhappy and wants the world to be a worse place yeah i mean our our i always say the ruins\n\n01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.480\npart of it is like it's a superficial joke you know it's like ruin comfort i mean yeah when you\n\n01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.440\nlearn something that is contrary to what you believe it's like unless it's really a backfire\n\n01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.160\neffect situation it's momentarily uncomfortable you know you're like oh no let's stop ah fuck\n\n01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:26.400\nmy gears are grinding ah geez right and then uh but then as you learn and you start to embrace\n\n01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.640\nthe actual truth it's really fun and rewarding to learn a new thing and it because you know\n\n01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.480\nthat it makes you more powerful it opens the world up to you one of the reasons our show does well\n\n01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.000\nis because once people learn the things they want to go tell someone else right away right like\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.240\nlearning case in point which is something i knew 20 years ago but i assumed it changed but then i\n\n01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.520\nsaw your episode and was like wait i always knew this this explains everything uh the uh your credit\n\n01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:56.640\ncard numbers they've already been stolen it the fact that it seems like every once in a while like\n\n01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:04.400\nyou're uh vulnerable to identity theft is is is based on the statistical probability of the gigantic\n\n01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:10.320\nlandfill full of everyone's credit card numbers that exists online yes that are that are sold to\n\n01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:15.440\namong people and huge tranches of like billions of cards you're actually protected by the lack of\n\n01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.560\nsecurity about your credit card because it's like a school of fish like yeah it's like what\n\n01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.960\nwill what are the odds you're going to get eaten very low and the credit card companies all or the\n\n01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.360\nbanks more specifically all have they're just like okay well just since this is the case we'll just\n\n01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.560\ncancel the card and refund the thing when it happens and we'll call you on the phone and and\n\n01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.880\nyou know so that's why now it's more annoying right because your your credit card what people\n\n01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.800\nnow have their cards canceled you know the fraud protection is too strong right um uh but uh yeah\n\n01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.560\nthat but i always knew that because i remember being a kid and i remember i don't know if it's\n\n01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:53.840\nillegal for me to say this but i remember being in that phase of my life like 16 17 and like i\n\n01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.520\nremember going to those sites and going like for real this these are just people's credit\n\n01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.200\ncard numbers yeah and i would take some and i tried some and i i got i did some stuff i i i i\n\n01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:10.080\nwhoa we're all the time on Harmontown for the second time i thought maybe it had changed in\n\n01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.200\n20 years but as your as your show maybe makes a point it's like no in the 70s they used to take\n\n01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.600\nyour your credit card as a just literally a card that has the number on it and they would literally\n\n01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:26.480\njust go 1754 yeah and then the thing that changed over 20 years is that now a computer does that\n\n01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.680\nyeah but it's it's no more secure the only thing it eliminates is that one person overhearing your\n\n01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.320\ncredit card transaction we've got like you know chip and pin when you're using the register\n\n01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.040\nis you're not exposing your number in the same way that you used to be but the number system\n\n01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.800\nstill exists right all you need is a sear you know a string of digits a shorter string of\n\n01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.960\ndigits and a shorter string of digits and you can use you can use someone's card right now exactly\n\n01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:56.560\nhow would a person say do that maybe you could ruin poverty pretty sure you can get online and google\n\n01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:04.080\ni think i'd correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure the issue is\n\n01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.160\nyou could get online and and if you really drilled down tonight you could you could get\n\n01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.200\nonline and google and go like i want to become a person who trades in the credit card numbers\n\n01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.440\nbasically it would be the equivalent of you becoming a metal detector guy yeah you would you\n\n01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.800\nwould be like putting the saint you'd be putting so much effort into it you may as well write a\n\n01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:27.040\nscreenplay is that what you go down to the beach you're like hey metal detector guy write a screen\n\n01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:34.320\nplay what are you doing jesus

letter to the immigration board or whatever you call it where basically\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.680\nit's like i'll to get a genius visa which is essentially saying yes he's going to take an\n\n01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:37.120\namericans job but no american can do it fuck you john williams fuck you mark mother's ball you had\n\n01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:46.480\nyour chance second city toronto mark mother's boss doing fine on the devour royalties both your\n\n01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.080\nparents are super smart right yeah they're both my parents are phd's yeah d scientists on the piece\n\n01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:58.480\nof shit with a ba is this is this where you get the unraveling from uh did they teach you like\n\n01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.600\nthis did they talk to you about these things you know i had a lot of so i i mean i i had a\n\n01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.920\nreally science-filled childhood but you know i was also a super adk and i couldn't keep my head\n\n01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.840\non straight you know so they they they wrote me they didn't write me off but you know i was like\n\n01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.400\nthey they weren't like this kid's gonna this kid's gonna make it an academia um\n\n01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.360\nbut you know i i spent a lot of time watching like kids science shows and things like that which\n\n01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.880\nended up i realized only after created the show i was like oh this show is like beakman's world i\n\n01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.240\ndon't know if you guys remember beakman's world um but i realized afterwards i was like this is\n\n01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.680\nreally profoundly influenced like i zip in we do sound effects for every little thing you know are\n\n01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.040\nthey impressed do you ever call them do i ever call beakman's world oh no that was literally my\n\n01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:46.560\nfirst one does my father beakman ever tell me he loves me uh not not yet uh yes my parents are my\n\n01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.360\nparents are impressed uh yeah and do they ever get story ideas from them at all do they ever\n\n01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:57.840\ngive you a you know i got i got to tell you uh almost the opposite um my we did an episode on\n\n01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.080\nscience which is one i'm very proud of because i love science it's dear to my heart and it's about\n\n01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:08.240\nsystemic problems in science um with science funding and with um you know use it over use of\n\n01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.040\nmouse models like they use mice for too many things and stuff like that um and i watched it with my\n\n01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:20.000\ndad who's uh the uh an administrator at a phd and a vice president of the university oregon\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.080\nand i watched it with my sister who's a phd in nuclear physics and a journalist at the wonderful\n\n01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.960\nmagazine science news really good outlet if you guys like learn about science and i watched it with\n\n01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:35.360\nthem and then afterwards they looked at me and they were like you really simplified a lot of\n\n01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:42.320\nstuff in this and i was like no i don't want to hear it don't just tell me good job i was like\n\n01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:49.520\nsitting there watching them during the episode as they were like i don't know yeah kind of painting\n\n01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.160\nwith broad a broad brush you know like my dad who we're talking about problems in science funding\n\n01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.480\nand the nsf and and you know corporate and and billionaire funding a science and the problem\n\n01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:03.520\nwith that my dad worked at the nsf and gave grants and he was like no no no it's a good system i was\n\n01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:09.040\nlike you're here's the thing when people are uh when people are so close to something it's nothing\n\n01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:15.200\ni hear a lot is uh oh adam ruins everything is a great show until he does something that you know\n\n01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:21.600\nabout right and like yeah i'm sorry that in six minutes we didn't manage to like the standards\n\n01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.080\nof your like fucking phd right damn it people get so excited that's one of the biggest problems\n\n01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:32.800\nwith the internet is people get so fucking excited yeah when the ocean of everyone dwelling together\n\n01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.720\naccidentally runs over a single god damn thing about that that's important to them it's like\n\n01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.760\nit's a that's just be excited about that don't get mad about it yeah i'm talking about you\n\n01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:50.160\nmentioned the pixies oh fuck i saw the last picture they think it's so fun they're like oh my god i\n\n01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.640\nfinally i'm the person here i mean we did this thing on on mouse models which is that you know\n\n01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.280\nmice are mice and rats are overused in medical testing and science and the reason is because\n\n01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.600\nthe models are very it's very easy to get the mice it's cost effective and it's replicable you can\n\n01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.600\ndo it over and over again and it's like easy get funding to do that right there are problems with\n\n01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:13.520\nit my dad told me about that with my dad's not a scientist sure he told me what he said you know those\n\n01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.080\nthose rats are bred for cancer that's what that's the thing that people say what do you mean it's\n\n01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:26.320\nlike well they're the the the rats are now easier to give cancer because all they get is cancer\n\n01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.280\nyeah i just remember that from what i was like eight that's kind of broadly true i mean it's like\n\n01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.200\nthere's such a there's such specific populations right because they're trying to reduce the number\n\n01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.920\nof variables right when they're when they're testing but as a result their findings then become\n\n01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:45.280\nlike really really narrow and just you know we talked to a fucking cancer scientist who says\n\n01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.160\nhey we shouldn't be using mice quite this much right it's a systemic problem in science and on\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.200\nyou know reddit we got so many people saying i am a scientist who uses mice and he doesn't know\n\n01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:01.040\nanything about mice and i use mice very well you know and the thing is from their vantage point where\n\n01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:06.720\nthey are at their particular post grad program at the university of whatever doing their work\n\n01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.000\nlike they have such a specific their whole lives are their little corner of it you know\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.480\nlike sort of writ large and i'm talking about i'm doing an overview for a general population\n\n01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.360\nof the field from 10 000 feet up right and so like those even though we're talking about the\n\n01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.840\nsame thing our perspectives are so different that like they can't you know they can't quite go to\n\n01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.760\nthey can't quite go together you know and they have that strong reaction of an episode i'm going\n\n01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.960\nback to your parents thing is there a version of an episode where you ruin the child-parent\n\n01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:43.920\nrelationship where but which is to say on both sides both sides uh because sometimes i feel\n\n01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:54.000\nat 46 like i look back on a lifetime of kind of like um uh symbolizing them i like oh my mom said\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.320\nthis my dad said that and i just told that story about my dad saying that it's like i it's so easy\n\n01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.560\nto want them to be wrong and all this stuff and like i guess i'm fascinated by this kind of like\n\n01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:11.680\nSchrab used to tell me this story uh Schrab's gonna grow up to be a god knows what he hasn't grown up\n\n01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.080\nyet no Schrab Schrab Schrab Schrab grows up to be a comic book artist right so Schrab has these stories\n\n01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:23.520\nlike when we're like 20 and we're hanging out and Schrab remembers being a kid and your mom hid\n\n01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:30.640\nyour comic books and you know she was she didn't have i had a comic book ranzor ox and it had uh on\n\n01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:36.000\nthe and it had some racies it was kind of like a heavy metal kind of a sci-fi book and there was\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.120\nlike some naked nudity in there hell yeah that's kind i guess i've got to i guess to skip ahead of\n\n01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.640\nit i'm wondering like do we when we i always because i also watch these true crime things and\n\n01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.640\nlike people are so fast and they go like oh ted bundy uh ted bundy's parents were like this i'm\n\n01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:02.880\nlike according to who fucking ted bundy we should the fuck do you trust him for you say i want to\n\n01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:09.680\nbundy uh are you comparing me to ted bundy yes yes i am what the fuck i think i think if you had\n\n01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:18.640\nslightly less of a support system uh no what i'm saying is do we as adults like i i wonder what\n\n01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:24.880\nfield of psychology like like like studies is like the idea of like like i i picture it like a like\n\n01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.560\na boat's wake like like to what extent i know it's like nature versus nurture is a thing but i'm\n\n01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:35.440\nsaying like like people like we we tend to interview people about their childhoods we go like oh hey so\n\n01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.160\nand so what do you remember about your childhood well my mom was always very encouraging about the\n\n01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.280\nalphabet oh really that's weird because your life ended up being about the fucking alphabet you\n\n01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:52.080\nalphabet scientist but like like guess what you were raised from your brain your mom like washing\n\n01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.640\nyour dick too hard in the bathtub we don't know like how do we know whether washing your dick\n\n01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.560\nreally hard makes you into the alphabet like we're gonna lose that stuff because we have this like\n\n01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:07.040\nfixation of this idea of the truth like this this biographical truth like why didn't you become a\n\n01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.040\ndick washing scientist who studies dick washing we think that's how it is but like have you have\n\n01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.680\nyou touched on any area that we haven't done we haven't done parenting we have you done that episode\n\n01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.720\nwell there's a lot there um there's a lot to unpack there's a lot to unpack uh we you know we've\n\n01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.160\nnever done parenting specifically because we've done we've tracked Emily and Murph throughout\n\n01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.600\nthe stages of life so they get engaged and we did an episode about their engagement we did an\n\n01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.120\nepisode of adam ruins weddings we did an episode about having a baby right and then we decided at\n\n01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.600\nthe end we sort of had a very soft you know our message to the end of that was like hey you don't\n\n01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.920\nhave to have a kid right that was sort of trying to take that shame off that pressure off of people\n\n01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.000\nit's not your chance to make the world a better place yeah to have a kid you mean yeah right\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.640\nyeah i i mean that's uh yeah that's that's certainly my my perspective is that like i don't\n\n01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:01.040\nthink there's a moral imperative to have children personally um and and uh if people want to have\n\n01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.520\nthem great but i don't think it's like a thing that we we have to do right um uh so at the end we\n\n01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.800\nhave Emily and Murph decide to wait and so they don't have kids and so but maybe maybe one day\n\n01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:17.200\nyou know god willing uh if we keep going we'll we'll do that episode but uh yeah i don't know i\n\n01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.440\nfeel like the the amount of like the fucking butterfly effect of parenting is so vast that i\n\n01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.320\nfeel like almost the worst part about it as a parent i can't imagine having to live with that\n\n01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.240\nbecause you feel like oh everything i do is going to be like that fucking simpson's episode where\n\n01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.160\nlike you know suddenly suddenly they turn into some kind of weird monster because i do x y z but\n\n01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.400\nit's completely unpredictable and you actually have almost no control over it at all like all the\n\n01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.800\nthings that you know i talk to my therapist about about you know my my parents doing x y or z none\n\n01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.480\nof it's none of it's you know particularly bad but the things that did affect me are things that i\n\n01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:55.040\nknow that that they never even thought about or that they they were just tiny little quirks of\n\n01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.600\ntheir personality that were just you know like a little bit too harsh about this or a little bit\n\n01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.920\ntoo loose about that or more importantly and this is the thing that plagues me is don't you think\n\n01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.360\nit's possible that there's moments where they're like by the way all that other shit that you're\n\n01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:16.880\ngonna remember um that's all boy i'm so sorry i came off that way earlier today adam you gotta\n\n01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.680\nremember it's so important that mice mice are overused and or whatever the thing is whatever\n\n01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:30.960\nand and that and that it just didn't serve your uh your your your adult brain your developing\n\n01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:36.400\nbrains it's like you create this like rocket thrust behind you you go why am i who i am\n\n01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:44.320\nand the memories that don't serve that narrative they just oh yeah like like like like oh old man\n\n01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:51.520\nwithers down the street was racist and that's why i'm not and i decided that and so i forgot\n\n01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:57.840\nthat old man withers uh yeah saved the space lab from i'm not gonna riff a narrative that's\n\n01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.160\ni'm already halfway into one i might as well complete it he saved space lab\n\n01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.800\nwith his racism i don't know uh yeah well that doesn't that's in that case old man withers\n\n01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.560\nwas still racist i don't know why i yeah there's this there's this conflict because i i believe\n\n01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:21.040\nwhat is going on back there can't you guys just is it on a loop or something what's going on\n\n01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.360\ni believe that every time it happens everyone feels like they have to react the weird i would\n\n01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:35.280\njust put it on like a like a video of a badger robbing or something like a fast motion video\n\n01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.440\nused to something i'm curious i'm i'm actually curious what you'll say to this because one of\n\n01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.680\nmy beliefs um and i've read your writing on on story structure and stuff and and i i love it\n\n01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.800\nbut one one of the things that i believe is that uh you know real life is not story shaped that\n\n01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.640\npeople's lives are not actually stories and that and that that's something that we impose onto them\n\n01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.880\nand that the real and that we actually have an upcoming episode our season finale is going to\n\n01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:04.080\nbe about exactly this problem because on our show we use stories to in the way that i describe to\n\n01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:10.480\nto give people information but in reality uh the real world is not story shaped right like we tell\n\n01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.280\nour our three beat story about teddy roosevelt's life but teddy roosevelt did not have a story\n\n01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.480\nlike that to his life that's something i imposed on it right um and so the in to the extent that\n\n01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.840\nwe're using those stories we get we get further from the truth and i think we do that for our own\n\n01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.200\nlives as well um but at the same time human life and human society definitely not story shaped\n\n01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.720\nbecause it's sloppadoodle because it but the only things that are story shaped are like\n\n01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:41.760\nthe day because the sun comes up and goes down so you can always rely on that and like the seasons\n\n01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:49.920\nand life and death and the kind of like general nature of how this two shall pass like um you're\n\n01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.240\nmad at this person today maybe you're mad at them because you love them you're going to find that\n\n01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:01.280\nout later like those kind of like those things that aren't uh um pollutable by the fact that\n\n01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.640\neveryone else is going through them all at the same time that creates static and that but the\n\n01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.040\nindividual signals i think if you were to the extent that it's possible to have an individual\n\n01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:15.520\nhave a relationship with the universe i think that the story structure holds true i think the\n\n01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:23.120\nnature boom well i have to say boom okay take that out but i do i i do know exactly what you're\n\n01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.040\ntalking about because then what we have to do is function together and then so then we go oh\n\n01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.160\nteddy roosevelt you know lesson you learn there mm don't dig a canal unless you want malaria\n\n01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.880\nand then someone else is like well actually and we're like you're actually me and my story is\n\n01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.640\nabout crossing the threshold of learning what actuallying is and everyone's right and everyone's\n\n01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:49.360\nwrong because it's like yeah it's like all signals that just create static but your heart is beating\n\n01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:56.960\nevery beat a muscle like go crosses it is a four act story right it's a four chambered heart\n\n01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.440\nbut i i am my my my believe i i agree with that except that i believe that's like a structure\n\n01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.640\nthat's a structure that we impose right that's a structure like i believe the story is a structure\n\n01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.240\nof the mind out of the universe right if humanity was wiped out nobody would care there would be\n\n01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.640\nnobody to care about anything there would be no you know sort of like the sun would be revolving\n\n01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.040\nbut there'd be no vantage point from which it would rise and set right um there would be no\n\n01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.360\none to observe it right yeah this is absolutely about the experience of being sentient yeah and\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:29.680\nso that's what i bump into because i'm really i'm my what i'm uh most interested in is understanding\n\n01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.200\nthe the universe as it truly is right this is fucking i'm just getting gonna just nose dive\n\n01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.000\ninto cont here but like i uh what i'm really interested in understanding the world as it\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.440\ntruly is and to the extent that i uh am imposing my own structure on it that's an extent to which\n\n01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:51.200\ni don't truly understand it as it is uh and and it seems like the story is like such a deep\n\n01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:57.040\npiece of how we think deep like characteristic of how we think that we can't escape it even\n\n01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:04.720\nas it distorts the world that we're trying to observe yeah i mean jeez there was there is\n\n01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.600\nthat idea that the only footage that is real documentary footage is surveillance footage\n\n01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.160\nbecause those people are unaffected because the camera is not in plain view\n\n01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.200\nbut the camp yeah i mean and then but what about but what about actually but like the camera was\n\n01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.760\nmounted uh in suspicion it was mounted by macy's because macy's didn't want their parking lot\n\n01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.160\nrobbed it was a choice made by everything that the human sentience touches it creates a perspective\n\n01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:36.640\nand a flavor i i think if you there's a way to look at that to to to to defeat yourself and go\n\n01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.800\noh so all i am is a is a conscious monkey that's just like projecting an illusion onto a chaotic\n\n01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:48.560\nuniverse you know monkey but can't you just flip that and go well flip the telescope look through\n\n01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:57.440\nthe big end and into the monkey and go um uh monkey is tiny hey yes he is very tiny and and the\n\n01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.400\nuniverse's point is that monkey for the time being according to that monkey and then and that's what\n\n01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:06.480\nthe monkey needs to know to actually understand the universe because as far as our monkey's\n\n01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.760\nrelationship with the universe the only thing that's going to possibly benefit the monkey\n\n01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:15.040\nis through that telescope even though it's absolutely a fraudulent telescope because the\n\n01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.600\nthe monkey understanding what the milky way thinks won't help the monkey and the milk and what\n\n01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:26.320\nthey won't it it it it's like uh yeah i don't know i'm scared i'm scared you're scaring me i'm\n\n01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.960\nso i'm like panicking i'm like flailing and going like look listen adam all we have to do is make\n\n01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.360\ngood television than die i agree i agree with that i agree with that statement as well i accept\n\n01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.200\nthat buying a tesla didn't help the earth uh this is as much quarter as i give you\n\n01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.080\ni mean i i i agree with that last statement all you have to do is make good television than die i\n\n01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.080\nmean when i make my show i'm like try this that's me trying to work that shit out you know like\n\n01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:59.840\nwell our our season finale this year is literally us like grappling with those issues right and the\n\n01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:05.360\nissues of like is the structure of our show make our show less true oh my god i mean this is my new\n\n01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.840\nfavorite show i'm gonna like watch it thank you oh my gosh because it's that's it's fucking meta in\n\n01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:16.160\nthe best way thank you um you should you should ruin the word meta it's a it's a greek prefix it\n\n01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.440\nmeans nothing it means beyond the it shores up the fourth wall it makes you identify with characters\n\n01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.720\ndo do all kinds of stuff like that you also have an offshoot that's like an animated thing where\n\n01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.400\nyou just investigate history we did uh we did animated episodes yeah uh that were called reanimated\n\n01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:38.160\nhistory and they were and they were specifically uh it was that the network wanted uh more episodes\n\n01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.880\nin less time and they were like you and they're like you shoot all year what if we do animated\n\n01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:49.840\nepisodes and i said uh maybe and they said great yes and then we did them and they came out quite\n\n01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:57.600\nwell um but uh yeah they're uh um is like we ended up creating an entirely different format for them\n\n01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.080\nwhere it's me interacting uh with a narrator i heard chris pernell's voice he is chris pernell\n\n01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.240\nis the voice of it which was incredible to to have so if you if you're going through rick and\n\n01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:14.160\nwarty withdrawals you can you can listen to jerry narrate history or animated adam ruins it for\n\n01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.240\nhim yeah i really recommend this show like i it's kind of it's one of those things where it's like\n\n01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:24.320\neasy to recommend because just watch ten minutes of it you're gonna it's like a grape or a crack\n\n01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:31.600\nrock like your your inner you're out you will sell all of your shit and lose your teeth over this\n\n01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:41.440\nshow oh man grapes grapes will get you that's what that's what grapes do to me oh man i am well\n\n01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.440\nlike i i think this is my most important question it was like it was sort of like hinted at in the\n\n01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:51.920\nbeginning and i purposely avoided it but like so do you believe in humanity do you think we have a\n\n01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:59.440\nchance and we've only got two minutes in the broadest in the broadest sense in the broadest\n\n01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:08.880\nsense um uh uh in the broad in the broadest sense drop what am i what do you think my job is here\n\n01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.200\ni got to ask that you know i got to ask i got to sleep tonight what are you what are you doing\n\n01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.560\nwell well so he's flattering you he's saying whatever you say is going to affect him\n\n01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.280\nby a big well let me let me so a thought i have sometimes is that let's see if i can do a a\n\n01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:31.200\npessimist and an optimist version uh the a thought that i have sometimes is that the the the amount\n\n01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:39.120\nof time that we have been on earth in our current form right like the the modern world right is is\n\n01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.560\nso short right our population has gone up by i i don't know i forget when the earth had a hundred\n\n01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.880\nhad i had one billion people on it as opposed to seven but it was less than two hundred years\n\n01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:58.960\nago right and so the amount of explosion is massive and if you saw any population of any\n\n01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.040\ncreature expand that much in that short of a time you'd be like yeah this might not end well right\n\n01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.640\nlike giraffes going from one billion to seven billion giraffes yeah exactly fuck it up at four\n\n01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.720\nbillion giraffes easy and exactly they'd be like well i invented a new kind of tree that's artificially\n\n01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:23.520\ntall because you gotta justify the next they can't you sorry i mean derail you no no no that's exactly\n\n01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.440\nmy that's exactly my example i'm often stricken by that it just feels like it's almost like where\n\n01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:31.760\nthe pat would like where complete absolute cynicism and optimism meet where it's like\n\n01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.440\nthere's eight billion of us we're horrible people like yeah like like when those lights went out in\n\n01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.240\nnew york like decades ago it was like everybody was like oh there she goes there goes new york\n\n01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.920\nand then the lights came on the next morning they're like we ate all the ice cream before it melted\n\n01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.040\ni was in new york during a blackout and it was it was kind of nice i like like like so few\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.520\nlike we're not we're not as bad as but at the at the same time at the same time okay so that's\n\n01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.920\nlike the worst that's like the worst vision of humanity right and and in that vision we're like\n\n01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:09.440\nwe're almost like a bacterial infection that found too much like substrate that would allow\n\n01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.760\nit to grow right like we're growing at this rapid pace in this unsustainable way and the crash is\n\n01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:21.440\na common right and that's how i feel sometimes then i feel other times that i think the the humanist\n\n01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:28.960\nworld view doesn't get enough credit sometimes for how beautiful it is because i feel like\n\n01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.040\natheists who people want to call themselves atheists don't don't give this view often enough\n\n01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:39.040\num uh because uh you know we if you if you're looking at the world in those terms right that\n\n01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.440\nwe live in a natural world where you know things are happened because of chemical reactions and\n\n01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.600\nthat life is essentially a complex chemical reaction right humanity is a chemical reaction\n\n01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:54.000\nthat's so complex that not only it it actually escaped the bounds of biological evolution and\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.560\nbegan a process of cultural evolution where um you know the the rate at which we're growing and the\n\n01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.640\nrate at which we're changing the amount the rate at which our species has changed is orders of\n\n01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.480\nmagnitude faster than any species that has ever changed before right because we've created this\n\n01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.160\nprocess of cultural evolution where things are happening in our minds right and through language\n\n01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:15.120\nmemetic evolution yeah that is like taken over yeah that is like incredibly rapid and that's\n\n01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.960\nsomething that to our knowledge has never happened anywhere in you know ever right and that makes\n\n01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:27.360\nus the most like undoubtedly the most remarkable thing to ever happen in the entire universe\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.800\ncertainly as far as we've seen yeah yeah i mean like it's it's um it's unbelievable that and and\n\n01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.200\nit again it's just it's just chemical reactions like building upon each other complexity creating\n\n01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.760\nmore complexity creating more complexity creating more complexity um and so that is the mere fact\n\n01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:49.680\nof our existence is the most beautiful truth in the natural world um and as a result it kind of\n\n01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.400\nmaybe i mean it i was going to say it doesn't matter what we do it does because we still need to\n\n01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.240\nbehave ethically towards each other and try to improve the world that we're in but um the fact\n\n01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:06.400\nof our existence is so marvelous that it's uh uh difficult to even comprehend i uh that's my positive\n\n01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:15.760\nfeel i yeah i i just spoke to elan musk about this you're welcome uh we were just having the\n\n01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.360\nsame conversation and he touched on this thing that i was like like like a canadian cartoonist\n\n01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.920\nmy friend steven notley who can you hear on the podcast he introduced to me a million years ago\n\n01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:34.640\nwhich was this idea of information as a field or i.e. an organism in its own right um although it\n\n01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.600\ndoesn't mean our definitions of living but it does mean our definitions of like wants to be\n\n01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:48.800\nand that information as a field uh it it goes it's like if you look at just us as a sort of\n\n01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:57.520\nof patsy i guess you'd call it that that molecular you know molecular bumpage leads to cosmic RNA\n\n01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.880\nleads to life leads to competition between giraffes and beavers leads to us having eyebrows\n\n01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.280\nand having podcasts and what the whole point of it is that we invented hard drives because\n\n01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:13.680\nwe've got our cells are bursting with information are the reason we have these chromosomes are just\n\n01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.680\nlike so tightly wound it's like comical it's like how can you have information that way\n\n01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:25.040\nand the answer is we barely can whenever you fuck and like the the the shuffle has to happen the\n\n01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.400\nballet of information having to unwind and then rewind in your baby's cells it's like\n\n01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.720\nit's gotten to a point where it's like enough is enough coincidentally right at the time when\n\n01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:42.640\nwe're also smart enough to make new ways for information to to to go on and my big fear was\n\n01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:56.720\nalways and look i'm i'm just gonna say elan shared it so new share he made your he made\n\n01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.920\nyour solar panels in your cars and like you know but i like where i was like i said well like\n\n01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.880\nwe're just like these like what we're experiencing right now could be intersected with like the kind\n\n01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:13.440\nof it's it's like like we could be coming to a point where everyone who's an atheist and\n\n01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:19.200\neveryone who's like a fundamentalist could actually both agree that it's over but\n\n01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.720\nthe the the atheists are agreeing because it's like well our species was never anything more\n\n01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:37.200\nthan basically like a a boot drive like a like a like a weird kind of like intermediary like oh\n\n01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.440\nwhat do i got to work with uh so i was like like time bandit to get the assistant to the guy that's\n\n01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:49.200\nlike like trying to devise a universe and like you have hydrogen you have you know you have\n\n01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:54.560\nthese like certain amount of atoms like all right well arrange them in a way that makes them when\n\n01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.360\nthey bump into each other want to make more of the things that bumped into each other and it's\n\n01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:05.680\nlike like and just give it a trillion gazillion years until it gets to a point where okay finally\n\n01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:11.920\nwe got like plants and furry things like crawling around and they all want to like now they've got\n\n01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.200\nthe agenda driven that's like it's on autopilot so if you're a god at this point you've walked away\n\n01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.640\na long time ago but uh you're growing basil in your flower box and that's like going but it's like\n\n01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:27.920\nlike like like because all it's doing is just going like look i got one every every living thing\n\n01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:34.160\nis just going i gotta beat every other living thing i gotta fuck more i gotta i and and but\n\n01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:42.480\nall of it is like bent towards this apex where you and i are like oh i i need to know how to make\n\n01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:51.200\neyeglasses and this microchip and this thing and this alphabet and that we have gotten finally\n\n01:43:51.200 --> 01:44:00.160\nright to the point where what we're experiencing is an actual spiritual abandonment of our original\n\n01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.840\nquest sorry that i said this that the no no no he didn't i don't i don't want to throw him under\n\n01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.880\nthe bus because i i i know this is me projecting on a shit i don't want to i don't i don't want to\n\n01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:18.640\nmiscredit anybody what do you know what my fear is that we are as primates we are at the event horizon\n\n01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:28.320\nand of of biologically going okay what's next and but the information is going like nothing's\n\n01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:35.840\nnext for you you fucking foot man you fucking skycap piece here's your five bucks it's for\n\n01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.880\nit's a actually a coupon from where we're going like you can't even spend it and we're like oh\n\n01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:50.800\noh that that that is violence that is nihilism like that that we're we that we have a we were\n\n01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:57.520\nat a crossroads where we could actually i my theory is if we could actually just recalibrate\n\n01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:02.320\nfor a second and realize that we are direct descendants of chimpanzees and that by their\n\n01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:11.840\nstandards we are gods and just stop like could we have a conversation with a chimpanzee tonight\n\n01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:19.280\nand they would go what's wrong and we would go well we got well not a lot to do and whoa slow\n\n01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:25.120\ndown jack i can't even talk how many spotted leopards are hunting you and we'd be like well\n\n01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.960\nspotted leopard of nuclear annihilation it's like whoa hey you made that up down the\n\n01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.000\neventually the conversation would end with the chimpanzee going you're crazy i'm gonna go have\n\n01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:44.640\nan orgy because i learned to fuck and i'm gonna go extinct because of you not because of me\n\n01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.240\nnot because fucking's wrong and not because gruman's wrong and not because and and we could just\n\n01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:56.480\nrealize like we we we've eliminated the spotted leopard yeah the wolves are fetching our slippers\n\n01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.960\nwe control the weather um if it rains we don't have to give a shit we don't control the weather\n\n01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:11.440\nwe affect it we affect the weather we do not control it but according to a chimpanzee yeah\n\n01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.440\nyeah we do because a chimpanzee can't just go indoors we invent it indoors we do control\n\n01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:22.640\nchimpanzee's definition of weather we can change it from raining to not raining by stepping to\n\n01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:28.800\nthe left three feet chimpanzees could only do that to a certain degree i what what i'd say to that\n\n01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.120\nis that you're always bragging about how you better than chimpanzee i think it's time i think i\n\n01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:39.040\nthink we got that look i think it's that's gonna be my movement just compare yourself to a chimpanzee\n\n01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:46.400\nyou're rich you're happy what i what i'd uh what i'd say to that and what i'd say to elon musk if\n\n01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:53.440\nyou was uh sitting here um is uh there's there's like this concern there's like this concern that\n\n01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:00.160\nwe are uh that the bad thing is something we're gonna do you know like we're worried about uh\n\n01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.680\nyou know we're worried about building AI or worried about like building the next level or you\n\n01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.960\nknow what i mean um and i'm concerned about the things that we're doing right now right um that\n\n01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.800\nlike we're uh you know we're actively we're destabilizing like weather systems and climate\n\n01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:21.360\nsystems right now you know and that uh we're we're currently building you know a lot of people are\n\n01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.600\nlike afraid like oh the AI is gonna take over you know um and it's like gonna come to consciousness\n\n01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.880\nit's gonna skynet us you know um but the the i there's this writer james bridal who wrote a book\n\n01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:36.480\ncalled new dark age and it's all about how we're building these systems that uh they're not AI they're\n\n01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:40.960\nnot like hard AI that's like you know trying to kill us or whatever they're just systems that we've\n\n01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.160\nbuilt that we don't understand right um that like the youtube algorithm like the u2 youtube algorithm\n\n01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.920\nis currently giving people uh you know misinformation uh conspiracy theories uh hateful shit right\n\n01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.160\nthat's what's like being bred on youtube and nobody knows why right because we don't understand the\n\n01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.520\nyoutube algorithm and the youtube people were just trying to get people to click more right that's\n\n01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.280\nall that's that's all that they were doing right um and so like that is the current you know that's\n\n01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.320\nthe problem of technology that that you know i would wish we were focusing on rather than the\n\n01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:17.280\nrather than the skynet problem you know i mean um like we have so much that uh we are like fucking up\n\n01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.600\ncurrently on a daily basis just in how we treat each other on a basic level i guess if i were a\n\n01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:28.720\ndoomsday person i would say in argument but your point is better i but i but i if i was arguing i\n\n01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.720\nwould say well no that's the point of worrying about the future is that you you do backwards\n\n01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.320\nmath to what you need to do today so you go these computers gonna take our jobs and then you now you\n\n01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.880\nknow today you need to take a ball peen hammer and you just smash a computer like at least that's\n\n01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:49.520\nsomething to do and i i'm kind of advocating for the chimpanzee model because i'm like yeah today\n\n01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:55.280\nwe could just look at a chimp before they're extinct and go what do you think and their unspoken\n\n01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:02.160\nanswer would be you guys are nailing it you have nailed it you need to stop nailing stop making\n\n01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:09.840\nmore sure you are i understand um the alarm instinct has made you guys like like very successful\n\n01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.440\nbut you are alarmed by each other now which makes no sense you're alarmed by nothing you're alarmed\n\n01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:24.240\nby silence you're alarmed by happiness yeah you're uh and the the the uh yeah but anyways um i uh\n\n01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.880\nhow do we end the
