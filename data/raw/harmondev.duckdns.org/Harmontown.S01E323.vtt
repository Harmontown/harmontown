WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.760
I'm Brandon Johnson, I'm sitting in for Jeff Davis, who we love so much, do we not?

00:17.760 --> 00:21.960
Spencer Crittenden is not with us tonight, we love him so much, do we not?

00:21.960 --> 00:28.160
Well, let's just get started, we love you downtown, Dynasty Theater, welcome to the

00:28.160 --> 00:29.160
stage.

00:29.160 --> 00:36.160
This is Dr. Dan Holman and Rob Schrupp.

00:36.160 --> 00:42.160
Rob Schrupp, everybody.

00:42.160 --> 00:51.160
Whoa, look at that comfortable chair, boy.

00:51.160 --> 00:57.160
Oh, you just get everything you want, don't you?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.400
Nice, comfortable chair.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.760
It's very nice.

01:02.760 --> 01:12.520
For those of you who tune in for the serialized aspect of our show, Schrab complains about stuff,

01:12.520 --> 01:18.640
and then the next episode, people have indulged him.

01:18.640 --> 01:24.880
He mentioned the chairs were uncomfortable, now he's in a big Lily Tomlin overstuffed

01:24.880 --> 01:32.120
prop sofa, I hope you get lumbar problems tonight, I hope that's too much comfort for

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
this podcast.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.280
More lumbar, more lumbar problems.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.240
You guys want to go to lumbar later and silver went like, it's never been better if it came

01:41.240 --> 01:42.240
out clean.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.240
Okay.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
What?

01:44.240 --> 01:45.240
Nothing.

01:45.240 --> 01:51.720
It's a hipster bar, it's all about lower back support and infusion drinks, lumbar.

01:51.720 --> 01:59.880
All right, there's only one, I feel like there's a voice in my head that says, Harmon,

01:59.880 --> 02:09.600
you're going to fuck this up, but I keep every week that goes by and I don't bring

02:09.600 --> 02:17.720
this up, another week goes by where it's like footprints in the snow, I had this experience

02:17.720 --> 02:24.680
at a bar in Burbank and I wrote down the kind of flowchart through it, I was there with

02:24.680 --> 02:30.040
a friend who kind of like, I digested it with him afterwards, so I got it all down accurately

02:30.040 --> 02:39.880
and I wanted to just relay this like fan encounter I had, I'm not sure now, and then

02:39.880 --> 02:46.800
the only reason I want to do it is because I just found it incredibly fascinating and

02:46.800 --> 02:52.760
it probably goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway, that I have no problem how

02:52.760 --> 02:59.800
you approach me, like I mean it would be weird to punch me, a lot of people make jokes and

02:59.800 --> 03:08.400
like, you know, if it's helpful to you to understand, like, you know, I could tell you

03:08.400 --> 03:13.920
that there's things that are like, oh, how am I supposed to react to that, you know,

03:13.920 --> 03:19.960
but I also, you get one thing, I kind of want to run through all of the things I cringe

03:19.960 --> 03:27.400
about when I think about, like, so many times I've been near anybody and I just, you had

03:27.400 --> 03:33.640
that urge to like, you know, like, hey, what am I going to be in the same billiard hall

03:33.640 --> 03:39.240
as this person and I'm not going to bother to, like that, I'm going to tell J.K.

03:39.240 --> 03:43.880
Rollins, what's up? Yeah, I'm going to tell you, like, that's J.K.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.640
Rollins and I'll even be the first to say, like, maybe you haven't even read Harry Potter

03:48.640 --> 03:51.760
and that happens and you're kind of like, there's a little blurry line, but I will

03:51.760 --> 03:56.840
say the people that usually come up to me because I'm not like, you know, if you recognize

03:56.840 --> 04:05.120
my face in a bar, probably means that you're kind of deep in and it's usually a very pleasant

04:05.120 --> 04:11.400
experience and sometimes it's a little socially awkward. I think I could name two times, including

04:11.400 --> 04:16.800
now this last time, this is two in like 10 years, where I've been like, well, that guy

04:16.800 --> 04:23.120
is kind of evil and a dick, but both times, I don't think the person didn't really know

04:23.120 --> 04:29.680
me that. And I've done that too. I remember in Milwaukee, we were famous for, one of our

04:29.680 --> 04:35.800
exports was a band called the Bodines. What was their big famous song?

04:35.800 --> 04:43.600
Oh, I'm looking for a runaway. Or is it going to take my heart away for me? I'm going to

04:43.600 --> 04:52.560
get the runaway. I'm a Bodine. Yeah. And I was at my, the drawing room of Milwaukee,

04:52.560 --> 05:01.760
which was called the Uptowner and a very fancy place. And it wasn't, there was a guy drinking

05:01.760 --> 05:06.640
at the end of the bar and a friend of mine said, that's so and so from the Bodines. And

05:06.640 --> 05:13.520
they gave me a name and I went up to them. My mom loved that song. I'm looking for a

05:13.520 --> 05:19.520
hideaway, going to get a runaway. And I lived in Milwaukee. I was 19 years old. I shouldn't

05:19.520 --> 05:24.400
have been at a bar, but and I was like, I went up and I said, like Jimmy or Jody or

05:24.400 --> 05:31.480
Gigi or whatever the name was, my mom's a big fan of your band. Could I get an autograph

05:31.480 --> 05:35.800
and he signed some shit that I looked at later. And it was basically like, Oh, fuck yourself

05:35.800 --> 05:40.120
or something like, like, like not, not, not like aggressive, but it was sort of like whatever

05:40.120 --> 05:43.160
I had said to him, it was, you know, it was kind of clear that he was like, here's what

05:43.160 --> 05:48.800
you get for not knowing who I am, what my song is and telling me your mom likes me,

05:48.800 --> 05:53.480
like here's your fucking, you know, worthless thing for sure. You're not walking out of

05:53.480 --> 05:58.080
here with anything worth anything. Yeah. And I remember that still because I'm embarrassed

05:58.080 --> 06:06.040
that I did that. But like, do I I mean, therefore I guess I should say not but I I don't I don't

06:06.040 --> 06:12.240
judge anybody whoever like kind of maybe has like a moment where they're like, Oh my God,

06:12.240 --> 06:17.720
like it's you. It's like such a flattering thing, obviously. And and if they then like

06:17.720 --> 06:21.800
have spit come out of their mouth or they or they or they do the mental equivalent, which

06:21.800 --> 06:26.760
is like they try to nag me, you know, like there's some people that do that. They're

06:26.760 --> 06:31.440
like, people think sometimes if they're rude to celebrities, it'll be cool. I mean, so

06:31.440 --> 06:35.720
I feel like I hopefully have just claimed that enough to say like, this is not me going

06:35.720 --> 06:44.120
like I met the biggest douchebag and here's blow by blow, everything he did wrong. But

06:44.120 --> 06:51.480
it I mean, it is that but it's like it's not that is not. It's just to I still I if this

06:51.480 --> 06:55.160
guy was listening, I would want him to know and I at the point of the stories, there's

06:55.160 --> 06:59.680
no way this guy's listening. But the I would also want to know you did nothing wrong. You

06:59.680 --> 07:04.240
don't have to you could erase this from your head. It is not on your karma. There's so

07:04.240 --> 07:11.400
you were at a bar and somebody came up to you and started talking to you. I'm just trying

07:11.400 --> 07:21.480
to find. So that was the setup. Okay, I'm trying to figure out what to type so I can

07:21.480 --> 07:33.440
find it. I'm never going to find it. Are you? Are you? No, Schrab, do you have any advice

07:33.440 --> 07:43.680
for people who come up to celebrities? Do I have any advice? No, no, not really. I mean,

07:43.680 --> 07:47.560
I think we just told the we told the company story last time, right? Yeah, we told that

07:47.560 --> 07:52.240
sorry. I mean, I think we were we were having we were having a pretty good time. That was

07:52.240 --> 07:58.160
a pretty historical night for me at least. Yeah, I met red buttons Tony. Oh, no, you

07:58.160 --> 08:00.720
thought you're thinking of Hasselhoff. That's the Hasselhoff story. We've also told that

08:00.720 --> 08:07.600
a couple times. Yeah. What's the finish to this story? The company story. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.720
We told that here. Yeah, we told it here. Yeah. Okay. What about the finish to this

08:11.720 --> 08:16.360
story? Okay, all right, all right, all right. Okay, you're not getting out of this. You're

08:16.360 --> 08:20.320
not getting out of this one. All right, so I'm going from memory because it was like

08:20.320 --> 08:25.720
in my mind it's like a it's like a flow chart where every time this guy has a chance to like

08:25.720 --> 08:34.360
go left but he drills down. Okay, so I'm sitting at this billiard hall in Burbank where I write

08:34.360 --> 08:41.640
most of Rick and Morty and I like there's this it's a sometimes inexplicably in Burbank

08:41.640 --> 08:45.160
there's this like, I don't know if it's like billiard leagues or something like the place

08:45.160 --> 08:51.640
is packed. And I'm like typing and then as a guy comes up and I see him peripherally

08:51.640 --> 08:59.720
and he's kind of like he's he's he's bobbin and weaving and he's like captivated. And

08:59.720 --> 09:06.840
then he he walks away for a second and he comes back and he goes, excuse me, has anybody

09:06.840 --> 09:16.960
ever told you you look exactly like Justin Roiland? And I think I think I've gotten that

09:16.960 --> 09:23.360
one before like like as a as a bit now now now zoom in on my flow chart where you go.

09:23.360 --> 09:29.600
Okay, like this could be this could be a great guy, right? That could be a funny bit, right?

09:29.600 --> 09:36.720
Of course. Um, it actually didn't even occur to me that it did not occur to me. I assumed

09:36.720 --> 09:44.960
automatically. I was like, I was like, okay, what he means is a big fan of your your who

09:44.960 --> 09:50.800
you are. And not that I would mind if he doomed to not recognize me and confuse me with someone

09:50.800 --> 09:54.480
else. That would be fine too. But it didn't occur to me. I just assume I processed it like

09:54.480 --> 09:58.880
he's doing a bit. He doesn't he doesn't want to he doesn't want to be regular, right? He wants

09:58.880 --> 10:04.080
to do it. He wants to be he wants to be fun. And and I could just laugh it down. I can go, ha, ha, ha.

10:06.160 --> 10:14.160
And and I go, yeah, I get that a lot. So that's me. Yes, Andy. Him. I get that a lot.

10:14.160 --> 10:21.680
And then and then and then he goes, whoa, whoa, uh, wait, God damn it. See, the thing is I needed

10:21.680 --> 10:26.080
my fucking notes because it's like he did so many things wrong, so many things. And they were all

10:26.080 --> 10:32.800
like one after another for the first one. But I can't I skip if I could skip to easily because

10:32.800 --> 10:39.440
he just I mean, I should I should bail on the whole thing. Can we can we just try one more time?

10:39.440 --> 10:43.280
All right. Well, that's just because he's a great part. Let me let me think about it. Just like,

10:43.280 --> 10:48.240
don't don't drop. Give us advice. Help me with my phobia of uncomfortable pauses. We got you

10:48.240 --> 10:51.440
shop. Let me advice and take off your shirt.

10:55.040 --> 11:02.080
Cold. Okay, okay. Yes, he's a genius. Trab is a genius. That's good. That's good. Okay, so he said

11:02.080 --> 11:07.040
you just arrived and I said, yeah, I get that a lot, which had just occurred to me. And I remember

11:07.040 --> 11:14.000
like, well, yes, that's yes, ending the joke. But it's also if it's technically in a technical

11:14.000 --> 11:23.360
narrative, it's saying, I'm not who you think I am. Yes. So he reacted as if that were the case and

11:23.360 --> 11:30.000
and just went like, okay, and walked away. But he like did like a two foot lap like around like an

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
invisible sunflower that he was pollinating. That was just like his own self loathing or something

11:36.000 --> 11:41.520
or like the ghost of his dad, I don't know. And then like, and then he came back and he like,

11:41.520 --> 11:51.120
he was like, no, no, it is you. It's you. I do I'd know you anywhere. And I was like, yeah,

11:51.120 --> 11:56.080
yeah, yeah, hey, how are you doing? And he's like, dude, Justin, what are you doing here?

11:56.080 --> 12:02.480
Oh, shit. And I was like, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I work here. I work or work

12:02.480 --> 12:07.920
around the back and and he and he goes, he goes, he goes, well, I don't know that.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.960
I'm not some sycophantic fucking ass kiss fan. I don't like worship your fucking life and know

12:14.960 --> 12:18.960
every goddamn detail of it. And I was like, that's cool. You don't have to.

12:20.560 --> 12:26.240
Did you, but it is Los Angeles. And what am I, what am I doing here?

12:26.240 --> 12:30.880
I thought you would, I thought you would shake him down in Justin's voice.

12:33.520 --> 12:38.880
Anyways, but, but, but, but why didn't you just say, I'm not Justin, you're wrong about that

12:38.880 --> 12:45.120
shit too, bitch. No, no, that's not fair. You don't, you don't have to say no, big, you're

12:45.120 --> 12:50.640
putting I am not because, because I also, I didn't, but he shit on you. Once he shit on you,

12:50.640 --> 12:54.160
can't you be like, motherfucker, you don't even know who you talking to. No, because, well,

12:54.160 --> 12:59.600
wait a minute. I'm going to be right about this. You're going to see because, because yeah, he

12:59.600 --> 13:06.160
shit on me. I'm thinking what I'm thinking at this point is he, he's, he's going to be embarrassed

13:06.160 --> 13:10.400
at some point and I could keep him from embarrassment. You know, it's like, like a parsley in your

13:10.400 --> 13:15.200
teeth, but it's like, if someone with parsley in their teeth was like biting you, like he's,

13:15.200 --> 13:20.800
he's, he's already being a bad person. So I was like, well, good, I can't wait for you to get the

13:20.800 --> 13:29.040
selfie, tag it and feel like a terrible piece of shit. Just enough. Like it's fine. And then every,

13:29.040 --> 13:34.640
all justice is done. And, and then, and so he, there were some other things he, god damn it,

13:34.640 --> 13:39.200
I swear they were like 90 fucking things. And I was like, really that decision, that choice,

13:39.200 --> 13:43.680
that's amazing. Like, like, like you, like the flow chart just has these clear, like the, you

13:43.680 --> 13:46.960
know, like the thing goes, this is like two of them, you know, one that like,

13:46.960 --> 13:53.200
you actually kept it going after he was being aggressive. I didn't keep shit going. I'm a

13:53.200 --> 13:58.160
dude sitting at a bar. Did you shut it down? Did you shut something down? You, that, that's you

13:58.160 --> 14:02.400
being like, I kind of respect that you were like in for the bit so you could fuck him up with this

14:02.400 --> 14:07.440
selfie. That is some game master type shit. I will always yes, and you I'm never going to be like,

14:07.440 --> 14:14.160
excuse me, I'm eating. Like, like, if I, that means like my mom died or like you have a hockey

14:14.160 --> 14:18.800
mask on, I don't know. Like, like, I'm never going to be like, I don't consider that fair to like

14:18.800 --> 14:24.880
turn me into the, you know, like to put that on me that I have to become the person that, that,

14:24.880 --> 14:30.080
that radiates negativity because you decided to pee in the pool. You know, like, I'm just like,

14:30.960 --> 14:36.240
best I could do is be like, I'm swimming in pee now. So I love it. So after he was like going,

14:36.240 --> 14:42.400
I'm not some kind of sick fan. You went, you just went, okay. I was like, yeah, that's fine.

14:42.400 --> 14:47.520
Yeah, that's what you would do to it. You know, and you and I are not good people. We're passive

14:47.520 --> 14:52.960
aggressive. We're from Wisconsin. You know, I've seen you interact with a million terrible people,

14:52.960 --> 14:58.080
and you always do the exact same thing. The shittier they get, the more you're like, okay, yeah,

14:58.080 --> 15:02.240
all right. Yeah. And then you'll throw in something like, like, if they're giving you a note on your

15:02.240 --> 15:06.160
comic book, you'll go like, okay, yeah, well, I'm probably going to keep doing whatever the fuck

15:06.160 --> 15:10.960
I wanted to do. But it was nice talking to you, you know, like that's, but I don't have anything

15:10.960 --> 15:18.080
to say in this situation because he's not telling me how to do the voices better. Okay. So, so keep

15:18.080 --> 15:24.400
doing whatever the fuck you want to do. What? Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.160
I get it. Game record math game.

15:28.160 --> 15:38.400
All right. What is that? What is that? Is that a candle? It's a hot signature.

15:39.440 --> 15:44.560
That's a hot signature. All right. Let me just let me just like teleport to the end and we'll bring

15:44.560 --> 15:52.640
our guests out. It's a hot signature. I got the thing that blew my mind is he goes like, hey,

15:52.640 --> 15:58.240
let me get it. Like, can I get a selfie with you? And I was like, yeah, no problem. And I took the

15:58.240 --> 16:03.920
selfie with it. Then it's not a selfie. I guess it is. I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:03.920 --> 16:09.680
I shouldn't be doing it. And then and then he and then he walked away and my Mike, Mike Waldron

16:09.680 --> 16:13.360
and I were sitting there, we're working on Rick and Morty and I was like, and we he was marveling

16:13.360 --> 16:17.440
at the whole thing and we were comparing notes and it was like, he was like, well, how often and

16:17.440 --> 16:26.560
it was like not not like that. No. And he's like, so he's gonna he's gonna go post it, tag it. And

16:26.560 --> 16:32.800
if I know, if I know our fan base, like he's gonna know in five seconds that he should kill

16:32.800 --> 16:41.440
himself and die by fire and all this stuff. What happened? But the crazy thing is that the guy,

16:42.000 --> 16:46.640
the guy absolutely like it was a selfie on the way out, like he was there for stuff. And then he

16:46.640 --> 16:50.800
was like, one last thing. Can I get a picture? That was the thing like he waited until the end

16:50.800 --> 16:55.120
because why wouldn't you and then he and then he and then he and so then he left and it was like,

16:55.120 --> 16:59.120
we really thought I was like, I was like, and so that the epilogue of that story will be forever

16:59.120 --> 17:06.720
unseen. And and then and then and then but then five minutes later, he came back and he was like,

17:06.720 --> 17:18.400
dude, Dan, I just wanted to congratulate you on out trolling me on that joke I was doing,

17:19.120 --> 17:26.800
where I pretended to think you were Justin and you fucking just stuck it out. And I didn't

17:26.800 --> 17:31.200
think you'd do that. But that was, you know, congratulations. That was amazing, you know,

17:31.200 --> 17:36.800
but whatever. I knew who you were the whole time. Yeah, well, guess what? Amateur hour.

17:38.400 --> 17:43.920
Fucking with a real comedian and you're walking up with your whack ass basement bargain joke.

17:43.920 --> 17:49.120
It was cute until you got aggressive. But now that you've met the real Dan Harmon and

17:49.120 --> 17:55.840
fucked up in front of them, leave. But you know, you know, he was gonna just come over and say,

17:55.840 --> 18:02.160
can I buy you a drink, motherfucker? But you know, he wasn't he wasn't because I read through this

18:02.160 --> 18:08.880
a thousand times. Like he he was he was he was he was revising he came back. Yeah,

18:08.880 --> 18:14.720
to salvage completely needless like salvage. It's like you didn't have anything to salvage

18:14.720 --> 18:20.000
ever. Like, like, what are you? You're like that. I was the one blower. But in whose eyes was like,

18:20.000 --> 18:24.640
Oh, remember that guy. Hey, remember me like this. I'm not gonna remember. I'm gonna get I'm

18:24.640 --> 18:27.280
not even gonna remember the details of the story while I'm shit talking you.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.880
Damn, dude, I'm blowing up.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.080
Shit, it's him.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.320
Her during real time, Justin didn't like what you said.

18:41.760 --> 18:47.120
And it was it was it was a bad it was I will forever regret this because I was I was like I

18:47.120 --> 18:50.720
knew it. It's been like three weeks. I was like, Oh, you never told that story. I would have had

18:50.720 --> 18:56.000
like some I would have had the whole thing in my head. It was it's bad podcasting. But that's why

18:56.000 --> 19:03.840
you're here. I mean, otherwise, you're just you're you're you're you're you're you're experimenting.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.240
I guess you're walking around downtown and you're like, let's go to a podcast we don't know is bad

19:08.240 --> 19:13.120
yet. Let's see if it's bad. If those people I feel bad for the rest of you, you're getting what you

19:13.120 --> 19:21.120
paid for, you know that. But sometimes we also have guests come on. This one is no exception.

19:25.040 --> 19:32.560
Just gets better and better. Really, really. That was a fun like kind of alt comedy intro.

19:32.560 --> 19:37.520
Yeah, I wrote a new dry alt comedy kind of like way of introducing people.

19:37.520 --> 19:47.200
I just I this is one of those one of those one of those shows that I've been hearing about forever.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.400
That's always like you should watch this. It's really funny. I could see from the ads. It probably

19:50.400 --> 19:56.560
was never did just dove into it. I fully admittedly because he was coming to the to the show. I'm so

19:56.560 --> 20:01.040
impressed with his stuff. Can't wait to talk to him about it and other stuff because there's a lot

20:01.040 --> 20:05.200
of stuff he's able to talk about and he ruins it all. Please welcome Adam Conover from Adam ruins

20:05.200 --> 20:24.640
everything. So nice to be here. What do they call a person that is it a polydact? Is that a word?

20:25.680 --> 20:32.560
Yeah, a person who's got more than one hand. Oh, no, I think it's a person who knows more than

20:32.560 --> 20:38.400
one thing. Is that is that will that be polydact? I think so. I think so. Polymath, polymath.

20:38.400 --> 20:44.640
I think it might be polymath. Anyways. Yeah, I thank you. This has been great.

20:46.160 --> 20:50.720
I watched like five episodes of your show today. Thank you. Popped around multiple seasons and

20:50.720 --> 20:56.960
stuff. I was really, really impressed now. And we'll get the plug in out of the way is that

20:56.960 --> 21:02.560
it's a it may be an ill timed plug, but like there's stuff coming up in July. Was that it?

21:02.560 --> 21:08.080
Yeah, yeah, we've got new episodes. We got new episodes up in July. We are on Netflix now,

21:08.080 --> 21:11.760
which is very exciting. And we also have new episodes coming out at the end of March on

21:11.760 --> 21:16.800
Netflix. They're not new, but they're new to Netflix. So but it's weird because people who

21:16.800 --> 21:21.200
just have Netflix are like behind everybody else, but they don't even know that there's

21:21.200 --> 21:25.120
more episodes of the show to watch. It's a very strange state of affairs. That's cool because

21:25.120 --> 21:31.360
yeah, that satisfaction of when that Netflix seal opens and you know, you're going to get like

21:31.360 --> 21:39.120
0.03 cents more. Is that what happens? We have not we have not gotten a like a residuals round

21:39.120 --> 21:44.000
on it yet. I don't know how that Netflix doesn't do back end. If you didn't get any money the day

21:44.000 --> 21:48.800
Netflix came into your life, then you're never going to see any. No, it means they just they

21:48.800 --> 21:53.760
just came in your window and took your dresser. It's a weird they're like what you wanted people

21:53.760 --> 22:01.520
to see you. Yeah, it's really weird. The state of affairs of being like a modern creative person

22:01.520 --> 22:08.160
is like just hoping that a platform bestows its unearned like sea of eyeballs on you in like a

22:08.160 --> 22:14.080
windfall and then hoping to God it doesn't go away for no reason later that you don't get

22:14.080 --> 22:19.440
fucked by some algorithm tweak that they made to try to stop anti-vaxxers or something. Suddenly

22:19.440 --> 22:25.680
no one's watching you now. It's bizarre. What's the what's the viewership like on true TV? What

22:25.680 --> 22:32.560
kind of world are you mired in? Are they are they are they are they are you mired or are you more

22:32.560 --> 22:39.040
in a quagmire and are you I just mean like do you get emails that are like well 0.7 last night

22:39.040 --> 22:44.880
not as good as we hoped but is it still that world in basic cable or yeah I mean it's I don't

22:44.880 --> 22:50.720
know the you know I sort of don't find out the week to week you know I get told hey the premiere

22:50.720 --> 22:56.000
was good and then I get told later on you know oh we did you know you did okay or it was flat or

22:56.000 --> 23:03.040
whatever but I mean the numbers are crazy like we heard last year that like oh well you know we

23:03.040 --> 23:08.400
you know the numbers were other it was flat your ratings didn't go up from year two to year three

23:08.400 --> 23:13.200
right and I say oh it's a little disappointing and then I found out later that the ratings for

23:13.200 --> 23:19.600
all of cable television had dropped 10% in one year so we were flat we went up yeah like we're

23:19.600 --> 23:24.000
we're beating everybody else it's like I keep telling me people about my weight I'm 46 years old

23:25.360 --> 23:31.040
if I get a little bit fatter that means I'm like fucking like ripped like I'm like I'm like

23:31.040 --> 23:36.400
actively not acroding like I'm not exploding you know anyways but but that was the same as like

23:36.400 --> 23:42.160
like when I was at NBC it was like but except the worst part was like they didn't that at least you

23:42.160 --> 23:49.360
could well you said you found out later but like it was it was years of Venice sinking and being

23:49.360 --> 23:53.680
measured as sinking but everyone just kept blaming the shows like yeah like how can you

23:53.680 --> 24:00.000
blame all of the shows for all shows failing in ratings like if the office is also failing

24:00.720 --> 24:06.240
by the same amount you have to take that part off of yelling at me now now they're starting I

24:06.240 --> 24:10.720
am totally with that and now they're they're starting to get it and you I have conversations

24:10.720 --> 24:16.080
with TV executives more where they say like yeah you know we gotta we gotta get on some new platforms

24:16.080 --> 24:22.480
I mean cable television just is not doing well I'm like you're a cable executive where are you

24:22.480 --> 24:28.400
gonna go no it's cool I just found out my company's buying an oil company uh next week like I pretty

24:28.400 --> 24:34.400
soon we're gonna be Time Warner Mobile um they're they're trying to start you know Turner's starting

24:34.400 --> 24:41.120
a streaming service sometime hopefully before LA collapses into the ocean and I think that's

24:41.120 --> 24:45.280
their next big thing but we're doing what I mean look we have true TV is a great audience

24:45.280 --> 24:49.920
you know in practical jokers is on our network and that's the best thing ever because in practical

24:49.920 --> 24:55.760
jokers if you guys have seen the show wonderful show wonderful prank show they run it like 23

24:55.760 --> 25:01.120
and a half hours a day it's just true TV is on demand in practical jokers and it's one of the

25:01.120 --> 25:05.440
most popular shows on cable right and then people who are just sitting there watching practical

25:05.440 --> 25:09.840
jokers and after a while my show comes on and they go oh what's this hey I like that too and so

25:09.840 --> 25:16.000
that's good for me we always have the best lead in on the network no matter what happens and yours

25:16.000 --> 25:20.240
isn't yours isn't constantly being run because that's another factor yeah they do right they

25:20.240 --> 25:24.400
we do pretty good in reruns too they give us you know they'll do two hour blocks throughout the year

25:24.400 --> 25:28.640
and stuff like that I'll say adult swim they don't they don't either maybe this is privileged maybe

25:28.640 --> 25:34.960
because we're a gigantic hit you're welcome yeah I don't think it is because I mean we were I mean

25:34.960 --> 25:43.360
adult swim never they I haven't heard a goddamn decimal number since I left NBC really I adult

25:43.360 --> 25:47.680
swims well they're making their money a thousand ways they've got it you know like you're you're

25:47.680 --> 25:53.360
on lunch boxes yeah not lunch boxes but they run their programming like yeah just on this big round

25:53.360 --> 26:01.200
clock a big round clock um Harmon explains television uh but and then and then and this how would you

26:01.200 --> 26:05.920
even be able to yell at anybody like oh it looks like you're taking a dip it's like what what what

26:05.920 --> 26:12.320
dip like maybe maybe yeah maybe you've accidentally adequately captured the appeal of the show maybe

26:12.320 --> 26:17.200
80 people want to watch it at 9 a.m. yeah and then another 10 people want to watch it an hour later

26:17.200 --> 26:23.440
um but anyways but uh I just well so that that's that's us ruining television maybe

26:23.440 --> 26:30.000
ruining a cable but um I'm very happy to be surviving in the it's so it's there's it everything

26:30.000 --> 26:33.840
is exploding right now in a million ways and everything's being disrupted so it's I'm very

26:33.840 --> 26:38.480
happy to just be surviving at all it's a great it's a great show I did that that's the that's the

26:38.480 --> 26:45.360
that's the important news is that creatively and I biggest compliment uh I I have is that I was so

26:45.360 --> 26:51.360
I had so much shit to do today I I I'm in I'm in big trouble I'm like I'm like really really

26:51.360 --> 26:55.440
behind on a draft and I wasn't using you to procrastinate because I really did want to

26:55.440 --> 27:01.200
finish my fucking draft but I knew I had to watch at least an episode of your show thank you and I

27:01.200 --> 27:07.120
and I did and then I watched five and I had to peel myself away I was really I really thank you

27:07.120 --> 27:13.040
like it I I I let's figure out later if this was a good or a bad idea how many people in the

27:13.040 --> 27:19.200
audience by applause have seen this show oh my gosh that's pretty nice I mean I that's a good way

27:19.200 --> 27:24.480
and if there's anybody if you're focusing on the negative space that means potential yeah that's

27:24.480 --> 27:28.080
now there now we're now we're marketing and then yeah those other people are like well what are

27:28.080 --> 27:34.240
the clapping people know I don't know uh I want to be a clapping person one one one reason why

27:34.240 --> 27:40.880
maybe people I to use my eye statements like I think a reason I didn't I didn't flock to it

27:40.880 --> 27:48.240
is I live in fear of my own cynicism and stuff I struggle so hard to stay positive yeah even

27:48.240 --> 27:55.520
humanity and stuff and uh I remember I think the dark kind of clubfooted cousin of your show is

27:55.520 --> 28:03.040
Penn and Teller's bullshit on Showtime yeah I I have a I love that show when it came out and uh

28:03.040 --> 28:06.960
but there were certain things that that there's certain things totally that that show did that

28:06.960 --> 28:11.920
I knew that I wanted to do something a little bit different from um but I love I'm a huge fan of

28:11.920 --> 28:16.960
Penn and Teller um and uh and what those guys do their show in Vegas is incredible if you've

28:16.960 --> 28:22.080
you've never seen it um just a little myth busters in there as well in oh and myth busters in terms

28:22.080 --> 28:27.440
of influence on on our show uh a little bit except we're not we never do experiments and things

28:27.440 --> 28:34.240
like that I'm like not handy at all you know like there's no like live demos um but uh yeah a little

28:34.240 --> 28:39.360
bit you know but I do think I think that the the incredible exception that made a difference which

28:39.360 --> 28:43.760
is immediately apparent from the pilot and then it's there in every show I mean one of the things

28:43.760 --> 28:50.160
is that tonally there is just a clear difference in that it's like comedy versus tragedy kind of

28:50.160 --> 28:56.880
thing like it's like at the end of the day either your show believes the viewer should kill themself

28:56.880 --> 29:04.800
or not um and and your show like it has this it it has this heart to it in fact it's inviting

29:04.800 --> 29:10.880
people up to skepticism and yeah set us as if it's not implying that uh if you didn't already know

29:10.880 --> 29:18.960
this you it's because you're dumb and um and and also like um now that you know this you know that

29:18.960 --> 29:24.400
life means less yeah it's the opposite I mean the the one of the modos of the show is that my

29:24.400 --> 29:28.880
character has and that I have personally is it's always better to know that I don't believe that

29:28.880 --> 29:32.720
there's any you know there's any virtue and ignorance whatsoever and that you're always

29:32.720 --> 29:37.920
better knowing the truth and the reason is because that makes you more powerful and capable and

29:38.640 --> 29:44.800
you know more able in the world um and so we want to make a show that that shows that um but I'm not

29:44.800 --> 29:50.320
a negative or cynical person by nature um and so it was important to us to have that positive

29:50.320 --> 29:54.480
thing at the end although I think it was actually on the pilot I think it was the best network

29:54.480 --> 29:58.480
note I've ever gotten where they were like you need something positive at the end like the four oh

29:58.480 --> 30:03.840
man we're a four we're a four act show and they were like the fourth act should be just an uplifting

30:03.840 --> 30:08.560
message of some kind you know um and that's the best on paper that sounds like the it's a

30:08.560 --> 30:13.920
prototypical terrible studio yeah exactly like oh come on I gotta find a positive spin every time

30:13.920 --> 30:21.680
right can they can can can can the can can I I was gonna try to riff the name of like a character

30:21.680 --> 30:25.840
that's like a guy you love to hate I was like can Rick can Rick from Rick and Morty can he be good

30:25.840 --> 30:30.480
at his job yeah I was like yeah no exactly it's not a dog that he loves just to show us that you

30:30.480 --> 30:38.400
know yeah it sounds too polyanna but in this case what was the hardest uh positive fourth act piece

30:38.400 --> 30:43.600
like what was the hardest one you think you did that or are they all like oh it's actually

30:43.600 --> 30:47.760
there's always something positive on well there's somewhere the ones that work the best are where

30:47.760 --> 30:52.240
there's a specific thing that people can do where it's like now that you know this instead of doing

30:52.240 --> 30:55.440
the bad thing that you were doing before here's the good thing that you can do you know instead of

30:55.440 --> 31:00.800
like giving you know instead of buying Tom shoes in our pilot you can give money to people directly

31:00.800 --> 31:05.520
and that's much better for them right um the hard ones are where it's like really diffuse like what

31:05.520 --> 31:11.360
the solution is um like our climate change episodes are the most difficult ones and we did

31:11.360 --> 31:17.840
this whole episode where about climate change um that uh was very important to me we did it in uh

31:18.480 --> 31:25.200
2016 and the big takeaway at the end and this was like literally me go that a lot of times

31:25.200 --> 31:30.640
I'm working through it myself you know um like I I was literally wrestling with what the fuck

31:30.640 --> 31:36.240
are we gonna do about climate change no one is making any progress um how do I think about this

31:36.240 --> 31:41.600
because it seems really dire and we talked to this um climate thinker and philosopher Dale

31:41.600 --> 31:46.000
Jameson who made the point that like look it's not when people talk about climate change and they

31:46.000 --> 31:50.880
say the end of the world is coming if we don't do this the world is gonna end that's always false

31:50.880 --> 31:55.680
right um you can always make a choice today to make a better tomorrow no matter how things no

31:55.680 --> 31:59.760
matter how bad things are gonna get you're never off the hook right um because there's no there's

31:59.760 --> 32:04.080
no such thing as the apocalypse right because there'll always be people who are living um and

32:04.080 --> 32:08.080
he said the best reason to be positive is because of the Paris agreement because every country came

32:08.080 --> 32:13.120
together and it just happened every country came together and made this agreement and so we did an

32:13.120 --> 32:17.200
episode where we talked about that you know that that was the fourth act thank god for the Paris

32:17.200 --> 32:22.720
agreement because this is the best sign we've ever had and then and then and then between

32:22.720 --> 32:30.480
shooting and airing was november 2016 um and uh we had to release a we released a little bumper

32:30.480 --> 32:36.560
at the end which was like okay so the Paris agreement is uh uh we're kind of worried about

32:36.560 --> 32:44.240
it now and um you should like phone call somebody call get one of those apps and um and call it

32:44.240 --> 32:53.920
congressperson fuck you know um you got a little bobcat there oh shit yeah i become bobcat gold

32:53.920 --> 33:04.560
wait in my darker moments the uh the what the episode that really uh i i've done a five i watched

33:04.560 --> 33:09.600
but i i saw obviously when the title of the episode is different i'm like okay i'm zooming in on that

33:09.600 --> 33:15.520
and uh there's this character emily in the show who's your oft antagonist slash whatever play by

33:15.520 --> 33:21.760
emily ruining everything for her and she she wrote with you on the original college humor series he

33:21.760 --> 33:27.520
said yeah yeah um and uh plays herself i put you know her her name's emily she's not playing herself

33:28.960 --> 33:34.400
she's playing a bro it's a based on her loosely yeah but that she's um you know she she gets these

33:34.400 --> 33:42.000
episodes where she gets to ruin you yeah and um which is a combination of a corrections segment

33:42.000 --> 33:47.680
yeah which your character is excited about which i was really impressed by i thought it was such

33:47.680 --> 33:53.680
great meta storytelling like i that i love i'm really impressed with the amount of character

33:53.680 --> 33:58.480
that you're doing in a show that's just like a true tv like hey it's me this is my name and

33:58.480 --> 34:04.080
here's the thing i'm going to ruin it's like you have arcs and and each episode has a story to it

34:04.080 --> 34:09.760
it like there's and this is so cathartic for someone to finally because nobody points out this

34:09.760 --> 34:13.760
part of the show to me very rarely does someone say oh i like the story arcs you know and we

34:13.760 --> 34:19.520
put so much work into that part of the show i truly believe that that everyone notices it

34:19.520 --> 34:23.840
enjoys it but they don't in the back of their minds yeah because they're uh they're inferior

34:23.840 --> 34:32.800
non-elites um they don't have our galaxy hollywood they haven't earned the the conscious pleasure

34:34.880 --> 34:41.200
but they're allowed the unconscious they feel it deep down in their animal brain stems it's the

34:41.200 --> 34:47.440
it's the scars on my back that are shaped like joseph cambell circles that the wounds

34:48.480 --> 34:54.000
allow his work to seep in at every level for you you'll think oh i like this show

34:55.840 --> 34:56.800
i know why

35:00.800 --> 35:10.080
but uh it really i truly it really i i i here's the thing like i it for a non-fiction show to

35:10.080 --> 35:14.960
like i'm like it was like it was a little it reminded me a doctor who kind of like like

35:17.120 --> 35:22.640
because there's a consistency to your character and you have a companion yeah and she was like

35:22.640 --> 35:27.520
it's my turn to fuck with you which is like first of all here's all the shit that people have

35:27.520 --> 35:32.960
corrected us on that we did in the past and but here's the really impressive thing to me as a

35:32.960 --> 35:41.040
master storyteller in the first act of that story adam is like oh goody i love being ruined

35:41.040 --> 35:44.800
because it's like the adam's family right like like hey what if you ruined a ruin or will

35:44.800 --> 35:49.440
the ruin or would love it he loves ruination oh good more ruining and i was like well that's

35:49.440 --> 35:54.000
probably gonna just be the thing right she's gonna get increasingly frustrated but then there's this

35:54.000 --> 35:59.360
threshold that's crossed where they they get they get through the corrections and they start talking

35:59.360 --> 36:04.240
about this thing called the backfire effect which is a thing you may have heard about probably since

36:04.240 --> 36:11.920
the election um uh or maybe i mean maybe but not by that name but this idea that um uh when we uh

36:11.920 --> 36:17.840
when we're when we're emotionally connected to something that we believe um uh unlike with

36:17.840 --> 36:23.040
something else like if i said what's that you're eating and you go slim gyms and i go you know

36:23.040 --> 36:28.640
it's better is slim gyms ultra if you don't care you're probably gonna be like i'll try those yeah

36:28.640 --> 36:33.360
yeah um you love those conversations like what are you listening to the pixies that you should

36:33.360 --> 36:38.960
listen to the pokes okay uh do they both have pee in them okay i wish we had used these actouts on

36:38.960 --> 36:44.080
the show these would have been a great demonstration i wish the backfire effect happens when you tell

36:44.080 --> 36:52.000
somebody as the obvious example is who'd you vote for oh natalie portman well she rapes children

36:52.000 --> 36:57.920
um you should and she pollutes the rivers and um you didn't know that and so you should vote for

36:57.920 --> 37:02.880
bernie uh i'm trying to change the name so that we don't play so you're gonna change bernie sanderson

37:04.560 --> 37:09.280
natalie portman and bernie sanderson i'm not good at names

37:13.120 --> 37:16.560
everybody in your shows are is named who they were named i just tried to imagine

37:16.560 --> 37:23.520
someone's like no queen she was good as queen amadala is that her okay thank you um but they

37:23.520 --> 37:29.120
they it actually not only is there a deflector shield yeah actually studies have shown that if

37:29.120 --> 37:34.960
you just lob a kind of like you're wrong about everything the earth is actually round at a flat

37:34.960 --> 37:41.040
earth or if or if they're a flat earth that has linked their fucking sexuality or their their

37:41.040 --> 37:45.280
heart to flat earth which how else would you be a flat and it can be even more powerful than that

37:45.280 --> 37:49.840
my favorite example that i've ever heard is like imagine shon hanity right if shon hanity woke up

37:49.840 --> 37:54.320
tomorrow and read a study that convinced him climate change was real and we had to do everything to

37:54.320 --> 38:00.640
stop it now right his whole life is based around the opposite his career is his family his relationships

38:00.640 --> 38:05.200
to his friends are you know if he was like no no i think climate change is real he'd become a pariah

38:05.200 --> 38:09.520
among everybody he knew it's not just his emotional identity it's his social identity it's everything

38:09.520 --> 38:15.440
he is as a person so there's no way for him right your money yeah i forget heart and soul and testicles

38:15.440 --> 38:20.080
like your your it could be your wallet it could be your social standing it could be your anything if

38:20.080 --> 38:28.320
there's an investment there the the the invasion of of an alternative fact can actually make you

38:28.320 --> 38:34.160
just double down yes it's almost like your muscles your muscles tense up and and uh it this is that

38:34.160 --> 38:38.960
the so not only was this an incredible episode just to learn about this stuff in a digestible

38:38.960 --> 38:44.640
way but also that i'm watching it as master storyteller um your character in the show

38:44.640 --> 38:48.560
that's the threshold he crosses where he's like yeah i don't want to hear about this

38:49.600 --> 38:55.200
yeah because it implies that your show doesn't have any value which is what my identity both the

38:55.200 --> 38:59.600
characters at any and my own personal identity is wrapped up in the premise idea that ruining

38:59.600 --> 39:06.160
everything doesn't mean anything yeah it may is how you get dr who to like yeah question himself

39:06.160 --> 39:11.760
yeah and i love that so much and it all happens just within one boxing ring with emily just dressed

39:11.760 --> 39:16.320
she's just punching you in the face telling you yeah so it's not about like uh there didn't need

39:16.320 --> 39:20.320
to be a car chase in order for this to be like a dynamic story i thought it was really cool and

39:20.320 --> 39:27.360
i'm only learning this amazing thing which it uh okay Harmon uh landed use a period

39:30.320 --> 39:36.080
you did it the back the backfire effect though so how do we oh oh the one it was like as it is

39:36.080 --> 39:40.800
explained in your show the reason for the backfire effect the software we're working with or maybe

39:40.800 --> 39:48.240
we should call the hardware yeah the hardware um the emotional wires they run faster than the logical

39:48.240 --> 39:53.920
ones yeah but you're never gonna win like we may as well just accept that humans are passionate

39:54.640 --> 39:59.840
illogical well and if we do that then it that gives us the tools that we need to overcome the

39:59.840 --> 40:06.240
backfire effect right like that my favorite thing uh about the uh segment was you know we went uh

40:06.240 --> 40:11.520
this guy who we interviewed on the show steven luandowski and his uh partners in academia wrote

40:11.520 --> 40:16.160
like a debunkers handbook um and you know that explains here's how to debunk things better um

40:16.160 --> 40:19.920
and it's a lot of stuff we already do on the show and the the thing that sticks between the most is

40:19.920 --> 40:24.240
it's about the power of stories right um that uh people so often when they believe something that's

40:24.240 --> 40:30.400
wrong they have a story about it like here's and you know you just uh like any fact that you know

40:30.400 --> 40:35.600
you probably have a story for how things got that way right america is like this because george

40:35.600 --> 40:39.760
washington chopped down the thing and the person wrote the thing and whatever right um and so if

40:39.760 --> 40:46.000
you can replace the bad story the incorrect story with a story that is both truer and more interesting

40:46.000 --> 40:50.880
right right that's how you uh can convince them and when he told me that i was like oh that's the

40:50.880 --> 40:58.160
that's our fucking show that's like all we do black history rosa parks yeah uh i i okay let's

40:58.160 --> 41:03.440
let's do it i i'm ready i'm white and i'm ready to talk about it happy february brandon

41:03.440 --> 41:12.480
um the can we give you like a list can we give you like a list of things to that you could ruin

41:12.480 --> 41:19.200
right here tonight well let's call out some stuff if we do that now then i'll be the guy that just

41:19.200 --> 41:23.920
pointed at people snapped and said black history rosa parks and then we moved on i i i have to

41:23.920 --> 41:28.720
just explain that i i i've been i've been doing like an hour of reading in the mornings before

41:28.720 --> 41:34.640
my instagram workouts now i have more to explain but i won't um but uh i'm proud of you but that i i

41:34.640 --> 41:40.000
i initially here's the here's the path that i went through i'm gonna be a hipster uh artisanal

41:40.000 --> 41:44.400
black historian for my workout so why would i do anything that we learned about in high school so

41:44.400 --> 41:49.280
let's skip rosa parks then i think first of all what that probably takes a lot of work how do you

41:49.280 --> 41:54.880
skip rosa parks probably by being smarter and spending more time so let's do rosa parks yeah

41:54.880 --> 41:59.440
then i but then so then like oh i guess what the first step is going back to like sixth grade

41:59.440 --> 42:03.680
where you you you have this george washington cherry tree story right yeah rosa parks was an

42:03.680 --> 42:09.840
old black lady who was on a bus and she had a lot of bags and she was very tired and and the climate

42:09.840 --> 42:17.200
of of racial injustice was was just like uh uh bubbling and a and a brewing and this innocent

42:17.200 --> 42:23.520
perfectly uh unaffiliated like woman who just represented all of america because she didn't

42:23.520 --> 42:28.640
want nothing to do with none of this um she was just tired and she wanted to sit down and from that

42:28.640 --> 42:33.920
sparked a revolution because and it's like now i'm realizing like that was the sinister that george

42:33.920 --> 42:38.880
washington cherry tree tree story is propaganda about hey you don't have to be an activist you

42:38.880 --> 42:44.000
should just sit down and shut the fuck up if you want to cause change like just do what makes you

42:44.000 --> 42:50.480
well but the truth is she was 40 she was so later when you're 20 you learn you you you hear these

42:50.480 --> 42:55.600
like whispers of these like hey you know that rosa parks thing it's all bullshit it was orchestrated

42:55.600 --> 43:00.080
there were a million rows of parks before rows of parks a million people sat on buses that were

43:00.080 --> 43:04.560
they weren't supposed to yeah and she and she was a she works for the n double acp what do you

43:04.560 --> 43:09.760
think about that and and it's like i got i got whispers of that i remember at some point i was

43:09.760 --> 43:16.080
like oh boy i you know yeah then you then you just read her fucking wikipedia page yeah which is not

43:16.080 --> 43:23.840
the truth probably no wikipedia but the truth is it's an amazing story yes yes she worked for the

43:23.840 --> 43:31.840
n double acp shout out to claudette colvin yeah claudette roda's oh sorry sorry claudette colvin

43:31.840 --> 43:40.480
was the 29th of february claudette colvin was the uh the original rosa parks yeah she's 15 years

43:40.480 --> 43:45.600
old yeah and she was she was pregnant so it's a little darker skinned so they were like we got

43:45.600 --> 43:50.480
this rosa parks and the wings to sort of fully illustrate your point there was a pregnant yes

43:50.480 --> 43:54.720
there was a yes and she would not have withstood yeah this is also a thing it's like do you want

43:54.720 --> 43:59.360
to put that kind of pressure on it on a young woman that is going to yeah you have to go

43:59.360 --> 44:02.880
all the way up to the supreme court everyone is going to attack you for the rest of your life

44:02.880 --> 44:09.200
rosa parks died uh she was like she was attacked for the rest of her life she lost her job as a

44:09.200 --> 44:13.680
seamstress her husband lost his job because he wasn't allowed to talk about his famous wife at work

44:13.680 --> 44:20.880
they had to change states she died alone in an apartment that was robbed like like she was robbed

44:20.880 --> 44:27.040
but then she was moved to a higher uh income apartment beautiful beautiful apartments owned by

44:27.040 --> 44:33.040
the pizza pizza people little seizures we won't name them because we have a you'll hear the ads for

44:33.040 --> 44:40.880
domino so we we have to call little seizures the pizza pizza people pizza people because what

44:40.880 --> 44:44.800
happened was she did get robbed people had sort of forgotten about her she was in detroit and then

44:46.000 --> 44:50.400
lovingly the community stepped in and said you can't rob her anymore and then she was living in

44:51.840 --> 44:56.080
hey that's rosa parks don't rob her usually they broke into her house they took all of her chairs

44:58.960 --> 45:05.680
wait really come on come on so she could never sit down is that true yeah it's awful

45:05.680 --> 45:11.120
it's awful black history month now you know the fucking truth

45:13.360 --> 45:17.040
anyways my point i just got excited because when you said that you're watching today i was like i

45:17.040 --> 45:21.360
just experienced that exact same thing is my only point well this gets to your point about about

45:21.360 --> 45:25.200
cynicism right because this is what our show this is why our show is not a cynical show because you

45:25.200 --> 45:29.440
hear those that cynical version like oh yeah rosa park she wasn't the first one there's this other

45:29.440 --> 45:34.720
girl claudette colvin who they fucked her over because they she was pregnant the first whispers

45:34.720 --> 45:38.880
are like if you knew as much as we knew you'd hate life and you'd hate everyone and you'd hate

45:38.880 --> 45:46.080
rosa parks but no it's the fact is the true story i believe is always a better story and the true

45:46.080 --> 45:51.840
story is that she was an activist and they were and they were thinking strategically and so yeah

45:51.840 --> 45:56.000
they were like hey claudette colvin that's happened to her you know what i bet we can find

45:56.000 --> 46:00.880
someone who will play better in the press it was purely strategic also claudette was sort of a

46:00.880 --> 46:05.280
bitch she was really rude and she would not do press she was like i don't like sitting down on

46:05.280 --> 46:13.520
nothing so they were like we got to swap somebody in but like that that goes to show you that goes

46:13.520 --> 46:19.200
to show you how smart and committed those activists were the nc double eight then double acp was at

46:19.200 --> 46:25.440
that time and uh and how good a job they did and the story about her being a little old lady was

46:25.440 --> 46:29.360
you know more or less created by that movement because it's a good story you know like it's it's

46:29.360 --> 46:34.240
not it's not an evil story it's like it's helpful to the movement it's it's yeah it's putting a

46:34.240 --> 46:38.880
different face on what is the set yeah the uh and that's and that's press and that's politics and

46:38.880 --> 46:42.480
that and you know there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that but you have a you have a furlough

46:42.480 --> 46:46.560
you have a fuller understanding of what the movement actually accomplished if you understood no these

46:46.560 --> 46:49.920
were activists who were trying to accomplish something and they went about it in a very smart

46:49.920 --> 46:54.560
way and you can too right and so then when you look at those kids like i don't know the kids who

46:54.560 --> 46:58.400
like want to die in feinstein this week and like went to her office and like look how smart that is

46:58.400 --> 47:03.600
you know to like hey we're children we're literal children saying hello we would like the planet to

47:03.600 --> 47:08.960
be around when we're here you know we are a and feinstein was like uh well then let me drink your

47:08.960 --> 47:17.440
blood we are we are we are a pack who has pushed these children into a senator's office the children

47:17.440 --> 47:21.120
can't tell you what school they're from because they're not supposed to be part of they're not

47:21.120 --> 47:26.720
political pawns but there is a group called the sunrise organization that hires a bunch of people

47:26.720 --> 47:33.120
to pound their way into democratic senator's offices the same move that they did to polosi

47:33.120 --> 47:37.200
it's not a bunch of kids it's not random it's a it's an orchestrated event where people have

47:37.200 --> 47:45.200
cameras where they set up old female democrats that is not a cool tactic at all oh interesting

47:45.200 --> 47:49.200
they didn't go to republic and always always always always well those those kids went to

47:49.200 --> 47:53.440
mitch mcconnell's office today they were in mitch mcconnell's up oh i don't i i right couldn't tell

47:53.440 --> 47:58.960
you the details look well we that's how you know it's a scam is that we didn't send first of all

47:58.960 --> 48:03.040
we don't use kids as pawns that that's number one number two they don't they don't send them

48:03.040 --> 48:08.480
they don't send them into a candidate who doesn't have a green plan shit a green plan right for them

48:08.480 --> 48:12.960
and when they did the same thing to polosi polosi handed them a plan why weren't those kids giving

48:12.960 --> 48:17.280
that plan before they walked in why weren't those kids hooked up with the knowledge they needed

48:17.280 --> 48:22.880
and how come those adults allowed those kids to yell at an older senator that's shit bullshit

48:22.880 --> 48:27.440
california is the greenest state in the nation take your ass to the kentucky senator's office

48:27.440 --> 48:32.160
go to philadelphia go to go to pennsylvania's office don't don't just fuck with the female

48:32.160 --> 48:38.160
candidates the female senators jam these are these are these these are don't make a two minute

48:38.160 --> 48:43.120
don't make a two minute edited tape you lost me when you posted a two minute edited tape the whole

48:43.120 --> 48:49.920
tape has her receiving those kids with love uh this brings up something i did i i was gonna

48:49.920 --> 48:56.000
like lead with tonight which would not not which was just this fascinating fact that we've now here

48:56.000 --> 49:06.720
we go here we go again two years well actually kind of three years later i i remember distinctly

49:06.720 --> 49:14.320
the point where it was where the primary season was upon us and um and i remember if you if you go

49:14.320 --> 49:19.760
back i swear if you rewind the podcast you'll listen to me being absolutely silent about politics

49:19.760 --> 49:26.320
and the reason is because it was the whole it was like hillary people versus elizabeth waran

49:26.320 --> 49:31.520
people versus bernie people versus things and i was like i through pure cowardice not through

49:31.520 --> 49:35.840
nobility because as you saw later as soon as the election happened i was like what this world's

49:35.840 --> 49:42.720
fucked i gotta say some shit um but i was just sort of like it's time for the groundhog to go

49:42.720 --> 49:49.680
back in his hole and i mean what is the it it relates to the backfire effect this idea that

49:49.680 --> 49:55.680
we're we're we all know now we're watching this we're there's a shit storm coming it's a shit

49:55.680 --> 50:01.120
storm that includes our best friends yelling at each other uh it includes this podcast possibly

50:01.120 --> 50:06.720
getting inflammatory if there's somebody out here that that that that says something it's like

50:06.720 --> 50:11.680
i remember i remember years ago you know i remember my friend heath being up here and going like well

50:11.680 --> 50:16.160
what about elizabeth waran and just like i remember other people that i respected and who i wanted to

50:16.160 --> 50:23.040
be happy like fucking basically how can i describe it other than bullying him like like like like

50:23.040 --> 50:30.560
shouting him down and like our this backfire effect means that like that's why the age old

50:30.560 --> 50:34.000
tradition of we don't talk about religion and politics right because those are the those are the

50:34.000 --> 50:41.440
those are the facts that we're all invested in which means that every time we hear something

50:41.440 --> 50:47.600
other than what we already thought we constrict right i mean people are already attaching their

50:47.600 --> 50:53.520
identities to specific candidates and specific you know like platforms and like i don't know

50:53.520 --> 50:59.280
if that's necessarily a bad thing right um i think that is kind of how it works yeah yeah i thought

50:59.280 --> 51:04.320
like 80 of the country doesn't right like they're not helping us and i think we i think we are

51:04.320 --> 51:10.800
kind of doing actual i think what it is is it's actual politics like that's actual you know

51:10.800 --> 51:16.560
political action is it's nice those conversation those arguments sounds more like people are

51:16.560 --> 51:22.800
using the words socialist fascist authoritarianism it's like we're actually doing politics in this

51:22.800 --> 51:27.920
country for the first time or at least yeah for the first time in like 50 years and so people

51:27.920 --> 51:32.000
got to like learn how to do it over again because i remember people oh don't talk about politics at

51:32.000 --> 51:37.040
a dinner party i was like why not you just say i like the president the end you know like there

51:37.040 --> 51:41.520
wasn't much or i don't like like it was i don't know it was kind of easy during the bush years

51:41.520 --> 51:47.040
too i don't like it all right moving on you know we got a couple years till the election now there's

51:47.040 --> 51:54.960
like uh you know there's actual shit to be worked out yeah i mean i didn't recognize them as politics

51:54.960 --> 52:00.320
because the morning after the election it was this thing that was making all the women cry

52:00.320 --> 52:05.200
it that that wasn't politics to me which means i'm a misogynist i was like waking up to that i'm

52:05.200 --> 52:12.000
like yeah why why is that waitress eyes so red well because something horrible happened last night

52:12.000 --> 52:18.080
that sent her a signal after like her entire life but etc etc and it'd be and as i gained access to

52:18.080 --> 52:24.240
that it wasn't the political thing to me it was me realizing i was i was part of a problem without

52:24.240 --> 52:29.760
realizing etc etc so for me it was like a journey of self-discovery and then as as my self-discovery

52:29.760 --> 52:35.120
is unfolding i'm triggering people who are going like jesus fucking christ stop talking about politics

52:35.120 --> 52:44.640
you fucking lump of fat hairy shit with gross flappy tits you disgusting soyboy fucking virtue

52:44.640 --> 52:50.640
signaling cock beta fucking pedophile fuck how did they know you were a cock

52:53.760 --> 52:57.840
well you know it's it would be cool if we didn't talk about behavior

52:57.840 --> 53:04.640
and we just talked about policy it'd be good if we got back to like let's just talk policy

53:05.280 --> 53:11.760
yeah i mean on our show like you know we do i don't want to say our show is is not political

53:11.760 --> 53:16.480
because it is because we talk about issues that can only be resolved through politics politics

53:16.480 --> 53:21.120
has all defined it half-assedly right now being like the process of how we decide what we're going

53:21.120 --> 53:25.600
to do you know in a in a country of people who have differing beliefs right how do you create a

53:25.600 --> 53:30.720
consensus or create like a dominant majority for a particular issue right but we talk about you

53:30.720 --> 53:36.160
know so we talk about like mass incarceration and and you know criminal justice and climate change

53:36.160 --> 53:42.400
and things like that we don't talk about you know we rarely say the name of a political party or

53:42.400 --> 53:47.600
like use that sort of like angle that you're going to get on it from the daily show right

53:48.400 --> 53:54.480
and part of that reason is we're trying to get to people in a more we're trying to hit people at

53:54.480 --> 54:00.080
their best and at their most thoughtful and their most open to new ideas rather than activating

54:00.080 --> 54:04.640
that identity based part of them is there an operation board game aspect to the to the back

54:04.640 --> 54:10.560
fire effect you can actually avoid let's call them trigger trigger phrases yeah a little bit

54:11.440 --> 54:18.080
you know yeah we we will we will try to make arguments that we think nobody could disagree

54:18.080 --> 54:24.720
with right like uh you know for the most part for instance when we're making an argument about uh

54:24.720 --> 54:30.640
about like that such and such a policy is like discriminatory you know everyone if you present

54:30.640 --> 54:35.760
to people the basic premise of like you know policies shouldn't be racially discriminatory

54:35.760 --> 54:40.560
right we can all agree that everyone should be treated the same by the government everyone will

54:40.560 --> 54:44.880
go yes i agree with that and then we say okay here's a case that it's not happening and then

54:44.880 --> 54:49.200
they'll go okay that probably shouldn't happen you know like though if you engage with them that

54:49.200 --> 54:53.360
way they'll they'll all agree with that that premise if you start with it where it's like

54:53.360 --> 54:58.960
this person is you know like this party is destroying america people will get there we'll

54:58.960 --> 55:04.080
get there it almost seems like we're defining diplomacy a little bit yeah yeah it seems like

55:04.080 --> 55:09.280
like like our our country was founded by a bunch of diplomats people who were like really fond and

55:09.280 --> 55:16.000
good at like talking around a topic yeah uh in in such high-flown terms that how are you

55:16.000 --> 55:22.320
gonna argue with this yeah and that maybe that's what good diplomacy is when you like every time

55:22.320 --> 55:28.560
that that every issue tends to get like pulled down into factionalism and they they love to

55:28.560 --> 55:32.480
attribute catchphrases to it yeah and those catchphrases are often indistinguishable from

55:32.480 --> 55:37.760
perfectly logical words like up in this cloud but as soon as they're down there they're off the table

55:37.760 --> 55:43.280
and so you have to be like this weird person who speaks like they sound like a fucking

55:44.320 --> 55:49.760
thesaurus because that's what we're doing is kind of like rising above everything and floating and

55:49.760 --> 55:57.120
going like well it's uh is this belief that a mankind that should prosper should but you know

55:57.120 --> 56:00.560
it's like why why aren't they just talking about the tories that we know what this is about

56:01.280 --> 56:06.400
fucking tories rule and it's uh and if they mentioned tomatoes because of that tomato riot

56:06.400 --> 56:11.200
like i know that's dog whistling yeah we we we try to avoid all that stuff you know we did an

56:11.200 --> 56:17.440
episode about about guns for our season premiere this year and we um uh in the past like our first

56:17.440 --> 56:21.440
year i was like we'll never do an episode about guns because that's like one of the big fault lines

56:21.440 --> 56:25.680
of american society like as soon as you do that episode because how do you ruin guns yeah well

56:25.680 --> 56:30.080
the well that's a good question um but you know as soon as we talk about people will be like as

56:30.080 --> 56:32.800
soon as you say okay i'm gonna do an episode about guns everyone folds their arms and they say well

56:32.800 --> 56:36.640
you better say what i want you to say well yeah i'm gonna change i'm gonna change the channel if

56:36.640 --> 56:40.720
you don't i'm gonna be watching you like a hawk you better say my side right now you know and so

56:40.720 --> 56:45.200
after doing the show for a couple years i was like i think we can do it i think we can at least

56:45.200 --> 56:51.520
make an attempt to do an episode that like gets people a little bit off balance um and hits the

56:51.520 --> 56:56.400
issue in a way that destabilizes them that hopefully they'll be a little more open-minded to that

56:56.400 --> 57:01.120
you know we we we try to hit things where everybody misunderstands about that everybody's

57:01.120 --> 57:05.360
wrong about this do you think when you ruined guns i didn't watch that episode do you think when you

57:05.360 --> 57:16.240
ruined guns that you um uh was there fixed it yes no no no i think we did it was there a uh

57:17.280 --> 57:23.040
did you kind of ruin it for everybody uh that was that was our that was our attempt i mean

57:23.040 --> 57:26.960
it was really interesting because we really want to do an episode that would speak to everybody

57:26.960 --> 57:33.120
speak to i hate saying both sides because i don't actually believe in i love for you to ruin dichotomy

57:34.160 --> 57:40.240
yeah just ruin fucking binary ruin the hegele and dialectic um the i mean that that's what

57:40.240 --> 57:43.920
we're that is what we were trying to do you know because these these coalitions are based around

57:43.920 --> 57:49.200
these catchphrases and these buzzwords that are very narrow sort of cognitive troughs that they're

57:49.200 --> 57:54.640
like stuck in you know and so we were trying to get people out of that and say hey here's a couple

57:54.640 --> 57:59.520
basic things that we can agree on and then here's a couple things that everybody is getting wrong

57:59.520 --> 58:05.600
right um so for for instance our our third act was was entirely about how guns interact with

58:05.600 --> 58:08.960
race in america which is something that you know is very rarely people who are pro gun

58:08.960 --> 58:12.400
controller very rarely having that conversation people who are pro gun rights are very rarely

58:12.400 --> 58:19.280
having that conversation um and uh uh yeah that was our that was our approach um and then we

58:19.280 --> 58:25.280
yeah i mean it was very difficult to do that without falling into both sidesism because

58:25.280 --> 58:30.720
that's the you know that's the shitty version of that hey there's a lot of shit to go around

58:30.720 --> 58:34.640
you know you're wrong you're wrong here i am in the middle like standing on top of my bullshit

58:34.640 --> 58:39.200
mountain right um but uh and i think we were if someone were to come up to me and tell me

58:39.200 --> 58:43.440
hey this was both sides bullshit i'd be like okay we did our best you know um like i'm not

58:43.440 --> 58:48.640
gonna argue with you but we tried not to do that very hard i mean that's a remarkable and chilling

58:48.640 --> 58:55.840
like description of the of the ice we're walking across where it's like there's a term now for both

58:55.840 --> 59:04.560
sidesism yeah um but yeah like i wish there weren't sides and uh yeah now the term both sides is

59:04.560 --> 59:09.760
absolutely attributable to what let's call him new hitler i don't know what i don't know what to call

59:09.760 --> 59:14.400
him bad hitler dumb hitler but yeah but literally like came out of his mouth i'm like you could never

59:14.400 --> 59:22.160
say both sides ever again yeah uh while taking yourself seriously as a uh arbiter yeah you because

59:22.160 --> 59:28.480
now and i i've actually detected that with the i've started to notice like i won't talk about

59:28.480 --> 59:33.680
freedom of speech anymore because the truth is that millennials have heard enough uh have heard

59:33.680 --> 59:41.440
that phrase so many times um yeah during um arguments about why they shouldn't uh complain about

59:41.440 --> 59:47.040
their rights their other other why they shouldn't speak up in defense of themselves even though i

59:47.040 --> 59:53.840
feel like the day i die it's it's either going to be prostate cancer a heart attack or i'm being

59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.320
shot specifically about first amendment shit um that i won't i won't talk about it anymore

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:06.640
because i sound racist when i say freedom of speech yeah yeah um because because the dialectic

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.760
the dialogue changes yeah i know what's going on back something happened back there uh blue screen

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:19.600
uh oh god oh no brandon's uh i mean this segways into well rob wanted to you want to you do you

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.760
do you have any random things you want to see if adam can ruin because he truly has ruined okay here

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:33.440
we go here we go here we go skateboards oh shit i mean uh say pass what is that i mean those i've

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.960
never seen anyone do a trick okay there is the oldest joke in the book but they always fall off

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.640
they're always like you see the guy do the flip and then he's like ah fucking he takes a couple

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.720
stutter step says the only thing i've ever seen anyone do on a skateboard awesome apples

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.960
apples uh yeah okay um apples are really interesting because uh they uh if you just like

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.520
plant an apple seed in the ground this is weird and true you get like a random apple like something

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.920
about apples mean they don't breed true they like breed in crazy ways you know so you'll get like

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.200
just a weird fucking probably inedible apple um and as a result people for most of the time

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.640
johnny apple seed he wasn't planting apples to uh you know eating they were only usable for cider

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.680
so he was actually planting booze trees all over america is a hundred percent true that's in michael

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.720
pollin's book the botany desire um and as a result what happened is if you randomly got an edible

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.320
apple you'd be like holy shit i'm gonna be a billionaire because then you would start grafting

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.960
the tree and cloning it right off of your original uh tree and so it was sort of like a striking oil

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:44.880
like to find uh an apple like oh i i uh granny smith i got it like you know um and uh so most

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:53.200
apples are clones that's uh what i know about apples yeah i mean i'm just i'm literally just

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.000
repeating things from new yorker articles like that's all that's all that's from michael pollin's

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.320
book the botany desire is that you say in the pilot you go by the way every time i say something

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.360
there's a bug up in the corner of the screen there's yeah it cites the reference i did that

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.240
specifically because i was just a comedian and i was like why should anybody believe anything i

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.800
say i need to let them know it's you know books somewhere well why else would they believe it

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.800
i do and i glance up there when you say something and i go like god damn it what and then i'll see

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.720
like slate 2011 i'll go like well you know i i'm sure that person did their reason you know what

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.040
i mean like but it's it's a proper kind of like yes it makes me feel more comfortable that's a big

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:38.000
theme of your show too is the idea that peer review and the idea of being wrong builds trust it's okay

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.680
to be wrong be wrong admit you're wrong it's the corrections page in a newspaper you know uh it's

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.680
when someone is we try to be transparent about our process so that people like uh one of our our

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.560
head of research natalie sure has a great um uh phrase for this i can't remember exactly what

01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:01.600
it was but um it's uh not the idea that someone is perfect or that you know oh sorry it's uh

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.000
credibility is more important than accuracy right um because you're not going to be a hundred percent

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.560
accurate but what you can be is as credible as you can and so you can say about someone hey they do

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:16.400
their research they uh they approach these issues in a credible you know respectful uh you know top

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.880
of their intelligence way when they're wrong they fess up to it like this is a person who i can trust

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.200
in a way right and so that's the that's the ideal that that we go that we go for yeah all you have

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.600
is your word so always you my therapist would say always use your eye statements if you're

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.320
taught you know if you're talking to somebody about emotional issues just always always make sure

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.920
you're always talking about how you feel yes that way like well you know you could be you could be a

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.200
crazy person but yeah you would be constantly people could rely on you yes you could be like

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.040
like yeah Dan's always he's nuts but i know exactly how he's nuts because he's always like

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:58.400
those windmills make me want to eat more salt and um but yeah i am now very upset about my

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.960
circumcision by the way i saw the sex episode and i did not i wasn't sure what to think about

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.440
i guess the one the what the one nice thing about it is that if i have a kid i don't think

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.400
there we go i'm pretty sure i'm not gonna have him circumvent that's my favorite thing that uh

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.240
people will come up to me and say and they'll say they'll say i didn't they'll say we didn't

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.560
circumcise our kid because of you and i say yes if you could change one life if you if you could

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:32.160
change one uh small child's penis in a positive way if now look i i just i want to say that uh

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:39.200
circumcision our position is there's no particular reason to do it right it's not a terrible thing

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.880
to do and if people do it for religious reasons that that's fine or whatever there's no medical

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.560
reason to do it and so if you're of the general position that i am which is don't perform unnecessary

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:54.560
surgeries unless you have a really good reason then hey why not not do it you know and like

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:00.240
there's certain you know uh uh yeah that that's about it but i don't i don't want to i went on

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.880
the business shame in anybody's hygiene thing but then i thought i was like wait a minute why would

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:12.560
cavemen have a piece of their penis that if left untended gives you an infection no there's no sense

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:17.360
they roll around in dirt the the forest can serves a the forest can serves a purpose it

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.520
cut it it covers the penis which is a sensitive area that could get dirty it's kind of time on

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:30.000
Harmontown in that same episode i mean you you could have broke these into three episodes but

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.040
in that same episode herpes and hymens i i was wrong about all of them two h's herpes herpes

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.480
90 of people have some form of herpes some form of herpes herpes isn't extremely uh so the problem

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.240
with herpes is that people the real scourge of herpes is that people get a herpes test and then

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.600
they're told they have herpes and then they're like oh no i have a horrible std and now i can't

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.440
have sex with normal people you know i can't i'm a pariah and they sort of feel you know like but

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.160
most people who have herpes 90 of people have some form of herpes um and then you know mouth

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.400
herpes like there's that's talking all over the body right but like so many people have herpes

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.080
don't know that they have it and that's fine because it never affects their lives at all

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.160
is it because they don't get tested or is it because it's because it's for most people it's

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.960
so asymptomatic you wouldn't know that you had it and so sometimes people i've i've talked to people

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.040
who are like i went to get an std test and i told the doctor i wanted a herpes test too and they

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:37.040
said don't get one because doctors know that you're you probably have it and finding out that you

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.800
do have it is just going to make you put a social stigma on yourself so you're better off because

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:46.080
it's a thing that like everybody everybody has now that's now you know there there are like

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.480
yeah everybody has it see

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.640
the jokes are too good to resist despite that everybody has but that yeah it's uh

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.800
it's shame i mean i love that that that uh your your episode on sex we try to remove

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.240
shank circumcision to hymen to herpes yeah and it comes around to the fourth act of

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.920
what explains all this stuff all the things that were wrong about shame yeah shame surrounding

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:23.920
sexuality little boys are having their their dick tips cut off at birth based on at best now

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.520
we're not questioning anybody if you're if you're getting your dick tip cut off for a 5000 year old

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.200
reason we're i'm not saying this podcast is not saying hey storm the gates i i i have no business

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:42.720
there but um but truthfully if you if you're just uh it's it's questionable reasons we don't there's

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.840
no science that suggests it was a fad in the 19th century that that they thought would stop kids

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.480
from masturbating yeah and that's why i took off in the united states but not in most of the world

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.400
right it was a us i do wonder what my life would be like if i masturbated more if that would be a

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.120
bad thing but i i apparently this this procedure does not stop people from masturbating i gotta say

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:07.680
it probably the main thing it's done is it's probably really increased lube sales in america

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.640
because uh the foreskin's a natural lubricant and uh if you don't have i think you need more lube

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.920
it's because it's a mucous membrane i assume because you cited you said that if you're if you're

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:28.720
gay um uh not being circumcised uh a person uh being circumcised will reduce the hiv uh uh risk

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.440
right but but but not but we're talking about so there's back versus condoms condoms reduce it by

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:44.640
80 percent i i he points at me like to continue um i uh yeah there's there's a small effect that's

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:51.840
been shown that being circumcised can really can reduce the risk of std transmission in

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.760
certain cases by some percentage right but it's like some small percentage it's like your chances

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.960
of transmitting it are like 10 less or something like that um which is to my mind not a good reason

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.560
to chop off part of your body you can wear a condom right or if you can practice safer sex you

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.000
don't need a surgical right like nothing nothing beats a condom in the first place which is the

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
important i read an article the ones that said if we were to uh if we were to circumcise a third of

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.600
men on earth we could reduce the cases of uh cervical cancer which is caused by hpv by a

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.440
couple thousand per year right like you're going to circumcise two billion people like billions

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.480
of people in order to just give out condoms you know like it's a better that that's a better

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.000
that's a better plan than hey we're going to go around with scalpel still like everywhere in

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.600
in the world right uh that's my that's my feeling about it anymore i just think about my dog

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.480
they get they get that little lipstick comes out and then well the reason that lipstick isn't always

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.360
out is because they're not circumcised yeah yeah yeah like like so i'm like looking at imagine if

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.360
we circumcised dogs it was that all the time that would be horrible like the dog would be so bummed

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:05.840
out like yeah but again again it's like the the thing of one of the reasons it's been able to

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.920
persist is because it's not a particularly bad thing to be circumcised right um and so uh it's

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.400
like fine it's totally great and the reason the myth around hymens has persisted because it

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.280
it blends perfectly in with our kind of like bullying yeah young girls are saying like oh there's

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.280
this event that's going to happen when you have sex for the first time you should think about it more

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.480
than the guy does because the guy could just stick it in and go away yeah and uh you however you're

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.680
the recipient of this thing and we're trusting you with this like drum skin that's like and

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.840
then oh god boy you better not yeah you'll be changed forever yeah it's actually it's practicality

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.600
that that perpetuates that myth it's a little more insidious than the circumcision oh it's

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.200
incredible yeah it's incredibly insidious and it's simply not true it's just that the hymen does

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.120
just doesn't exist that way hymen is just a thing it's not has nothing to it's all i got the

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.360
impression it's unrelated to sex like that it's just a fucking thing you know i don't want to get

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.920
too outside of my lane um uh talking about it because you know we did that as a episode a couple

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.280
years ago we made our claims there and you know i'm not an expert on on female anatomy i've never

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:15.440
seen a woman but but yeah i mean the hymen is not a barrier that is covering the you know vagina

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.320
and then the first time it comes through it's like you know ruptured forever like that doesn't

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.640
that's literally what i pictured my entire life was i was like it's like a freshness seal it's

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:30.400
like a fucking capri sun boom you go through there you're never going to close that capri sun again

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.560
and that's what i thought it was and i had sex ed in you guys characterize it as that paper thing

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.400
on a football field that the band comes through but i but i really love this this goes back to

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.880
how much heart this show has on that football field this character of emily uh uh uh uh adam

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:55.440
is is standing with emily's uh boyfriend murph who's a health teacher but you guys are are are

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.520
preoccupied with the uh the myths surrounding the hymen because the first one on the list is the

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:08.160
cherry popping daddy's uh band and and the two of you as men are just like looking at at a cd case

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.280
and like arguing about why it's bad which leaves emily to like walk away from you guys down the

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:20.240
football field in a beautiful haunting shot where she just basically says without preaching that like

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:27.280
this is also by the way you can use this myth of the hymen there are countries where women have to

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.760
show proof of hymen to get a fucking yes food stamp or whatever the show proof of something

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:37.040
that doesn't exist in that form right that doesn't even food stamp i'm rift don't don't i just say

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:41.760
like like it's like if you if you accept something as clinical and cause and effect it can be used

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:47.200
to like really hurt people yeah if it's a myth it's crazy it's like the same thing as iq tests

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:54.080
which you also ruin which have been used extensively for racism yeah anyway so uh but that's that's

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.240
just like like please watch the show i mean it's really thank you it is not a show that wants you

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.400
to be unhappy and wants the world to be a worse place yeah i mean our our i always say the ruins

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.480
part of it is like it's a superficial joke you know it's like ruin comfort i mean yeah when you

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.440
learn something that is contrary to what you believe it's like unless it's really a backfire

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.160
effect situation it's momentarily uncomfortable you know you're like oh no let's stop ah fuck

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:26.400
my gears are grinding ah geez right and then uh but then as you learn and you start to embrace

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.640
the actual truth it's really fun and rewarding to learn a new thing and it because you know

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.480
that it makes you more powerful it opens the world up to you one of the reasons our show does well

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.000
is because once people learn the things they want to go tell someone else right away right like

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.240
learning case in point which is something i knew 20 years ago but i assumed it changed but then i

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.520
saw your episode and was like wait i always knew this this explains everything uh the uh your credit

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:56.640
card numbers they've already been stolen it the fact that it seems like every once in a while like

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:04.400
you're uh vulnerable to identity theft is is is based on the statistical probability of the gigantic

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:10.320
landfill full of everyone's credit card numbers that exists online yes that are that are sold to

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:15.440
among people and huge tranches of like billions of cards you're actually protected by the lack of

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.560
security about your credit card because it's like a school of fish like yeah it's like what

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.960
will what are the odds you're going to get eaten very low and the credit card companies all or the

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.360
banks more specifically all have they're just like okay well just since this is the case we'll just

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.560
cancel the card and refund the thing when it happens and we'll call you on the phone and and

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.880
you know so that's why now it's more annoying right because your your credit card what people

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.800
now have their cards canceled you know the fraud protection is too strong right um uh but uh yeah

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.560
that but i always knew that because i remember being a kid and i remember i don't know if it's

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:53.840
illegal for me to say this but i remember being in that phase of my life like 16 17 and like i

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.520
remember going to those sites and going like for real this these are just people's credit

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.200
card numbers yeah and i would take some and i tried some and i i got i did some stuff i i i i

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:10.080
whoa we're all the time on Harmontown for the second time i thought maybe it had changed in

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.200
20 years but as your as your show maybe makes a point it's like no in the 70s they used to take

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.600
your your credit card as a just literally a card that has the number on it and they would literally

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:26.480
just go 1754 yeah and then the thing that changed over 20 years is that now a computer does that

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.680
yeah but it's it's no more secure the only thing it eliminates is that one person overhearing your

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.320
credit card transaction we've got like you know chip and pin when you're using the register

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.040
is you're not exposing your number in the same way that you used to be but the number system

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.800
still exists right all you need is a sear you know a string of digits a shorter string of

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.960
digits and a shorter string of digits and you can use you can use someone's card right now exactly

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:56.560
how would a person say do that maybe you could ruin poverty pretty sure you can get online and google

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:04.080
i think i'd correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure the issue is

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.160
you could get online and and if you really drilled down tonight you could you could get

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.200
online and google and go like i want to become a person who trades in the credit card numbers

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.440
basically it would be the equivalent of you becoming a metal detector guy yeah you would you

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.800
would be like putting the saint you'd be putting so much effort into it you may as well write a

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:27.040
screenplay is that what you go down to the beach you're like hey metal detector guy write a screen

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:34.320
play what are you doing jesus christ haven't you seen how easy it is saw the oscars oh did the uh

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.440
by the way i thought that was a glib dumb reference i don't know if all the great movies one did the

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.600
did the favorite win anything uh best actress for libya come on i love that i thought i did

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.920
think that's so good any production awards i thought maybe i don't think it got no i think it

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.840
only got because we were worried it was going to be black panther one best productions it did

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.680
it did wonderful wardrobe costume yeah wardrobe yeah lidwick gaurdson won for this for scoring black

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:06.480
panther he was the community uh composer oh really uh yeah yeah that's that that that movie had a

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.640
great score for for a marvel movie he was a russo brother's discovery i can't claim credit for

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.240
like discovering him but i did i because i was the creator of community i did have the honor of

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:22.000
signing the special letter to the immigration board or whatever you call it where basically

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.680
it's like i'll to get a genius visa which is essentially saying yes he's going to take an

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.600
this did they talk to you about these things you know i had a lot of so i i mean i i had a

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.920
really science-filled childhood but you know i was also a super adk and i couldn't keep my head

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.840
on straight you know so they they they wrote me they didn't write me off but you know i was like

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.360
but you know i i spent a lot of time watching like kids science shows and things like that which

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.880
ended up i realized only after created the show i was like oh this show is like beakman's world i

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.240
don't know if you guys remember beakman's world um but i realized afterwards i was like this is

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.680
really profoundly influenced like i zip in we do sound effects for every little thing you know are

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.040
they impressed do you ever call them do i ever call beakman's world oh no that was literally my

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.360

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:57.840
give you a you know i got i got to tell you uh almost the opposite um my we did an episode on

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.080
science which is one i'm very proud of because i love science it's dear to my heart and it's about

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:08.240
systemic problems in science um with science funding and with um you know use it over use of

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.040
mouse models like they use mice for too many things and stuff like that um and i watched it with my

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:20.000
dad who's uh the uh an administrator at a phd and a vice president of the university oregon

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.080
and i watched it with my sister who's a phd in nuclear physics and a journalist at the wonderful

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.960
magazine science news really good outlet if you guys like learn about science and i watched it with

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:35.360
them and then afterwards they looked at me and they were like you really simplified a lot of

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:42.320
stuff in this and i was like no i don't want to hear it don't just tell me good job i was like

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:49.520
sitting there watching them during the episode as they were like i don't know yeah kind of painting

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.160
with broad a broad brush you know like my dad who we're talking about problems in science funding

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.480
and the nsf and and you know corporate and and billionaire funding a science and the problem

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:03.520
with that my dad worked at the nsf and gave grants and he was like no no no it's a good system i was

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:09.040
like you're here's the thing when people are uh when people are so close to something it's nothing

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:15.200
i hear a lot is uh oh adam ruins everything is a great show until he does something that you know

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:21.600
about right and like yeah i'm sorry that in six minutes we didn't manage to like the standards

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.080
of your like fucking phd right damn it people get so excited that's one of the biggest problems

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:32.800
with the internet is people get so fucking excited yeah when the ocean of everyone dwelling together

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.720
accidentally runs over a single god damn thing about that that's important to them it's like

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.760
it's a that's just be excited about that don't get mad about it yeah i'm talking about you

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:50.160
mentioned the pixies oh fuck i saw the last picture they think it's so fun they're like oh my god i

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.640
finally i'm the person here i mean we did this thing on on mouse models which is that you know

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.280
mice are mice and rats are overused in medical testing and science and the reason is because

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.600
the models are very it's very easy to get the mice it's cost effective and it's replicable you can

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.600
do it over and over again and it's like easy get funding to do that right there are problems with

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:13.520
it my dad told me about that with my dad's not a scientist sure he told me what he said you know those

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.080
those rats are bred for cancer that's what that's the thing that people say what do you mean it's

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:26.320
like well they're the the the rats are now easier to give cancer because all they get is cancer

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.280
yeah i just remember that from what i was like eight that's kind of broadly true i mean it's like

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.200
there's such a there's such specific populations right because they're trying to reduce the number

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.920
of variables right when they're when they're testing but as a result their findings then become

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:45.280
like really really narrow and just you know we talked to a fucking cancer scientist who says

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.160
hey we shouldn't be using mice quite this much right it's a systemic problem in science and on

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.200
you know reddit we got so many people saying i am a scientist who uses mice and he doesn't know

01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:01.040
anything about mice and i use mice very well you know and the thing is from their vantage point where

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:06.720
they are at their particular post grad program at the university of whatever doing their work

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.000
like they have such a specific their whole lives are their little corner of it you know

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.480
like sort of writ large and i'm talking about i'm doing an overview for a general population

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.360
of the field from 10 000 feet up right and so like those even though we're talking about the

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.840
same thing our perspectives are so different that like they can't you know they can't quite go to

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.760
they can't quite go together you know and they have that strong reaction of an episode i'm going

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.960
back to your parents thing is there a version of an episode where you ruin the child-parent

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:43.920
relationship where but which is to say on both sides both sides uh because sometimes i feel

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:54.000
at 46 like i look back on a lifetime of kind of like um uh symbolizing them i like oh my mom said

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.320
this my dad said that and i just told that story about my dad saying that it's like i it's so easy

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.560
to want them to be wrong and all this stuff and like i guess i'm fascinated by this kind of like

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:11.680
Schrab used to tell me this story uh Schrab's gonna grow up to be a god knows what he hasn't grown up

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.080
yet no Schrab Schrab Schrab Schrab grows up to be a comic book artist right so Schrab has these stories

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:23.520
like when we're like 20 and we're hanging out and Schrab remembers being a kid and your mom hid

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:30.640
your comic books and you know she was she didn't have i had a comic book ranzor ox and it had uh on

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:36.000
the and it had some racies it was kind of like a heavy metal kind of a sci-fi book and there was

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.120
like some naked nudity in there hell yeah that's kind i guess i've got to i guess to skip ahead of

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.640
it i'm wondering like do we when we i always because i also watch these true crime things and

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.640
like people are so fast and they go like oh ted bundy uh ted bundy's parents were like this i'm

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:02.880
like according to who fucking ted bundy we should the fuck do you trust him for you say i want to

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:09.680
bundy uh are you comparing me to ted bundy yes yes i am what the fuck i think i think if you had

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:18.640
slightly less of a support system uh no what i'm saying is do we as adults like i i wonder what

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:24.880
field of psychology like like like studies is like the idea of like like i i picture it like a like

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.560
a boat's wake like like to what extent i know it's like nature versus nurture is a thing but i'm

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:35.440
saying like like people like we we tend to interview people about their childhoods we go like oh hey so

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.160
and so what do you remember about your childhood well my mom was always very encouraging about the

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.280
alphabet oh really that's weird because your life ended up being about the fucking alphabet you

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:52.080
alphabet scientist but like like guess what you were raised from your brain your mom like washing

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.640
your dick too hard in the bathtub we don't know like how do we know whether washing your dick

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.560
really hard makes you into the alphabet like we're gonna lose that stuff because we have this like

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:07.040
fixation of this idea of the truth like this this biographical truth like why didn't you become a

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.040
dick washing scientist who studies dick washing we think that's how it is but like have you have

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.680
you touched on any area that we haven't done we haven't done parenting we have you done that episode

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.720
well there's a lot there um there's a lot to unpack there's a lot to unpack uh we you know we've

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.160
never done parenting specifically because we've done we've tracked Emily and Murph throughout

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.600
the stages of life so they get engaged and we did an episode about their engagement we did an

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.120
episode of adam ruins weddings we did an episode about having a baby right and then we decided at

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.600
the end we sort of had a very soft you know our message to the end of that was like hey you don't

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.920
have to have a kid right that was sort of trying to take that shame off that pressure off of people

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.000
it's not your chance to make the world a better place yeah to have a kid you mean yeah right

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.640
yeah i i mean that's uh yeah that's that's certainly my my perspective is that like i don't

01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:01.040
think there's a moral imperative to have children personally um and and uh if people want to have

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.520
them great but i don't think it's like a thing that we we have to do right um uh so at the end we

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.800
have Emily and Murph decide to wait and so they don't have kids and so but maybe maybe one day

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:17.200
you know god willing uh if we keep going we'll we'll do that episode but uh yeah i don't know i

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.440
feel like the the amount of like the fucking butterfly effect of parenting is so vast that i

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.320
feel like almost the worst part about it as a parent i can't imagine having to live with that

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.240
because you feel like oh everything i do is going to be like that fucking simpson's episode where

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.160
like you know suddenly suddenly they turn into some kind of weird monster because i do x y z but

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.400
it's completely unpredictable and you actually have almost no control over it at all like all the

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.800
things that you know i talk to my therapist about about you know my my parents doing x y or z none

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.480
of it's none of it's you know particularly bad but the things that did affect me are things that i

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:55.040
know that that they never even thought about or that they they were just tiny little quirks of

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.600
their personality that were just you know like a little bit too harsh about this or a little bit

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.920
too loose about that or more importantly and this is the thing that plagues me is don't you think

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.360
it's possible that there's moments where they're like by the way all that other shit that you're

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:16.880
gonna remember um that's all boy i'm so sorry i came off that way earlier today adam you gotta

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.680
remember it's so important that mice mice are overused and or whatever the thing is whatever

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:30.960
and and that and that it just didn't serve your uh your your your adult brain your developing

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:36.400
brains it's like you create this like rocket thrust behind you you go why am i who i am

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:44.320
and the memories that don't serve that narrative they just oh yeah like like like like oh old man

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:51.520
withers down the street was racist and that's why i'm not and i decided that and so i forgot

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:57.840
that old man withers uh yeah saved the space lab from i'm not gonna riff a narrative that's

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.160
i'm already halfway into one i might as well complete it he saved space lab

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.800
with his racism i don't know uh yeah well that doesn't that's in that case old man withers

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.560
was still racist i don't know why i yeah there's this there's this conflict because i i believe

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:21.040
what is going on back there can't you guys just is it on a loop or something what's going on

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.360
i believe that every time it happens everyone feels like they have to react the weird i would

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:35.280
just put it on like a like a video of a badger robbing or something like a fast motion video

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.440
used to something i'm curious i'm i'm actually curious what you'll say to this because one of

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.680
my beliefs um and i've read your writing on on story structure and stuff and and i i love it

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.800
but one one of the things that i believe is that uh you know real life is not story shaped that

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.640
people's lives are not actually stories and that and that that's something that we impose onto them

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.880
and that the real and that we actually have an upcoming episode our season finale is going to

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:04.080
be about exactly this problem because on our show we use stories to in the way that i describe to

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:10.480
to give people information but in reality uh the real world is not story shaped right like we tell

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.280
our our three beat story about teddy roosevelt's life but teddy roosevelt did not have a story

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.480
like that to his life that's something i imposed on it right um and so the in to the extent that

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.840
we're using those stories we get we get further from the truth and i think we do that for our own

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.200
lives as well um but at the same time human life and human society definitely not story shaped

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.720
because it's sloppadoodle because it but the only things that are story shaped are like

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:41.760
the day because the sun comes up and goes down so you can always rely on that and like the seasons

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:49.920
and life and death and the kind of like general nature of how this two shall pass like um you're

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.240
mad at this person today maybe you're mad at them because you love them you're going to find that

01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:01.280
out later like those kind of like those things that aren't uh um pollutable by the fact that

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.640
everyone else is going through them all at the same time that creates static and that but the

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.040
individual signals i think if you were to the extent that it's possible to have an individual

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:15.520
have a relationship with the universe i think that the story structure holds true i think the

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:23.120
nature boom well i have to say boom okay take that out but i do i i do know exactly what you're

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.040
talking about because then what we have to do is function together and then so then we go oh

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.160
teddy roosevelt you know lesson you learn there mm don't dig a canal unless you want malaria

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.880
and then someone else is like well actually and we're like you're actually me and my story is

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.640
about crossing the threshold of learning what actuallying is and everyone's right and everyone's

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:49.360
wrong because it's like yeah it's like all signals that just create static but your heart is beating

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:56.960
every beat a muscle like go crosses it is a four act story right it's a four chambered heart

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.440
but i i am my my my believe i i agree with that except that i believe that's like a structure

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.640
that's a structure that we impose right that's a structure like i believe the story is a structure

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.240
of the mind out of the universe right if humanity was wiped out nobody would care there would be

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.640
nobody to care about anything there would be no you know sort of like the sun would be revolving

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.040
but there'd be no vantage point from which it would rise and set right um there would be no

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.360
one to observe it right yeah this is absolutely about the experience of being sentient yeah and

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:29.680
so that's what i bump into because i'm really i'm my what i'm uh most interested in is understanding

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.200
the the universe as it truly is right this is fucking i'm just getting gonna just nose dive

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.000
into cont here but like i uh what i'm really interested in understanding the world as it

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.440
truly is and to the extent that i uh am imposing my own structure on it that's an extent to which

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:51.200
i don't truly understand it as it is uh and and it seems like the story is like such a deep

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:57.040
piece of how we think deep like characteristic of how we think that we can't escape it even

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:04.720
as it distorts the world that we're trying to observe yeah i mean jeez there was there is

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.600
that idea that the only footage that is real documentary footage is surveillance footage

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.160
because those people are unaffected because the camera is not in plain view

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.200
but the camp yeah i mean and then but what about but what about actually but like the camera was

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.760
mounted uh in suspicion it was mounted by macy's because macy's didn't want their parking lot

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.160
robbed it was a choice made by everything that the human sentience touches it creates a perspective

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:36.640
and a flavor i i think if you there's a way to look at that to to to to defeat yourself and go

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.800
oh so all i am is a is a conscious monkey that's just like projecting an illusion onto a chaotic

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:48.560
universe you know monkey but can't you just flip that and go well flip the telescope look through

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:57.440
the big end and into the monkey and go um uh monkey is tiny hey yes he is very tiny and and the

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:02.400
universe's point is that monkey for the time being according to that monkey and then and that's what

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:06.480
the monkey needs to know to actually understand the universe because as far as our monkey's

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.760
relationship with the universe the only thing that's going to possibly benefit the monkey

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:15.040
is through that telescope even though it's absolutely a fraudulent telescope because the

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.600
the monkey understanding what the milky way thinks won't help the monkey and the milk and what

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:26.320
they won't it it it it's like uh yeah i don't know i'm scared i'm scared you're scaring me i'm

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.960
so i'm like panicking i'm like flailing and going like look listen adam all we have to do is make

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.360
good television than die i agree i agree with that i agree with that statement as well i accept

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.200
that buying a tesla didn't help the earth uh this is as much quarter as i give you

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.080
i mean i i i agree with that last statement all you have to do is make good television than die i

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.080
mean when i make my show i'm like try this that's me trying to work that shit out you know like

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:59.840
well our our season finale this year is literally us like grappling with those issues right and the

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:05.360
issues of like is the structure of our show make our show less true oh my god i mean this is my new

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.840
favorite show i'm gonna like watch it thank you oh my gosh because it's that's it's fucking meta in

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:16.160
the best way thank you um you should you should ruin the word meta it's a it's a greek prefix it

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.440
means nothing it means beyond the it shores up the fourth wall it makes you identify with characters

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.720
do do all kinds of stuff like that you also have an offshoot that's like an animated thing where

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.400
you just investigate history we did uh we did animated episodes yeah uh that were called reanimated

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:38.160
history and they were and they were specifically uh it was that the network wanted uh more episodes

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.880
in less time and they were like you and they're like you shoot all year what if we do animated

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:49.840
episodes and i said uh maybe and they said great yes and then we did them and they came out quite

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:57.600
well um but uh yeah they're uh um is like we ended up creating an entirely different format for them

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.080
where it's me interacting uh with a narrator i heard chris pernell's voice he is chris pernell

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.240
is the voice of it which was incredible to to have so if you if you're going through rick and

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:14.160
warty withdrawals you can you can listen to jerry narrate history or animated adam ruins it for

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.240
him yeah i really recommend this show like i it's kind of it's one of those things where it's like

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:24.320
easy to recommend because just watch ten minutes of it you're gonna it's like a grape or a crack

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:31.600
rock like your your inner you're out you will sell all of your shit and lose your teeth over this

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:41.440
show oh man grapes grapes will get you that's what that's what grapes do to me oh man i am well

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.440
like i i think this is my most important question it was like it was sort of like hinted at in the

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:51.920
beginning and i purposely avoided it but like so do you believe in humanity do you think we have a

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:59.440
chance and we've only got two minutes in the broadest in the broadest sense in the broadest

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:08.880
sense um uh uh in the broad in the broadest sense drop what am i what do you think my job is here

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.200
i got to ask that you know i got to ask i got to sleep tonight what are you what are you doing

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.560
well well so he's flattering you he's saying whatever you say is going to affect him

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.280
by a big well let me let me so a thought i have sometimes is that let's see if i can do a a

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:31.200
pessimist and an optimist version uh the a thought that i have sometimes is that the the the amount

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:39.120
of time that we have been on earth in our current form right like the the modern world right is is

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.560
so short right our population has gone up by i i don't know i forget when the earth had a hundred

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.880
had i had one billion people on it as opposed to seven but it was less than two hundred years

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:58.960
ago right and so the amount of explosion is massive and if you saw any population of any

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.040
creature expand that much in that short of a time you'd be like yeah this might not end well right

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.640
like giraffes going from one billion to seven billion giraffes yeah exactly fuck it up at four

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.720
billion giraffes easy and exactly they'd be like well i invented a new kind of tree that's artificially

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:23.520
tall because you gotta justify the next they can't you sorry i mean derail you no no no that's exactly

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.440
my that's exactly my example i'm often stricken by that it just feels like it's almost like where

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:31.760
the pat would like where complete absolute cynicism and optimism meet where it's like

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.440
there's eight billion of us we're horrible people like yeah like like when those lights went out in

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.240
new york like decades ago it was like everybody was like oh there she goes there goes new york

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.920
and then the lights came on the next morning they're like we ate all the ice cream before it melted

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.040
i was in new york during a blackout and it was it was kind of nice i like like like so few

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.520
like we're not we're not as bad as but at the at the same time at the same time okay so that's

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.920
like the worst that's like the worst vision of humanity right and and in that vision we're like

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:09.440
we're almost like a bacterial infection that found too much like substrate that would allow

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.760
it to grow right like we're growing at this rapid pace in this unsustainable way and the crash is

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:21.440
a common right and that's how i feel sometimes then i feel other times that i think the the humanist

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:28.960
world view doesn't get enough credit sometimes for how beautiful it is because i feel like

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.040
atheists who people want to call themselves atheists don't don't give this view often enough

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:39.040
um uh because uh you know we if you if you're looking at the world in those terms right that

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.440
we live in a natural world where you know things are happened because of chemical reactions and

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.600
that life is essentially a complex chemical reaction right humanity is a chemical reaction

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:54.000
that's so complex that not only it it actually escaped the bounds of biological evolution and

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.560
began a process of cultural evolution where um you know the the rate at which we're growing and the

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.640
rate at which we're changing the amount the rate at which our species has changed is orders of

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.480
magnitude faster than any species that has ever changed before right because we've created this

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.160
process of cultural evolution where things are happening in our minds right and through language

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:15.120
memetic evolution yeah that is like taken over yeah that is like incredibly rapid and that's

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.960
something that to our knowledge has never happened anywhere in you know ever right and that makes

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:27.360
us the most like undoubtedly the most remarkable thing to ever happen in the entire universe

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.800
certainly as far as we've seen yeah yeah i mean like it's it's um it's unbelievable that and and

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.200
it again it's just it's just chemical reactions like building upon each other complexity creating

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.760
more complexity creating more complexity creating more complexity um and so that is the mere fact

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:49.680
of our existence is the most beautiful truth in the natural world um and as a result it kind of

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.400
maybe i mean it i was going to say it doesn't matter what we do it does because we still need to

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.240
behave ethically towards each other and try to improve the world that we're in but um the fact

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:06.400
of our existence is so marvelous that it's uh uh difficult to even comprehend i uh that's my positive

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:15.760
feel i yeah i i just spoke to elan musk about this you're welcome uh we were just having the

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.360
same conversation and he touched on this thing that i was like like like a canadian cartoonist

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.920
my friend steven notley who can you hear on the podcast he introduced to me a million years ago

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:34.640
which was this idea of information as a field or i.e. an organism in its own right um although it

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.600
doesn't mean our definitions of living but it does mean our definitions of like wants to be

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:48.800
and that information as a field uh it it goes it's like if you look at just us as a sort of

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:57.520
of patsy i guess you'd call it that that molecular you know molecular bumpage leads to cosmic RNA

01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.880
leads to life leads to competition between giraffes and beavers leads to us having eyebrows

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.280
and having podcasts and what the whole point of it is that we invented hard drives because

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:13.680
we've got our cells are bursting with information are the reason we have these chromosomes are just

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.680
like so tightly wound it's like comical it's like how can you have information that way

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:25.040
and the answer is we barely can whenever you fuck and like the the the shuffle has to happen the

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.400
ballet of information having to unwind and then rewind in your baby's cells it's like

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.720
it's gotten to a point where it's like enough is enough coincidentally right at the time when

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:42.640
we're also smart enough to make new ways for information to to to go on and my big fear was

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:56.720
always and look i'm i'm just gonna say elan shared it so new share he made your he made

01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.920
your solar panels in your cars and like you know but i like where i was like i said well like

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.880
we're just like these like what we're experiencing right now could be intersected with like the kind

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:13.440
of it's it's like like we could be coming to a point where everyone who's an atheist and

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:19.200
everyone who's like a fundamentalist could actually both agree that it's over but

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.720
the the the atheists are agreeing because it's like well our species was never anything more

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:37.200
than basically like a a boot drive like a like a like a weird kind of like intermediary like oh

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.440
what do i got to work with uh so i was like like time bandit to get the assistant to the guy that's

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:49.200
like like trying to devise a universe and like you have hydrogen you have you know you have

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:54.560
these like certain amount of atoms like all right well arrange them in a way that makes them when

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.360
they bump into each other want to make more of the things that bumped into each other and it's

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:05.680
like like and just give it a trillion gazillion years until it gets to a point where okay finally

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:11.920
we got like plants and furry things like crawling around and they all want to like now they've got

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.200
the agenda driven that's like it's on autopilot so if you're a god at this point you've walked away

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.640
a long time ago but uh you're growing basil in your flower box and that's like going but it's like

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:27.920
like like like because all it's doing is just going like look i got one every every living thing

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:34.160
is just going i gotta beat every other living thing i gotta fuck more i gotta i and and but

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:42.480
all of it is like bent towards this apex where you and i are like oh i i need to know how to make

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:51.200
eyeglasses and this microchip and this thing and this alphabet and that we have gotten finally

01:43:51.200 --> 01:44:00.160
right to the point where what we're experiencing is an actual spiritual abandonment of our original

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.840
quest sorry that i said this that the no no no he didn't i don't i don't want to throw him under

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.880
the bus because i i i know this is me projecting on a shit i don't want to i don't i don't want to

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:18.640
miscredit anybody what do you know what my fear is that we are as primates we are at the event horizon

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:28.320
and of of biologically going okay what's next and but the information is going like nothing's

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:35.840
next for you you fucking foot man you fucking skycap piece here's your five bucks it's for

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.880
it's a actually a coupon from where we're going like you can't even spend it and we're like oh

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:50.800
oh that that that is violence that is nihilism like that that we're we that we have a we were

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:57.520
at a crossroads where we could actually i my theory is if we could actually just recalibrate

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:02.320
for a second and realize that we are direct descendants of chimpanzees and that by their

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:11.840
standards we are gods and just stop like could we have a conversation with a chimpanzee tonight

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:19.280
and they would go what's wrong and we would go well we got well not a lot to do and whoa slow

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:25.120
down jack i can't even talk how many spotted leopards are hunting you and we'd be like well

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.960
spotted leopard of nuclear annihilation it's like whoa hey you made that up down the

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.000
eventually the conversation would end with the chimpanzee going you're crazy i'm gonna go have

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:44.640
an orgy because i learned to fuck and i'm gonna go extinct because of you not because of me

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.240
not because fucking's wrong and not because gruman's wrong and not because and and we could just

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:56.480
realize like we we we've eliminated the spotted leopard yeah the wolves are fetching our slippers

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.960
we control the weather um if it rains we don't have to give a shit we don't control the weather

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:11.440
we affect it we affect the weather we do not control it but according to a chimpanzee yeah

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.440
yeah we do because a chimpanzee can't just go indoors we invent it indoors we do control

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:22.640
chimpanzee's definition of weather we can change it from raining to not raining by stepping to

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:28.800
the left three feet chimpanzees could only do that to a certain degree i what what i'd say to that

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.120
is that you're always bragging about how you better than chimpanzee i think it's time i think i

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:39.040
think we got that look i think it's that's gonna be my movement just compare yourself to a chimpanzee

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:46.400
you're rich you're happy what i what i'd uh what i'd say to that and what i'd say to elon musk if

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:53.440
you was uh sitting here um is uh there's there's like this concern there's like this concern that

01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:00.160
we are uh that the bad thing is something we're gonna do you know like we're worried about uh

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.680
you know we're worried about building AI or worried about like building the next level or you

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.960
know what i mean um and i'm concerned about the things that we're doing right now right um that

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.800
like we're uh you know we're actively we're destabilizing like weather systems and climate

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:21.360
systems right now you know and that uh we're we're currently building you know a lot of people are

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.600
like afraid like oh the AI is gonna take over you know um and it's like gonna come to consciousness

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.880
it's gonna skynet us you know um but the the i there's this writer james bridal who wrote a book

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:36.480
called new dark age and it's all about how we're building these systems that uh they're not AI they're

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:40.960
not like hard AI that's like you know trying to kill us or whatever they're just systems that we've

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.160
built that we don't understand right um that like the youtube algorithm like the u2 youtube algorithm

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.920
is currently giving people uh you know misinformation uh conspiracy theories uh hateful shit right

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.160
that's what's like being bred on youtube and nobody knows why right because we don't understand the

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.520
youtube algorithm and the youtube people were just trying to get people to click more right that's

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.280
all that's that's all that they were doing right um and so like that is the current you know that's

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.320
the problem of technology that that you know i would wish we were focusing on rather than the

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:17.280
rather than the skynet problem you know i mean um like we have so much that uh we are like fucking up

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.600
currently on a daily basis just in how we treat each other on a basic level i guess if i were a

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:28.720
doomsday person i would say in argument but your point is better i but i but i if i was arguing i

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.720
would say well no that's the point of worrying about the future is that you you do backwards

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:38.320
math to what you need to do today so you go these computers gonna take our jobs and then you now you

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.880
know today you need to take a ball peen hammer and you just smash a computer like at least that's

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:49.520
something to do and i i'm kind of advocating for the chimpanzee model because i'm like yeah today

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:55.280
we could just look at a chimp before they're extinct and go what do you think and their unspoken

01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:02.160
answer would be you guys are nailing it you have nailed it you need to stop nailing stop making

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:09.840
more sure you are i understand um the alarm instinct has made you guys like like very successful

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.440
but you are alarmed by each other now which makes no sense you're alarmed by nothing you're alarmed

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:24.240
by silence you're alarmed by happiness yeah you're uh and the the the uh yeah but anyways um i uh

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.880
how do we end the show brandy we do it like this we say uh one of the greatest gifts that we got

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:35.360
left us this past weekend and it is oh jeez brody incredibly sad for all of us but uh incredibly

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.960
happy that we got a chance to know him and if you got a chance to see him uh you you would have seen

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.360
why we all loved him so much his name is brody and uh he did warm up for community as well for you

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:53.680
but for the most of us in this city he was you you go to a chinese restaurant and you you see the
