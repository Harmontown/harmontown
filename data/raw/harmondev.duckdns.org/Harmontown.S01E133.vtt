00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.

00:10.000 --> 00:26.000
Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Wow, I don't understand. Jeff, why are all these people here? It's the Super Bowl.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Why is our audience here?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm assuming that they came straight from their Super Bowl parties and made it just in time.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
We should get it out of the way, right? We should do a sports corner.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
Sports corner, doing the sports, throwing the balls, and you know what's worse than playing sports.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Doing the thing, it's a team action. Make sure you say you've got to jump up and down to the organized sports.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Jump, jump, yep, yep, sports.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
Dan, let me start you off. Seattle Seahawks, Pats, whatever Pats is short for.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm not going to play that game. I couldn't not get that information.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
The New England Patriots, first impressions going into the game with all the controversy that led up to it.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
Everybody, the controversy. It was a weird year this year for the Super Bowl.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Dan, when people put the gate on the end of a name of a controversy.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Super Bowl gate?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm talking, of course, about the game leading up to the Patriots making it into the Super Bowl.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Some of their balls were under inflated.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh, there's the deflate gate.

01:59.000 --> 02:09.000
I did see some of that. I saw Craig Ferguson or something that they did a funny video where people were spiking footballs and they photoshopped them just staying put.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Somebody said that they were under inflating the balls and that made them easier to catch.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, I got that. We're all on the same page.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
So going in, hopefully they had that ironed out. What did you think about the, let's go right to the end of the game.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Some pretty amazing plays towards the end there.

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
I mean, there was so much, I mean, what Tuckerson did with the 11th hour.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
You watch a whole game like that, point by point, quarter by quarter, and you're watching.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Usually, as you know, football is a game of yardage and that's not always a fun thing to watch.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It's not always a dramatic thing to watch.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
In baseball, it's like, oh, he popped a fly to the third, and it's a big deal.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Every batter that comes up has an opportunity to create a story.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
In football, it's a team effort. It's the long lost American dream.

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
You've got a quarterback, you've got a receiver, you've got a linebacker, you've got a fatback, you've got a wide receiver in case the line receiver fails.

03:11.000 --> 03:20.000
The quarterback has to throw the ball and the point is yardage and it's an accumulation of that yardage.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And so we watched that happen tonight. It's a super ball.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
A lot of people were turned off by that.

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
But at the end of the game, at the very end of the game, dramatic turn of events.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
The guy ran and caught the ball.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
It did, but then they were right about to score.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
They were right in the end zone and the guy right before the end zone and the other guys did what they're supposed to do.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
What they're supposed to do.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Correct.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
But there was a question about whether they did it right.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
They did it right.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
They did it right.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
There was a question, but the answer was yes, they did it right.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
There was a question of whether or not the guy that caught the ball had caught it right.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Right. There's always a question about that, which is why they have the referees out there on the field.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
And in that particular instance, the answer to the question, did he catch it right, was yes.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
He caught it right.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
So it didn't matter what the other people did.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
What do you think about the halftime performance?

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, those musicians.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I haven't seen them in what, 10, 11 years?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
A few of them a little bit longer than that.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
And the combination of those musicians.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Correct.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
Who would have thought that those musicians would appear in that combination?

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
Were you expecting a kind of early 90s-ish black kind of rock and roll?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
No, of course I wasn't expecting that.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It's a halftime at the Super Bowl.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm expecting nothing more than the president of football to come out and throw candy.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Who would have known that superstar from the mid 90s?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Kind of supermodel dating.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Cindy Crawford.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Cynthia Bloomberg.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Madonna did that.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It's a guy.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Perry Farrell.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Perry was the last name of the girl that was the headliner in it.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
What?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Katy Perry.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Katy Perry.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
You said Katy Perry.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Don't applaud that.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
I thought mixing Katy Perry with those guys, those crazy guys.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
She's such a pop-sugar-pop bubblegum.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Just when you're thinking I'm being fed some top 40 bullshit,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
I don't want to eat bubblegum for a living.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm a working man.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Then in comes the room, room, room.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
The fucking hard-driving, overdriven fucking six strings of that fucking band

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
that shouldn't be with Katy Perry.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
He's mostly just kind of a solo guy.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Fucking like Jethro Toll.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
As I said before, black gentlemen.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Black?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
You know, kind of.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
American woman, he covered that one time.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
You loved that. Mr. Cab Driver, and he was pretty big.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
BB King?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
He came out.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Lenny.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Lenny.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Lenny.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Lenny.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
John Steinbeck came out.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Fucking right out.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Black guy named Lenny.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Black Lenny.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Lenny Kravitz.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's all you had to say.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Black Lenny came out.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I call him Black Lenny.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Who would have thought he'd be with Katy Perry?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That's crazy.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
I don't have a reason to question my consumerist lifestyle.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Not if these two are poking up in the 50-yard plan.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And then the female rapper came out towards the end.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh my God, when Pharrell came out.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Holler.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Holler.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Look, I didn't know it wasn't until she said that.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Her name was on the TV, I would not have known.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, is it a lady?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
A lady rapper?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Little Kim.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Natalie.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Rapper.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Will Johnson.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
If it's not a hit, it's a...

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It's a Missy Elliott came out.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Amazing.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Talk about ending the culture war and getting back to shopping.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Like, it was a great, great halftime.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I just...

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
It's that time of year when we all realize there's nothing going wrong.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
And then whoever won, won.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
It was either the bird people or the fucking aqua people, I don't know.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And it was...

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
The important thing is that the right team won,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
because it was the team, the corporation that owned it,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
spent the right amount of money

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
aggregating dumb people from colleges around the country

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
who had been passed up through corrupt systems

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
and assembled into a team

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
so that you could overcharge people to watch

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and generally train people for jingoism

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
in arenas in and around the world.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
What was your favorite commercial level?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
That's always a big thing.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I actually know about the commercials,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
because people were tweeting me, you got to see the Liam Neeson one.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
The Liam Neeson was in a commercial.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
The two commercials that I saw,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and I don't know if it was because

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
the two commercials I saw were for apps.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
They were for, like, gaming apps.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That was weird.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Liam Neeson did an ad for Clash of Clans,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
and then there was another ad I got sent

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
that was some game of war or something.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Some lady game of war is a thing.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It was just another thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't know, but did Bud Light do anything?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
There seemed to be a lot of commercials

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
about fathers neglecting their children.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Then there was a really horrifying one

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
by nationwide insurance, I think,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
about your baby's going to be murdered

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
by your negligence around the house.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It was just like, don't let your kid die.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
We'll save you from that.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
If we haven't figured out by now

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
that that's what insurance is,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
it's a protection racket.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I remember when I was 20 years old,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
an envelope that I got in the mail,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
there was literally a photo of Christopher Reeves

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
post-accident, Christopher Reeves,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
on the envelope that said,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
don't let what happened to me happen to you,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
and it was an ad for an insurance company.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
That's exactly what the mafia does in mafia movies.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Except they have the courtesy to not involve the guy.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It would just be a guy in a suit going,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
don't let what happened to Christopher Reeves happen to you.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It'd be a shame.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
It'd be a shame for that to happen.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
It's amazing to me that we haven't caught on to this yet,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
that our laws that protect us from the mafia,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
if you actually applied them in an objective sense,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
you should go after insurance companies.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Here's another thing. Guess what?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Airline companies are a cartel.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Look up the word cartel. Cartel.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I know you think the word cartel

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
means Mexican drug dealer.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Cartel is a collection of companies,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
a collection of profit-seeking groups

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
who are supposed to be in competition,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
who aren't in competition,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
who work with each other

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
to minimize the consumer service

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
and maximize their own profits.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Airline companies, cartel, antitrust laws.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Hey, I learned about them in high school too.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Not applicable.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Haven't applied them in the last 30 years.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
What the fuck happened to antitrust?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You're supposed to break up any company

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
that is imposing any threat to the competition.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Key component to fucking capitalism.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Competition. Competition.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
No one is supposed to be safe in capitalism.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Nobody.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Even the guy at the very top,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
the guy that sells you all the candy,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
should be looking over one shoulder.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Every time Willy Wonka starts his car,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
he should be like, I hope Snickers doesn't get me.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
They're not supposed to have secret meetings.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
They're not supposed to share information.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
They're not supposed to have all the same board members

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
on their board of directors.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Fuck you people.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I was in an Alaska airline flight,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
and they stopped providing blankets,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and it's cold flying up there.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I bet you could get them for a $5 upgrade fee.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
There was an article in the New Yorker or whatever I tweeted.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
It's a fucking expose of a goddamn cartel.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
JetBlue just ended its,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
hey, you're a human being.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You want to get somewhere?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Let's just give you, JetBlue just ended it.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
JetBlue was seeing profits.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
They were a profit-seeing airline.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
They were doing fine.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
JetBlue's gimmick was,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I believe there was no first class on JetBlue.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Was that the case?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
All the seats were kind of equally alright.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It was generally like, it's kind of nice to fly JetBlue.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Let's just try this.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Let's try this as an experiment.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
And the experiment was working fine.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
They weren't going to go out of business.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It was going to happen to them.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
They stopped it anyway,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
because the stockholders in JetBlue said,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
ugh, this obsession with pleasing the customer, ugh.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
We don't want to buy your stock anymore.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
You are obsessed with pleasing the customer.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
And the way you make a profitable airline

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
is you slowly reduce the amount of fucking human space

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
that you have in coach, economy,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
whatever the fuck you call it, pencil plus.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Now there's 95 classes,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
and all of them are shrinking down.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
I compulsively fly first class,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
because they got me. They got me.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
But even in first class,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
white people problem with platinum addition,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
first class is shrinking too.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Sometimes there's a room upstairs,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I think, where everyone's in an egg.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Like in an egg.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's like secret class or something.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm sure that's getting bigger and bigger.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
In case you're flying with one of the 700 people

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
that has all the wealth in the United States.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
But their business model

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
is to shrink and shrink and shrink

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
everything that you have as an airline passenger

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
and offer you,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
oh, did you want Perk Plus?

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Did you want to put your feet on somewhere

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
that's not behind your head?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Oh, that you're a Perk Pluser.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Did you want a Perk Pluser Pluser?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
And they just move you, boarding first,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
and being allowed to have a backpack,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
and did you want to bring Q-tips,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
and they sell everything to you as this upgrade.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It's fucked up, man.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And they agree on it with each other.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
They all have to have meetings about this,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
and they go, okay, how many centimeters leg room

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
are we calling luxury?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Because if they don't agree on that,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
that's really bad by six centimeters.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That makes a huge difference in a nine-hour flight.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
What about Virgin America or Virgin Atlanta?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
They seem like they're a nice airline to fly.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, I don't know where Virgin falls.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I fly them a lot, and they seem like they're kind of doing

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
their own kind of groovy thing.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I don't know, but my eye's on you, airlines.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
That's the moral of that story.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Oh, do you want to do a new segment?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's called Things That I Say,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Off the Cuff, that I swear,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
like, if somebody on Parenthood said it,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
like, it could be, like, an amazing piece of dialogue.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay, because I've been experimenting,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
going through our new, because I can't use

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
licensed music anymore, I found this today

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
in hopes that maybe this might happen.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Okay, all right.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Things I said tonight just while getting dressed

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
with Erin that I'm like, wow, I sound like an NBC character.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Are you ready?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
Every once in a while.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
It's short.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
So Erin and I were talking about beards,

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
and I was talking about how I saw some red carpet lady,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
fashion lady on the red carpet say,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
like, well, you can expect a lot of beards this year

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
from the men.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
And I was like, yeah, I've had a beard for a long time.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Everybody's finally doing beards.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And Erin and I were talking about the beards,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and what is that culturally?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
And Erin was like, I don't want to put words in Erin's mouth,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
and it's a hot button topic,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
so I'm not putting words in Erin's mouth.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
This is what I remember hearing.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Erin was talking about how, like, is that a thing

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
that's motivated from the feminine side,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
like, based on what women want?

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
She was talking about, is it a possible reaction

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
to over-metrosexuality?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Like, are we, you know, like, the women are, like,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
craving, like, something else?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
We were having that conversation

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
in the privacy of our own home.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
And then she said, yeah, it's definitely a heterosexual trend,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
the beard.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's not a gay trend.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
And then she went in the bathroom,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and then I was standing alone in the bedroom,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
and I went, hey, a gay trend.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Imagine being in charge of figuring out what those are.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Talk about finding a needle in a needle stack.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
Because, because...

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
Because to me gay people are a trend.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
All right.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I'm having it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Real quick, on the beard thing,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I've been grasping about the beard business,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
because I live in, like, Los Feliz,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
which is near Silver Lake,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
which is the Williamsburg,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
which is the hip neighborhood of the city

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
that has the hip neighborhoods.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
And I was in a restaurant in Brooklyn,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
like, a few months or two ago,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
having brunch,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
and there were 15 guys in there, including me.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
14 of those guys had the same fucking Hammurabi big ass

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
down to their fucking collarbone beard.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Whoa.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
And it's like, you can't all have the same fucking beard.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
That's crazy.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
If you walked in the room and you were all wearing the same hat,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
you're crazy people.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I just...

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I just, like, and I told you so.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Like, I mean, everything I do,

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
like, 10 years later, everybody starts doing it.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You were the last to get a podcast, though.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
That's true, yeah.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
But now I'm going...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Now I got a video podcast.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I skimmed a couple of articles that people sent me,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
because they know how much I have a beef about this whole beard craze,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
and the phrase, lumber sexual,

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
and it's like, guys, wear it.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Lumber sexual?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And they have, like...

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
They wear the plaid shirts,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and they have the beards,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and it's a reaction to the...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Not just women's need to have men that are more masculine,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
but men's need to reclaim masculinity from it.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
That's where I immediately went.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But any woman that told me,

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
oh, no, women kind of define, you know,

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
what women say an attractive man looks like,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
like, you got to believe under the surface.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
That's what we do.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
It's a weird dance we have.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It's like men's gimmick is, like,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I don't give a shit,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
and that's sort of a staple of masculinity, too.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
But, like, obviously, women are cracking the whip.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Like, sexual reproduction,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
all of the changes are queued by the female side.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Like, that is as old as plant life.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Like, when we divided from asexual organisms

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
into a male and female,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
the only thing that's consistent between,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
like, all of the species from when we were flowers

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
until what we are now

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
is basically that the reason it speeds up Darwinian selection

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
is because it compounds it with half of the species dictates

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
how you get to the egg.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And that half of the species kind of tends to...

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
That's why you see on those nature shows,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
like, the bird is going, like,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
what the fuck is the bird doing?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
It has to do, like, 900 things in order to just get near the...

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
It has to grow iridescent feathers and stuff like that.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And then, like, the lockhorn beetles and the...

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
There's all this weird shit they have to do.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And it's like, some of it is, like, an odd, like, random thing.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And it's like, because there's so much energy coming out of...

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
If you just endow...

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
If you divide your species in half and endow one half with the green light,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
that is... I mean, that's not sexism.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
That is as old as vegetation.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Drew Carey used to joke that every guy cuts their hair

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
like they had it when they were getting laid all the time.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, I know. That's why you look like George Lucas.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
And it's like, yeah, guess what happened?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Oh, yeah, sure. I'm gonna make a ninth movie out of it.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
You're just looking at his Papadare.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It's like, yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
George, you could get your haircut by, like, a thousand robots every morning.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Like, he can have nano-scissors injected into his hair follicles.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
George Lucas could afford to have, like, the perfect haircut, for sure.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
As far as he's concerned, I think he has the perfect haircut.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Exactly. Because that's the haircut he had.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
That's the haircut he had, the night that something happened to him sexually,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
that he doesn't connect to American graffiti.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Like, he's like, ah, yeah, she really liked me.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
I heard another thing, and I did not follow up on this,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
and in keeping with last week's theme of unverifiable facts

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
that we don't know anything about, but we must make other people Google,

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
is that apparently I heard there was a reaction among the bear community,

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
like the bearded gay gentleman who are, you know, the little heavier, like, bearded...

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
The Harmons.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
The Harmons.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
They did not get that from you, the bear culture.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh, no, no, no, they had it.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Okay, yeah. But they're apparently, like, they feel like they're being co-opted

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
by a bunch of straighties going out there and dressing up like bears.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
They'll be all right. They're bears.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
They're fine.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Do we have any bears here?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Do we have any bears here? Any self-identifying bears?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Just kidding.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Well, now that we know you're just kidding, it's weird for you to go,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
yeah!

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
It should have been, rah!

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Yeah, you're sp... yeah.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
I always say, I've met bears.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I feel...

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I like bears. I like that idea.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
When I was in Palm Springs for New Year's Eve,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I forgot my swim trunks at home back in LA,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
and so I went to this place to go buy them,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
and I went to this place called Gay Mart USA,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
which is, by its own admission, America's favorite gay superstar.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
And they sell, among other things, really good bathing suits.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Also, lots of cock rings and lube.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
And, like, fancy underwear and stuff.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
So I thought it'd be funny if I went back to the parties,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
we're all doing shopping for this big New Year's Eve party that's going to happen,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
and a bunch of people are going to come, I didn't know.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And so, I bought, you know, we all got snacks,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and there's food, and there's booze, and all this stuff.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
So I wanted to find, they had these little cock rings that looked like lifesavers,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
a little j... a little bigger than that, with a jelly,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
like, kind of stretchy little jelly things,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
and they come in little plastic lifesaver wrappers.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And so I thought, I just, they're really, like, they're not expensive,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
so I just buy a big bunch of them, put them in a bowl,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
and have those next to, like, their pretzels and shit, and they'll be like...

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
You can have cock rings, because everyone's going to come with couples more or less to this party.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I thought, okay, let's put the cock rings in.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
So I asked the gentleman behind the counter at GameMart,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
do you have those little jelly cock rings?

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
All they had were these really high-concept-looking cybernetic, like,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Shadowrun cock rings, I didn't mind fucking... did not know how to...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm talking, I'm going to drink.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh, I'll keep talking.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
So, I said, do you have those little gel ones?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
He goes, no, we're out of those, they're just so great, though.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
I go, do you know a store, like, because there's one little strip there

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
that's all these, like, gay bars and stores and, like, fashion places.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It goes down to bear wear.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I'm like, where's bear wear?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
He's like, it's just two dollars down.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I go into bear wear, it was the fucking best.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Guess what's in bear wear?

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
A bunch of the most adorable bear couples is walking around buying,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
putting, like, holding up clothes on a hanger and holding it up to their boyfriend.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
I'm like, everyone's buying, like, little outfits and, like, scarves and things,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
and I'm up there just talking cock rings with the top brass,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
and it was really nice.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I really enjoyed my time at bear wear.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Also, I took the cock rings to the party.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Three of them instantly were gone.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And no one was talking.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And I think I found it later on that two of them were gone,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
the girlfriend had taken them for the boyfriend,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
because there was going to be lots of drinking involved,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
and they want, you know, a little enhancement later on down the line.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
Well, that, I'd like to, I mean, I kind of think maybe a later episode,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
but, like, I want to understand the cock ring concept.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I'll explain it all to you in a moment.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
One of the cock rings was out of the wrapper next to the bowl.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I'm like, who did this?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The guy's like, I thought it was candy.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I'd like to understand cock rings,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
and I'd like to understand the bear community if there is, you know,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
if there's a bear Harmontown out there.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
We must, I'd like to think we have a few bear fans out there.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
It'd be nice.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
I sometimes feel like we somehow marginalized the marginalized on our show.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
I feel like the bears do a pretty good job of saying,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
like, you have a store called Bearware,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
and in there everybody looked like exactly what I wanted bears to all look like.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
It was really cool.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
Frankly, I'd like to see more black people in the audience,

25:00.000 --> 25:08.000
and I'd like to see more gay people, but you can't see them as well.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
But we often ask, like, who's gay?

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And it's like, I don't, I just want, you know,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
let's throw some ladies in there, too.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Like, I don't, I'd like to...

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
After black people and gay people?

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
In keeping with the American tradition.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
Gay people were president.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I just, I feel like we're doing something wrong.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
I feel like I cut the silhouette of some kind of, like,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Belushian, like, figure.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
It's not what I mean to do.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I know I'm ignorant, I know I'm clumsy,

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
but I love all people, and I wish we had more black Armenians.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
It makes me feel like we're doing something wrong.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
If you're black and you're out there,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
well, then you're out there.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
So you're fine.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
If you're black and you're out there,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
I don't want to sound racist, but do you know other black people?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Could you tell them to come here?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Are any of your best friends black people?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Right, and that's the hell, now I'm racist,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
for asking you if you have black friends because you're black.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I don't want to do that.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
If you're black and you're out there, thank you.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
That's the, thank you.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
What's your name over there?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Jamal.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Jamal, fucking.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Cha-ching.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Jamal, indeed.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
But can we, I mean, that's, but that's the thing,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
like all his friends pointing at him, like, that's,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
that's the, like, that's, that's why,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
that's why they don't, that's why they don't come.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
They don't want to get sucked into my black hole,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
my white hole.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Is, is community, does it have a large black audience, do you know?

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
How do you measure that?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Do you get a lot of black people tweeting you and saying,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
I love your show?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
No.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Rick and, Rick and Morty, I think Adult Swim has a larger black audience,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
so a lot of, and I, I, this is going to sound crazy,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
and I, I don't, I don't believe anything about this.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I'm only repeating what seems to be the case,

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
but it seems like, it seems like a black audience is like animation a lot.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Like they, Adult Swim has, like, a black audience,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
and Rick and Morty, like, I, like, community, like, episodes will go,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
and I'll just, I'll look at the tweets,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
but then when an episode of Rick and Morty is airing,

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
like, there's a lot more, like, like, like, a face that you just,

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
I just go like, ah, man, that guy, man, I wish he was my friend.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Just with a tweet that's like, this motherfucker just said,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
butters a disease or something.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
I don't know.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Like, like, they'll, like, quote, like a thing,

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
but they'll kind of quote it in sort of a street language.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
And it, and it, and it validates me.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
So black people, come on down next Sunday.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
And keep watching Rick and Morty, and I love you too.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
All right, so moving on to a couple more things.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
So obviously I was right in my predictions about the Jurassic Park Nine,

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
whatever, the park is open, and I, I, I'm not, I wasn't psychic.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
I had heard reports that Chris Pratt is playing a raptor trainer in the movie.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Does he go out like a quarterback at the end with a bunch of raptors,

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
and they're all going to go clean house?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
He certainly does, he certainly does.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
In the newest trailer, it's becoming very clear that he,

28:37.000 --> 28:44.000
uh, that he trained, that he trains raptors for a living,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
and he hangs out with them, and he loves them.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
And then, like, there's this big dinosaur they've made that's like a big,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
they shouldn't have made this big dinosaur.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
And then he, in this new trailer, he's saying, he goes like,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
we got to go out there with everything we got,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
and it cuts to him on the four-wheeler with a flock of the last raptors.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Everything we got includes his trained raptors.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Did they say, uh, this time the girls are cleverer?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
It's just pretty amazing, and there's nothing to it.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
I did like the, uh, I mean, the fact that they had to show it to you,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I would like to have not seen it in the, in the trailer,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
but there's a Jurassic Park sea world, and a giant,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
giant kraken comes out of the, comes out of the ocean,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
and eats of, like, an orca hanging from a string or something like that.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
Which, by the way, I don't believe would be a part of the real Jurassic Park.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Which parts of it did you buy as real parts of the Jurassic Park?

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
Well, if there's reptiles that are ancient, that are walking on Earth,

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
it's like, I don't think that a park is going to put their money into a tank so big

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
that a gigantic, the creatures in the sea are already prehistoric.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Sharks are prehistoric.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Like, whales are basically prehistoric.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Like, they're fucking old and giant, and it's neat to watch them jump out of water.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
But there wasn't a thing, like,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
you know, 100 meters long. Yeah, me or Google a boobala.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
But, like, now you're being racist.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Guess what's last on your list if you go to Jurassic Park?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
You're not going to go to the fucking water tank.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
How are they going to get the insurance companies to sign off after the first Jurassic Park?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Like, where do they, like, we got it all figured out.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
This is a new world.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
It's the money, Jack.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It's the, like, what do you mean?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Are you going to go see it?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm not going to go see it.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm not going to go see anything.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm 42.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
I will wait the three weeks until it's on my wristwatch.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
You don't go out to the theater anymore?

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
If it's Valentine's Day, maybe I'll go see it.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
But, you know, Paul Rudd better be in it or...

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
All right, so go see it.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
You never feel like, oh, this is a movie that's going to be better on a giant screen.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I want to go see this on a large screen.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
The last time we tried that was Monuments Men.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
I don't think we've been to a theater since.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
You thought that story about stealing Hitler's art was only going to be great on a big screen?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
No, I was just saying, like, movies are for kids.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Like, going to see movies are for kids.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
And then as the kids get, you know, they parlay their parents' money into a new support system for themselves,

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
eventually you buy a screen on your wall and then you wear a bathrobe and you watch the movie on your wall.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
These guys know what I'm talking about.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah, you live in a little shitty apartment.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
You go to movies.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
But you dream of this.

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
You dream of rocking the fucking, like, the boiler room down here.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
For the non-visual listener.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
Walking naked around a mansion, a barfin' and pukin' and, I don't know, why a barfin' and pukin'?

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
I meant to say burpin' and poopin'.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
It's not far off, man.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
You want to be Jim Morrison.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
You want to be Howard Hughes.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah, so you get the big screen, the wealth distribution.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
You see that chart?

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh, everybody's got more money as you, like, yeah, you get older and you want that money.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You want that big screen in your house.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
Why is this, we spend some money, you, I mean, we meaning you, spend some money getting all these cameras up

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
and we get the live stream going on.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
Why can't we kill this cricket that's been here plaguing us?

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
It's the only theater that has one cricket that never goes away.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
He's my conscience.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
But how can he listen to you if he never shuts up?

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
He's telling me, just like, he's only saying one thing over and over again in case I ever listen,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
which is like, you're supposed to be at work.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Your show needs help.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Are you way behind schedule?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Of course I'm behind schedule.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I'll talk about that.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
All right, last thing, last thing on my, last thing on my thing.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
I really recommend everybody watch this show Empire, okay?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
It's on Fox.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
It's a show about, Terrence Howard plays a hip-hop record label mogul.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
It's like a dynasty.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Our friend, N.T., called it Black Dynasty.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
It's, he's black.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
He can call it that.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Also, he's black and he stopped coming to our show.

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, see, Jamal, please move up front next week.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
We're trying, and tell us what we're doing wrong.

33:33.000 --> 33:43.000
But Empire is, it's just a, I don't know, it's like a perfect story of like, I don't know, just watch it.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Watch the pilot.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
It takes you 40 minutes to watch the pilot of Empire.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
The dad is the mogul.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
He's running a record label.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
It's established immediately.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
He's a record producer.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Sorry, I got a little vodka off my mustache.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Jamal, that can be yours next week.

34:06.000 --> 34:17.000
The pilot opens on him sitting in like, basically a throne, like a cushioned throne overseeing a chanteuse singing into the microphone in the VO booth.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
And she's like, singing a song, some R&B song.

34:23.000 --> 34:32.000
And he goes like, stop it, stop it. And then he presses the mic button and he goes like, I need you to sing as if you just found out you were going to die.

34:32.000 --> 34:45.000
And then she's like, and then as she's singing, it intercuts from her singing to him thinking about the fact that earlier today he was in a hospital getting his hospital test results.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
So we're already knowing that he's going to die.

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
And then he goes in the booth and he goes like, all right, hold on. And he goes in the booth and he goes like, how are you doing? How are you doing?

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
And she's like, fine. And he's like, do you remember when your brother got shot?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
This guy sounds like a real bully.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
He's not a good man.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
No.

35:06.000 --> 35:14.000
Sing to him. And then of course she goes back and then she's like, I'm not doing a good impression.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
But of course she sings really well. And it's like, that's the first three minutes of Empire.

35:20.000 --> 35:28.000
And it's like, just so you now know what a record producer does for a living, if he's good, if he gets results.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
He emotionally terrorizes people?

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah. And so then they keep flashing back to the life. So I don't want to spoil it all.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
I'm telling you, just watch the pilot because the thing about the show is you're never watching one scene for more than one minute.

35:42.000 --> 35:51.000
The show is not, Dallas would be like eight minutes of two women about to pull each other's hair by the end of the episode.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
It would set it up the whole time. This is like one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute.

35:56.000 --> 36:06.000
There's like eight locations and this matriarch cookie who gets out of prison and the pilot goes back and forth between all the eight locations around the clock.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
And it's just stirring shit up because of course the company was built on her back and she went to prison.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
But the dad, I'll say nothing more about the show and then you make your decision of whether you want to watch it or not.

36:18.000 --> 36:31.000
But in one of the flashbacks to the 90s when the patriarch who founded the label, who used to be a gangster rapper, who previous to that was a real gangster,

36:31.000 --> 36:41.000
in one of the flashbacks, he's wearing a doo rag in his one bedroom apartment living room and he's got one baby on his arm and there's three sons in the show.

36:41.000 --> 36:56.000
And then the gay son, because one of his three sons is gay, and the idea is that one of his three sons has to take over the record label because he's dying of ALS, but he's not telling anybody.

36:56.000 --> 37:06.000
His gay son comes into the living room, as gay sons do, wearing high heel shoes and with a scarf around his head,

37:06.000 --> 37:14.000
and like swishing around and going like, look at me, I'm like a six year old boy but here's how you know I'm gay.

37:14.000 --> 37:22.000
And the dad gets so infuriated, he scoops the son up, takes him outside and puts him in the garbage.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
Puts his son in a garbage can.

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
He throws his gay son away in the garbage and puts the lid over him.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
That's a shame, people throwing away a perfectly good black boy like that.

37:37.000 --> 37:46.000
So I mean it's saying if you're interested in drama, maybe tune into Empire and check it out, there's only 12, 13 episodes.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
That's so specific, that has to be based in true anecdotal shit.

37:50.000 --> 37:59.000
Because I was so fascinated with it, I've heard rumors that one of the writers or actors had that experience, that happened to them.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
But I mean, amazing.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
That's horrifying.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
So watch Empire, I think.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
How many episodes are there already?

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
I think there's like 13, I'm three in, and it doesn't slow down.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It's pretty fun.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
So just watch it, will you?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Jamal, do you watch it?

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
No, that's racist to ask him, it's racist to ask him.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
No it's not, it's racist to not be able to ask that.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
Ugh.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
I can't really, you're sitting way back, the lights are on you.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
I seem that he's the kind of guy that can handle that sort of question.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
It's racist to say you can't see him.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I can't see the white people next to him either.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Okay, alright.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
If I can't, how do I know they're white people?

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
If I can speak for Jamal for a second.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
That's racist.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
I'll take that risk.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Okay.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
I'm gonna speak on Jamal's behalf for one second.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
You know, we can just bring him up.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
No, no, no.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
Too dangerous.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Come on.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
We can't have anarchy.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah, you all heard the trash can story.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
I'm Jamal, I'm speaking as Jamal for a second.

39:20.000 --> 39:27.000
I wish tomorrow I could wake up and spend an entire day from waking up till I go to bed,

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
not being my friend's black friend.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
I just want to be their friend, I just want to be Jamal.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
Jamal, do you want to come up and tell us if that's true?

39:39.000 --> 39:49.000
Can you come up?

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
It's just...

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
I only downloaded a few new songs and that was an accident.

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
It was that or the new Shadowrun theme I have very little to choose from.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I meant it, I'm proud.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Well, I mean, how accurate are we?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
You're actually 100% accurate.

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
Yeah, you wish you knew what it was like to not think about race.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
It's just like...

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
I see other people around, they're hanging out with their friends.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm like, that's cool, but I don't want to explain it.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
I just want to be white, honestly.

40:35.000 --> 40:47.000
Good night, folks.

40:47.000 --> 40:53.000
You just made Dan's dreams come true then.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
Let's say you just want to be white or have everyone in the world suddenly become black

40:58.000 --> 41:06.000
or any other means by which we could erase this concept, which seems to be an artificial conceit

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
so that it doesn't eclipse every conversation, every moment.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Or were you making fun of me when you said what you said?

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
I was just making fun of you.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
So we've entered a generation where you're not thinking about that at all, you don't care.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
I'm just dragging you down by thinking about it.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Yes.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
So we're just waiting for me to die.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
That's good though, that's a problem that solves itself, that's good.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
All right, well, what else do you want to talk about?

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
Are you plugging a book?

41:45.000 --> 41:55.000
I have a mixtape drop-in in December.

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
What's your mixtape name?

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
It's called Straight Fire.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
There's no way to know when you're making fun of me or not.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
You get to control everything, he gets to make you feel uneasy.

42:17.000 --> 42:24.000
Is there anything that you could link to or anything?

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
No, I was lying.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
Who is the real you, what are you doing?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I'm not sure exactly what you mean.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
What are you, are you a student or do you have a job?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I'm a student at LMU.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
LMU?

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
LMU, what's LMU, what is that?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Loyola Marymount.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
It's a college.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Where, tell me what the LMU stands for.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Loyola Marymount University.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
It's like near USC.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
You seem like you want to go to this.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
It's like south towards the airport, sort of.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Towards the airport.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
You got KXLU record, radio station there, right?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Don't you?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah, it's pretty white.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
Would you tell some other black kids to come to the show?

43:13.000 --> 43:21.000
I don't know many other black kids.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
We got to take baby steps.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
You need to be satisfied having any black people here.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
He's a black guy who listens to podcasts.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
He may or may not have only black friends.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
No, I didn't make that mistake.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
But the white guy that brought you here.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
What about him?

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
Your friend, your white friend.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
Does he have any black friends?

43:56.000 --> 44:04.000
I'm the black friend.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
And you don't really make mixtapes?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
No, no, I don't.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
He said he has a mixtape dropping sometime.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You drop that off to your girlfriend.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
That's in 1987.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
What are you studying?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm undeclared right now.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
What would be your dream gig if you could have your pie in the sky?

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Do you do anything you wanted for a living?

44:29.000 --> 44:40.000
I'd probably be on community.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Fairy tales can come true.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
What can happen to you?

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
There's a table in the back.

44:51.000 --> 44:58.000
You put your headshot in a basket back there.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Everybody knows that.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Is this your first time at the show?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Yes, it is.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
You don't know about the table?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I know you're joking.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Is there a part in your back of your head?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
You knew that Spencer was just a fan.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
He came one time when he got on the show.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Adam, I know you think that.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
I've been on twice.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Really?

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
I don't watch the show.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
I think Adam started coming to the Harmontown Show because he was on community.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
He got wind of...

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Oh, is that right?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I didn't know that.

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
Jamal, other than wanting to be on television,

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
what is your dream?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I have no idea.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
How old are you?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
I'm 18.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Oh yeah, you don't have to know yet.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Do whatever you want.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Be nice if you knew.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
His parents aren't paying for him to have a lifetime vacation.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Did you know you wanted to be at 18?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
I was going to be a sportscaster.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
And I refused their money.

46:15.000 --> 46:26.000
And I worked hard at Marquette University to become a sports journalist.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
For real?

46:29.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah.

46:37.000 --> 46:48.000
Or maybe I can lie too.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
All right, cue the...

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Let me do some rapping.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Jamal, you're going to want to stay for this.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
From the streets, yeah, from the streets, yeah.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
From the streets to the streets, from the alley to the streets, from the streets to the road.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Fuck your mama like a frog or a toad.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Put my dick in her mouth dissection.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
Fuck your mama's infection.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Gross.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Fuck your mama from the ceiling to the floor.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
Fuck your mama so hard she wanted some more.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Fuck your mama down the hall.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Fuck your mama slumber and fall.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Fuck your mama in the new way.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Fuck your mama till she was gay.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Hold on, hold on, hold on, new area.

47:39.000 --> 47:47.000
Okay, whoa, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Left to the right.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Fuck your mama till she lost her sight.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Needed a stick to walk around.

47:54.000 --> 48:01.000
Fuck your mama till she didn't know what town.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
Hold on, hold on.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
Jamal, uh, what city are you from?

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
Claremont? Where's that?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Is this in California?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Oh, god.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Alright, alright.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Yo, yo.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
J to the A to the M-A-L.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
I fucked your mama so hard, but she'll never tell.

48:29.000 --> 48:36.000
That doesn't mean it was rape.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
Okay, Jamal, everybody.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Thank you.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Thank you, Jamal.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Now Dan, while the beat is still rolling,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I want you to sing the melody hook

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
like you were gonna die tomorrow.

48:52.000 --> 49:01.000
Yo, yo, oh, oh, rain, rain comes down on your umbrella.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
Every drop makes you me, I'm your guy.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Alright.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Alright.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
It's very unsettling to me that an 18-year-old kid

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
can come up and just go,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I wish I was white,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and then have me go like,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
oh, yeah, yeah.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
And then kind of like try to meet him halfway,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
and then he's like, I'm just fucking with you, bro.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Like, I don't know if you noticed,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
but it kind of threw me, because I'm like,

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
well, if we're really living in a post-racial America,

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
then we have a huge problem,

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
because then that means that we're...

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
There's a huge...

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
We're not paying attention to certain things that...

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Is the problem that when he said he wishes he were white,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
he wasn't like?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
No, no God, no.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
I don't want him to be telling the truth when he says that.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm saying like, the idea that it's become a joke,

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
that race can become a joke before we address the issues

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
that are tagged race,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
that's the troubling thing to me as a Gen Xer.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
That's the troubling thing.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I think that behind...

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
I'm getting a little tipsy,

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
so I should not be talking in this area.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
But I...

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
So let me put a pin in it.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
I think that race is tied to wealth distribution

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
in an unfortunate way

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
that needs to be paid attention to,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
and I think that the race as artificial construct,

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
egalitarian, let's all ignore everything that separates this thing,

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
is 50% the solution and 50% part of a shell game,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
as part of a larger system that says,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
you're racist if you pay attention to anything

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that separates anybody,

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
because it keeps your eyes off of the walnut

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
that has the pee under it.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And I'm too drunk to go further with that.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Also too uneducated.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
I dropped out of my first semester at college,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
so I don't have anything to back that up.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
But I always get suspicious of that,

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
and that's the same thing with religion,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
when you hear me piping up about religion.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
It's like, I had like a big Twitter exchange

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
following the David Cross episode,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
or I thought David Cross is...

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
As Aaron says, David Cross's atheism is truly empowering.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Like, he's the kind of guy that's like, he goes,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
hey, I'm an atheist, nobody else should be.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
And the thing that makes me argue

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
with people who are evangelical about their atheism,

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
is the suspicion I have,

51:43.000 --> 51:49.000
that the things that we're tending to blame

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
just religion on,

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
which is basically like kind of all bad stuff,

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
it freaks me out that we can just jump on that.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
Because I get worried about the real criminals

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
who are inherently not religious people,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
or atheists, they're just capitalists.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
And they get away with actual crimes,

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
that there's a class system that is tied to this stuff,

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
and that when you say in this country that there's a culture war,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
and you point at all the dummies that, you know,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
they believe so much in God

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
that they think the world was created in six days.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
You're also talking about people who play scratch-offs

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
and believe in the horoscopes.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
You're talking about people who are kind of exploited.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
You're talking about people who have been convinced

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
by people who are kind of bullying them

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
that their faith should be put in military

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
and fear of strangers and all this stuff.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
I just worry a little bit about the intelligentsia,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
just dogpiling on all religion,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
because I don't think the corner pastor

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
in your neighborhood is at the top of the conspiracy.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
So, too drunk.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
My obsession with race and religion and all that stuff

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
is I'm always suspicious of the actual thing in the room,

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
which is rich people have more than poor people,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
and we kind of never talk about that.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I don't know if that's because it's boring,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
or if it's because it's like,

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
if they're actually successfully distracting us from talking about it.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
So, how'd your vasectomy go?

53:19.000 --> 53:25.000
Aces.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
I hope I didn't get too drunk to play Shadowrun.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Don't get too drunk to play Shadowrun.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
No, I don't.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Don't tell me not to.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
But your character,

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
because I've read Spencer sent me your character sheet.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Did you see one of your negative qualities on there?

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Alcoholism.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Severe alcoholism.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
All right, so it's a big night.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
We're going to start playing Shadowrun tonight.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
What is that video?

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
What's the plan for the video?

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
What is the...

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
What are you doing?

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
That's the most ironic statement in the world.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
You're sitting in the room.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
You paid $10.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
There's cameras everywhere.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
The entire thing is being live streamed.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
How long has that camera been up?

54:18.000 --> 54:26.000
Since I started talking about anything that might get me in trouble, is that...

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
But are you from out of town?

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
And you're like, they won't believe this.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
All right, okay, okay.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
I've lashed out at my best friend, I'm sorry.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
Where are you from?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
We're part of LA.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I grew up in Venice.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Venice, nice. Do you go to Venice High?

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
No, because my parents thought I'd get shot, so they sent me to St. Lauderdale.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Did you get shot?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Didn't get shot.

55:00.000 --> 55:07.000
Didn't get shot? Your parents were right again?

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
Now, speaking of the kind of anti-capitalist distribution of wealth thing,

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
I think it's kind of built into this whole shadow-run universe.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Oh, for sure, yeah.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
The corporations have taken over, and there's a group of mercenaries

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
who either exploit it or are exploited by it.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.000
I believe we are a dragon awakening away from living in the world that shadow-run exists in.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
All right, well, let's bring out...

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
Should we bring them out in one at a time, or just bring them out?

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
Let's bring out my wife, Erin McGathy.

55:40.000 --> 55:46.000
Hello.

55:46.000 --> 55:56.000
Hello.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Thank you. Hello.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Oh, yeah, kill the baby.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Star of the new number one channel on a one-show, kill the baby.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I'm the baby.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Female lead, I would, yeah.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Oh, that's nice. Yeah, thanks.

56:11.000 --> 56:18.000
Unless the baby's a girl.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I think the baby's a boy.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
Baby's a boy.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
Thanks for having me. Goodbye.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
But you're the baby? I haven't seen it, I'm sorry.

56:28.000 --> 56:36.000
I'm not the baby. This is a channel one-at-one show from Alex and Ariel that went first this last week.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
And I play the wife to a man who wants to kill our baby.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Okay.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Check it out.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
All right.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
Was this all part of that nationwide insurance campaign that wasn't acceptable to me?

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Wait about that.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Explain the nationwide thing.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
I think, like, I was watching at the drawing room and the sound was kind of, like, at,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
pardon me, at 50%, so I couldn't quite hear it.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
And there was a kid, like, and he's in a bathtub, but he's sailing the seven seas with his dog,

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
and he's in the tree house, and he's got the dog up there.

57:06.000 --> 57:11.000
And then, then, like, he's, like, a kid, like, being, like, an imagineer of his own fun.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
And then all of a sudden, there's just a picture of a bathtub that's overflowed,

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
and then a TV that's fallen, like, clearly would have crushed anybody beneath it.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
And it said, you know, most childhood deaths are preventable.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
And everyone in the bar was like, whoa!

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
Dead baby commercial!

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
Does the company tell you what's appropriate to put in different rooms in your house?

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
It says, like, go to Don'tKillYourBaby.com, and we'll fucking, we'll help you save up

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
your house from certain disaster, or give us $500 a month, and we'll make sure, like,

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
it's fucking horrible.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
And it'd be a shame if anything bad should happen to your baby.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Hey, you got a good baby.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Your son, your son seems like a nice kid, you know.

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
Be ashamed of, I don't know, maybe a flat screen television lands on his head.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't know.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
It happens.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
It happens all the time.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Go to Don'tKillYourBaby.com.

58:07.000 --> 58:16.000
You see terrible statistics about such things that I would hate to see happen to your only son

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
with the high heels and the trash cans.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
So joyless.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
He wears the high heels and the rag on his head.

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
Yeah, when the gay son comes out, clearly the young actor was confused, and they just

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
threw a scarf on him and the things, and they're like, come out like you're doing the wrong thing.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
So it's a six-year-old actor doing this, like it's a little boy doing this?

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
Yeah, it's incredibly offensive because it means that gay means that you wear high heels

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
and scarves on your head.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
I dressed up as a kid a lot, and some of that included dressing up in women's clothing,

58:49.000 --> 58:56.000
because I had two options, dad's clothes or mom's clothes, and I wore them all.

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
That sounds like a poll quote from your autobiography.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
I wore them all.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
I do recall coming out, because my parents would have these swanky late-70s dinner parties,

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
and there was fondue, and all the dudes had suits and great mustaches and looked like the Marlboro man.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
And the women all had great dresses on and were named Lorraine and shit, and they all...

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Do you think there was some key business happening?

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Key?

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Key party business? Do you think your parents were part of...

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
You know, I've actually considered that retrospectively, but I don't think so.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
I don't think it was really that kind of vibe.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
It was a pretty permissive environment in terms of...

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Yeah, it was just 70s. People were groovy, and the guys did their thing,

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
and the women would kibbutz and talk and smoke and drink.

59:37.000 --> 59:44.000
But I do remember coming out of my mom's bathroom and took one of her products, like eyeliner or lipstick,

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
and I think I put it on, and I did a big Revlon commercial for everybody.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
That's so cute.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Like you...

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
I would come out and do it, because you watch TV, and they do commercials,

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
so they would be having this dinner party that my brother and I were not supposed to come out and interrupt,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
because there were being adults, and probably swinging, probably fucking.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And I would just come out and interrupt it for a little 30-second spot,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
so I would come out and sell you some lipstick that I found.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So you would come out and go, like, Revlon make-ups.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah, the new Revlon Ultra color. The new thing with the lips.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Which...

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Was your mom putting the makeup on you?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
No, I was just raiding her bathroom and finding things to sell, like to do commercials for her.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Got it.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Also, I was auditioning for commercials around that time, too, so maybe that was in my head as well.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Did I ever tell you the one about me running into a party with some information that I'd discovered?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard that.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
That was a great story.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
All right.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Let's bring out Game Master Spencer Crittenden!

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Game Master!

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
He is the gay master!

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Game Master!

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Put him in a trash can. He hiles on.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Game Master, all day long.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Hey guys.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Hey Spencer, what's cooking, man?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You know, just throwing away children.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I don't know. I don't know you guys. I'm kind of... I'm kind of...

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Oh, run out. Run out of juice.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Yeah.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's 9-Eleven.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Oh, I didn't even...

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It's not... It's January 1st. The clock says 9-Eleven.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I wasn't even thinking it was 9-Eleven when I said that, but, like, yeah, this is getting close to my bedtime.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's just, you know, it's no good.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
We do this every week, Spencer.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And I usually go to bed at, like, 10 or 9.30 if I can.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Yeah.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Yeah, sleeps the best part of the day.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Also, you've been...

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
As far as I know, you've been spending a good part of your waking hours working on Shadow Run for us.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah, I mean, it is. Yeah.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I've read the book about four times now, and I still barely understand it.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I reread some of that stuff multiple times, and I still have only a passing knowledge of it.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Oh, I know you do.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I haven't read it, and I get it.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yep.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Are our friends...

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I'll teach you.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Is DeMorge Brown here?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Yeah, he's here.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Oh, okay. DeMorge, are you here?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
DeMorge Brown.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
DeMorge Brown.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Downtown.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
DeMorge Brown.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
DeMorge, do you know Jamal?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I don't know Jamal, but I will meet him.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
He lives a very sequestered life.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I can reach him through the network.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Black people!

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
There's a special slash...

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Jamal's an extra special name because it's a math book name.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Well, everyone's saying what, but when I was in school in math books where it has pictures

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
of different people, a lot of the African-American kids were named Jamal.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Math book name.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:21.000
As a white writer, if you know a character as African-American, you cannot name them Jamal.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000
There's a short list of names that the other white writers will go, no, send it back.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You can't do that, which is funny.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Should you tell them that in the world of commercials?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Because when you audition for commercials, pretty much every script that has a black

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
character in it is named Jamal.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I think that's part of the reason, though.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I think it's just Ebon Flo.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
It's a beautiful name and you're a beautiful person.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That's why I think it Ebs and Flows.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I think culture gets a hold of those.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I think white writers, they're all white.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000
They get confident and the bubble inflates and then it bursts because the ninth all-state

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
commercial to have a kid named Jamal in it, then somebody starts going, this is the new

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Leroy.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
We can't do this anymore.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Dan, when you're creating a black character for a community or another show...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I would never do such a thing.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You know Dan's the first person a Hollywood ghost would do when they're creating a new

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
black character.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
He's a consultant.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Have you ever gone and tried, I want to make this a black-sounding name.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
For instance, I'm unlikely to meet a white D'Morge.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
D'Morge sounds like an African American name.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
The United States you're not, but in Switzerland you are.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Is that right?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
There's a whole village full of family...

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
No shit?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
There's a village of D'Morges?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's a last name, but there's also a horse, a racing horse right now named D'Morge.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It's a horse.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Stop being so racist.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I love it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
No, no.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's like in this country now, but outside of that spirit.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
But it's a unique first name, right?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Yeah.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.680
We cast Keith David in this season of Community, so the character, the actor is cast before

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.000
the character is named, so here's a room full of white writers like have to come up with

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000
a name for a black man, and so that is a factor for us.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.800
I would like to hear all the pitches.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.000
I bet you would.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And also the conversations that we have about it, this is the real world, the ugly, strange,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
twisted, balloon animal world of racial consciousness, like white writers going like, well, I don't know.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Well, not that for sure.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And one of the things is he's not named Jamal, that's for sure.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I just went all the way.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
His name is Elroy Patashnik.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I was like, I can't, I'm running from this.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I'm not doing it.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Giordello, Jaffet Koto's character in the homicide, it was based on a real story, and the real

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
head of the homicide department was a Sicilian.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But when they cast the actors, the actor they liked the most was Jaffet Koto.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So they didn't change the script at all.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
He was just named Al Giordello, and for the whole series he walks around when the officers

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
are confused, and he just says, the Sicilians have a saying, and he speaks in Sicilian.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And then he says, get out of my office, and he pulls a red table wine out and, you know,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
starts eating Italian food.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Really?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
The Sicilian food.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
They just didn't bother to change it.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
No, no, no, they didn't change it at all.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
That's great.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And then later on, they wanted to bring him a son, bring his personal life into it, and

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
they brought a real Black Sicilian.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
They brought Giancarlo Esposito into play.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
His son just sort of had this crashing of details.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
That's great.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Do you guys remember when Dan said, I'll fuck your mama and her infection?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It rhymed with some—

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
No, I know, but I—

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I find these days that when I rap, one of two things happens.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Something comes out that's so gross that I stop and go, that's gross.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Or it's just stuff that I've already said.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
It's like mentally exploring the idea that there is a man somewhere that refers to his

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
wife's vagina as her infection.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
See, were that conjured in my mind that it wasn't her vagina?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
She had some other infection that he was fucking.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It might have been on her thigh, you know, or her calf or something.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Or like maybe Adam and Eve.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Adam was like, oh, you're so great.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I don't know why I'm attracted to you.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I am.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
What is that?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Are you sick?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It looks like—it could look like a—

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It does seem like you're not well.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Like in a vacuum.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
In a vacuum.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
If all you knew was men and then a woman pulled her pants down, you'd be like, are you all right?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And vice versa.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yeah.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
If all you saw were women and then a man, you'd be like, whoa.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The first time I saw you.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
You really have to get that looked at.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It's not a controversial statement.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Yeah.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I think what you're saying, Dan, is boys have wee-wees and girls have crack-wees.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, it's like—it's similar to, like, ax wound, which is such a grudge.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I mean, which is a terrible thing to say.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'm really laughing because—

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
There are 900 words for a vagina and none of them are pleasant, really.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I mean, a couple that are passable, but mostly just no.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Paloma.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
No, you just ruined that name.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You call her Pussy Paloma?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000
No, that's our name for unborn daughter that is not—

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
He just called your pussy your Paloma.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I mean, we'll just change it.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Her name just won't be Paloma.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Dan and I have talks about naming a daughter Paloma.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Paloma!

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Pull it together.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
All right.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Sorry, Spencer.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Hey, guys.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
When you say you're unborn daughter, have you conceived?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Are you trying to actively right now?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I don't know.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
No.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'm giggling because you're the first person who's asked.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000
No, we are not actively trying to—what a weird question.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I don't know.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Are you trying to make a baby?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
You said that.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
No, no.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I'm sorry for being too personal.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
That's way too personal.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I'm sorry.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I don't need to press you down.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'm coming in her tits a lot.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Does that—

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Which brings us back to cock ring story.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But I'm stopping it up with a paper towel

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and doing what I call stuffing.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
The tunnel.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Isn't it?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
We read somewhere—

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
It's a great way to get an infection.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
We call it demerging.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
What?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
That wasn't fair.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I'm just here, man.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I'm just here.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
We're waiting until June 1st.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
We're going to start conceiving.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
We've decided we want our child's birthday

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
to be a very specific date.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
So we're just going to cast a wide net

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and take advantage of our God-given right to abortion.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We're not Republicans, for God's sake.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I want my kid to be born on April 15th.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Because I want everyone to remember

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:37.000
my taxes are due and also—

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It'll be our first child, but our fifth pregnancy.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I mean, you guys, those of you who have come to the show live,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
this glow is not un-pregnant.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Look at me.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Beaming.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
What if we can't have kids?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I mean, if anybody can't, it's got to be me, right?

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Don't I just seem sterile?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I feel sterile.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I just feel like I feel so sterile.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Is that your way of just talking yourself

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
out of ever having to wear a condom?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
It's like, oh, baby, I'd never get you pregnant.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
No, I've never used that as an excuse in the past.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I'm married now.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I'm just saying like, yeah, no, it just doesn't seem like—

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000
When I look at myself in the mirror, I don't go, ah, potency.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I go like, eh, apology amati.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You don't picture him firing off like a million geomatis.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
You think in order to make a new apology amati,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
you'd have to catch one and distill it and help it,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
put wheels on the back on its tail,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.000
put it on a sperm track to an egg that's like in braces.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We made a new geomati.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
It wasn't easy.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000
The park is open.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I don't know what kind of new geomati you're making in there.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It doesn't sound like a good idea.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Don't you see what you're doing, geomati?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You're tampering with nature.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Spent so much time thinking whether you could make another apology.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
You didn't stop.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
That is one big pile of geomati shit.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I think it's time to start getting into our shadow run for this evening.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Fuckin' hey, man.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Yeah, that's why I brought him out early, see?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
You brought me on at the normal time.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Well, I brought you out earlier, but then we talked,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
and you know how we usually bring you out?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It's normal time.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Normal time you bring me out.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It's my fault.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There's nothing wrong with it.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Just call him like you see it.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Well, I listened to the show last week,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and I heard all of your awesome characters

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I'm very excited about,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and so I should probably start off by revealing my character, correct?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Correct.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Is that good?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Is that a right sponsor?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Yeah, that's fine, because our characters all know each other.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So, we're not going to be meeting each other.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
No.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
We're going to be beginning on, as I understand it,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
we're going to be beginning already having known each other.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah, you're like a team of shadow runners.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I love it.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
There you go.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I'm so excited.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
We're going to really try to do it right,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
and I'm sorry I got, but not too drunk.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I just got a little too drunk.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
But I mean, not too drunk.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
All right, well my character's name is Eve.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Yes.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Eve was born, you know what?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Do you play a little Vangelis?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Funny you should say that.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I think I have a song for my thing.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
If I were here last week, I would have done musical.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Oh, by the way, last week, I never said, like,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Yacht was the name of the band, right, Dustin?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Like Yacht, who's like, actually, I mean,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
they don't need to give their music away.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
That was a great band.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Yeah.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Who did I play tonight, Dustin?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The song called My Kind of Devil.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Do we know?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's not on here, but we'll find it out.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
We'll put it on the thing.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
But thank you for ever wrote that.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I like that song.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Okay, so here we go with Eve.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Let's see what we got here.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
If you like any music you hear in the show,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
go find out who made it.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Jamal has a mix of all the music tonight

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:56.000
at blackfire.org.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Here it is.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Pardon me.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Eve was born the daughter of two loving middle-class

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Elf shamans.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Before her birth, her parents ran a successful chain

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
of alchemy stores in Seattle,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
but they were squeezed out of business by big alchemy.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And with a baby on the way,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
they chose very reluctantly to work

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
for the megacorporation Neonet.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
In exchange for big pay, they became nothing more

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
than corporate mage slaves,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
selling their magic, that's in the book,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
selling their magic and prostituting

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
their sacred shamanic tradition,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
helping Neonet enhance their security

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
and exploit the world.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
When their daughter, Ev Duriel, was born,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
they were determined to protect her

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
from their own sad fate.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Before she could be given a system ID number

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
and be absorbed by the states,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
they took their newborn daughter and left her

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
to the Elf magicians who lived in the woods

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
around Seattle in mystic harmony

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
with the Native American shamans of the Salish tribe.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
There, between her new elven and Native American family,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
she grew to learn and control her own powerful magic

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and to connect with the great spirits of Mother Earth.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
At 13 years old, however,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
her peaceful life was shattered

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
when her community was raided by awakened cops

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
on astral patrol for illegal gatherings of magicians.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Many of her people were slaughtered or arrested.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Like Ev Duriel managed to escape,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
alone and terrified and burning with hatred

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
for the violent power of the megacorps

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that destroyed her life and the lives of parents

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
she'd never known.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Ev Duriel vowed to use her magic, however she could,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
to undermine the powerful and return this world

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
to its natural state of harmony with Earth's great spirit

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and maybe see her family again.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
But, not done.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Before fleeing the woods to hide

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
in the bustling anonymity of the city sprawl,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
she called upon the spirit world for guidance.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Her buried anger and stormy personality

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
led her to take on the powerful mentor spirit

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
of the Thunderbird,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
whose beacon claws are lightning and her cries,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the clap of thunder!

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
The Thunderbird spirit now guides her to use her power for good

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and to destroy those who would oppose the spirits

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
of the natural world.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Armed with her magic, a cat-like agility

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and an old Comanche war club,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
she learned to survive on the streets as a shadow runner.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
She is now 20 years old,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
and she runs by the name of Eve Libertine.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It is such a shame.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
There should have been someone doing an interpretive dance

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
during that.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I want you guys to do that over again,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
but remember when your mother got shot.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Alright.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
So everyone knows everyone, right?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You're all, you're all ready.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I know Mercy, I know Eve,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and I want to recount,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
what's your character's name tomorrow?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Hordegard.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Hordegard.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Okay, the most amazing character ever.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah, I snorted.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Deal with it.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Hashtag, yes, all snorters.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Timely.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Yes, all snorters.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Alright.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Okay.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I have new theme music for Spencer's new intro to Shadowrun.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
The thing is, I'm not sure if there's like a proper intro to this,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
because it's, you know,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
because those were all kind of like recaps,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
but there's nothing to recap.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Okay, then we'll say that for next time.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't know you guys.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Okay.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
So you're all shadow runners, you're on a shadow running team,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
we all know this.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
That's background.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
What?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Maybe just an intro.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Maybe you guys care, what is your investment in this music?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Because it makes it special.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Does it?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
We like it.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I mean, it would be special if I got to say the things that I wrote.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I mean, that's special to me.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
All this hubbub isn't doing it. I don't know.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
When did you stop believing in magic?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I don't get it.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
We'll save the music for next time,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
we'll make it special for our recap kind of all of the old days.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Right now we'll just go and dry.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Make sense to me, Jeff.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
All right. Shadow runners, shadow running team, gotcha.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
All right.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
You all pile out of your Uber before the car scoots away,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
leaving you standing in the shade of the rotting wooden facade

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
of a dive bar.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Hank's last stand.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You've all received the same message from your fixer,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and you're going to miss.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
The message is as follows.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Listen, guys, I've done something bad.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I've got to lay low for a while, but look,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I know you need to pay rent, same as always,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
so I'm putting you in touch with Teddy.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
He was my fixer before I got my star fixin'.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
He's your man.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
He'll be picking up all of my slack while I'm gone,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
and I'll be making a nice little kickback for myself

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
for every job you guys complete.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
So don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Anyway, trust me, I'll be back on my feet in a few months.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Don't you fret.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Head to Hank's last stand, got me?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Teddy's the new cool Dennis.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Stand.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So there you are, in front of the dive bar,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
and out through the double doors

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
bursts a squat and strange figure.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It's Teddy.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
He's wearing an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
white shorts, and flip flops.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
The unbutton hangs from his belt.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Oh, yeah, and he's a dwarf.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Howdy.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I'm Teddy.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's great to finally meet you a lot.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
You see, cool Dennis told me all about you.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Now, I'm sure you have a lot of questions,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
and I respect that, but right now,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I've actually got a Johnson on the Rhine

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
who needs a run soon, as in, like, right now.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
So why don't we go inside and see what he needs?

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Sound good?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Sounds great.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
All right.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Johnson is street talk for a corporate client.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yes, yes.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
All right, Jim, stop wasting our fragging time.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Let's go inside.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Inside the moldy bar is empty,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
but for a tired old cowboy of a bartender,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
sat in a corner idly watching sports on a big screen TV,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
but then Teddy calls out,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Hank, if you wouldn't mind.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The old man nods and flips the game over to ARSpeak,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
shuffles out of the back room.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Teddy touches a button on his com link.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That's a cell phone.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And the big screen TV flashes

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
as a shadowy businessman persona appears on screen.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Teddy's all like,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
now if you'll forgive me, Mr. Johnson,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
me and the crew were just catching up on old times.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
They're old standbys.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
The best new upstarts in the shadows.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Isn't that right?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
He points to Mercy.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Isn't that right?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Gestures you to...

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Mercy.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
That's right. Yeah.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yeah, that's good.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
You're standing facing this shadowy figure

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
on a big screen television.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Talk to me.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
All right.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I'll talk like this because I can't emulate

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
like a computer voice thing,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
like in, you know, the news

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
when you're trying to hide your voice.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
That's what this guy sounds like, okay?

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Can we do that in post for the podcast?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Shit, for future episodes,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
do we have that effect in board?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I could like get an app for it or something.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I don't know.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I'll figure it out.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
That'll be fun.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Let's try it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Never mind.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
You thought you could just...

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Yeah, I did.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And it didn't come out the way I thought.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I'd be willing to hear more of that voice.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
It's like a giant frog.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Mr. Johnson, you were saying?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
All right.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
My employers have taken a keen interest

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
in better-than-life chips.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
That's BTLs.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
These data chips contain experiences

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
beyond normal experience.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
They inspire emotions.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
It's impossible in normal brains

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
and even out the rough edges.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Better-than-life.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Lately, experimental chips have been

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
leaking out of the Redmond Barrens.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Crazy chips.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Stronger than ever.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
We've heard rumors that these chips

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
don't have side effects or addiction.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Just rumors, though.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
We got a positive ID on an expert

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
software engineered by the name

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
of Baldwin Brown,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
sighted in and around an abandoned

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
warehouse that's been beefing up security lately.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Head down there and capture Brown.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Alive.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I want to know what he knows.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Scoop up all the BTLs you come across

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
and I'll bring them back.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'll meet you there.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I'll meet you at the drop zone with a payment.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
After the fixer fee, I can offer 5,000 each.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I'll throw in an extra 1,000

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
if you guys want to bring me back crates of BTLs.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Sounds good.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
How about you throw in an extra 1,500?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
All right.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Let me do this.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I'm rolling dice now.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
How's your family?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Oh, it's good.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
What is that?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Face.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
What was the amount that you said?

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
1,500.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Nope.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
All right.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
We will keep that in mind with our timing.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Mercy, what does Baldwin Brown do again?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Who is he?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
He's an expert software engineer.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Thanks, Mercy.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
So what do you guys say?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I don't know.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I don't know.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I don't know.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I don't know.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I don't know.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I don't know.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
So what do you guys say?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
5,000 a piece.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I don't trust him.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But I'll do it because I need the money.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I tried to negotiate the bonus.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I really think that this job sounds a little more dangerous

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
than 5,000.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
What's the currency?

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
New yen.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Oh, OK.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
How about 6,000 yen?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Well, that sounds a lot more agreeable.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
6,000 it is.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
All right.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Nice, Mercy.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000
You got a great face.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I would also like to go on this mission.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Hey, nightblade.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
You're not fucked up again, are you?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Just once I'd like to go on a mission with you

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000
where you're not totally blasted on cyber booze.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
You're Kettle Trons and whatnot.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It's our neck we're risking out there, nightblade.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I need the money.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
You don't look so good as what I'm trying to tell you.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Were you paying attention at all?

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Repeat back to me what Mr. Johnson just asked us to do.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
We were supposed to go get Bradley Woodford from the...

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Baldwin Brown.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Baldwin Brown has been seen in a warehouse.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
We're going to secure him.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
He's an engineer from this place that makes these BTL chips.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
We're going to grab him and any BTL chips we can.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
But she called the currency nyung nyung.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And that's why I'm laughing.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
All right.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Because it sounds like a cat food.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
What is it?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
New Yen.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Nobody tell her.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
All right.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Horticard, what do you say?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I have a feeling that this is something that we could do.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Quite easily, but we should go quickly because he is deteriorating this one on the right.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And we will need his...

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
He's talking to you, nightblade.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Horticard.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
You got tricks of cyber kettle on your...

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
We will need his attributes in the first day of the approach.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:31.000
You don't have to be a precog to see those guys fucked up.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
What do you guys have to worry about, Mia, right?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So someone go on there calmly and find out how far away the Redmond Barons are.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Not far.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Just an Uber right away.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Shall we hop in an Uber?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Sure.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Sure, who calls them?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
The fixer.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Perhaps.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Will he do this?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
There's an app for that.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I open up the Uber app in my brain.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Just on your cell phone, on the com link.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Okay.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I open up the Uber app and I request an Uber.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
An Uber arrives post haste.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Our Uber's here.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I get in.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
We exit the last stand.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
What's it called?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Hank's last stand.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Go to the Uber.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
All right.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Give me all your gum.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Wait, what?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Excuse me?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I'm saying that to the Uber driver.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
There is no Uber driver.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Oh, okay.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I see.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
All right.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Sorry.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I say that and then I laugh and I'm like, oh, it's a dream I have.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Sometimes I play out the dreams that I have.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
What's the plan when we get into you guys?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
What's the plan of attack?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Yeah, you might want to.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Yeah.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
We got to figure this out.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Okay.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So there's this warehouse.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
This guy's holed up in it and we want to just nab him.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
We don't want to kill him.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Have it drop us off on the side street.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
First of all, we are shadow runners.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
We should come out in the shadow.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Of course.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Absolutely.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
When we get there and sidebar table talk, this is my first time playing a magic user.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
It's going to be a learning curve for me on this one.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I've read a lot.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I'll try to actually perceive or to actually project when we get there to go inside the warehouse to see what's going on.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Oh, that's fantastic.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Should we nab him or are we just getting something from him?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
We're going to nab him and as many BTL chips as we can get our hands on.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
He's the package for the Johnson.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Right, right.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And I have extraordinary physical stealth skills.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I'm very stealthy as well on Agile.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Yeah.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Also, I can make myself invisible and levitate and shit like that.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I'm as familiar with Hordecai's skill set.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Hordecai.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I have several items at my disposal.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I will keep them to myself.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It is a private inventory.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Yeah.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But you should know my reputation.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Obviously precedes myself.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I would not be part of the team.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
No, of course.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Sure.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I have certain precognition skills.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I also have presets that allow me to enhance my physical abilities and mental abilities.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And I can probe minds if we get one and settle somebody down and need to know what's happening.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
That's great.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Can you pre-cog what's going on inside that warehouse right now?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Can you foresee the...

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I can use general perception, but pre-cogging requires me to retire somewhere and to find a good sound system.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Alright.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000
If this is going to be all muscle and agility, I'll stand outside and...

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
We look at a map of the city.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Okay.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
We're in Seattle?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Yep.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And we look at where this warehouse is.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Alright.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Can we pick a spot that looks like we could get maybe a good vantage point physically?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Like, you know, safe.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Totally safe.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Not trying to...

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I have no soft for the city of Seattle in my mind.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I can look at the building and also its sort of physical plant and no certain points of entry.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Any adjacent buildings?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Pass that to DeMorsch.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Here's a map.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Here's a map.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
It's a good deal.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Okay.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
To DeMorsch.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I love that you're not excited.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
He has the map.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
You don't have the map.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
We got a whole...

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I'm sensing that the map is stuck in translation.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Could I please maybe get it to myself?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I'm looking at the map.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Hold on.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
That's a train.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
It's not yours to have.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I'll have them up for download after the show.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Okay.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Alright.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Alright.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
It's...

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
The compound is...

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I don't think we're supposed to see it.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
DeMorsch is supposed to...

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Oh, sorry.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Sorry.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
It's fine.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
He can share, but afterwards...

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I'm sorry.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
If you could read my mind, what a tale my heart would tell.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
There's a warehouse surrounded by a large fence.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
The whole area is in the barrens.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's just this destroyed, devastated area.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
There's all sorts of squat shells of buildings you can kind of hide out and scope out the place if you wish.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And that's where the Uber kind of drops you off.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
It's just in an alleyway, kind of about 600 feet off.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
What time of day is it?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It's about 6 p.m. It's getting dark.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Okay.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Shadows are coming out.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Don't worry about, you know, us elves in our low light vision.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I have cyber eyes.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So from your vantage point, you can see the low-roofed warehouse.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000
It's on a big hunk of land fenced off by a 10-foot tall fence topped with knife wire.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
You see shattered, burnt-out buildings all over the place surrounding the lot.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And through the fence, you see the warehouse with a loading dock for trucks.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
The only entrance you can see on the compound is on the south side.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
There's a big gate controlled by a small gatehouse.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Far from state-of-the-art security, the fence looks old,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and you only see three armed guards manning the gate with submachine guns.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.000
One bulky security camera on the fence surveys the road leading up to the gate.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Someone's going to take out that camera.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Well, first let's talk about these fences.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
The ones that don't have a gate on them.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
What keeps one from getting in?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Wow.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Linked chains.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
It's a chain link fence.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And they're high, and they have...

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
A 10-feet tall topped with knife wire.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Knife wire.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Yup. That's a real thing.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Yeah. BFD.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
To a guy like me.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Can I go up to the fence without being seen?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Which fence?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Not the one by the guards, but like farther away from them.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Yeah, probably.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I go up there to check it out to see.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
You got to stealthily sneak up to see if there's any sensors,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
like a wire is connected to it, if it's electrified.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
What's your agility plus sneaking?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Um...

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Quick.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Don't make me rush.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Agility is four, and my sneaking is...

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Six.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
All right.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
You do it without being seen.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Fuck yeah.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
You're up on a fence.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
You're right by the knife wires.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I tried to use my perception on the fence and see what's going on.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
If it looks like there's any hidden sensors or things that might trip.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
You don't see any sensors.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
It's pretty rusted and old, actually.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
All right.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I'll go back to the group and relay that information.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Mm-hmm.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Hey.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Listen, don't run up to shit like that without us making a plan.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
You don't own me Nightblade.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I lived alone in this town for four years.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I'm a man without a past!

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
All right, look, we know that the two of you have...

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
The two of you have this will-they-won't-they bullshit.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Let's cool it for a second and focus on the task at hand.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
We're gonna work as a team, you know?

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
All right, well, cool it, Nightblade.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Cool it.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I'm telling her to cool it.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I take the note.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
All right.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000
So I'm wondering, you know, I got a nano whip in my fingertip compartment.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
We all know.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Yeah, like, that's the first time we've heard this story.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I'm not bragging, but I might be able to cut through the chain link, I'm not sure.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Do I know from experience if chain link is something that would thwart my nano whip?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
No.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
You know it would not do that, in fact.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I know it wouldn't thwart it?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Yes.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
In fact, your nano whip would thwart the chain link.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Like a knife through butter.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Like a knife through butter.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So we could go in, I mean, we could frag the three skisballs at the front gate.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'd say it's better to go and clean through the side.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I would suggest perhaps that we align ourselves directly in front of the security gate at a certain distance.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000
That we first toss into the compound, the security compound, a smoke bomb.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000
That's perhaps driving them out and perhaps each pick a target and shoot with each of the three guards.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Let's listen to the Nazi doctor.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I'm worried the smoke bomb will draw out all of the people inside as well.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
The security guards.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Yeah, there's only three.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Only three.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
But if we have these aligned, we each take one shot.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Right, but I think that beyond those three, there's like more, you know, in there.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And if we, the smoke bombs, that's going to, like, that's going to say, hey, everybody inside the compound,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
let's have all of you come out the front and deal with this.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
But they're inside.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Perhaps we can...

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Security guards on the outside of the gate.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Can we create a diversion?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Maybe I walk in, I'm wearing an action-ear business clothes.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And we all know I have this face.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Maybe I talk to the guards while you come in through the side.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
That's good.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
So we got, you know, we got going in through the back door.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:46.000
We got smoke bomb, weird Atari 2600 take all comers at the front door.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I have improved invisibility where I'm invisible to guards and sensors.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Well, let's have Eve do that then.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
You don't like walk through the front door?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Let's do that, but if we take that choice, then I would choose then to use a silent,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I have a silent gun, a gun with a silencer, and I would use that.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Well, yeah, that's a good move.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I call them a mentor of spirit, Spencer, the Thunderbird, for guidance on this.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Thunderbirds, like, you should check it out first.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
That's what I've been saying, Thunderbird.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Car, car.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
That's what I've been saying.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Everybody, we're all able to be in constant contact with each other.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Yeah, you have your com links and microtransceivers.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
All right, everybody, test your transceivers.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Check.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Are you hearing me?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Check.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Check.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Check.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Check.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Check.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Check.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Check.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Check.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Check.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Check.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Check.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Check.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Check.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Check.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Check.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Check.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Check.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Check.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Check.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Check.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Check.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Check.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Check.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Check.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
OK, we can split up, and I'm going to nano whip through the back door as a tour,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
and I'm going to, anybody I see, I'm going to take them out with stealth.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I think we should have an emergency code that we have in case the shit hits the fan,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
in which case we all run, or...

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Yeah.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We can't just run out and call on Uber.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.320
There's probably a spot that we're in right now.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.000
I say, here's what I say.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.040
I say, Nightblade, you go in, nano-whip that fence,

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.560
go in, see what you've got.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.240
And we need two people to cover the front gate.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.040
So if anything goes weird with the guards there,

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:35.840
we'll take them out.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.480
That's true.

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.040
That's their only way out.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.600
That's how we should be looking at this.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.920
These guys are pigs in a pen.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.180
What?

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.520
Wait, what?

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.060
So you're saying that the two people on the outside

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.120
need to be on the outside, because that's their only way out.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.800
And we're going to execute the people that are leaving?

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.440
No, I'm saying we're going in there to get a guy.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.680
The front gate is not important for us to get in,

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.680
but it is important for us to keep an eye on in case

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.000
the guy we're trying to get tries to get out.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:05.400
I see.

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.680
OK, I can stand at the front gate.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:18.600
I can't do much physically, aside from having a great face.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.040
So I'll do that.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.400
I just, that sounds fine.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.280
I don't want to.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.000
When the rest of the group settles on the plan,

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.360
I am fully equipped to do whatever the task is assigned to me.

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.160
Nightblade, you want to go try to get in,

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.560
keep us posted on the com links.

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:42.000
And if there's trouble, we come charging in after you.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.080
If not, we'll see what we see, and then we'll take it from there.

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.160
All right, sound good?

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.160
I'm going to go in.

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.520
All right, I'm going to nano whip the fence.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.000
All right, so there's multiple sides.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.400
It's like a rectangle of a fence, so northeast, south, or west.

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.640
I want to go in the west side.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.960
All right, which side?

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960
OK.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.280
Just so you know, just in the middle of that fence,

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.200
once you get over, there are crates.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.280
If you need to scale them, you could perhaps arrange them

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.960
to get to the top of the warehouse.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.000
Well, that might make a good visual cover for the hole

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.440
I cut in it.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:14.920
It's good.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:15.840
Do what you like.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.440
Look for these crates that he's talking about.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.080
Where are these crates?

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.120
You find the crates.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.640
On this side of the fence, you're actually

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.720
pretty close to the warehouse itself.

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.080
There's only kind of a narrow five or six feet space,

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.920
and it's kind of packed with crates, so yeah.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.360
I like that.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.320
Sounds like good cover.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.000
Using the visual cover of the crates,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.600
I nano whip a man-sized hole in the chain link.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:46.760
You do that successfully, you neatly slice.

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.400
You guys see a sized hole?

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.320
With that, we are officially shadow running.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.720
That's right, that was the wrong hand.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:56.040
My nano whip is in a fingertip compartment

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.280
on my human arm.

01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.960
My bionic arm is the other arm.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.460
OK.

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.440
All right, you're inside.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.080
You're right next to this warehouse.

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.680
The property is big and deserted.

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.800
It's the perfect spot for secret research.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.280
You can see an old rusted storage container

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.560
on the far side of the yard, trash,

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.000
litters of the ground.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.960
You're also right next to a shooting range

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.720
with targets and bullets and stuff.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.880
What's the nearest structure from these crates?

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.720
You're right next to the warehouse,

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.160
but you're not next to a door.

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.360
You don't see any doors on the side of the building you're on.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.240
How far physically are we away from the guards

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.760
at the front gate?

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.120
I mean, about 250 feet if you're kind of near where he is.

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.040
OK.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.040
Is there, do I see a way to, well, it doesn't matter.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.120
I'm Jim Nightblade.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.160
I want to go to the warehouse and use my grappling gun

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.800
to get to the roof.

01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.840
All right, you do that.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.920
Guys, he's going in alone.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.960
I'm going to go on with him.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.320
All right, be careful.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.640
If you follow him, please be careful.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.600
If you go to the south on the outside,

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.720
there is a bit of a sinkhole.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.120
And you might, as it gets darker, be prone to falling in.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.840
So please be careful.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.760
How do you know all this?

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.080
A perception on this?

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:23.080
I have a city of Seattle map.

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.800
My mind is one of my no-softs.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.320
Oh, us?

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.080
OK, that's very good.

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.040
Thank you, Hordegaard.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.000
Hordegaard, where's the best place for me

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000
to stand if I'm standing in a position to talk to somebody?

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.280
It's like somebody's talking about guards or people

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.960
who would inquire.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.440
The gate is on the south side in the middle.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.160
The road that leads to the front gate

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.560
is the only way out and the only way in.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.160
And this in-science inside leads to the loading dock.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.400
The gatehouse is next to that.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.640
It's a sentry unit, and it is separate, of course,

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.080
from the gate, just a sentry house with three guards inside.

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.600
OK, I'm going to walk around in front of that.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.640
You're saying the front gate is the best place?

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.960
It would appear to be a front gate,

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.400
but it's on the south side.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.280
OK, I'm going to walk around there with my, I'm sorry,

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.160
what is it, a selby?

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.000
What is the cell phone?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:20.680
Comlick.

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.440
Comlick, sorry.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.840
Almost had it.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.360
I'm going to have my Comlick up and make it look like I'm

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.200
standing there waiting for somebody to pick me up,

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.800
so I will be in disguise.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:37.600
All right, as you approach, you're still a good 40 yards off,

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.360
and the guards turn and aim their submachine guns at you

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.400
and start yelling, hey, get back, get back, get back, get back.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.200
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:53.120
I turn my face towards the great gentleman.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.200
Boys, boys.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.000
Boys will be boys.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.240
I'm so sorry.

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:06.160
My son is being brought here to me.

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.160
I've got to play with him.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.000
Screwed it up.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.760
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:20.720
I'm just a lady, a little lost, and I'll back away,

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.840
but is it OK if I just stand kind of here?

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:29.160
Because this is where I've told my son's father to meet me.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.600
We're no longer together.

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.000
What a bastard.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.960
I know how that goes.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960
No way, you don't know how that goes.

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.880
You're too handsome to ever be alone.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.480
I think that most of the time.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.240
I don't want to be forward, but with your beard

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.160
and your looks, you look like a lumber sexual.

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.240
Oh, I'm clean shaven.

01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.480
Clean shaven.

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.080
That's right.

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.960
All right, well, sir, if you don't mind me standing here

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.880
with my phone and occasionally looking over at you

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.880
and fantasizing, then I think we're good.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.760
Well, that sounds mighty fine.

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.800
All right.

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.200
Nightblade, what do you see in there?

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.640
You're on a roof.

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640
I'm on a roof.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.840
Are there windows on the outside of the structure?

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.520
No, it's a windowless building.

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.360
All right.

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.720
I climbed the rope up there with him.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.360
All right.

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.160
Oof.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.800
You climb up, but you slip and fall on your face

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.000
right at the top.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:45.920
Am I on the roof?

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.520
Yeah.

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:47.200
Am I hurt?

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:47.640
Nope.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.400
OK.

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.920
You just made a noise.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.520
Oops, sorry.

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.520
I used my grappling gun.

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.800
Well, you were already, wait, how?

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:01.840
No, I mean, I was just explaining to her.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.320
Oh, OK.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.800
I used my grappling gun.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.080
I examine the rooftop for any sort of skylights

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.320
or any sort of ingress.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.080
You don't see any skylights, but you do see,

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.760
it just looks like a, what do you call it, like a great,

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.920
yeah, just a grill, like a great,

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.720
it's screwed on tight.

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:21.680
See that grill?

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:22.640
Yeah.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:26.000
It's just getting a closer look.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.920
It's just a grill.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.640
It's a Phillips head screws bolted.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.600
You know what that looks like to my nanowhip?

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.160
More butter.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.880
Looks like we will be conceiving tonight.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:55.120
I mean, I don't have any tools for screw, screw, screws.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.880
Do I have, like, a screwdriver?

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.280
I don't know.

01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.200
I don't think so.

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.640
It'd probably say something like that.

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.160
Do you have a screwdriver?

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.520
I don't have a screwdriver.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.280
If you're out there and you're listening,

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.880
you can proceed north on top of the building.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.880
There is some sort of loading dock there.

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.200
If you can drop down there, you can find ingress,

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.920
or egress, perhaps, if you are inside,

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.240
but you would find ingress.

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.920
OK, let's not get caught up on that.

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.680
But I'm just saying.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.160
The structure is there, perhaps an easier one,

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.840
but perhaps also one that is guarded.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.080
All right, Napele, the sneak to the north side of the building.

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.960
Go to that loading dock.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.520
What about the grate?

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.640
We don't have the tools, man.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.120
I can have a nano-whip.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.200
Look, Nightblade.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.960
Can I use my combat sense to see what troubles

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.800
might befall them?

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.200
You can sense that they're not in any immediate danger

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.080
at the moment.

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.800
I sense it, you are not, in any immediate danger.

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.080
But don't hold me to that.

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.600
If you want a nano-whip that great,

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.880
I'm not going to stand in your way.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.360
That's what she said.

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.120
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.760
We talked about harassment on the runs.

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.240
Let me just take a peek.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.200
A nano-whip the great.

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.120
All right.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:30.160
Yep, you nano-whip the great.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.760
Wrong finger, wrong finger, wrong finger.

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:39.040
You slice a hole in it, and it's kind of like a can,

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.240
where it's hanging by like a little thread, you know?

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:41.840
Nice.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.960
How's the size?

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.800
It's man-sized.

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.120
I got a man-sized grate.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.400
Why don't you take a peek and take a little gander

01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.120
down there, Nightblade?

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.120
Let's start going in the grate.

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.640
Wait, you do what?

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:05.360
I go in.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.320
Oh, you go in.

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.120
Well, it's just kind of like a hole in the ceiling.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.400
If you go in, you'd just be kind of like dropping

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:12.880
through a hole.

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.680
Is that what you do?

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.320
Oh, you mean like down below is the warehouse itself?

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.040
Yeah.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.920
Oh, then let me look and get a lay of the land.

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.000
You do that.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.080
You see a card table with two guys playing cards

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.160
and drinking alcohol.

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.040
They're not seeming to pay much attention.

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.880
They got their pistols on the table.

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.280
I got two bogeys.

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:38.760
You also see two semi-trucks and crates all over the place

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.760
and a forklift in one corner.

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.480
Two bogeys playing cards.

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.680
It's all I got in here.

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.040
PortaGuy, what do you see down there?

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.560
Anything else we need to know about?

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.400
Our own vision, good enough there, Spencer.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.400
What?

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.160
To see around inside the warehouse.

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.440
You see the things I said.

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.120
There's nothing else to see.

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:03.720
So can I use my grappling gun to descend like Spider-Man?

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.320
Well, you can hook it on something

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.360
and then climb down on the rope, like tying a rope

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:13.360
to a fixed object.

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.600
How far away are they from us?

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.520
40 feet.

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.600
And how far is 40 feet down?

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.200
No, I mean it's diagonal.

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.800
OK, so it's 20 feet or so down?

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.360
Yep.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.840
So I can fix my grapple to the roof here

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.560
and then descend with my grappling gun.

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.920
Yes.

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.440
I'm going to give it a shot.

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.200
All right.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.200
I'll be right behind you if you need me to.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.720
What's your agility plus sneaking?

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:37.960
Get ready for go time.

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.200
I'd like this to be a black bag job,

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.680
but it might be fracapalooza.

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:55.160
My agility is, it's me, Dan.

01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:00.160
My agility is five, and my, what was the other thing?

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:00.800
Sneaking.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:08.920
Sneaking is four, and it says parentheses plus four.

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.600
OK.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:12.720
That's sneaky.

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:17.400
All right, you descend unseen or heard.

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.840
You're right above the floor.

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.080
You can touch the floor if you want.

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:22.720
OK, I'll wait until you're off the thing

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.280
before I descend after you.

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.680
I touch it.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:32.120
I leave my grapple so that my friend can come down too.

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:34.440
You do that quietly.

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.200
I descend as well.

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.120
That happens.

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.960
OK.

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:39.960
They don't see us?

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:40.560
They don't.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.560
They're not paying close attention apparently.

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.640
What do you think?

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.280
I can stun these guys and knock them out with a stun bolt

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.520
from a distance if you want.

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.040
Let's check them with the team.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.360
Come on, chuckleheads, talk to me.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:53:00.160
I'm a chucklehead.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.040
Sounds good.

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.160
Once again, if I could tap into combat sense

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.880
to see what sort of risk they are in.

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.920
They might be in danger if they screw up.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.280
They're in more immediate danger than they were before.

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:16.280
Can we pull up an image of this Baldwin character

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:16.760
we're looking for?

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:19.360
Is there a photo online of this guy that we can see?

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.760
So if we know we're looking for the right guy?

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.000
Yeah, you do that.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.320
He looks like an aging bald man with glasses.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.400
Does he look like one of those guys playing cards there?

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400
No, these are young dudes.

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.400
There's a 20-year-old orc and then a 20-ish-year-old human.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.960
Any kind of non-lethal?

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.040
I got loads.

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.080
I can knock them out with a stun bolt if you like.

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.040
Both of them?

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:47.240
Yeah, it's an area spell.

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.480
Stun bolt is not an area spell.

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.200
No, no, no.

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.160
Stun ball, I mean.

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.240
There you go.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:52.320
Stun ball, all right.

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.320
You think you can take two of them out with a stun ball?

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:57.440
I mean, let's not waste my spells if we don't have to.

01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.440
It drains a magician to use that stuff.

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.200
Do you think we do that right away?

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.280
I think it's worth it to try as hard as we can

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.400
to go non-lethal.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.920
And I mean, we only see these two people.

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.960
Let's try to stun ball them.

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.960
All right.

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:11.960
You sure?

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:16.120
Hold on, I'm getting a Sim sense.

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:17.240
Do you boys need help in there?

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.920
I have stealth.

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:23.600
I can maybe help you out if you need some backup.

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.120
Aren't you at the front gate just flirting?

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.320
I don't like it when you degrade what I do, but yes.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.720
Yes, that is what I am doing.

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:33.280
Well, stay there.

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.240
Keep them occupied.

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.600
Nightblade, I also have an X-Shocker taser gun.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:40.400
It's only a single shot thing, so I can't get them both.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.800
Well, if your stun ball is a ranged thing that

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.080
could stun two people, that's perfect for these poker players.

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:57.240
I cast a, I harness, first of all, my combat spell casting.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:03.480
I touch my red feather earring and summon the spell casting

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.720
focus to increase my combat.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.360
And I throw a force three stun ball at the guards.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.680
All right.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.520
What's your spell casting plus magic?

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.440
11.

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.440
11, huh.

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.160
What do I get?

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.520
Do I get a plus two for the spell casting?

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.040
Was I added in?

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.520
Yes, so that'd be 13 all the time.

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:22.480
13.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.680
Erin asking, do you have just one earring?

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.600
Yes.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.520
Which ear is it in?

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:28.520
It's my left ear.

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:29.000
Thank you.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Mm.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.480
All right.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.320
Means to parties.

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.720
Means to parties.

01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.800
So you fire off a stun ball.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:36.800
What did I do?

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:37.300
Ah!

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:37.800
Ah.

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:43.080
Ah.

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:47.760
It lands right in the middle of them, and it hits them.

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:50.960
They attempt to twist out of the way,

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.920
and they take a lesser effect, and they

01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:55.840
end up taking some damage.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.640
Hold on.

01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.280
There better be an app with all of Jeff's different magic

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.080
noises in a human.

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.240
There better be.

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.520
She buried the lead on that spell.

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.520
Do whatever!

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.520
It's a man of the sun ball I'm shooting.

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.360
It takes a lot out of you.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.800
One of them goes down to the ground cold,

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.920
and the other one seems to have dodged out of the way.

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.640
Rush him, Nightblade!

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.120
Yeah, when it's my turn, I'll use my science equipped Ares

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.320
Predator 5 that's in my bionic arm.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:28.200
All right, you got the surprise on him.

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.960
So what's your pistols plus agility?

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.600
I mean, I'm assuming I'm not close enough to him

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.720
to do anything non-lethal.

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:40.200
Like, I have a stun baton, and I mean, that's about it.

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.600
So what's your agility plus pistols?

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.880
Well, you're making me kill this guy.

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.920
Well, you said you were firing at him with your gun, right?

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.840
Well, I just wanted to make sure before I do that.

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.200
I wasn't close enough to him to stun baton him, right?

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:51.600
No.

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.840
You have the element of surprise.

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.240
I'm not.

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.040
Well, not anymore.

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.320
Now the stun ball's in play.

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.640
Adam, don't heckle the gym.

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:04.920
OK, so, OK, so you need to know my.

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.480
Adam's real born on the 4th of July,

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:07.760
right now, I read.

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.560
I mean, shit's gone bad.

01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.400
It's the first act of heat.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.160
No, the cat's out of the bag.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.160
I've got a stun ball.

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.560
I'll sleep like a baby tonight.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:20.800
OK, so you're looking for, sorry, one more time.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:21.440
I'm a little drunk.

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.560
Agility plus pistols.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:28.160
Agility is five, and pistols is two parentheses plus two.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:31.560
Is there a shorthand for those numbers when it's two?

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.840
Well, if it's plus two, then just add them all up.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.640
So five plus two plus two would be nine.

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.320
OK, great.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.600
Cool.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.520
Ooh.

01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.560
Yeah, you plug them right in the face.

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.080
Wow, a little bit overkill, huh, Nightblade?

01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:53.880
That's bat and cleanup.

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:58.040
Yeah, he gets shot in the face and goes down.

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.160
Every time you fuck up, casting the spell,

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:11.480
that's what it looks like as a human cost noted.

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.080
I go up there and secure their weapons.

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.560
All right, you take two Ingram smart guns.

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:21.520
I'm hyper-vigilant.

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.840
I'm in a fucking PTSD fucking 360.

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.280
My heart's beating.

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.600
You see no one.

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:34.320
Outside, Mercy and Hordegaard hear the report of a pistol.

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.280
Silence, sir.

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.240
Oh, then they don't.

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.880
I sense that something has gone down, and I'm checking in.

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:45.080
Do you see crates?

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.800
Yeah, there's crates everywhere in here.

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.560
In the building.

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.840
This place is lousy with crates.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.080
Yes, yes.

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:56.520
Yeah, you don't see anyone else in the room that you're in.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.840
Are there any doors that we see along the walls?

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:01.160
There's a door to the east that's

01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:03.360
leading presumably out of the building.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.000
There's a door to the south.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.520
We should check these trucks.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.760
OK.

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.480
I mean, I will.

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.040
You go ahead.

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.120
I'm going to go up.

01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.920
There's one door that's presumably leaving at the loading

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.600
block or what?

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.080
Yeah.

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.040
And then the other one looks like it might be an interior room.

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:19.800
Yep.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:21.720
I go to that door and take out my endoscope

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.600
and put it under the door to take a look around.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:24.240
You do that.

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:27.320
You see three large machines that look like they're

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.760
producing something.

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.200
You don't know quite what from your low angle.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.360
You also see a concrete barrier that blocks your vision

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.200
towards the right.

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.080
It's kind of the only things you can see are those two things.

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:40.400
Machines and a barrier.

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.320
OK.

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.320
I report that over to Nightblade.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.000
What's in those trucks?

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.240
Oh, go check these trucks.

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.280
They're full of crates.

01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:50.400
The crates are sealed shut.

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.800
Boxes and boxes.

01:59:51.800 --> 02:00:01.800
What was it Nabokov said?

02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:08.400
Package is just a package for a package.

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.360
I got a door over here at Nightblade

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.640
that I can't see the whole situation in here.

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:24.400
I said we come in their guns of blazing.

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.240
I load my gun with stick and shock bullets.

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.760
You do that.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:31.760
Well, hold on.

02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:39.440
So the cheeky peas up front talking to these three guys.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.800
If we take out those three guys, then she can come in.

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.680
It's like we've got the whole yard covered, right?

02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.320
We can all, like maybe we should take those guys out

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.560
at the South Gate.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.000
Well, can I try just talking to them and see what happens?

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:52.480
Yeah.

02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.560
See if I can get in.

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.560
OK.

02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.560
I will choose to come in.

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.240
I will choose to approach as cover.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.680
Yeah, keep their attention.

02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.880
You see if you can get all three of them

02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:04.040
to be talking to you, all facing you at the same time,

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:06.800
none of them facing north.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.920
All right.

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:18.600
I positioned myself south.

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:19.600
I'm so sad.

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.920
I just got the worst news.

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.840
I'm so sad.

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:30.560
I'm so weak.

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.320
The clean, shaven guy comes over to you and is like,

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:38.640
why are you weak?

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.040
Oh, my son that I was meant to meet here, I guess,

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:49.360
he was killed by one of those dirty shadow runners.

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.480
Some shadow runner was on a run.

02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:58.000
And my son was standing in the way.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.120
And I'm so sorry to ask this, but I've

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.920
been going to this cyber therapy that's,

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.440
my cyber therapist told me that the only thing that could

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:15.600
calm me down was three men, one with two hands on my head

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.000
and the other two with two hands on either arm.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.840
And this is so embarrassing.

02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.520
But if you could please just touch me.

02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.520
Please.

02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:28.600
He touches you.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:32.680
Can you ask your friends to also touch me?

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.240
And just listen to me.

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:36.120
I guess I can do that.

02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:36.600
Thank you.

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.640
I'm so sorry.

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.840
This is so embarrassing.

02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:43.080
I am some distance away, but I am holding my rifle poised.

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.000
And I am looking for an open shot,

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.880
should an opportunity present it.

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.840
OK, yeah, there's some shots open.

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:57.480
Do I see the, I want to leave the warehouse through the,

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.720
is there, if I go towards the south,

02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.840
is that where the south gate is?

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:04.240
No, if you go towards the south, that's towards the door

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.520
that he's peeking through.

02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.040
But that'll put us out towards the gate, right?

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.720
No, that's an interior door.

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.600
Oh, I'm looking to go toward Aaron.

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.480
All right.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:16.320
Mercy.

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.240
You came in through the ceiling.

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.240
Right.

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.040
Where we are, are there any?

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:22.520
South gate is to the south, right?

02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.520
Are there any businesses near?

02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.880
Yeah, but it's outside.

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:27.600
Are there any businesses that we saw on the way over here

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.120
in the Uber?

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:30.920
No, they're all destroyed.

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:33.920
They're just like destroyed, bombed buildings and stuff.

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.520
OK.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.400
All right, I tried to find an exit from the warehouse.

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.160
OK, a different exit?

02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:40.040
Yeah, OK.

02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.640
A one that provides me egress from the warehouse itself.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.880
There's the loading dock.

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.280
That's where the trucks came in.

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:46.880
It's open.

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.960
So that's where Eve is?

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.360
No.

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.080
No, I'm in another door.

02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.160
I'll come with you over there.

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:55.960
OK, let's try the loading dock.

02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.960
Do we know if there's dudes there?

02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.400
There aren't any dudes there.

02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.640
All right, so I'm just trying to get to the south gate.

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.040
If you exit the loading dock, you'll see a path,

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:08.160
a winding path, which leads you straight to the gate.

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:10.760
You will also pass a storage unit,

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:14.200
so perhaps you would be careful and perhaps check that out,

02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.560
but usual priorities.

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.360
All right, all right.

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:20.960
You exit the loading dock, and you

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:25.480
see the three guys touching Mercy, who's on the floor in pain.

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:27.440
What's the range?

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.240
200 feet.

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.240
And they're back to us?

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:33.920
Yeah.

02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:34.560
All right.

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:37.600
Time to fucking like.

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:40.120
Can we synchronize so that we shoot at the same time?

02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:40.520
Mm-hmm.

02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:43.960
We have to make sure that Mercy ducks and gets out of the way.

02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.080
Well, she's out of the shot.

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:46.760
She's on the ground and stuff.

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:47.600
Oh, she is.

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:48.720
I think.

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:51.200
I am.

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.600
You collapsed, yeah.

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:59.200
What's an objective way of picking dudes?

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.320
So you can't do like 3 o'clock, 12 o'clock.

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.520
How do you go?

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.640
The two of you are together.

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:06.960
You both look at each other and say, I'll take this one.

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:08.280
I'll take that one.

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:14.160
I am not with you, so I will take the one that is remaining.

02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:20.760
Spencer, can I say to the gentleman, thank you.

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:22.360
I know this is such an inconvenience,

02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:26.720
but if the three of you, this is the way my therapist explained

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:30.680
to me, it was the way that this ended, if the three of you

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:33.640
could just turn towards each other,

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:37.040
and I will walk away symbolizing me walking away

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.320
from my pain.

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:42.120
If you just for a moment can link and just stare at the ground,

02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.920
it will take just 30 seconds or so, and I thank you so much.

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:49.760
And if I ever meet you again, I promise I'll

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:52.880
be generous with my kindness.

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:53.840
Lock and load, guys.

02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:56.080
Lock and load.

02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:56.960
You're already fine.

02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:00.840
Just have each of them hold between one and three fingers up.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.240
It's too lengthy a process.

02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:09.240
We'll take care of it.

02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:11.960
I'm just wanting to get away from the situation,

02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:12.920
so they're just standing there.

02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.360
All right, we'll go with Hortagum's plan.

02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:20.880
I'll just kill whoever I can, and he'll kill whoever.

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:24.160
We'll just start killing people.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.560
I'm using stick and shock on mine,

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:27.680
because I prefer non-lethal if I can.

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:31.160
Well, OK.

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:33.040
All right, if you want to go up there and cut

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.920
those throats when they're down.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:35.560
I can't.

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:37.360
If I could get close, I would stun Botanum.

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.920
I don't like to kill people.

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:42.960
The one you stun, I will take out.

02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.360
I'm not stunning anybody.

02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:45.560
I'm not going to get that close.

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:48.960
I'm going to shoot them in the head with my gun.

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.560
I feel like, but could they really

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.160
kill all guards at once, find out next time?

02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.160
Thank you, everybody.

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.160
All right.

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.760
Jamorge Brown, thank you so much.

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:09.560
Erin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden, Jamal,

02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.640
thank you for coming up.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:17.680
I'm Jeff Davis, Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:20.360
Next week, there'll be music for Shadow Run.

02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:21.760
It's going to be very exciting.

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:24.360
If you want to know whose music we played tonight,

02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:26.360
I'm assuming there's somewhere you can go, right?

02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:29.360
Yeah, we'll post that online on the website,

02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.360
and we'll make sure everybody knows about the music.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.360
Yeah.

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.360
Did you get any of that?

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.360
It's a good show.

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.360
Feral Audio.
