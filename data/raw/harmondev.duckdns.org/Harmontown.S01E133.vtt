{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:26.000\nPlease welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:36.000\nWow, I don't understand. Jeff, why are all these people here? It's the Super Bowl.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:40.000\nWhy is our audience here?\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:44.000\nI'm assuming that they came straight from their Super Bowl parties and made it just in time.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:48.000\nWe should get it out of the way, right? We should do a sports corner.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:56.000\nSorry, I'm sorry.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:02.000\nSports corner, doing the sports, throwing the balls, and you know what's worse than playing sports.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:08.000\nDoing the thing, it's a team action. Make sure you say you've got to jump up and down to the organized sports.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:12.000\nJump, jump, yep, yep, sports.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:22.000\nDan, let me start you off. Seattle Seahawks, Pats, whatever Pats is short for.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:28.000\nI'm not going to play that game. I couldn't not get that information.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:33.000\nThe New England Patriots, first impressions going into the game with all the controversy that led up to it.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:42.000\nEverybody, the controversy. It was a weird year this year for the Super Bowl.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nDan, when people put the gate on the end of a name of a controversy.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:49.000\nSuper Bowl gate?\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:53.000\nI'm talking, of course, about the game leading up to the Patriots making it into the Super Bowl.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nSome of their balls were under inflated.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:59.000\nOh, there's the deflate gate.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:09.000\nI did see some of that. I saw Craig Ferguson or something that they did a funny video where people were spiking footballs and they photoshopped them just staying put.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:14.000\nSomebody said that they were under inflating the balls and that made them easier to catch.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nYeah, I got that. We're all on the same page.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:23.000\nSo going in, hopefully they had that ironed out. What did you think about the, let's go right to the end of the game.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nSome pretty amazing plays towards the end there.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:34.000\nI mean, there was so much, I mean, what Tuckerson did with the 11th hour.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:39.000\nYou watch a whole game like that, point by point, quarter by quarter, and you're watching.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:46.000\nUsually, as you know, football is a game of yardage and that's not always a fun thing to watch.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nIt's not always a dramatic thing to watch.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:55.000\nIn baseball, it's like, oh, he popped a fly to the third, and it's a big deal.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nEvery batter that comes up has an opportunity to create a story.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nIn football, it's a team effort. It's the long lost American dream.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:11.000\nYou've got a quarterback, you've got a receiver, you've got a linebacker, you've got a fatback, you've got a wide receiver in case the line receiver fails.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:20.000\nThe quarterback has to throw the ball and the point is yardage and it's an accumulation of that yardage.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nAnd so we watched that happen tonight. It's a super ball.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\nA lot of people were turned off by that.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:35.000\nBut at the end of the game, at the very end of the game, dramatic turn of events.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:42.000\nThe guy ran and caught the ball.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nIt did, but then they were right about to score.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:53.000\nThey were right in the end zone and the guy right before the end zone and the other guys did what they're supposed to do.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhat they're supposed to do.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.000\nCorrect.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nBut there was a question about whether they did it right.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nThey did it right.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nThey did it right.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nThere was a question, but the answer was yes, they did it right.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:12.000\nThere was a question of whether or not the guy that caught the ball had caught it right.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nRight. There's always a question about that, which is why they have the referees out there on the field.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:22.000\nAnd in that particular instance, the answer to the question, did he catch it right, was yes.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nHe caught it right.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nYeah.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nSo it didn't matter what the other people did.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nWhat do you think about the halftime performance?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:34.000\nOh, those musicians.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nI haven't seen them in what, 10, 11 years?\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nA few of them a little bit longer than that.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nAnd the combination of those musicians.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nCorrect.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:50.000\nWho would have thought that those musicians would appear in that combination?\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:56.000\nWere you expecting a kind of early 90s-ish black kind of rock and roll?\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nNo, of course I wasn't expecting that.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nIt's a halftime at the Super Bowl.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:04.000\nI'm expecting nothing more than the president of football to come out and throw candy.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:09.000\nWho would have known that superstar from the mid 90s?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nKind of supermodel dating.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nCindy Crawford.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nCynthia Bloomberg.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nMadonna did that.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:21.000\nIt's a guy.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nPerry Farrell.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:27.000\nPerry was the last name of the girl that was the headliner in it.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nWhat?\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nKaty Perry.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nKaty Perry.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nYou said Katy Perry.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nDon't applaud that.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:43.000\nI thought mixing Katy Perry with those guys, those crazy guys.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nShe's such a pop-sugar-pop bubblegum.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nJust when you're thinking I'm being fed some top 40 bullshit,\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nI don't want to eat bubblegum for a living.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nI'm a working man.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nThen in comes the room, room, room.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:07.000\nThe fucking hard-driving, overdriven fucking six strings of that fucking band\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nthat shouldn't be with Katy Perry.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nHe's mostly just kind of a solo guy.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nFucking like Jethro Toll.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nAs I said before, black gentlemen.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nBlack?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nYou know, kind of.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nAmerican woman, he covered that one time.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nYou loved that.

07:02.000\nI don't have a reason to question my consumerist lifestyle.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nNot if these two are poking up in the 50-yard plan.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nAnd then the female rapper came out towards the end.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nOh my God, when Pharrell came out.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nHoller.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nHoller.\n\n07:17.000 -->

realize there's nothing going wrong.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nAnd then whoever won, won.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nIt was either the bird people or the fucking aqua people, I don't know.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nAnd it was...\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nThe important thing is that the right team won,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nbecause it was the team, the corporation that owned it,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nspent the right amount of money\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\naggregating dumb people from colleges around the country\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:23.000\nwho had been passed up through corrupt systems\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nand assembled into a team\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nso that you could overcharge people to watch\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nand generally train people for jingoism\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nin arenas in and around the world.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nWhat was your favorite commercial level?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nThat's always a big thing.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI actually know about the commercials,\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nbecause people were tweeting me, you got to see the Liam Neeson one.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nThe Liam Neeson was in a commercial.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nThe two commercials that I saw,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nand I don't know if it was because\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nthe two commercials I saw were for apps.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nThey were for, like, gaming apps.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nThat was weird.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nLiam Neeson did an ad for Clash of Clans,\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nand then there was another ad I got sent\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nthat was some game of war or something.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nSome lady game of war is a thing.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nIt was just another thing.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nI don't know, but did Bud Light do anything?\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nThere seemed to be a lot of commercials\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nabout fathers neglecting their children.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nThen there was a really horrifying one\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nby nationwide insurance, I think,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nabout your baby's going to be murdered\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nby your negligence around the house.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nIt was just like, don't let your kid die.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nWe'll save you from that.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nIf we haven't figured out by now\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nthat that's what insurance is,\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nit's a protection racket.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nI remember when I was 20 years old,\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nan envelope that I got in the mail,\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nthere was literally a photo of Christopher Reeves\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\npost-accident, Christopher Reeves,\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\non the envelope that said,\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\ndon't let what happened to me happen to you,\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nand it was an ad for an insurance company.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nThat's exactly what the mafia does in mafia movies.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nExcept they have the courtesy to not involve the guy.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt would just be a guy in a suit going,\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\ndon't let what happened to Christopher Reeves happen to you.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nIt'd be a shame.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nIt'd be a shame for that to happen.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nIt's amazing to me that we haven't caught on to this yet,\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nthat our laws that protect us from the mafia,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nif you actually applied them in an objective sense,\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nyou should go after insurance companies.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nHere's another thing. Guess what?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nAirline companies are a cartel.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nLook up the word cartel. Cartel.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nI know you think the word cartel\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nmeans Mexican drug dealer.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\nCartel is a collection of companies,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\na collection of profit-seeking groups\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nwho are supposed to be in competition,\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nwho aren't in competition,\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nwho work with each other\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nto minimize the consumer service\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nand maximize their own profits.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nAirline companies, cartel, antitrust laws.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nHey, I learned about them in high school too.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nNot applicable.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nHaven't applied them in the last 30 years.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nWhat the fuck happened to antitrust?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou're supposed to break up any company\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nthat is imposing any threat to the competition.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:11.000\nKey component to fucking capitalism.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nCompetition. Competition.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:16.000\nNo one is supposed to be safe in capitalism.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nNobody.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nEven the guy at the very top,\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nthe guy that sells you all the candy,\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nshould be looking over one shoulder.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nEvery time Willy Wonka starts his car,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:28.000\nhe should be like, I hope Snickers doesn't get me.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nThey're not supposed to have secret meetings.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nThey're not supposed to share information.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nThey're not supposed to have all the same board members\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\non their board of directors.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nFuck you people.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nI was in an Alaska airline flight,\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nand they stopped providing blankets,\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nand it's cold flying up there.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nI bet you could get them for a $5 upgrade fee.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nThere was an article in the New Yorker or whatever I tweeted.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nIt's a fucking expose of a goddamn cartel.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nJetBlue just ended its,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nhey, you're a human being.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nYou want to get somewhere?\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nLet's just give you, JetBlue just ended it.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nJetBlue was seeing profits.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:11.000\nThey were a profit-seeing airline.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nThey were doing fine.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nJetBlue's gimmick was,\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nI believe there was no first class on JetBlue.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nWas that the case?\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nAll the seats were kind of equally alright.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nIt was generally like, it's kind of nice to fly JetBlue.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nLet's just try this.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nLet's try this as an experiment.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nAnd the experiment was working fine.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nThey weren't going to go out of business.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nIt was going to happen to them.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nThey stopped it anyway,\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nbecause the stockholders in JetBlue said,\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:41.000\nugh, this obsession with pleasing the customer, ugh.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nWe don't want to buy your stock anymore.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nYou are obsessed with pleasing the customer.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.000\nAnd the way you make a profitable airline\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:54.000\nis you slowly reduce the amount of fucking human space\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nthat you have in coach, economy,\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nwhatever the fuck you call it, pencil plus.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nNow there's 95 classes,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nand all of them are shrinking down.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nI compulsively fly first class,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nbecause they got me. They got me.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nBut even in first class,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nwhite people problem with platinum addition,\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nfirst class is shrinking too.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nSometimes there's a room upstairs,\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nI think, where everyone's in an egg.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nLike in an egg.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nIt's like secret class or something.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nI'm sure that's getting bigger and bigger.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nIn case you're flying with one of the 700 people\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nthat has all the wealth in the United States.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nBut their business model\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nis to shrink and shrink and shrink\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\neverything that you have as an airline passenger\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nand offer you,\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\noh, did you want Perk Plus?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nDid you want to put your feet on somewhere\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nthat's not behind your head?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nOh, that you're a Perk Pluser.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nDid you want a Perk Pluser Pluser?\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:04.000\nAnd they just move you, boarding first,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nand being allowed to have a backpack,\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nand did you want to bring Q-tips,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nand they sell everything to you as this upgrade.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nIt's fucked up, man.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nAnd they agree on it with each other.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nThey all have to have meetings about this,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nand they go, okay, how many centimeters leg room\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nare we calling luxury?\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nBecause if they don't agree on that,\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nthat's really bad by six centimeters.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nThat makes a huge difference in a nine-hour flight.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nWhat about Virgin America or Virgin Atlanta?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nThey seem like they're a nice airline to fly.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nYeah, I don't know where Virgin falls.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nI fly them a lot, and they seem like they're kind of doing\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\ntheir own kind of groovy thing.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nI don't know, but my eye's on you, airlines.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.000\nThat's the moral of that story.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nOh, do you want to do a new segment?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nIt's called Things That I Say,\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:53.000\nOff the Cuff, that I swear,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nlike, if somebody on Parenthood said it,\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:00.000\nlike, it could be, like, an amazing piece of dialogue.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nOkay, because I've been experimenting,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\ngoing through our new, because I can't use\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nlicensed music anymore, I found this today\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nin hopes that maybe this might happen.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nThings I said tonight just while getting dressed\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.000\nwith Erin that I'm like, wow, I sound like an NBC character.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nAre you ready?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nYeah.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:31.000\nEvery once in a while.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nIt's short.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nSo Erin and I were talking about beards,\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:40.000\nand I was talking about how I saw some red carpet lady,\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nfashion lady on the red carpet say,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nlike, well, you can expect a lot of beards this year\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nfrom the men.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, I've had a beard for a long time.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nEverybody's finally doing beards.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd Erin and I were talking about the beards,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nand what is that culturally?\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd Erin was like, I don't want to put words in Erin's mouth,\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nand it's a hot button topic,\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nso I'm not putting words in Erin's mouth.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nThis is what I remember hearing.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nErin was talking about how, like, is that a thing\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nthat's motivated from the feminine side,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nlike, based on what women want?\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:11.000\nShe was talking about, is it a possible reaction\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nto over-metrosexuality?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nLike, are we, you know, like, the women are, like,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\ncraving, like, something else?\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nWe were having that conversation\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nin the privacy of our own home.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:27.000\nAnd then she said, yeah, it's definitely a heterosexual trend,\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nthe beard.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nIt's not a gay trend.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd then she went in the bathroom,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nand then I was standing alone in the bedroom,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:38.000\nand I went, hey, a gay trend.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nImagine being in charge of figuring out what those are.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nTalk about finding a needle in a needle stack.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:50.000\nBecause, because...\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:55.000\nBecause to me gay people are a trend.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nAll right.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nI'm having it.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nReal quick, on the beard thing,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI've been grasping about the beard business,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nbecause I live in, like, Los Feliz,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nwhich is near Silver Lake,\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nwhich is the Williamsburg,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nwhich is the hip neighborhood of the city\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nthat has the hip neighborhoods.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nAnd I was in a restaurant in Brooklyn,\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nlike, a few months or two ago,\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nhaving brunch,\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\nand there were 15 guys in there, including me.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\n14 of those guys had the same fucking Hammurabi big ass\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\ndown to their fucking collarbone beard.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nWhoa.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nYeah.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nAnd it's like, you can't all have the same fucking beard.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nIf you walked in the room and you were all wearing the same hat,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nyou're crazy people.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nI just...\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nI just, like, and I told you so.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nLike, I mean, everything I do,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:41.000\nlike, 10 years later, everybody starts doing it.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nYou were the last to get a podcast, though.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nThat's true, yeah.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nBut now I'm going...\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nNow I got a video podcast.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI skimmed a couple of articles that people sent me,\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nbecause they know how much I have a beef about this whole beard craze,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nand the phrase, lumber sexual,\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nand it's like, guys, wear it.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nLumber sexual?\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nAnd they have, like...\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nThey wear the plaid shirts,\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nand they have the beards,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nand it's a reaction to the...\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nNot just women's need to have men that are more masculine,\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nbut men's need to reclaim masculinity from it.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nThat's where I immediately went.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nBut any woman that told me,\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\noh, no, women kind of define, you know,\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:23.000\nwhat women say an attractive man looks like,\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nlike, you got to believe under the surface.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nThat's what we do.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nIt's a weird dance we have.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nIt's like men's gimmick is, like,\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nI don't give a shit,\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nand that's sort of a staple of masculinity, too.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:41.000\nBut, like, obviously, women are cracking the whip.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nLike, sexual reproduction,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:48.000\nall of the changes are queued by the female side.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nLike, that is as old as plant life.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nLike, when we divided from asexual organisms\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\ninto a male and female,\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nthe only thing that's consistent between,\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nlike, all of the species from when we were flowers\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nuntil what we are now\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.000\nis basically that the reason it speeds up Darwinian selection\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:13.000\nis because it compounds it with half of the species dictates\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nhow you get to the egg.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:18.000\nAnd that half of the species kind of tends to...\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nThat's why you see on those nature shows,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nlike, the bird is going, like,\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nwhat the fuck is the bird doing?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nIt has to do, like, 900 things in order to just get near the...\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nIt has to grow iridescent feathers and stuff like that.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nAnd then, like, the lockhorn beetles and the...\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nThere's all this weird shit they have to do.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nAnd it's like, some of it is, like, an odd, like, random thing.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nAnd it's like, because there's so much energy coming out of...\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nIf you just endow...\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.000\nIf you divide your species in half and endow one half with the green light,\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nthat is... I mean, that's not sexism.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:51.000\nThat is as old as vegetation.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nDrew Carey used to joke that every guy cuts their hair\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nlike they had it when they were getting laid all the time.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:00.000\nYeah, I know. That's why you look like George Lucas.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nAnd it's like, yeah, guess what happened?\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nOh, yeah, sure. I'm gonna make a ninth movie out of it.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nYou're just looking at his Papadare.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nIt's like, yeah.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:15.000\nGeorge, you could get your haircut by, like, a thousand robots every morning.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:19.000\nLike, he can have nano-scissors injected into his hair follicles.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:24.000\nGeorge Lucas could afford to have, like, the perfect haircut, for sure.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nAs far as he's concerned, I think he has the perfect haircut.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:30.000\nExactly. Because that's the haircut he had.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:34.000\nThat's the haircut he had, the night that something happened to him sexually,\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nthat he doesn't connect to American graffiti.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:42.000\nLike, he's like, ah, yeah, she really liked me.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:46.000\nI heard another thing, and I did not follow up on this,\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nand in keeping with last week's theme of unverifiable facts\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:53.000\nthat we don't know anything about, but we must make other people Google,\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:58.000\nis that apparently I heard there was a reaction among the bear community,\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:03.000\nlike the bearded gay gentleman who are, you know, the little heavier, like, bearded...\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nThe Harmons.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nThe Harmons.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nThey did not get that from you, the bear culture.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nOh, no, no, no, they had it.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:13.000\nOkay, yeah. But they're apparently, like, they feel like they're being co-opted\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:16.000\nby a bunch of straighties going out there and dressing up like bears.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nThey'll be all right. They're bears.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nThey're fine.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nDo we have any bears here?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nDo we have any bears here? Any self-identifying bears?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nYeah?\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nJust kidding.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:32.000\nWell, now that we know you're just kidding, it's weird for you to go,\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nyeah!\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nIt should have been, rah!\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nYeah, you're sp... yeah.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:42.000\nI always say, I've met bears.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nI feel...\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nI like bears. I like that idea.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nWhen I was in Palm Springs for New Year's Eve,\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nI forgot my swim trunks at home back in LA,\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nand so I went to this place to go buy them,\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nand I went to this place called Gay Mart USA,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:05.000\nwhich is, by its own admission, America's favorite gay superstar.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:08.000\nAnd they sell, among other things, really good bathing suits.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nAlso, lots of cock rings and lube.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nAnd, like, fancy underwear and stuff.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nSo I thought it'd be funny if I went back to the parties,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nwe're all doing shopping for this big New Year's Eve party that's going to happen,\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nand a bunch of people are going to come, I didn't know.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nAnd so, I bought, you know, we all got snacks,\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nand there's food, and there's booze, and all this stuff.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nSo I wanted to find, they had these little cock rings that looked like lifesavers,\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\na little j... a little bigger than that, with a jelly,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nlike, kind of stretchy little jelly things,\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nand they come in little plastic lifesaver wrappers.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nAnd so I thought, I just, they're really, like, they're not expensive,\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nso I just buy a big bunch of them, put them in a bowl,\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nand have those next to, like, their pretzels and shit, and they'll be like...\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nYou can have cock rings, because everyone's going to come with couples more or less to this party.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nI thought, okay, let's put the cock rings in.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nSo I asked the gentleman behind the counter at GameMart,\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\ndo you have those little jelly cock rings?\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nAll they had were these really high-concept-looking cybernetic, like,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:02.000\nShadowrun cock rings, I didn't mind fucking... did not know how to...\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nI'm talking, I'm going to drink.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nOh, I'll keep talking.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nSo, I said, do you have those little gel ones?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nHe goes, no, we're out of those, they're just so great, though.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:14.000\nI go, do you know a store, like, because there's one little strip there\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:17.000\nthat's all these, like, gay bars and stores and, like, fashion places.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nIt goes down to bear wear.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nI'm like, where's bear wear?\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nHe's like, it's just two dollars down.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nI go into bear wear, it was the fucking best.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nGuess what's in bear wear?\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nA bunch of the most adorable bear couples is walking around buying,\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nputting, like, holding up clothes on a hanger and holding it up to their boyfriend.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nI'm like, everyone's buying, like, little outfits and, like, scarves and things,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nand I'm up there just talking cock rings with the top brass,\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nand it was really nice.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nI really enjoyed my time at bear wear.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\nAlso, I took the cock rings to the party.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nThree of them instantly were gone.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nAnd no one was talking.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nAnd I think I found it later on that two of them were gone,\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nthe girlfriend had taken them for the boyfriend,\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nbecause there was going to be lots of drinking involved,\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nand they want, you know, a little enhancement later on down the line.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:08.000\nWell, that, I'd like to, I mean, I kind of think maybe a later episode,\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:12.000\nbut, like, I want to understand the cock ring concept.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nI'll explain it all to you in a moment.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nOne of the cock rings was out of the wrapper next to the bowl.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nI'm like, who did this?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nThe guy's like, I thought it was candy.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nI'd like to understand cock rings,\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nand I'd like to understand the bear community if there is, you know,\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:37.000\nif there's a bear Harmontown out there.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:40.000\nWe must, I'd like to think we have a few bear fans out there.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nIt'd be nice.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:46.000\nI sometimes feel like we somehow marginalized the marginalized on our show.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nI feel like the bears do a pretty good job of saying,\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nlike, you have a store called Bearware,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:55.000\nand in there everybody looked like exactly what I wanted bears to all look like.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nIt was really cool.\n\n24:56.000 --> 25:00.000\nFrankly, I'd like to see more black people in the audience,\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:08.000\nand I'd like to see more gay people, but you can't see them as well.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nBut we often ask, like, who's gay?\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nAnd it's like, I don't, I just want, you know,\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nlet's throw some ladies in there, too.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nLike, I don't, I'd like to...\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nAfter black people and gay people?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nIn keeping with the American tradition.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:31.000\nGay people were president.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nI just, I feel like we're doing something wrong.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nI feel like I cut the silhouette of some kind of, like,\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nBelushian, like, figure.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nIt's not what I mean to do.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nI know I'm ignorant, I know I'm clumsy,\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:47.000\nbut I love all people, and I wish we had more black Armenians.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:50.000\nIt makes me feel like we're doing something wrong.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nIf you're black and you're out there,\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nwell, then you're out there.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:57.000\nSo you're fine.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nIf you're black and you're out there,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\nI don't want to sound racist, but do you know other black people?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nCould you tell them to come here?\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nAre any of your best friends black people?\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nRight, and that's the hell, now I'm racist,\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.000\nfor asking you if you have black friends because you're black.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nI don't want to do that.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nIf you're black and you're out there, thank you.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nThat's the, thank you.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nWhat's your name over there?\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nJamal.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nJamal, fucking.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nCha-ching.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nJamal, indeed.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nBut can we, I mean, that's, but that's the thing,\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:41.000\nlike all his friends pointing at him, like, that's,\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nthat's the, like, that's, that's why,\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nthat's why they don't, that's why they don't come.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:50.000\nThey don't want to get sucked into my black hole,\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nmy white hole.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nIs, is community, does it have a large black audience, do you know?\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nHow do you measure that?\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nDo you get a lot of black people tweeting you and saying,\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nI love your show?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nNo.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:08.000\nRick and, Rick and Morty, I think Adult Swim has a larger black audience,\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:11.000\nso a lot of, and I, I, this is going to sound crazy,\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:15.000\nand I, I don't, I don't believe anything about this.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nI'm only repeating what seems to be the case,\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:23.000\nbut it seems like, it seems like a black audience is like animation a lot.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:28.000\nLike they, Adult Swim has, like, a black audience,\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:33.000\nand Rick and Morty, like, I, like, community, like, episodes will go,\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nand I'll just, I'll look at the tweets,\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nbut then when an episode of Rick and Morty is airing,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:41.000\nlike, there's a lot more, like, like, like, a face that you just,\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:45.000\nI just go like, ah, man, that guy, man, I wish he was my friend.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nJust with a tweet that's like, this motherfucker just said,\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nbutters a disease or something.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nLike, like, they'll, like, quote, like a thing,\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:58.000\nbut they'll kind of quote it in sort of a street language.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:02.000\nAnd it, and it, and it validates me.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nSo black people, come on down next Sunday.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:10.000\nAnd keep watching Rick and Morty, and I love you too.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nAll right, so moving on to a couple more things.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:18.000\nSo obviously I was right in my predictions about the Jurassic Park Nine,\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:23.000\nwhatever, the park is open, and I, I, I'm not, I wasn't psychic.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:28.000\nI had heard reports that Chris Pratt is playing a raptor trainer in the movie.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.000\nDoes he go out like a quarterback at the end with a bunch of raptors,\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:32.000\nand they're all going to go clean house?\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nHe certainly does, he certainly does.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:37.000\nIn the newest trailer, it's becoming very clear that he,\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:44.000\nuh, that he trained, that he trains raptors for a living,\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nand he hangs out with them, and he loves them.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:49.000\nAnd then, like, there's this big dinosaur they've made that's like a big,\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:52.000\nthey shouldn't have made this big dinosaur.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:56.000\nAnd then he, in this new trailer, he's saying, he goes like,\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nwe got to go out there with everything we got,\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:02.000\nand it cuts to him on the four-wheeler with a flock of the last raptors.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nEverything we got includes his trained raptors.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nDid they say, uh, this time the girls are cleverer?\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nYeah.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:13.000\nIt's just pretty amazing, and there's nothing to it.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:16.000\nI did like the, uh, I mean, the fact that they had to show it to you,\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nI would like to have not seen it in the, in the trailer,\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.000\nbut there's a Jurassic Park sea world, and a giant,\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\ngiant kraken comes out of the, comes out of the ocean,\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:28.000\nand eats of, like, an orca hanging from a string or something like that.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:31.000\nWhich, by the way, I don't believe would be a part of the real Jurassic Park.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nWhich parts of it did you buy as real parts of the Jurassic Park?\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:39.000\nWell, if there's reptiles that are ancient, that are walking on Earth,\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:44.000\nit's like, I don't think that a park is going to put their money into a tank so big\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:49.000\nthat a gigantic, the creatures in the sea are already prehistoric.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nSharks are prehistoric.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nLike, whales are basically prehistoric.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:56.000\nLike, they're fucking old and giant, and it's neat to watch them jump out of water.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nBut there wasn't a thing, like,\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:01.000\nyou know, 100 meters long. Yeah, me or Google a boobala.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nBut, like, now you're being racist.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:09.000\nGuess what's last on your list if you go to Jurassic Park?\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:12.000\nYou're not going to go to the fucking water tank.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:16.000\nHow are they going to get the insurance companies to sign off after the first Jurassic Park?\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nLike, where do they, like, we got it all figured out.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nThis is a new world.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nIt's the money, Jack.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nIt's the, like, what do you mean?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nAre you going to go see it?\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nI'm not going to go see it.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:29.000\nI'm not going to go see anything.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nI'm 42.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:35.000\nI will wait the three weeks until it's on my wristwatch.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nYou don't go out to the theater anymore?\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:44.000\nIf it's Valentine's Day, maybe I'll go see it.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:48.000\nBut, you know, Paul Rudd better be in it or...\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:52.000\nAll right, so go see it.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nYou never feel like, oh, this is a movie that's going to be better on a giant screen.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nI want to go see this on a large screen.\n\n30:57.000 --> 31:01.000\nThe last time we tried that was Monuments Men.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:04.000\nI don't think we've been to a theater since.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nYou thought that story about stealing Hitler's art was only going to be great on a big screen?\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nNo, I was just saying, like, movies are for kids.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nLike, going to see movies are for kids.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:19.000\nAnd then as the kids get, you know, they parlay their parents' money into a new support system for themselves,\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:25.000\neventually you buy a screen on your wall and then you wear a bathrobe and you watch the movie on your wall.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:29.000\nThese guys know what I'm talking about.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:32.000\nYeah, you live in a little shitty apartment.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nYou go to movies.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:38.000\nBut you dream of this.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:43.000\nYou dream of rocking the fucking, like, the boiler room down here.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nFor the non-visual listener.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:52.000\nWalking naked around a mansion, a barfin' and pukin' and, I don't know, why a barfin' and pukin'?\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:57.000\nI meant to say burpin' and poopin'.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:00.000\nIt's not far off, man.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nYou want to be Jim Morrison.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nYou want to be Howard Hughes.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:08.000\nYeah, so you get the big screen, the wealth distribution.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nYou see that chart?\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:14.000\nOh, everybody's got more money as you, like, yeah, you get older and you want that money.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nYou want that big screen in your house.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:20.000\nWhy is this, we spend some money, you, I mean, we meaning you, spend some money getting all these cameras up\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nand we get the live stream going on.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:26.000\nWhy can't we kill this cricket that's been here plaguing us?\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nIt's the only theater that has one cricket that never goes away.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:34.000\nHe's my conscience.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:37.000\nBut how can he listen to you if he never shuts up?\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:41.000\nHe's telling me, just like, he's only saying one thing over and over again in case I ever listen,\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:45.000\nwhich is like, you're supposed to be at work.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:48.000\nYour show needs help.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\nAre you way behind schedule?\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nOf course I'm behind schedule.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nI'll talk about that.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:58.000\nAll right, last thing, last thing on my, last thing on my thing.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:03.000\nI really recommend everybody watch this show Empire, okay?\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nIt's on Fox.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:09.000\nIt's a show about, Terrence Howard plays a hip-hop record label mogul.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nIt's like a dynasty.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:15.000\nOur friend, N.T., called it Black Dynasty.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nIt's, he's black.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nHe can call it that.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nAlso, he's black and he stopped coming to our show.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:29.000\nYeah, see, Jamal, please move up front next week.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:33.000\nWe're trying, and tell us what we're doing wrong.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:43.000\nBut Empire is, it's just a, I don't know, it's like a perfect story of like, I don't know, just watch it.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nWatch the pilot.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:48.000\nIt takes you 40 minutes to watch the pilot of Empire.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:51.000\nThe dad is the mogul.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nHe's running a record label.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nIt's established immediately.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nHe's a record producer.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:01.000\nSorry, I got a little vodka off my mustache.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:06.000\nJamal, that can be yours next week.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:17.000\nThe pilot opens on him sitting in like, basically a throne, like a cushioned throne overseeing a chanteuse singing into the microphone in the VO booth.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:23.000\nAnd she's like, singing a song, some R&B song.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:32.000\nAnd he goes like, stop it, stop it. And then he presses the mic button and he goes like, I need you to sing as if you just found out you were going to die.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:45.000\nAnd then she's like, and then as she's singing, it intercuts from her singing to him thinking about the fact that earlier today he was in a hospital getting his hospital test results.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nSo we're already knowing that he's going to die.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:55.000\nAnd then he goes in the booth and he goes like, all right, hold on. And he goes in the booth and he goes like, how are you doing? How are you doing?\n\n34:55.000 --> 35:01.000\nAnd she's like, fine. And he's like, do you remember when your brother got shot?\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nThis guy sounds like a real bully.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nHe's not a good man.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:06.000\nNo.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:14.000\nSing to him. And then of course she goes back and then she's like, I'm not doing a good impression.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:20.000\nBut of course she sings really well. And it's like, that's the first three minutes of Empire.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:28.000\nAnd it's like, just so you now know what a record producer does for a living, if he's good, if he gets results.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nHe emotionally terrorizes people?\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:35.000\nYeah. And so then they keep flashing back to the life. So I don't want to spoil it all.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:42.000\nI'm telling you, just watch the pilot because the thing about the show is you're never watching one scene for more than one minute.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:51.000\nThe show is not, Dallas would be like eight minutes of two women about to pull each other's hair by the end of the episode.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:56.000\nIt would set it up the whole time. This is like one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute.\n\n35:56.000 --> 36:06.000\nThere's like eight locations and this matriarch cookie who gets out of prison and the pilot goes back and forth between all the eight locations around the clock.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:12.000\nAnd it's just stirring shit up because of course the company was built on her back and she went to prison.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:18.000\nBut the dad, I'll say nothing more about the show and then you make your decision of whether you want to watch it or not.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:31.000\nBut in one of the flashbacks to the 90s when the patriarch who founded the label, who used to be a gangster rapper, who previous to that was a real gangster,\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:41.000\nin one of the flashbacks, he's wearing a doo rag in his one bedroom apartment living room and he's got one baby on his arm and there's three sons in the show.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:56.000\nAnd then the gay son, because one of his three sons is gay, and the idea is that one of his three sons has to take over the record label because he's dying of ALS, but he's not telling anybody.\n\n36:56.000 --> 37:06.000\nHis gay son comes into the living room, as gay sons do, wearing high heel shoes and with a scarf around his head,\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:14.000\nand like swishing around and going like, look at me, I'm like a six year old boy but here's how you know I'm gay.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:22.000\nAnd the dad gets so infuriated, he scoops the son up, takes him outside and puts him in the garbage.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:27.000\nPuts his son in a garbage can.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:33.000\nHe throws his gay son away in the garbage and puts the lid over him.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:37.000\nThat's a shame, people throwing away a perfectly good black boy like that.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:46.000\nSo I mean it's saying if you're interested in drama, maybe tune into Empire and check it out, there's only 12, 13 episodes.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:50.000\nThat's so specific, that has to be based in true anecdotal shit.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:59.000\nBecause I was so fascinated with it, I've heard rumors that one of the writers or actors had that experience, that happened to them.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nBut I mean, amazing.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:02.000\nThat's horrifying.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nSo watch Empire, I think.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nHow many episodes are there already?\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:11.000\nI think there's like 13, I'm three in, and it doesn't slow down.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nIt's pretty fun.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nSo just watch it, will you?\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nJamal, do you watch it?\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:20.000\nNo, that's racist to ask him, it's racist to ask him.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:23.000\nNo it's not, it's racist to not be able to ask that.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:28.000\nUgh.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:32.000\nI can't really, you're sitting way back, the lights are on you.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:36.000\nI seem that he's the kind of guy that can handle that sort of question.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:40.000\nIt's racist to say you can't see him.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nI can't see the white people next to him either.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:45.000\nOkay, alright.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:50.000\nIf I can't, how do I know they're white people?\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:53.000\nIf I can speak for Jamal for a second.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nThat's racist.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nI'll take that risk.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nOkay.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:02.000\nI'm gonna speak on Jamal's behalf for one second.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nYou know, we can just bring him up.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:09.000\nToo dangerous.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nCome on.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nWe can't have anarchy.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:17.000\nYeah, you all heard the trash can story.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:20.000\nI'm Jamal, I'm speaking as Jamal for a second.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:27.000\nI wish tomorrow I could wake up and spend an entire day from waking up till I go to bed,\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:32.000\nnot being my friend's black friend.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:36.000\nI just want to be their friend, I just want to be Jamal.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:39.000\nJamal, do you want to come up and tell us if that's true?\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:49.000\nCan you come up?\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:53.000\nIt's just...\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:58.000\nI only downloaded a few new songs and that was an accident.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:04.000\nIt was that or the new Shadowrun theme I have very little to choose from.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nI meant it, I'm proud.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nWell, I mean, how accurate are we?\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nYou're actually 100% accurate.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:18.000\nYeah, you wish you knew what it was like to not think about race.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.000\nIt's just like...\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:24.000\nI see other people around, they're hanging out with their friends.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:31.000\nI'm like, that's cool, but I don't want to explain it.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:35.000\nI just want to be white, honestly.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:47.000\nGood night, folks.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:53.000\nYou just made Dan's dreams come true then.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:58.000\nLet's say you just want to be white or have everyone in the world suddenly become black\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:06.000\nor any other means by which we could erase this concept, which seems to be an artificial conceit\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:11.000\nso that it doesn't eclipse every conversation, every moment.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nOr were you making fun of me when you said what you said?\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:19.000\nI was just making fun of you.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:23.000\nSo we've entered a generation where you're not thinking about that at all, you don't care.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:27.000\nI'm just dragging you down by thinking about it.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:31.000\nYes.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:34.000\nSo we're just waiting for me to die.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:38.000\nThat's good though, that's a problem that solves itself, that's good.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nAll right, well, what else do you want to talk about?\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:45.000\nAre you plugging a book?\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:55.000\nI have a mixtape drop-in in December.\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:01.000\nWhat's your mixtape name?\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:07.000\nIt's called Straight Fire.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:13.000\nThere's no way to know when you're making fun of me or not.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:17.000\nYou get to control everything, he gets to make you feel uneasy.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:24.000\nIs there anything that you could link to or anything?\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:27.000\nNo, I was lying.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:31.000\nWho is the real you, what are you doing?\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nWhat are you, are you a student or do you have a job?\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nI'm a student at LMU.\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:39.000\nLMU?\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:42.000\nLMU, what's LMU, what is that?\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:43.000\nLoyola Marymount.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:44.000\nIt's a college.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:47.000\nWhere, tell me what the LMU stands for.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nLoyola Marymount University.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:52.000\nIt's like near USC.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:55.000\nYou seem like you want to go to this.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:58.000\nIt's like south towards the airport, sort of.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nTowards the airport.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nYou got KXLU record, radio station there, right?\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:03.000\nDon't you?\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nYeah, it's pretty white.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:13.000\nWould you tell some other black kids to come to the show?\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:21.000\nI don't know many other black kids.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nWe got to take baby steps.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nYou need to be satisfied having any black people here.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:31.000\nHe's a black guy who listens to podcasts.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:35.000\nHe may or may not have only black friends.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:38.000\nNo, I didn't make that mistake.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:43.000\nBut the white guy that brought you here.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nWhat about him?\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:50.000\nYour friend, your white friend.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:56.000\nDoes he have any black friends?\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:04.000\nI'm the black friend.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nAnd you don't really make mixtapes?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nNo, no, I don't.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nHe said he has a mixtape dropping sometime.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nYou drop that off to your girlfriend.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:18.000\nThat's in 1987.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nWhat are you studying?\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nI'm undeclared right now.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:26.000\nWhat would be your dream gig if you could have your pie in the sky?\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:29.000\nDo you do anything you wanted for a living?\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:40.000\nI'd probably be on community.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:44.000\nFairy tales can come true.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nWhat can happen to you?\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:51.000\nThere's a table in the back.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:58.000\nYou put your headshot in a basket back there.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nEverybody knows that.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nIs this your first time at the show?\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nYes, it is.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nYou don't know about the table?\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nI know you're joking.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nIs there a part in your back of your head?\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nYou knew that Spencer was just a fan.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nHe came one time when he got on the show.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:17.000\nAdam, I know you think that.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:22.000\nI've been on twice.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:23.000\nReally?\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:26.000\nI don't watch the show.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:30.000\nI think Adam started coming to the Harmontown Show because he was on community.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nHe got wind of...\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:33.000\nOh, is that right?\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:42.000\nJamal, other than wanting to be on television,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:46.000\nwhat is your dream?\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nI have no idea.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:49.000\nHow old are you?\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nI'm 18.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nOh yeah, you don't have to know yet.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nDo whatever you want.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:57.000\nBe nice if you knew.\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:03.000\nHis parents aren't paying for him to have a lifetime vacation.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nDid you know you wanted to be at 18?\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:06.000\nYeah.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:11.000\nI was going to be a sportscaster.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:15.000\nAnd I refused their money.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:26.000\nAnd I worked hard at Marquette University to become a sports journalist.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:29.000\nFor real?\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:37.000\nYeah.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:48.000\nOr maybe I can lie too.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nAll right, cue the...\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.000\nLet me do some rapping.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nJamal, you're going to want to stay for this.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:59.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:02.000\nFrom the streets, yeah, from the streets, yeah.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:07.000\nFrom the streets to the streets, from the alley to the streets, from the streets to the road.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:10.000\nFuck your mama like a frog or a toad.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:13.000\nPut my dick in her mouth dissection.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:18.000\nFuck your mama's infection.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nGross.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nFuck your mama from the ceiling to the floor.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:26.000\nFuck your mama so hard she wanted some more.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nFuck your mama down the hall.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:31.000\nFuck your mama slumber and fall.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:34.000\nFuck your mama in the new way.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:37.000\nFuck your mama till she was gay.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nHold on, hold on, hold on, new area.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:47.000\nOkay, whoa, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nLeft to the right.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:52.000\nFuck your mama till she lost her sight.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nNeeded a stick to walk around.\n\n47:54.000 --> 48:01.000\nFuck your mama till she didn't know what town.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:05.000\nHold on, hold on.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:09.000\nJamal, uh, what city are you from?\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:14.000\nClaremont? Where's that?\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nIs this in California?\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nOh, god.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:21.000\nAlright, alright.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nYo, yo.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nJ to the A to the M-A-L.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:29.000\nI fucked your mama so hard, but she'll never tell.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:36.000\nThat doesn't mean it was rape.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:40.000\nOkay, Jamal, everybody.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:43.000\nThank you.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nThank you, Jamal.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nNow Dan, while the beat is still rolling,\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nI want you to sing the melody hook\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:52.000\nlike you were gonna die tomorrow.\n\n48:52.000 --> 49:01.000\nYo, yo, oh, oh, rain, rain comes down on your umbrella.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:07.000\nEvery drop makes you me, I'm your guy.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:12.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nAlright.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:17.000\nAlright.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nIt's very unsettling to me that an 18-year-old kid\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\ncan come up and just go,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nI wish I was white,\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nand then have me go like,\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\noh, yeah, yeah.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nAnd then kind of like try to meet him halfway,\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:35.000\nand then he's like, I'm just fucking with you, bro.\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nLike, I don't know if you noticed,\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nbut it kind of threw me, because I'm like,\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:42.000\nwell, if we're really living in a post-racial America,\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:45.000\nthen we have a huge problem,\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:51.000\nbecause then that means that we're...\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nThere's a huge...\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:58.000\nWe're not paying attention to certain things that...\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:01.000\nIs the problem that when he said he wishes he were white,\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nhe wasn't like?\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nNo, no God, no.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:07.000\nI don't want him to be telling the truth when he says that.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nI'm saying like, the idea that it's become a joke,\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:12.000\nthat race can become a joke before we address the issues\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nthat are tagged race,\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:17.000\nthat's the troubling thing to me as a Gen Xer.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nThat's the troubling thing.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:20.000\nI think that behind...\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:21.000\nI'm getting a little tipsy,\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nso I should not be talking in this area.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nBut I...\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:28.000\nSo let me put a pin in it.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:33.000\nI think that race is tied to wealth distribution\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nin an unfortunate way\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nthat needs to be paid attention to,\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:40.000\nand I think that the race as artificial construct,\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:45.000\negalitarian, let's all ignore everything that separates this thing,\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:50.000\nis 50% the solution and 50% part of a shell game,\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:53.000\nas part of a larger system that says,\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nyou're racist if you pay attention to anything\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nthat separates anybody,\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:01.000\nbecause it keeps your eyes off of the walnut\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nthat has the pee under it.\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nAnd I'm too drunk to go further with that.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nAlso too uneducated.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:11.000\nI dropped out of my first semester at college,\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nso I don't have anything to back that up.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:14.000\nBut I always get suspicious of that,\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:15.000\nand that's the same thing with religion,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nwhen you hear me piping up about religion.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:20.000\nIt's like, I had like a big Twitter exchange\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nfollowing the David Cross episode,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nor I thought David Cross is...\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nAs Aaron says, David Cross's atheism is truly empowering.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nLike, he's the kind of guy that's like, he goes,\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nhey, I'm an atheist, nobody else should be.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:37.000\nAnd the thing that makes me argue\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nwith people who are evangelical about their atheism,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:43.000\nis the suspicion I have,\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:49.000\nthat the things that we're tending to blame\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\njust religion on,\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:55.000\nwhich is basically like kind of all bad stuff,\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:00.000\nit freaks me out that we can just jump on that.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nBecause I get worried about the real criminals\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:07.000\nwho are inherently not religious people,\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:10.000\nor atheists, they're just capitalists.\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nAnd they get away with actual crimes,\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:16.000\nthat there's a class system that is tied to this stuff,\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:19.000\nand that when you say in this country that there's a culture war,\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nand you point at all the dummies that, you know,\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nthey believe so much in God\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nthat they think the world was created in six days.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nYou're also talking about people who play scratch-offs\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nand believe in the horoscopes.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nYou're talking about people who are kind of exploited.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nYou're talking about people who have been convinced\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:36.000\nby people who are kind of bullying them\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:39.000\nthat their faith should be put in military\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nand fear of strangers and all this stuff.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:44.000\nI just worry a little bit about the intelligentsia,\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:47.000\njust dogpiling on all religion,\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nbecause I don't think the corner pastor\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:53.000\nin your neighborhood is at the top of the conspiracy.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nSo, too drunk.\n\n52:55.000 --> 53:00.000\nMy obsession with race and religion and all that stuff\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.000\nis I'm always suspicious of the actual thing in the room,\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:06.000\nwhich is rich people have more than poor people,\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nand we kind of never talk about that.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nI don't know if that's because it's boring,\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nor if it's because it's like,\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:16.000\nif they're actually successfully distracting us from talking about it.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:19.000\nSo, how'd your vasectomy go?\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:25.000\nAces.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:30.000\nI hope I didn't get too drunk to play Shadowrun.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:31.000\nDon't get too drunk to play Shadowrun.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:32.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:33.000\nDon't tell me not to.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:34.000\nBut your character,\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nbecause I've read Spencer sent me your character sheet.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:40.000\nDid you see one of your negative qualities on there?\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nAlcoholism.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nSevere alcoholism.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:45.000\nAll right, so it's a big night.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nWe're going to start playing Shadowrun tonight.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:52.000\nWhat is that video?\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:56.000\nWhat's the plan for the video?\n\n53:56.000 --> 54:00.000\nWhat is the...\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:05.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nThat's the most ironic statement in the world.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:10.000\nYou're sitting in the room.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nYou paid $10.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nThere's cameras everywhere.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nThe entire thing is being live streamed.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nHow long has that camera been up?\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:26.000\nSince I started talking about anything that might get me in trouble, is that...\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nBut are you from out of town?\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:34.000\nAnd you're like, they won't believe this.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nAll right, okay, okay.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:40.000\nI've lashed out at my best friend, I'm sorry.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:45.000\nWhere are you from?\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nWe're part of LA.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nI grew up in Venice.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nVenice, nice. Do you go to Venice High?\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:55.000\nNo, because my parents thought I'd get shot, so they sent me to St. Lauderdale.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:58.000\nDid you get shot?\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nDidn't get shot.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:07.000\nDidn't get shot? Your parents were right again?\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:13.000\nNow, speaking of the kind of anti-capitalist distribution of wealth thing,\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:16.000\nI think it's kind of built into this whole shadow-run universe.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nOh, for sure, yeah.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:21.000\nThe corporations have taken over, and there's a group of mercenaries\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nwho either exploit it or are exploited by it.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:29.000\nI believe we are a dragon awakening away from living in the world that shadow-run exists in.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:33.000\nAll right, well, let's bring out...\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:37.000\nShould we bring them out in one at a time, or just bring them out?\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:40.000\nLet's bring out my wife, Erin McGathy.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:46.000\nHello.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:56.000\nHello.\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nThank you. Hello.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nOh, yeah, kill the baby.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:04.000\nStar of the new number one channel on a one-show, kill the baby.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nI'm the baby.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nFemale lead, I would, yeah.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:11.000\nOh, that's nice. Yeah, thanks.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:18.000\nUnless the baby's a girl.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nI think the baby's a boy.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:23.000\nBaby's a boy.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:26.000\nThanks for having me. Goodbye.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nBut you're the baby? I haven't seen it, I'm sorry.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:36.000\nI'm not the baby. This is a channel one-at-one show from Alex and Ariel that went first this last week.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:41.000\nAnd I play the wife to a man who wants to kill our baby.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:42.000\nOkay.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:43.000\nYeah.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:44.000\nCheck it out.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:45.000\nAll right.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:50.000\nWas this all part of that nationwide insurance campaign that wasn't acceptable to me?\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:51.000\nWait about that.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.000\nExplain the nationwide thing.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:56.000\nI think, like, I was watching at the drawing room and the sound was kind of, like, at,\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:59.000\npardon me, at 50%, so I couldn't quite hear it.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:03.000\nAnd there was a kid, like, and he's in a bathtub, but he's sailing the seven seas with his dog,\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:06.000\nand he's in the tree house, and he's got the dog up there.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:11.000\nAnd then, then, like, he's, like, a kid, like, being, like, an imagineer of his own fun.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:15.000\nAnd then all of a sudden, there's just a picture of a bathtub that's overflowed,\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:20.000\nand then a TV that's fallen, like, clearly would have crushed anybody beneath it.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:24.000\nAnd it said, you know, most childhood deaths are preventable.\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:29.000\nAnd everyone in the bar was like, whoa!\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:32.000\nDead baby commercial!\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:36.000\nDoes the company tell you what's appropriate to put in different rooms in your house?\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:41.000\nIt says, like, go to Don'tKillYourBaby.com, and we'll fucking, we'll help you save up\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:46.000\nyour house from certain disaster, or give us $500 a month, and we'll make sure, like,\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:47.000\nit's fucking horrible.\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:51.000\nAnd it'd be a shame if anything bad should happen to your baby.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nHey, you got a good baby.\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:57.000\nYour son, your son seems like a nice kid, you know.\n\n57:57.000 --> 58:02.000\nBe ashamed of, I don't know, maybe a flat screen television lands on his head.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:03.000\nI don't know.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:04.000\nIt happens.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:05.000\nIt happens all the time.\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nGo to Don'tKillYourBaby.com.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:16.000\nYou see terrible statistics about such things that I would hate to see happen to your only son\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:21.000\nwith the high heels and the trash cans.\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:22.000\nSo joyless.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nHe wears the high heels and the rag on his head.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:30.000\nYeah, when the gay son comes out, clearly the young actor was confused, and they just\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:35.000\nthrew a scarf on him and the things, and they're like, come out like you're doing the wrong thing.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:38.000\nSo it's a six-year-old actor doing this, like it's a little boy doing this?\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:43.000\nYeah, it's incredibly offensive because it means that gay means that you wear high heels\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nand scarves on your head.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:49.000\nI dressed up as a kid a lot, and some of that included dressing up in women's clothing,\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:56.000\nbecause I had two options, dad's clothes or mom's clothes, and I wore them all.\n\n58:56.000 --> 59:00.000\nThat sounds like a poll quote from your autobiography.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:03.000\nI wore them all.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:07.000\nI do recall coming out, because my parents would have these swanky late-70s dinner parties,\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:11.000\nand there was fondue, and all the dudes had suits and great mustaches and looked like the Marlboro man.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:14.000\nAnd the women all had great dresses on and were named Lorraine and shit, and they all...\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nDo you think there was some key business happening?\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.000\nKey?\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:20.000\nKey party business? Do you think your parents were part of...\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:24.000\nYou know, I've actually considered that retrospectively, but I don't think so.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:27.000\nI don't think it was really that kind of vibe.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:30.000\nIt was a pretty permissive environment in terms of...\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:34.000\nYeah, it was just 70s. People were groovy, and the guys did their thing,\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:37.000\nand the women would kibbutz and talk and smoke and drink.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:44.000\nBut I do remember coming out of my mom's bathroom and took one of her products, like eyeliner or lipstick,\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:48.000\nand I think I put it on, and I did a big Revlon commercial for everybody.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nThat's so cute.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nLike you...\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:55.000\nI would come out and do it, because you watch TV, and they do commercials,\n\n59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nso they would be having this dinner party that my brother and I were not supposed to come out and interrupt,\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nbecause there were being adults, and probably swinging, probably fucking.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nAnd I would just come out and interrupt it for a little 30-second spot,\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nso I would come out and sell you some lipstick that I found.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nSo you would come out and go, like, Revlon make-ups.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nYeah, the new Revlon Ultra color. The new thing with the lips.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nWhich...\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nWas your mom putting the makeup on you?\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nNo, I was just raiding her bathroom and finding things to sell, like to do commercials for her.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nGot it.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nAlso, I was auditioning for commercials around that time, too, so maybe that was in my head as well.\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nDid I ever tell you the one about me running into a party with some information that I'd discovered?\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard that.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nThat was a great story.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nAll right.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nLet's bring out Game Master Spencer Crittenden!\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nGame Master!\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nHe is the gay master!\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nGame Master!\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nPut him in a trash can. He hiles on.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nGame Master, all day long.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nHey guys.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nHey Spencer, what's cooking, man?\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nYou know, just throwing away children.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nI don't know. I don't know you guys. I'm kind of... I'm kind of...\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nOh, run out. Run out of juice.\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nYou?\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nOh, I didn't even...\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nIt's not... It's January 1st. The clock says 9-Eleven.\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nI wasn't even thinking it was 9-Eleven when I said that, but, like, yeah, this is getting close to my bedtime.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nIt's just, you know, it's no good.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nWe do this every week, Spencer.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nAnd I usually go to bed at, like, 10 or 9.30 if I can.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nYeah, sleeps the best part of the day.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nAlso, you've been...\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nAs far as I know, you've been spending a good part of your waking hours working on Shadow Run for us.\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nYeah, I mean, it is. Yeah.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nI've read the book about four times now, and I still barely understand it.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nI reread some of that stuff multiple times, and I still have only a passing knowledge of it.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nOh, I know you do.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nI haven't read it, and I get it.\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nYep.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nAre our friends...\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nI'll teach you.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nIs DeMorge Brown here?\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nYeah, he's here.\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nOh, okay. DeMorge, are you here?\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nDeMorge Brown.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nDeMorge Brown.\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nDowntown.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nDeMorge Brown.\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nDeMorge, do you know Jamal?\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nI don't know Jamal, but I will meet him.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nHe lives a very sequestered life.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nI can reach him through the network.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nBlack people!\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nThere's a special slash...\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nJamal's an extra special name because it's a math book name.\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nWell, everyone's saying what, but when I was in school in math books where it has pictures\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nof different people, a lot of the African-American kids were named Jamal.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nMath book name.\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nAs a white writer, if you know a character as African-American, you cannot name them Jamal.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nThere's a short list of names that the other white writers will go, no, send it back.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nYou can't do that, which is funny.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nShould you tell them that in the world of commercials?\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nBecause when you audition for commercials, pretty much every script that has a black\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\ncharacter in it is named Jamal.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nI think that's part of the reason, though.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nI think it's just Ebon Flo.\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nIt's a beautiful name and you're a beautiful person.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nThat's why I think it Ebs and Flows.\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nI think culture gets a hold of those.\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nI think white writers, they're all white.\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nThey get confident and the bubble inflates and then it bursts because the ninth all-state\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000\ncommercial to have a kid named Jamal in it, then somebody starts going, this is the new\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nLeroy.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nWe can't do this anymore.\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nDan, when you're creating a black character for a community or another show...\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nI would never do such a thing.\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nYou know Dan's the first person a Hollywood ghost would do when they're creating a new\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nblack character.\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nHe's a consultant.\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nHave you ever gone and tried, I want to make this a black-sounding name.\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nFor instance, I'm unlikely to meet a white D'Morge.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nD'Morge sounds like an African American name.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nThe United States you're not, but in Switzerland you are.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nIs that right?\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nOh, I didn't know that.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nThere's a whole village full of family...\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nNo shit?\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nThere's a village of D'Morges?\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nIt's a last name, but there's also a horse, a racing horse right now named D'Morge.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nIt's a horse.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nStop being so racist.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nI love it.\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nIt's like in this country now, but outside of that spirit.\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nBut it's a unique first name, right?\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.680\nWe cast Keith David in this season of Community, so the character, the actor is cast before\n\n01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.000\nthe character is named, so here's a room full of white writers like have to come up with\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000\na name for a black man, and so that is a factor for us.\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.800\nI would like to hear all the pitches.\n\n01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.000\nI bet you would.\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nAnd also the conversations that we have about it, this is the real world, the ugly, strange,\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000\ntwisted, balloon animal world of racial consciousness, like white writers going like, well, I don't know.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nWell, not that for sure.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nAnd one of the things is he's not named Jamal, that's for sure.\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nI just went all the way.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nHis name is Elroy Patashnik.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nI was like, I can't, I'm running from this.\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nI'm not doing it.\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nGiordello, Jaffet Koto's character in the homicide, it was based on a real story, and the real\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nhead of the homicide department was a Sicilian.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nBut when they cast the actors, the actor they liked the most was Jaffet Koto.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nSo they didn't change the script at all.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nHe was just named Al Giordello, and for the whole series he walks around when the officers\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nare confused, and he just says, the Sicilians have a saying, and he speaks in Sicilian.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nAnd then he says, get out of my office, and he pulls a red table wine out and, you know,\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nstarts eating Italian food.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nReally?\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nThe Sicilian food.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nThey just didn't bother to change it.\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nNo, no, no, they didn't change it at all.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nThat's great.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nAnd then later on, they wanted to bring him a son, bring his personal life into it, and\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nthey brought a real Black Sicilian.\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nThey brought Giancarlo Esposito into play.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nHis son just sort of had this crashing of details.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nThat's great.\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nDo you guys remember when Dan said, I'll fuck your mama and her infection?\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nIt rhymed with some—\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nNo, I know, but I—\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nI find these days that when I rap, one of two things happens.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nSomething comes out that's so gross that I stop and go, that's gross.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nOr it's just stuff that I've already said.\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nIt's like mentally exploring the idea that there is a man somewhere that refers to his\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nwife's vagina as her infection.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nSee, were that conjured in my mind that it wasn't her vagina?\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nShe had some other infection that he was fucking.\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nYeah, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nIt might have been on her thigh, you know, or her calf or something.\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nOr like maybe Adam and Eve.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nAdam was like, oh, you're so great.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nI don't know why I'm attracted to you.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nI am.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nAre you sick?\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nIt looks like—it could look like a—\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nIt does seem like you're not well.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nLike in a vacuum.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nIn a vacuum.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nIf all you knew was men and then a woman pulled her pants down, you'd be like, are you all right?\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nAnd vice versa.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nIf all you saw were women and then a man, you'd be like, whoa.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nThe first time I saw you.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nYou really have to get that looked at.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nIt's not a controversial statement.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nYeah.\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nI think what you're saying, Dan, is boys have wee-wees and girls have crack-wees.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nWell, it's like—it's similar to, like, ax wound, which is such a grudge.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nI mean, which is a terrible thing to say.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nI'm really laughing because—\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nThere are 900 words for a vagina and none of them are pleasant, really.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nI mean, a couple that are passable, but mostly just no.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nPaloma.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nNo, you just ruined that name.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nYou call her Pussy Paloma?\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nNo, that's our name for unborn daughter that is not—\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nHe just called your pussy your Paloma.\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nI mean, we'll just change it.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nHer name just won't be Paloma.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nDan and I have talks about naming a daughter Paloma.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nPaloma!\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nPull it together.\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nAll right.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nSorry, Spencer.\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nHey, guys.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nWhen you say you're unborn daughter, have you conceived?\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nAre you trying to actively right now?\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nNo.\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nI'm giggling because you're the first person who's asked.\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nNo, we are not actively trying to—what a weird question.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nAre you trying to make a baby?\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nYou said that.\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nI'm sorry for being too personal.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nThat's way too personal.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nI don't need to press you down.\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nI'm coming in her tits a lot.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nDoes that—\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nWhich brings us back to cock ring story.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nBut I'm stopping it up with a paper towel\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nand doing what I call stuffing.\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nThe tunnel.\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nIsn't it?\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nWe read somewhere—\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nIt's a great way to get an infection.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nWe call it demerging.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nWhat?\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nThat wasn't fair.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nI'm just here, man.\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nI'm just here.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nWe're waiting until June 1st.\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nWe're going to start conceiving.\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nWe've decided we want our child's birthday\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nto be a very specific date.\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nSo we're just going to cast a wide net\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nand take advantage of our God-given right to abortion.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nWe're not Republicans, for God's sake.\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nI want my kid to be born on April 15th.\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nBecause I want everyone to remember\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nmy taxes are due and also—\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nIt'll be our first child, but our fifth pregnancy.\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nI mean, you guys, those of you who have come to the show live,\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nthis glow is not un-pregnant.\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nLook at me.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nBeaming.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nWhat if we can't have kids?\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nI mean, if anybody can't, it's got to be me, right?\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nDon't I just seem sterile?\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nI feel sterile.\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nI just feel like I feel so sterile.\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nIs that your way of just talking yourself\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nout of ever having to wear a condom?\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nIt's like, oh, baby, I'd never get you pregnant.\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nNo, I've never used that as an excuse in the past.\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nI'm married now.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nI'm just saying like, yeah, no, it just doesn't seem like—\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nWhen I look at myself in the mirror, I don't go, ah, potency.\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nI go like, eh, apology amati.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nYou don't picture him firing off like a million geomatis.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nYou think in order to make a new apology amati,\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nyou'd have to catch one and distill it and help it,\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nput wheels on the back on its tail,\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nput it on a sperm track to an egg that's like in braces.\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nWe made a new geomati.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nIt wasn't easy.\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nThe park is open.\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nI don't know what kind of new geomati you're making in there.\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nIt doesn't sound like a good idea.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nDon't you see what you're doing, geomati?\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nYou're tampering with nature.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nSpent so much time thinking whether you could make another apology.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nYou didn't stop.\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nThat is one big pile of geomati shit.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nI think it's time to start getting into our shadow run for this evening.\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nFuckin' hey, man.\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nYeah, that's why I brought him out early, see?\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nYou brought me on at the normal time.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nWell, I brought you out earlier, but then we talked,\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nand you know how we usually bring you out?\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nIt's normal time.\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nNormal time you bring me out.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nIt's my fault.\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nThere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nJust call him like you see it.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nWell, I listened to the show last week,\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nand I heard all of your awesome characters\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nI'm very excited about,\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nand so I should probably start off by revealing my character, correct?\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nCorrect.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nIs that good?\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nIs that a right sponsor?\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nYeah, that's fine, because our characters all know each other.\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nSo, we're not going to be meeting each other.\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nNo.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nWe're going to be beginning on, as I understand it,\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nwe're going to be beginning already having known each other.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nYeah, you're like a team of shadow runners.\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nI love it.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nThere you go.\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nI'm so excited.\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nWe're going to really try to do it right,\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nand I'm sorry I got, but not too drunk.\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nI just got a little too drunk.\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nBut I mean, not too drunk.\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nAll right, well my character's name is Eve.\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nYes.\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nEve was born, you know what?\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nDo you play a little Vangelis?\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nFunny you should say that.\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nI think I have a song for my thing.\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nIf I were here last week, I would have done musical.\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nOh, by the way, last week, I never said, like,\n\n01:14:13.000 -->

shamans.\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nBefore her birth, her parents ran a successful chain\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nof alchemy stores in Seattle,\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nbut

01:23:21.000\nBetter-than-life.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nLately, experimental chips have been\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nleaking out of the Redmond Barrens.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nCrazy chips.\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nStronger than ever.\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nWe've heard rumors that these chips\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000\ndon't have side effects or addiction.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nJust rumors, though.\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nWe got a positive ID on an expert\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nsoftware engineered by the name\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nof Baldwin Brown,\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nsighted in and around an abandoned\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nwarehouse that's been beefing up security lately.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nHead down there and capture Brown.\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nAlive.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nI want to know what he knows.\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nScoop up all the BTLs you come across\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nand I'll bring them back.\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nI'll meet you there.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nI'll meet you at the drop zone with a payment.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nAfter the fixer fee, I can offer 5,000 each.\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nI'll throw in an extra 1,000\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nif you guys want to bring me back crates of BTLs.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nSounds good.\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nHow about you throw in an extra 1,500?\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nAll right.\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nLet me do this.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nI'm rolling dice now.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nHow's your family?\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nOh, it's good.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nFace.\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nWhat was the amount that you said?\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000\n1,500.\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nNope.\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nAll right.\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nWe will keep that in mind with our timing.\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nMercy, what does Baldwin Brown do again?\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nWho is he?\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nHe's an expert software engineer.\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nThanks, Mercy.\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nSo what do you guys say?\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nSo what do you guys say?\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\n5,000 a piece.\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nI don't trust him.\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nBut I'll do it because I need the money.\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nI tried to negotiate the bonus.\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nI really think that this job sounds a little more dangerous\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nthan 5,000.\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nWhat's the currency?\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nNew yen.\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nOh, OK.\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nHow about 6,000 yen?\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nWell, that sounds a lot more agreeable.\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\n6,000 it is.\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nAll right.\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nNice, Mercy.\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nYou got a great face.\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nI would also like to go on this mission.\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nHey, nightblade.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nYou're not fucked up again, are you?\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nJust once I'd like to go on a mission with you\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nwhere you're not totally blasted on cyber booze.\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nYou're Kettle Trons and whatnot.\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nIt's our neck we're risking out there, nightblade.\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nI need the money.\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nYou don't look so good as what I'm trying to tell you.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nWere you paying attention at all?\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nRepeat back to me what Mr. Johnson just asked us to do.\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nWe were supposed to go get Bradley Woodford from the...\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nBaldwin Brown.\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nBaldwin Brown has been seen in a warehouse.\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nWe're going to secure him.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nHe's an engineer from this place that makes these BTL chips.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nWe're going to grab him and any BTL chips we can.\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nBut she called the currency nyung nyung.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nAnd that's why I'm laughing.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nBecause it sounds like a cat food.\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nWhat is it?\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nNew Yen.\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nNobody tell her.\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nHorticard, what do you say?\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nI have a feeling that this is something that we could do.\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nQuite easily, but we should go quickly because he is deteriorating this one on the right.\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nAnd we will need his...\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nHe's talking to you, nightblade.\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nHorticard.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nYou got tricks of cyber kettle on your...\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nWe will need his attributes in the first day of the approach.\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nYou don't have to be a precog to see those guys fucked up.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nWhat do you guys have to worry about, Mia, right?\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nSo someone go on there calmly and find out how far away the Redmond Barons are.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nNot far.\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nJust an Uber right away.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nShall we hop in an Uber?\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nSure.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nSure, who calls them?\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nThe fixer.\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nPerhaps.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nWill he do this?\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nThere's an app for that.\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nI open up the Uber app in my brain.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nJust on your cell phone, on the com link.\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nOkay.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nI open up the Uber app and I request an Uber.\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nAn Uber arrives post haste.\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nOur Uber's here.\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nI get in.\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nWe exit the last stand.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nHank's last stand.\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nGo to the Uber.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nAll right.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nGive me all your gum.\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nWait, what?\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nExcuse me?\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nI'm saying that to the Uber driver.\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nThere is no Uber driver.\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nI see.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nAll right.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nSorry.\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nI say that and then I laugh and I'm like, oh, it's a dream I have.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nSometimes I play out the dreams that I have.\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nWhat's the plan when we get into you guys?\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nWhat's the plan of attack?\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nYeah, you might want to.\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nWe got to figure this out.\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nOkay.\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nSo there's this warehouse.\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nThis guy's holed up in it and we want to just nab him.\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nWe don't want to kill him.\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nHave it drop us off on the side street.\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nFirst of all, we are shadow runners.\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nWe should come out in the shadow.\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nOf course.\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nWhen we get there and sidebar table talk, this is my first time playing a magic user.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nIt's going to be a learning curve for me on this one.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nI've read a lot.\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nI'll try to actually perceive or to actually project when we get there to go inside the warehouse to see what's going on.\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nOh, that's fantastic.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nShould we nab him or are we just getting something from him?\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nWe're going to nab him and as many BTL chips as we can get our hands on.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nHe's the package for the Johnson.\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nRight, right.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nAnd I have extraordinary physical stealth skills.\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nI'm very stealthy as well on Agile.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nAlso, I can make myself invisible and levitate and shit like that.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nI'm as familiar with Hordecai's skill set.\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nHordecai.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nI have several items at my disposal.\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nI will keep them to myself.\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nIt is a private inventory.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nBut you should know my reputation.\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nObviously precedes myself.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nI would not be part of the team.\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nNo, of course.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nSure.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nI have certain precognition skills.\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nI also have presets that allow me to enhance my physical abilities and mental abilities.\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nAnd I can probe minds if we get one and settle somebody down and need to know what's happening.\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nThat's great.\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nCan you pre-cog what's going on inside that warehouse right now?\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nCan you foresee the...\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nI can use general perception, but pre-cogging requires me to retire somewhere and to find a good sound system.\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nAlright.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nIf this is going to be all muscle and agility, I'll stand outside and...\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nWe look at a map of the city.\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nOkay.\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nWe're in Seattle?\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nYep.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nAnd we look at where this warehouse is.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nAlright.\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nCan we pick a spot that looks like we could get maybe a good vantage point physically?\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nLike, you know, safe.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nTotally safe.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nNot trying to...\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nI have no soft for the city of Seattle in my mind.\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nI can look at the building and also its sort of physical plant and no certain points of entry.\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nAny adjacent buildings?\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nPass that to DeMorsch.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nHere's a map.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nHere's a map.\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nIt's a good deal.\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nOkay.\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nTo DeMorsch.\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nI love that you're not excited.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nHe has the map.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nYou don't have the map.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nWe got a whole...\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nI'm sensing that the map is stuck in translation.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nCould I please maybe get it to myself?\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nI'm looking at the map.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nHold on.\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nThat's a train.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nIt's not yours to have.\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nI'll have them up for download after the show.\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nOkay.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nAlright.\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nAlright.\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nIt's...\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nThe compound is...\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nI don't think we're supposed to see it.\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nDeMorsch is supposed to...\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nSorry.\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nHe can share, but afterwards...\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nIf you could read my mind, what a tale my heart would tell.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nThere's a warehouse surrounded by a large fence.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nThe whole area is in the barrens.\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nIt's just this destroyed, devastated area.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nThere's all sorts of squat shells of buildings you can kind of hide out and scope out the place if you wish.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nAnd that's where the Uber kind of drops you off.\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nIt's just in an alleyway, kind of about 600 feet off.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nWhat time of day is it?\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nIt's about 6 p.m. It's getting dark.\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nOkay.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nShadows are coming out.\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nDon't worry about, you know, us elves in our low light vision.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nI have cyber eyes.\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nSo from your vantage point, you can see the low-roofed warehouse.\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nIt's on a big hunk of land fenced off by a 10-foot tall fence topped with knife wire.\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nYou see shattered, burnt-out buildings all over the place surrounding the lot.\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nAnd through the fence, you see the warehouse with a loading dock for trucks.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nThe only entrance you can see on the compound is on the south side.\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nThere's a big gate controlled by a small gatehouse.\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nFar from state-of-the-art security, the fence looks old,\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nand you only see three armed guards manning the gate with submachine guns.\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nOne bulky security camera on the fence surveys the road leading up to the gate.\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nSomeone's going to take out that camera.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nWell, first let's talk about these fences.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nThe ones that don't have a gate on them.\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nWhat keeps one from getting in?\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nWow.\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nLinked chains.\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nIt's a chain link fence.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nAnd they're high, and they have...\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nA 10-feet tall topped with knife wire.\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nKnife wire.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nYup. That's a real thing.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nYeah. BFD.\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nTo a guy like me.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nCan I go up to the fence without being seen?\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nWhich fence?\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nNot the one by the guards, but like farther away from them.\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nYeah, probably.\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nI go up there to check it out to see.\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nYou got to stealthily sneak up to see if there's any sensors,\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nlike a wire is connected to it, if it's electrified.\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nWhat's your agility plus sneaking?\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000\nUm...\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nQuick.\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nDon't make me rush.\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nAgility is four, and my sneaking is...\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nSix.\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nYou do it without being seen.\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nYou're up on a fence.\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nYou're right by the knife wires.\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nI tried to use my perception on the fence and see what's going on.\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nIf it looks like there's any hidden sensors or things that might trip.\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nYou don't see any sensors.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nIt's pretty rusted and old, actually.\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nI'll go back to the group and relay that information.\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nHey.\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nListen, don't run up to shit like that without us making a plan.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nYou don't own me Nightblade.\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nI lived alone in this town for four years.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nI'm a man without a past!\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000\nAll right, look, we know that the two of you have...\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nThe two of you have this will-they-won't-they bullshit.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nLet's cool it for a second and focus on the task at hand.\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nWe're gonna work as a team, you know?\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nAll right, well, cool it, Nightblade.\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nCool it.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nI'm telling her to cool it.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nI take the note.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nAll right.\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nSo I'm wondering, you know, I got a nano whip in my fingertip compartment.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nWe all know.\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nYeah, like, that's the first time we've heard this story.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nI'm not bragging, but I might be able to cut through the chain link, I'm not sure.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nDo I know from experience if chain link is something that would thwart my nano whip?\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nYou know it would not do that, in fact.\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nI know it wouldn't thwart it?\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nYes.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nIn fact, your nano whip would thwart the chain link.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nLike a knife through butter.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nLike a knife through butter.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nSo we could go in, I mean, we could frag the three skisballs at the front gate.\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nI'd say it's better to go and clean through the side.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nI would suggest perhaps that we align ourselves directly in front of the security gate at a certain distance.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nThat we first toss into the compound, the security compound, a smoke bomb.\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nThat's perhaps driving them out and perhaps each pick a target and shoot with each of the three guards.\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000\nLet's listen to the Nazi doctor.\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nI'm worried the smoke bomb will draw out all of the people inside as well.\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nThe security guards.\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nYeah, there's only three.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nOnly three.\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000\nBut if we have these aligned, we each take one shot.\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nRight, but I think that beyond those three, there's like more, you know, in there.\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nAnd if we, the smoke bombs, that's going to, like, that's going to say, hey, everybody inside the compound,\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nlet's have all of you come out the front and deal with this.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nBut they're inside.\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nPerhaps we can...\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nSecurity guards on the outside of the gate.\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nCan we create a diversion?\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nMaybe I walk in, I'm wearing an action-ear business clothes.\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nAnd we all know I have this face.\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nMaybe I talk to the guards while you come in through the side.\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nThat's good.\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nSo we got, you know, we got going in through the back door.\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:46.000\nWe got smoke bomb, weird Atari 2600 take all comers at the front door.\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nI have improved invisibility where I'm invisible to guards and sensors.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nWell, let's have Eve do that then.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nYou don't like walk through the front door?\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nLet's do that, but if we take that choice, then I would choose then to use a silent,\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.000\nI have a silent gun, a gun with a silencer, and I would use that.\n\n01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nWell, yeah, that's a good move.\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nI call them a mentor of spirit, Spencer, the Thunderbird, for guidance on this.\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nThunderbirds, like, you should check it out first.\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nThat's what I've been saying, Thunderbird.\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nCar, car.\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nThat's what I've been saying.\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nEverybody, we're all able to be in constant contact with each other.\n\n01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nYeah, you have your com links and microtransceivers.\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000\nAll right, everybody, test your transceivers.\n\n01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nAre you hearing me?\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nCheck.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nOK, we can split up, and I'm going to nano whip through the back door as a tour,\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nand I'm going to, anybody I see, I'm going to take them out with stealth.\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nI think we should have an emergency code that we have in case the shit hits the fan,\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000\nin which case we all run, or...\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nWe can't just run out and call on Uber.\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.320\nThere's probably a spot that we're in right now.\n\n01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.000\nI say, here's what I say.\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.040\nI say, Nightblade, you go in, nano-whip that fence,\n\n01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.560\ngo in, see what you've got.\n\n01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.240\nAnd we need two people to cover the front gate.\n\n01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.040\nSo if anything goes weird with the guards there,\n\n01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:35.840\nwe'll take them out.\n\n01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.480\nThat's true.\n\n01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.040\nThat's their only way out.\n\n01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.600\nThat's how we should be looking at this.\n\n01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.920\nThese guys are pigs in a pen.\n\n01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.180\nWhat?\n\n01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.520\nWait, what?\n\n01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.060\nSo you're saying that the two people on the outside\n\n01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.120\nneed to be on the outside, because that's their only way out.\n\n01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.800\nAnd we're going to execute the people that are leaving?\n\n01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.440\nNo, I'm saying we're going in there to get a guy.\n\n01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.680\nThe front gate is not important for us to get in,\n\n01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.680\nbut it is important for us to keep an eye on in case\n\n01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.000\nthe guy we're trying to get tries to get out.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:05.400\nI see.\n\n01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:10.680\nOK, I can stand at the front gate.\n\n01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:18.600\nI can't do much physically, aside from having a great face.\n\n01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.040\nSo I'll do that.\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.400\nI just, that sounds fine.\n\n01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.280\nI don't want to.\n\n01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.000\nWhen the rest of the group settles on the plan,\n\n01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.360\nI am fully equipped to do whatever the task is assigned to me.\n\n01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.160\nNightblade, you want to go try to get in,\n\n01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.560\nkeep us posted on the com links.\n\n01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:42.000\nAnd if there's trouble, we come charging in after you.\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.080\nIf not, we'll see what we see, and then we'll take it from there.\n\n01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.160\nAll right, sound good?\n\n01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.160\nI'm going to go in.\n\n01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.520\nAll right, I'm going to nano whip the fence.\n\n01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.000\nAll right, so there's multiple sides.\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.400\nIt's like a rectangle of a fence, so northeast, south, or west.\n\n01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.640\nI want to go in the west side.\n\n01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.960\nAll right, which side?\n\n01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960\nOK.\n\n01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.280\nJust so you know, just in the middle of that fence,\n\n01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.200\nonce you get over, there are crates.\n\n01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.280\nIf you need to scale them, you could perhaps arrange them\n\n01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.960\nto get to the top of the warehouse.\n\n01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.000\nWell, that might make a good visual cover for the hole\n\n01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.440\nI cut in it.\n\n01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:14.920\nIt's good.\n\n01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:15.840\nDo what you like.\n\n01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.440\nLook for these crates that he's talking about.\n\n01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.080\nWhere are these crates?\n\n01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.120\nYou find the crates.\n\n01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.640\nOn this side of the fence, you're actually\n\n01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.720\npretty close to the warehouse itself.\n\n01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.080\nThere's only kind of a narrow five or six feet space,\n\n01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.920\nand it's kind of packed with crates, so yeah.\n\n01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.360\nI like that.\n\n01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.320\nSounds like good cover.\n\n01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.000\nUsing the visual cover of the crates,\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.600\nI nano whip a man-sized hole in the chain link.\n\n01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:46.760\nYou do that successfully, you neatly slice.\n\n01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.400\nYou guys see a sized hole?\n\n01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.320\nWith that, we are officially shadow running.\n\n01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.720\nThat's right, that was the wrong hand.\n\n01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:56.040\nMy nano whip is in a fingertip compartment\n\n01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.280\non my human arm.\n\n01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.960\nMy bionic arm is the other arm.\n\n01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.460\nOK.\n\n01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.440\nAll right, you're inside.\n\n01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.080\nYou're right next to this warehouse.\n\n01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.680\nThe property is big and deserted.\n\n01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.800\nIt's the perfect spot for secret research.\n\n01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.280\nYou can see an old rusted storage container\n\n01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.560\non the far side of the yard, trash,\n\n01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.000\nlitters of the ground.\n\n01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.960\nYou're also right next to a shooting range\n\n01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.720\nwith targets and bullets and stuff.\n\n01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.880\nWhat's the nearest structure from these crates?\n\n01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.720\nYou're right next to the warehouse,\n\n01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.160\nbut you're not next to a door.\n\n01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.360\nYou don't see any doors on the side of the building you're on.\n\n01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.240\nHow far physically are we away from the guards\n\n01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.760\nat the front gate?\n\n01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.120\nI mean, about 250 feet if you're kind of near where he is.\n\n01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.040\nOK.\n\n01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.040\nIs there, do I see a way to, well, it doesn't matter.\n\n01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.120\nI'm Jim Nightblade.\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.160\nI want to go to the warehouse and use my grappling gun\n\n01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.800\nto get to the roof.\n\n01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.840\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.920\nGuys, he's going in alone.\n\n01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.960\nI'm going to go on with him.\n\n01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.320\nAll right, be careful.\n\n01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.640\nIf you follow him, please be careful.\n\n01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.600\nIf you go to the south on the outside,\n\n01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.720\nthere is a bit of a sinkhole.\n\n01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.120\nAnd you might, as it gets darker, be prone to falling in.\n\n01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.840\nSo please be careful.\n\n01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.760\nHow do you know all this?\n\n01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.080\nA perception on this?\n\n01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:23.080\nI have a city of Seattle map.\n\n01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.800\nMy mind is one of my no-softs.\n\n01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.320\nOh, us?\n\n01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.080\nOK, that's very good.\n\n01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.040\nThank you, Hordegaard.\n\n01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.000\nHordegaard, where's the best place for me\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nto stand if I'm standing in a position to talk to somebody?\n\n01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.280\nIt's like somebody's talking about guards or people\n\n01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.960\nwho would inquire.\n\n01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.440\nThe gate is on the south side in the middle.\n\n01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.160\nThe road that leads to the front gate\n\n01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.560\nis the only way out and the only way in.\n\n01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.160\nAnd this in-science inside leads to the loading dock.\n\n01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.400\nThe gatehouse is next to that.\n\n01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.640\nIt's a sentry unit, and it is separate, of course,\n\n01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.080\nfrom the gate, just a sentry house with three guards inside.\n\n01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.600\nOK, I'm going to walk around in front of that.\n\n01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.640\nYou're saying the front gate is the best place?\n\n01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.960\nIt would appear to be a front gate,\n\n01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.400\nbut it's on the south side.\n\n01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.280\nOK, I'm going to walk around there with my, I'm sorry,\n\n01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.160\nwhat is it, a selby?\n\n01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.000\nWhat is the cell phone?\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:20.680\nComlick.\n\n01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.440\nComlick, sorry.\n\n01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.840\nAlmost had it.\n\n01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.360\nI'm going to have my Comlick up and make it look like I'm\n\n01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.200\nstanding there waiting for somebody to pick me up,\n\n01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.800\nso I will be in disguise.\n\n01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:37.600\nAll right, as you approach, you're still a good 40 yards off,\n\n01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.360\nand the guards turn and aim their submachine guns at you\n\n01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.400\nand start yelling, hey, get back, get back, get back, get back.\n\n01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.200\nGentlemen, I'm sorry.\n\n01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:53.120\nI turn my face towards the great gentleman.\n\n01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.200\nBoys, boys.\n\n01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.000\nBoys will be boys.\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.240\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:06.160\nMy son is being brought here to me.\n\n01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.160\nI've got to play with him.\n\n01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.000\nScrewed it up.\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.760\nI'm sorry, gentlemen.\n\n01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:20.720\nI'm just a lady, a little lost, and I'll back away,\n\n01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.840\nbut is it OK if I just stand kind of here?\n\n01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:29.160\nBecause this is where I've told my son's father to meet me.\n\n01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.600\nWe're no longer together.\n\n01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.000\nWhat a bastard.\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.960\nI know how that goes.\n\n01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960\nNo way, you don't know how that goes.\n\n01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.880\nYou're too handsome to ever be alone.\n\n01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.480\nI think that most of the time.\n\n01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.240\nI don't want to be forward, but with your beard\n\n01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.160\nand your looks, you look like a lumber sexual.\n\n01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.240\nOh, I'm clean shaven.\n\n01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.480\nClean shaven.\n\n01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.080\nThat's right.\n\n01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.960\nAll right, well, sir, if you don't mind me standing here\n\n01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.880\nwith my phone and occasionally looking over at you\n\n01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.880\nand fantasizing, then I think we're good.\n\n01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.760\nWell, that sounds mighty fine.\n\n01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.800\nAll right.\n\n01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.200\nNightblade, what do you see in there?\n\n01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.640\nYou're on a roof.\n\n01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640\nI'm on a roof.\n\n01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.840\nAre there windows on the outside of the structure?\n\n01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.520\nNo, it's a windowless building.\n\n01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.720\nI climbed the rope up there with him.\n\n01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.360\nAll right.\n\n01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.160\nOof.\n\n01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.800\nYou climb up, but you slip and fall on your face\n\n01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.000\nright at the top.\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:45.920\nAm I on the roof?\n\n01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.520\nYeah.\n\n01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:47.200\nAm I hurt?\n\n01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:47.640\nNope.\n\n01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.400\nOK.\n\n01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.920\nYou just made a noise.\n\n01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.520\nOops, sorry.\n\n01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.520\nI used my grappling gun.\n\n01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.800\nWell, you were already, wait, how?\n\n01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:01.840\nNo, I mean, I was just explaining to her.\n\n01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.320\nOh, OK.\n\n01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.800\nI used my grappling gun.\n\n01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.080\nI examine the rooftop for any sort of skylights\n\n01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.320\nor any sort of ingress.\n\n01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.080\nYou don't see any skylights, but you do see,\n\n01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.760\nit just looks like a, what do you call it, like a great,\n\n01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.920\nyeah, just a grill, like a great,\n\n01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.720\nit's screwed on tight.\n\n01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:21.680\nSee that grill?\n\n01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:22.640\nYeah.\n\n01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:26.000\nIt's just getting a closer look.\n\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.920\nIt's just a grill.\n\n01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.640\nIt's a Phillips head screws bolted.\n\n01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.600\nYou know what that looks like to my nanowhip?\n\n01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.160\nMore butter.\n\n01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.880\nLooks like we will be conceiving tonight.\n\n01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:55.120\nI mean, I don't have any tools for screw, screw, screws.\n\n01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.880\nDo I have, like, a screwdriver?\n\n01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.200\nI don't think so.\n\n01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.640\nIt'd probably say something like that.\n\n01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.160\nDo you have a screwdriver?\n\n01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.520\nI don't have a screwdriver.\n\n01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.280\nIf you're out there and you're listening,\n\n01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.880\nyou can proceed north on top of the building.\n\n01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.880\nThere is some sort of loading dock there.\n\n01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.200\nIf you can drop down there, you can find ingress,\n\n01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.920\nor egress, perhaps, if you are inside,\n\n01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.240\nbut you would find ingress.\n\n01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.920\nOK, let's not get caught up on that.\n\n01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.680\nBut I'm just saying.\n\n01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.160\nThe structure is there, perhaps an easier one,\n\n01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.840\nbut perhaps also one that is guarded.\n\n01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.080\nAll right, Napele, the sneak to the north side of the building.\n\n01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.960\nGo to that loading dock.\n\n01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.520\nWhat about the grate?\n\n01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.640\nWe don't have the tools, man.\n\n01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.120\nI can have a nano-whip.\n\n01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.200\nLook, Nightblade.\n\n01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.960\nCan I use my combat sense to see what troubles\n\n01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.800\nmight befall them?\n\n01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.200\nYou can sense that they're not in any immediate danger\n\n01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.080\nat the moment.\n\n01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.800\nI sense it, you are not, in any immediate danger.\n\n01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.080\nBut don't hold me to that.\n\n01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.600\nIf you want a nano-whip that great,\n\n01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.880\nI'm not going to stand in your way.\n\n01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.360\nThat's what she said.\n\n01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.120\nSorry, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.760\nWe talked about harassment on the runs.\n\n01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.240\nLet me just take a peek.\n\n01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.200\nA nano-whip the great.\n\n01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.120\nAll right.\n\n01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:30.160\nYep, you nano-whip the great.\n\n01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.760\nWrong finger, wrong finger, wrong finger.\n\n01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:39.040\nYou slice a hole in it, and it's kind of like a can,\n\n01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.240\nwhere it's hanging by like a little thread, you know?\n\n01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:41.840\nNice.\n\n01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.960\nHow's the size?\n\n01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.800\nIt's man-sized.\n\n01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.120\nI got a man-sized grate.\n\n01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.400\nWhy don't you take a peek and take a little gander\n\n01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.120\ndown there, Nightblade?\n\n01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.120\nLet's start going in the grate.\n\n01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.640\nWait, you do what?\n\n01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:05.360\nI go in.\n\n01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.320\nOh, you go in.\n\n01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.120\nWell, it's just kind of like a hole in the ceiling.\n\n01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.400\nIf you go in, you'd just be kind of like dropping\n\n01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:12.880\nthrough a hole.\n\n01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.680\nIs that what you do?\n\n01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.320\nOh, you mean like down below is the warehouse itself?\n\n01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.040\nYeah.\n\n01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.920\nOh, then let me look and get a lay of the land.\n\n01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.000\nYou do that.\n\n01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.080\nYou see a card table with two guys playing cards\n\n01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.160\nand drinking alcohol.\n\n01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.040\nThey're not seeming to pay much attention.\n\n01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.880\nThey got their pistols on the table.\n\n01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.280\nI got two bogeys.\n\n01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:38.760\nYou also see two semi-trucks and crates all over the place\n\n01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:41.760\nand a forklift in one corner.\n\n01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.480\nTwo bogeys playing cards.\n\n01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.680\nIt's all I got in here.\n\n01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.040\nPortaGuy, what do you see down there?\n\n01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.560\nAnything else we need to know about?\n\n01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.400\nOur own vision, good enough there, Spencer.\n\n01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.400\nWhat?\n\n01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.160\nTo see around inside the warehouse.\n\n01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.440\nYou see the things I said.\n\n01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.120\nThere's nothing else to see.\n\n01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:03.720\nSo can I use my grappling gun to descend like Spider-Man?\n\n01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.320\nWell, you can hook it on something\n\n01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.360\nand then climb down on the rope, like tying a rope\n\n01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:13.360\nto a fixed object.\n\n01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.600\nHow far away are they from us?\n\n01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.520\n40 feet.\n\n01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.600\nAnd how far is 40 feet down?\n\n01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.200\nNo, I mean it's diagonal.\n\n01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.800\nOK, so it's 20 feet or so down?\n\n01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.360\nYep.\n\n01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.840\nSo I can fix my grapple to the roof here\n\n01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.560\nand then descend with my grappling gun.\n\n01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.920\nYes.\n\n01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.440\nI'm going to give it a shot.\n\n01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.200\nAll right.\n\n01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.200\nI'll be right behind you if you need me to.\n\n01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.720\nWhat's your agility plus sneaking?\n\n01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:37.960\nGet ready for go time.\n\n01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.200\nI'd like this to be a black bag job,\n\n01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.680\nbut it might be fracapalooza.\n\n01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:55.160\nMy agility is, it's me, Dan.\n\n01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:00.160\nMy agility is five, and my, what was the other thing?\n\n01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:00.800\nSneaking.\n\n01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:08.920\nSneaking is four, and it says parentheses plus four.\n\n01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.600\nOK.\n\n01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:12.720\nThat's sneaky.\n\n01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:17.400\nAll right, you descend unseen or heard.\n\n01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.840\nYou're right above the floor.\n\n01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.080\nYou can touch the floor if you want.\n\n01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:22.720\nOK, I'll wait until you're off the thing\n\n01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.280\nbefore I descend after you.\n\n01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.680\nI touch it.\n\n01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:32.120\nI leave my grapple so that my friend can come down too.\n\n01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:34.440\nYou do that quietly.\n\n01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.200\nI descend as well.\n\n01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.120\nThat happens.\n\n01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.960\nOK.\n\n01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:39.960\nThey don't see us?\n\n01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:40.560\nThey don't.\n\n01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.560\nThey're not paying close attention apparently.\n\n01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.640\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.280\nI can stun these guys and knock them out with a stun bolt\n\n01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.520\nfrom a distance if you want.\n\n01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.040\nLet's check them with the team.\n\n01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.360\nCome on, chuckleheads, talk to me.\n\n01:52:54.360 --> 01:53:00.160\nI'm a chucklehead.\n\n01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.040\nSounds good.\n\n01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.160\nOnce again, if I could tap into combat sense\n\n01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.880\nto see what sort of risk they are in.\n\n01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.920\nThey might be in danger if they screw up.\n\n01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.280\nThey're in more immediate danger than they were before.\n\n01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:16.280\nCan we pull up an image of this Baldwin character\n\n01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:16.760\nwe're looking for?\n\n01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:19.360\nIs there a photo online of this guy that we can see?\n\n01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.760\nSo if we know we're looking for the right guy?\n\n01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.000\nYeah, you do that.\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.320\nHe looks like an aging bald man with glasses.\n\n01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.400\nDoes he look like one of those guys playing cards there?\n\n01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400\nNo, these are young dudes.\n\n01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.400\nThere's a 20-year-old orc and then a 20-ish-year-old human.\n\n01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.960\nAny kind of non-lethal?\n\n01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.040\nI got loads.\n\n01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.080\nI can knock them out with a stun bolt if you like.\n\n01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.040\nBoth of them?\n\n01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:47.240\nYeah, it's an area spell.\n\n01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:48.480\nStun bolt is not an area spell.\n\n01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.200\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.160\nStun ball, I mean.\n\n01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.240\nThere you go.\n\n01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:52.320\nStun ball, all right.\n\n01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.320\nYou think you can take two of them out with a stun ball?\n\n01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:57.440\nI mean, let's not waste my spells if we don't have to.\n\n01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.440\nIt drains a magician to use that stuff.\n\n01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.200\nDo you think we do that right away?\n\n01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.280\nI think it's worth it to try as hard as we can\n\n01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.400\nto go non-lethal.\n\n01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.920\nAnd I mean, we only see these two people.\n\n01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.960\nLet's try to stun ball them.\n\n01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.960\nAll right.\n\n01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:11.960\nYou sure?\n\n01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:16.120\nHold on, I'm getting a Sim sense.\n\n01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:17.240\nDo you boys need help in there?\n\n01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.920\nI have stealth.\n\n01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:23.600\nI can maybe help you out if you need some backup.\n\n01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.120\nAren't you at the front gate just flirting?\n\n01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.320\nI don't like it when you degrade what I do, but yes.\n\n01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.720\nYes, that is what I am doing.\n\n01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:33.280\nWell, stay there.\n\n01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.240\nKeep them occupied.\n\n01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.600\nNightblade, I also have an X-Shocker taser gun.\n\n01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:40.400\nIt's only a single shot thing, so I can't get them both.\n\n01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.800\nWell, if your stun ball is a ranged thing that\n\n01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.080\ncould stun two people, that's perfect for these poker players.\n\n01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:57.240\nI cast a, I harness, first of all, my combat spell casting.\n\n01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:03.480\nI touch my red feather earring and summon the spell casting\n\n01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.720\nfocus to increase my combat.\n\n01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.360\nAnd I throw a force three stun ball at the guards.\n\n01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.680\nAll right.\n\n01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.520\nWhat's your spell casting plus magic?\n\n01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.440\n11.\n\n01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.440\n11, huh.\n\n01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.160\nWhat do I get?\n\n01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.520\nDo I get a plus two for the spell casting?\n\n01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.040\nWas I added in?\n\n01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.520\nYes, so that'd be 13 all the time.\n\n01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:22.480\n13.\n\n01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.680\nErin asking, do you have just one earring?\n\n01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.600\nYes.\n\n01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.520\nWhich ear is it in?\n\n01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:28.520\nIt's my left ear.\n\n01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:29.000\nThank you.\n\n01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000\nMm.\n\n01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.480\nAll right.\n\n01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.320\nMeans to parties.\n\n01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.720\nMeans to parties.\n\n01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.800\nSo you fire off a stun ball.\n\n01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:36.800\nWhat did I do?\n\n01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:37.300\nAh!\n\n01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:37.800\nAh.\n\n01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:43.080\nAh.\n\n01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:47.760\nIt lands right in the middle of them, and it hits them.\n\n01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:50.960\nThey attempt to twist out of the way,\n\n01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.920\nand they take a lesser effect, and they\n\n01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:55.840\nend up taking some damage.\n\n01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.640\nHold on.\n\n01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.280\nThere better be an app with all of Jeff's different magic\n\n01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.080\nnoises in a human.\n\n01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.240\nThere better be.\n\n01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.520\nShe buried the lead on that spell.\n\n01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.520\nDo whatever!\n\n01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.520\nIt's a man of the sun ball I'm shooting.\n\n01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.360\nIt takes a lot out of you.\n\n01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.800\nOne of them goes down to the ground cold,\n\n01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.920\nand the other one seems to have dodged out of the way.\n\n01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.640\nRush him, Nightblade!\n\n01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.120\nYeah, when it's my turn, I'll use my science equipped Ares\n\n01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.320\nPredator 5 that's in my bionic arm.\n\n01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:28.200\nAll right, you got the surprise on him.\n\n01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.960\nSo what's your pistols plus agility?\n\n01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.600\nI mean, I'm assuming I'm not close enough to him\n\n01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.720\nto do anything non-lethal.\n\n01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:40.200\nLike, I have a stun baton, and I mean, that's about it.\n\n01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.600\nSo what's your agility plus pistols?\n\n01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.880\nWell, you're making me kill this guy.\n\n01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.920\nWell, you said you were firing at him with your gun, right?\n\n01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.840\nWell, I just wanted to make sure before I do that.\n\n01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.200\nI wasn't close enough to him to stun baton him, right?\n\n01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:51.600\nNo.\n\n01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.840\nYou have the element of surprise.\n\n01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.240\nI'm not.\n\n01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.040\nWell, not anymore.\n\n01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.320\nNow the stun ball's in play.\n\n01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.640\nAdam, don't heckle the gym.\n\n01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:04.920\nOK, so, OK, so you need to know my.\n\n01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.480\nAdam's real born on the 4th of July,\n\n01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:07.760\nright now, I read.\n\n01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.560\nI mean, shit's gone bad.\n\n01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.400\nIt's the first act of heat.\n\n01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.160\nNo, the cat's out of the bag.\n\n01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.160\nI've got a stun ball.\n\n01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.560\nI'll sleep like a baby tonight.\n\n01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:20.800\nOK, so you're looking for, sorry, one more time.\n\n01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:21.440\nI'm a little drunk.\n\n01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.560\nAgility plus pistols.\n\n01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:28.160\nAgility is five, and pistols is two parentheses plus two.\n\n01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:31.560\nIs there a shorthand for those numbers when it's two?\n\n01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.840\nWell, if it's plus two, then just add them all up.\n\n01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.640\nSo five plus two plus two would be nine.\n\n01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.320\nOK, great.\n\n01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.600\nCool.\n\n01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.520\nOoh.\n\n01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.560\nYeah, you plug them right in the face.\n\n01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.080\nWow, a little bit overkill, huh, Nightblade?\n\n01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:53.880\nThat's bat and cleanup.\n\n01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:58.040\nYeah, he gets shot in the face and goes down.\n\n01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.160\nEvery time you fuck up, casting the spell,\n\n01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:11.480\nthat's what it looks like as a human cost noted.\n\n01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.080\nI go up there and secure their weapons.\n\n01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.560\nAll right, you take two Ingram smart guns.\n\n01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:21.520\nI'm hyper-vigilant.\n\n01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.840\nI'm in a fucking PTSD fucking 360.\n\n01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.280\nMy heart's beating.\n\n01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.600\nYou see no one.\n\n01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:34.320\nOutside, Mercy and Hordegaard hear the report of a pistol.\n\n01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.280\nSilence, sir.\n\n01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.240\nOh, then they don't.\n\n01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.880\nI sense that something has gone down, and I'm checking in.\n\n01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:45.080\nDo you see crates?\n\n01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.800\nYeah, there's crates everywhere in here.\n\n01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.560\nIn the building.\n\n01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.840\nThis place is lousy with crates.\n\n01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.080\nYes, yes.\n\n01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:56.520\nYeah, you don't see anyone else in the room that you're in.\n\n01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.840\nAre there any doors that we see along the walls?\n\n01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:01.160\nThere's a door to the east that's\n\n01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:03.360\nleading presumably out of the building.\n\n01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.000\nThere's a door to the south.\n\n01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.520\nWe should check these trucks.\n\n01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.760\nOK.\n\n01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.480\nI mean, I will.\n\n01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.040\nYou go ahead.\n\n01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.120\nI'm going to go up.\n\n01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.920\nThere's one door that's presumably leaving at the loading\n\n01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.600\nblock or what?\n\n01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.080\nYeah.\n\n01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.040\nAnd then the other one looks like it might be an interior room.\n\n01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:19.800\nYep.\n\n01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:21.720\nI go to that door and take out my endoscope\n\n01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.600\nand put it under the door to take a look around.\n\n01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:24.240\nYou do that.\n\n01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:27.320\nYou see three large machines that look like they're\n\n01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.760\nproducing something.\n\n01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.200\nYou don't know quite what from your low angle.\n\n01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.360\nYou also see a concrete barrier that blocks your vision\n\n01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.200\ntowards the right.\n\n01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.080\nIt's kind of the only things you can see are those two things.\n\n01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:40.400\nMachines and a barrier.\n\n01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:41.320\nOK.\n\n01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.320\nI report that over to Nightblade.\n\n01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.000\nWhat's in those trucks?\n\n01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.240\nOh, go check these trucks.\n\n01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.280\nThey're full of crates.\n\n01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:50.400\nThe crates are sealed shut.\n\n01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.800\nBoxes and boxes.\n\n01:59:51.800 --> 02:00:01.800\nWhat was it Nabokov said?\n\n02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:08.400\nPackage is just a package for a package.\n\n02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.360\nI got a door over here at Nightblade\n\n02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.640\nthat I can't see the whole situation in here.\n\n02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:24.400\nI said we come in their guns of blazing.\n\n02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.240\nI load my gun with stick and shock bullets.\n\n02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.760\nYou do that.\n\n02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:31.760\nWell, hold on.\n\n02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:39.440\nSo the cheeky peas up front talking to these three guys.\n\n02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.800\nIf we take out those three guys, then she can come in.\n\n02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.680\nIt's like we've got the whole yard covered, right?\n\n02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.320\nWe can all, like maybe we should take those guys out\n\n02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.560\nat the South Gate.\n\n02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.000\nWell, can I try just talking to them and see what happens?\n\n02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:52.480\nYeah.\n\n02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.560\nSee if I can get in.\n\n02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.560\nOK.\n\n02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.560\nI will choose to come in.\n\n02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.240\nI will choose to approach as cover.\n\n02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.680\nYeah, keep their attention.\n\n02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.880\nYou see if you can get all three of them\n\n02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:04.040\nto be talking to you, all facing you at the same time,\n\n02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:06.800\nnone of them facing north.\n\n02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.920\nAll right.\n\n02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:18.600\nI positioned myself south.\n\n02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:19.600\nI'm so sad.\n\n02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.920\nI just got the worst news.\n\n02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.840\nI'm so sad.\n\n02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:30.560\nI'm so weak.\n\n02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.320\nThe clean, shaven guy comes over to you and is like,\n\n02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:38.640\nwhy are you weak?\n\n02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.040\nOh, my son that I was meant to meet here, I guess,\n\n02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:49.360\nhe was killed by one of those dirty shadow runners.\n\n02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.480\nSome shadow runner was on a run.\n\n02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:58.000\nAnd my son was standing in the way.\n\n02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.120\nAnd I'm so sorry to ask this, but I've\n\n02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.920\nbeen going to this cyber therapy that's,\n\n02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.440\nmy cyber therapist told me that the only thing that could\n\n02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:15.600\ncalm me down was three men, one with two hands on my head\n\n02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.000\nand the other two with two hands on either arm.\n\n02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.840\nAnd this is so embarrassing.\n\n02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.520\nBut if you could please just touch me.\n\n02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.520\nPlease.\n\n02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:28.600\nHe touches you.\n\n02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:32.680\nCan you ask your friends to also touch me?\n\n02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.240\nAnd just listen to me.\n\n02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:36.120\nI guess I can do that.\n\n02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:36.600\nThank you.\n\n02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.640\nI'm so sorry.\n\n02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.840\nThis is so embarrassing.\n\n02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:43.080\nI am some distance away, but I am holding my rifle poised.\n\n02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.000\nAnd I am looking for an open shot,\n\n02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.880\nshould an opportunity present it.\n\n02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.840\nOK, yeah, there's some shots open.\n\n02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:57.480\nDo I see the, I want to leave the warehouse through the,\n\n02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.720\nis there, if I go towards the south,\n\n02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.840\nis that where the south gate is?\n\n02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:04.240\nNo, if you go towards the south, that's towards the door\n\n02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.520\nthat he's peeking through.\n\n02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.040\nBut that'll put us out towards the gate, right?\n\n02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.720\nNo, that's an interior door.\n\n02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.600\nOh, I'm looking to go toward Aaron.\n\n02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.480\nAll right.\n\n02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:16.320\nMercy.\n\n02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.240\nYou came in through the ceiling.\n\n02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.240\nRight.\n\n02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.040\nWhere we are, are there any?\n\n02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:22.520\nSouth gate is to the south, right?\n\n02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.520\nAre there any businesses near?\n\n02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.880\nYeah, but it's outside.\n\n02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:27.600\nAre there any businesses that we saw on the way over here\n\n02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.120\nin the Uber?\n\n02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:30.920\nNo, they're all destroyed.\n\n02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:33.920\nThey're just like destroyed, bombed buildings and stuff.\n\n02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.520\nOK.\n\n02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.400\nAll right, I tried to find an exit from the warehouse.\n\n02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.160\nOK, a different exit?\n\n02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:40.040\nYeah, OK.\n\n02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.640\nA one that provides me egress from the warehouse itself.\n\n02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.880\nThere's the loading dock.\n\n02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.280\nThat's where the trucks came in.\n\n02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:46.880\nIt's open.\n\n02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.960\nSo that's where Eve is?\n\n02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.360\nNo.\n\n02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.080\nNo, I'm in another door.\n\n02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.160\nI'll come with you over there.\n\n02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:55.960\nOK, let's try the loading dock.\n\n02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.960\nDo we know if there's dudes there?\n\n02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.400\nThere aren't any dudes there.\n\n02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.640\nAll right, so I'm just trying to get to the south gate.\n\n02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.040\nIf you exit the loading dock, you'll see a path,\n\n02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:08.160\na winding path, which leads you straight to the gate.\n\n02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:10.760\nYou will also pass a storage unit,\n\n02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:14.200\nso perhaps you would be careful and perhaps check that out,\n\n02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.560\nbut usual priorities.\n\n02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.360\nAll right, all right.\n\n02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:20.960\nYou exit the loading dock, and you\n\n02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:25.480\nsee the three guys touching Mercy, who's on the floor in pain.\n\n02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:27.440\nWhat's the range?\n\n02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.240\n200 feet.\n\n02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.240\nAnd they're back to us?\n\n02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:33.920\nYeah.\n\n02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:34.560\nAll right.\n\n02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:37.600\nTime to fucking like.\n\n02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:40.120\nCan we synchronize so that we shoot at the same time?\n\n02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:40.520\nMm-hmm.\n\n02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:43.960\nWe have to make sure that Mercy ducks and gets out of the way.\n\n02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.080\nWell, she's out of the shot.\n\n02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:46.760\nShe's on the ground and stuff.\n\n02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:47.600\nOh, she is.\n\n02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:48.720\nI think.\n\n02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:51.200\nI am.\n\n02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.600\nYou collapsed, yeah.\n\n02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:59.200\nWhat's an objective way of picking dudes?\n\n02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.320\nSo you can't do like 3 o'clock, 12 o'clock.\n\n02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.520\nHow do you go?\n\n02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.640\nThe two of you are together.\n\n02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:06.960\nYou both look at each other and say, I'll take this one.\n\n02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:08.280\nI'll take that one.\n\n02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:14.160\nI am not with you, so I will take the one that is remaining.\n\n02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:20.760\nSpencer, can I say to the gentleman, thank you.\n\n02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:22.360\nI know this is such an inconvenience,\n\n02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:26.720\nbut if the three of you, this is the way my therapist explained\n\n02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:30.680\nto me, it was the way that this ended, if the three of you\n\n02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:33.640\ncould just turn towards each other,\n\n02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:37.040\nand I will walk away symbolizing me walking away\n\n02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.320\nfrom my pain.\n\n02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:42.120\nIf you just for a moment can link and just stare at the ground,\n\n02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.920\nit will take just 30 seconds or so, and I thank you so much.\n\n02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:49.760\nAnd if I ever meet you again, I promise I'll\n\n02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:52.880\nbe generous with my kindness.\n\n02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:53.840\nLock and load, guys.\n\n02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:56.080\nLock and load.\n\n02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:56.960\nYou're already fine.\n\n02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:00.840\nJust have each of them hold between one and three fingers up.\n\n02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.240\nIt's too lengthy a process.\n\n02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:09.240\nWe'll take care of it.\n\n02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:11.960\nI'm just wanting to get away from the situation,\n\n02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:12.920\nso they're just standing there.\n\n02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.360\nAll right, we'll go with Hortagum's plan.\n\n02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:20.880\nI'll just kill whoever I can, and he'll kill whoever.\n\n02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:24.160\nWe'll just start killing people.\n\n02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.560\nI'm using stick and shock on mine,\n\n02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:27.680\nbecause I prefer non-lethal if I can.\n\n02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:31.160\nWell, OK.\n\n02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:33.040\nAll right, if you want to go up there and cut\n\n02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.920\nthose throats when they're down.\n\n02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:35.560\nI can't.\n\n02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:37.360\nIf I could get close, I would stun Botanum.\n\n02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.920\nI don't like to kill people.\n\n02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:42.960\nThe one you stun, I will take out.\n\n02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.360\nI'm not stunning anybody.\n\n02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:45.560\nI'm not going to get that close.\n\n02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:48.960\nI'm going to shoot them in the head with my gun.\n\n02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.560\nI feel like, but could they really\n\n02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.160\nkill all guards at once, find out next time?\n\n02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:00.160\nThank you, everybody.\n\n02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.160\nAll right.\n\n02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.760\nJamorge Brown, thank you so much.\n\n02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:09.560\nErin McGathy, Spencer Crittenden, Jamal,\n\n02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.640\nthank you for coming up.\n\n02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:17.680\nI'm Jeff Davis, Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.\n\n02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:20.360\nNext week, there'll be music for Shadow Run.\n\n02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:21.760\nIt's going to be very exciting.\n\n02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:24.360\nIf you want to know whose music we played tonight,\n\n02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:26.360\nI'm assuming there's somewhere you can go, right?\n\n02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:29.360\nYeah, we'll post that online on the website,\n\n02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.360\nand we'll make sure everybody knows about the music.\n\n02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.360\nYeah.\n\n02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.360\nDid you get any of that?\n\n02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.360\nIt's a good show.\n\n02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.360\nFeral Audio.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[185781]}
