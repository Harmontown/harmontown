{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.000\nI have some very good news for you guys, the apartment town is now in session.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:50.000\nWill you join me in welcoming the mayor of the apartment town, Mr. Dan Harmon?\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:57.000\nWhat on earth?\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:09.000\nJesus, Jeff, take it easy.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nTake it easy?\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nFor the podcast listeners out there.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:23.000\nDan Harmon emerges from the shadows with no shirt on and a camera on his head.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:34.000\nHe has a GoPro camera strapped to his head and a stomach that clearly has been off its diet for the last two weeks.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:40.000\nThat is a comment that would hurt the corporeal, Jeff, but I am man-transformed.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:52.000\nI have been on a 20-day tour. I am now in the cradle of American civilization, Portland.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:05.000\nI am in the basin, the hot tub, the bath, the belly button, the voodoo doughnuts of the United States.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.000\nAre you going to get into the whole show with no shirt and a camera on your head?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nI don't know, Jeff. I probably tell you. I don't know.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nI don't know, Jeff. What do these people do for a living?\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:21.000\nAre they industrial or do they make art? Are they teachers? It's Portland.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:26.000\nWe do what the fuck we want, Jeff.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:31.000\nWe are activated humanity.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:37.000\nI truly hope that somebody, at least one person's here tonight, has no idea what Harmontown is.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:45.000\nMy favorite is, like I said, the couples who come because their underage son or daughter couldn't come to the show.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nThey just came to get a community DVD signed.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nIt's like two 40-year-old men and women coming up to me after the show and going,\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:57.000\nHi, could you just make it out to Rachel? What the fuck was that?\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:58.000\nLook, here's the thing.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nYou got no shirt on.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm almost certain that's illegal. You're not allowed to come out here with no shirt on.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nYeah, we did get almost arrested in Vegas when I did this.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:11.000\nBut I think that's because you're not supposed to sing Sassudio at karaoke.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:17.000\nThe reason I'm doing this, Jeff, is because I'm sitting back in the green room.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nWe're being given all these gifts.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:26.000\nPortland is the San Francisco of the Northwest.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\nCertainly.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nI think that's safe to say.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nThe culture is high. Everyone's practically a lesbian.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd they don't give a shit, and they're friendly about it, too.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:46.000\nPeople that aren't lesbians are still just welding shit and calling it art.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nThere's a mental and cultural health here, Jeff, that is,\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:56.000\nif there is a place that we're going to call Harmontown that is earthbound, it would be here.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:04.000\nI apologize to our friends back home in Los Angeles.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nI apologize to our friends we're going to talk to in San Francisco.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nYou know I love San Francisco, too.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nBut here's the thing. We came in here.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:17.000\nThere's people showering us with someone made Spencer special copper dice.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nYeah, really cool like that.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:26.000\nSomeone made us all t-shirts. By the way, this might be a good time to give me my shirt.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nNo, Dan, do the whole show like that.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nI need to be mic'd and stuff.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.000\nI wanted to participate in their fucking artistic abandon.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nI want to be a Portlandier.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nSomebody made me this pin.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nIt's just a pin with a tie on it, which I love.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nPaul, are you out there, Paul?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nYeah.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nThank you, Paul, and Noel, thank you.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.000\nAnd then somebody made me a tie with Adidas stripes on the tie.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nYeah.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nAnd on the back, because this is Nike Town.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nI got a Sharpie shirt. Someone made this.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nSomeone made Spencer a shirt.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:05.000\nThere was a guy, like Portland's version of the obnoxious guy that tries to zig when he should zag.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nLike any other city, like there's always a guy that's like,\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nwell fuck this, I'm not going to be a fan.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nI'm going to impress the hell out of this guy by telling him to go fuck himself.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\nThe Portland's version of that guy printed up like,\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:22.000\npolitical literature about getting me recalled as mayor of Harmontown.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:27.000\nIt's filled with material.

Let's all just hang out, play board games.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nNice.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:37.000\nAnd fly kites and just like run around in Portland.

Ron Hubbard into a kind of like Philip Seymour Hoffman master,\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:37.000\nkind of like Tom Cruise, Magnolia kind of like vibe where I was like, this is how you\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nfeel.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:43.000\nLike, everyone would go, eh, it's funny if it's a joke and he's fatty, stupid.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nHe's fired from comedian.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nBut if we started to worship Spencer, it would never get abused.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nAnd also, God needs a hobby.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nIf that hobby was Dungeons and Dragons, all of life's rules would be consistent.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nAll of the randomness would be die rolls.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:03.000\nAnd we would all have character sheets.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd everything, we could all level up consistently or die and be resurrected as other things.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nIt all works.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:15.000\nAnd I think that based on his freestyle rapping, like, Spencer may be actually God.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nLike, he could be like God on earth.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd it makes sense to think about everything you know about Spencer, our dungeon master.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nHe appeared out of nowhere.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nWe don't know anything about him.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nHe raised his hand in the audience and said, do we need a dungeon master?\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nAnd he went, I'm a dungeon master.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:43.000\nAnd he came that night not knowing that you were going to say that, but he came with the idea,\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nI have to drive from Simi Valley to Hollywood, which I never did.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nSomeone needs a dungeon master.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nBecause I want to play D&D with Dan Harmon.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nHe came that night and you asked him to come up.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nYou can listen to the podcast.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\nIt's recorded where he just appears out of nowhere and goes, I am a dungeon master.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nHe wears shorts in the snow.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nThat's another God-like quality.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nHe's the best freestyle rapper ever.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nHe can rap about dinosaurs.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nHe can rap about...\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nAlso, he's very bashful.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nHe's a shy guy.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nHowever, he's the most unflappable person on stage.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nYou can't tamper with Spencer.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nHe has a...\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nAnd this is where it gets kind of Christ-like, where it's like half God, half man.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nOr Hercules, if you're offended by the Christianity thing.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nIt's like, it doesn't matter.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nThe idea of half man, half God, has existed forever.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nGoogle it.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:41.000\nHe is relatable because you can access him, but he's incorruptible at the same time.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nHe's separate from us.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nWe talk about love.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nHe's like, I love.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nLove is for people.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nI'm not a people.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nHe kind of disagrees with everything.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nYou take him to a bar and he goes like, I've been to four bars.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nIt's not really working.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nAnd he went off to a garden somewhere and he can't like...\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nLet's bring him out.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nLet's bring God out.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nYee-haw!\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nYeah.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nNo, it's a program.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nIt's like Toby Keith would...\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nYeah.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nAll right.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nWell, I'm proud to have Spencer.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nAsk my Lord and God.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:25.000\nStars and Mars and Americas and dice rollin' hard.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:31.000\nWell, with those chickens, sheites come a terrorist icing me.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:37.000\nI'm going to refer him to Spencer and have him get a critical hit for me.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nHe's got a beard and he's not on a cloud.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nHe's down here playin' D&D.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:48.000\nSpencer is my God, America, you and me.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:54.000\nSorry, it's not a good song, but...\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nToo much.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nToo much.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nI like it.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nHe likes it.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nHe likes it.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nAm I on?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nYeah, it sounds good.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nAll right.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\nHow's it going, guys?\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nHey, hey.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:13.000\nSpencer, I'm being attacked by a mankind...\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nBy Toby Keith.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:23.000\n...approaching you in a shirt that can only be described as tight and ill-fitting.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:30.000\nThe blue and black plaid screams out, trying too hard.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:37.000\nWith a lilting voice and a pin that plugs his Denver-based eye-heart of this barbecue\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nand grill, whatever the fuck that place was.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.000\nHe starts to play a song about a red cup or some shit.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nThat's all.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nThat's all I got.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nAll right.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nYeah.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nThat's one.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:55.000\nAgain, the references, you know, not my forte.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nCan we get our mics up a little bit?\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nAt least in the monitor, please?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nSound guy?\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nCheck one, two.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nShit.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nThere we go.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nYeah, Portland.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nNice city.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nWhat's up with your mics?\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:13.000\nWe like everything else, but mics are a little cold.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nI can't really see anybody except people in the front row.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nHave you been to Portland before, Dan?\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nYeah, I've been to Portland.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:25.000\nI spoke at this thing, this XOXO festival.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nIt was like six months ago.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nI came here.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nI hung out with Adam Savage from Mythbusters.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nOh, shit.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nDamn.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nAte a sandwich with him.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nVery lukewarm applause for Adam Savage.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:40.000\nMore important than that, did someone boo him?\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nCan you imagine someone coming?\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nGod, bust too many myths.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nNo, he doesn't.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nJamie Hinderman busts the myths.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nHe's fucking hanging on for dear life.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nYeah, that's what it is.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nJamie's doing all the fucking heavy lifting on that show.\n\n16:54.000 --> 17:00.000\nI am actively endeavoring to bust the myth of our lack of friendship between me and Adam.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nI told him as much.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nI'm sure he never gets that.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nAre you guys pals?\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nI'm trying to make it happen.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nAre you a fan of that show?\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nWell, I saw like six episodes of it a long time ago.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nYeah.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nAre they still doing them?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nYeah.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nJesus.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nI think that show busts the myth that they're funny.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nBecause they keep doing sketch comedy and it's the worst.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nPlease stop asking those fuckers to do sketch comedy.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nJust tell me the facts.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nBust a myth.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nDon't do sketch comedy.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nDon't dress up like ninjas and be like,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:34.000\nWho's the 20 fucking guy that always hurts himself?\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nTori.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nTori, what a cunt.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:42.000\nHe's like, yeah, I'm a ninja.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:47.000\nJust fucking just build something and don't be a dick and fucking get on with it.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nAll right.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nWell, all right.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nYeah.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nToby Keith.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nJimmy Buffett.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nFuck it.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nTori from fucking myth buzzers.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nFuck him.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nJeff.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nYeah.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nWe are in the Nike capital of the country.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.000\nNike?\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nFuck Nike.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nDoes anybody work at Nike?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nNo.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nNo, because Nike.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nIt's just an office and it's just like there's a PO box.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:21.000\nYou have to be a 14 year old girl from Kuala Lumpur to work at Nike.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nBut you can become CEO.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nOh yeah.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:30.000\nThere's no glass ceiling there.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:35.000\nWell, I thought that because we were trying to sponsor our show with Nike earlier.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nWe gave Nike a chance and they dropped the ball.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:41.000\nWe tried to cattle one.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nWhat the hell's going on over there?\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nNo, they're just ordering nothing.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nThere's ordering, ordering, ordering us to be distracted.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nWhat are you looking on your phone right now for?\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nI wanted to check and see.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nDid you get a text?\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nWhat's going on over there?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nI just wanted to make sure I didn't make any notes and I sure didn't.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nI don't know.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nNo.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nNope.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nJust hanging out in Portland.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nHope this gets better.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:11.000\nI have to say about Portland, without a doubt, is one of my favorite cities I've ever been\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nto in the world.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:16.000\nPortland is the fucking graveyard.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.000\nVery strangely, you guys take food very seriously here.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:26.000\nBut even simple things, like a grilled cheese is better here for some reason.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nSpeaking of...\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nOh.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nYeah, we're not drinking cattle one tonight.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nIf we go through a city that has their own local vodka and it's decent, we're drinking\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nhouse spirits.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nIt's a Volstead vodka, right?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:44.000\nVolstead, named after the act that prohibited alcohol for what?\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\n15 years?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nHow long was the prohibition?\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\n20 years?\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\n15?\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\n20 till what?\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:51.000\n33.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\n33?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\n13 years, yeah.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nSports Corner!\n\n19:54.000 --> 20:00.000\nOh my God, everybody keep clapping until I find the music for it.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nOh my God.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nI don't know where it's at.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nOh my God.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nSports Corner.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nHello, Portland Oregon.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nIt's Sports Corner time with Dan Harmon.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nHe loves sports.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nI know you do too, because you're Harmontown fans.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nIf anything says sports, it says Harmontown.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nNike, brought to you by Nike.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nNike, we're racists.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nHey, Dan, how about those blazers this year?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nFinally.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nFinally.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nYeah, you can hear it in the crowd.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nThe blazers have really turned it around.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nWhat do you think they came from and where are they headed?\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nWhat direction of the blazer is headed?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:47.000\nI like to think they come from Portland, but I make no assumptions.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:54.000\nThe free agent system being what it is, the new drafts, the second drafts, the third drafts.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nYou don't go into regionals with the team you want.\n\n20:56.000 --> 21:07.000\nYou get the team that you get, and I think Coach Norfolk, he knows how to pick the winners\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nat the beginning of the draftable season.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nDo you think it was a mistake to bring Steve Nash in after the injury?\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:17.000\nSteve Nash's injury was, to me, largely cosmetic.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:31.000\nIt's no big deal, we're just summoning a giant moth.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nShe protects us.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nIt's going to seem like a monster, but when Godzilla gets here, you'll be thankful.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:44.000\nDan, I know this is a hot button topic for you, especially because you love soccer so much.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nThe timbers versus the sounders.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nThe Cascadia Cup is coming up in a couple of days.\n\n21:50.000 --> 22:02.000\nI've always said timbers, sounders, Jeff, I say merge them together, put them into a timbersounder.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:11.000\nBut until the league allows us to do that, timbers are an offensive team and the sounders are defensive.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:19.000\nIt's always been the way it is since the 40s going through Jacobson and all the way through Landgraf,\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:24.000\nGreenblatt, and all those coaches.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nThe only Jewish soccer coach in MLS history.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:34.000\nHis famous, this is a team, speech.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:39.000\nI know you're a big Greenblatt fan, can you give us some of the Jewish coach speech?\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:44.000\nWho can forget him saying, this is a way to kick a ball.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nThis is a way to kick a ball.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:50.000\nYou don't throw, you don't write.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:57.000\nJust a smidge of offense is always the best defense, but what do I know?\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nDan, next season, coin toss. Who do you like? Ducks or beavers?\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:06.000\nI'm telling you beavers for sure, for only one reason.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:13.000\nYou've got a front line that's amazing, they're always there ahead of the back line.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:21.000\nThey know how to charge forward and gain that valuable footage and yardage and stack it against.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:28.000\nThey keep the knees iced, they keep the defense on the point and they flank correctly.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:32.000\nI can't tell you how many of that sports, particular teams...\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nWhich of the two schools do you like?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:38.000\nThe schools of thought regarding the sport that we're talking about?\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nWhich university do you like the most between Ducks and Beavers?\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nI think that...\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nAre you saying which...\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\nI'm just asking you to name one of the schools.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nA University of Portland, I think.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nUP, UP.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:59.000\nUP, they've got it tied up in a ribbon.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:04.000\nOK, Sports Corner with Dan Harmon.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nSomething happened after the Mothra attack, we're ringing out now.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nI kicked a chord and it all held broke loose.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nI kicked a chord.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nAnd I liked it.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:23.000\nWho's in pain tonight?\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:26.000\nI don't say I'm pancreatic. No, that's fine.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nI don't know why I would adjust. Don't come up and be a pancreatic cancer.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nWe don't want your bullshit up here.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nWho's in transitional, emotional...\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nYou're moving tomorrow?\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nI had one back up there.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:43.000\nIt's hard for me to see from up here.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nIs that a gal? What's your name?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nAlma.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nAlma, get up here. Alma, everybody.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nIf you want to, if you want to come up.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:56.000\nI learned in either Madison or Minneapolis,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nI can't remember which, that we got to remember to say,\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nwould you like to come up here?\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nSo that if they're assholes, you get to ask them,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nwhy did you come up here?\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nI made the mistake.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nI got in the habit of like, get up here.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nAnd then a guy was like, hey, I'm an asshole.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nAnd I was like, why are you being an asshole?\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nHe's like, you told me to come up here.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nAnd I kind of didn't have a...\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:22.000\nHello, Alma.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nHello.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nHello.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nSo you're in a transition in your life?\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nI am.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nWhat kind?\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nIn fact, well, I just started a new job recently.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nCan you give us details?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nI work at a bakery. I'm a baker.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nThat's your new job?\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nYeah.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nIt's not that awesome bakery with the windows where you can look in.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nI walked past one from my...\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nWere you on Alberta?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nI should have more information for you.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nThere are a lot of bakeries that do that.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nI do have a fish bowl at my bakery.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:50.000\nI could smell cookies everywhere.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nIt's like, why is it cooking?\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nIt's midnight.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nAnd then I walked past this place and I looked in the window and there was...\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:57.000\nThere's just bread, loaves of bread going everywhere,\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nlike little trolley cars and...\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nThat doesn't sound like my bakery, unfortunately.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nOkay.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nIt sounds fantastic.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nAnd yours, the bread just sits there like a...\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nLike in a big pot of bread.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nWell, I mean, it's well displayed.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nIt's not open to the public.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nBecause we're like peering in.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nIt's displayed.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nIt's just...\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nAnd I sell pastries, lots of pastries.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:19.000\nSo that's your new job?\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nIt's the new job.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nYeah.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nI just started it in December.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nAnd your old job was...\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:28.000\nI worked at a food cart where I made grilled cheese sandwiches,\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nbut that job ended back in June.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:31.000\nRight.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nSo it's been a long...\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nOh, so really it was...\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nThe pain was about the period of unemployment.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nYes.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nDid you collect unemployment?\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nNo.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nDid you know that you can?\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nI didn't.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nI didn't.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nIt's the way that I became unemployed.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nIt's causing me...\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nOh.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nPhysical pain as well.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nI was injured.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nOh.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nInjured.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nLike in a food cart?\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nNo.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nRegrettably.\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nWhat?\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nThat would have been more often.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nOh, you get injured off duty.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nYeah.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nWell, what happened?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nI got hit by a cement lamppost.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:10.000\nIs that your revisionist way of saying you walked into a lamppost?\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:13.000\nBecause those don't tend to move around a lot.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:18.000\nI got stabbed by a lamppost seven times.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:21.000\nA fire hydrant kicked my foot.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nYou mean you're an alcoholic?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nNo.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nThat's what you mean.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nI mean, Alma, what...\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nLampposts are fucking vicious.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nI got attacked.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nNo, explain what happened.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:37.000\nSo, I was at a park on the 4th of July and some friends of mine were there\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nand they had a slack line.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nDo you know what slack lining is?\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nNo, no.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nI do.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nExplain to them.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nAll right.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nSo, it's kind of...\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:45.000\nThat's 40 bucks downtown, right?\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nYeah.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nSo, it's...\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.000\nI saw somebody poop in your chest, right?\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nIt's a...\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nOkay.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:59.000\nI mean, if you want, I...\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nWhat is slack lining?\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nSlack lining is...\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:05.000\nSo, you've got a nylon rope similar to what we'd used for climbing.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nAnd you set it up between two things.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nAnd in this case, we're setting up really low to the ground.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nSo, no higher than this.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nOkay.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nKnee level.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nKnee level?\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nOkay.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nYeah.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nAnd so, we were at a park and we were like, hey, let's play with the slack line.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nSo, okay, we'll set it up.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nAnd the two trees that we picked were too far apart.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nSo, somebody else said, hey, lampposts, let's try that.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nBut wait, I have to stop you.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nBecause what are you doing with the rope?\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nSorry.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:29.000\nYou walk across.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:30.000\nYou took it like a tight rope walker.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nMoreness.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:32.000\nInstead of tight, it's slack line.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nYeah.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nOh, wait, wait.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nSo, it's like an entertainment thing?\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nLike a performance?\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nYeah.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nYou do a tight rope act?\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nWell, in this case, we're just fucking around.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nRight.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nWell, no.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nBut yes, you could do it for entertainment.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nThere's a movie.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nThe name which I can't remember.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nThe subtitle is Flight of the Frenchies.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nAnd they're doing something similar.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nBut that's way more extreme.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nMan on a wire.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nWell, I don't think that's.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:58.000\nThe subtitle, Flight of the Frenchies and Man on the Wire.\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nMaybe not.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nYou're doing a tight rope act.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nYou're fucking around, which is entertainment, whatever.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:04.000\nOkay.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nWe're all on the same page now.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:09.000\nSo, the idea is that you have to have a little bit of tension on the line or you can't walk\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\non it.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nIt's useless.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nThere's a little bit of tension on the line.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nAnd I'm standing.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nSo, if this is the tree, that's the lamppost.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nI'm standing right about here.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nAnd the lamp, it just set up.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:22.000\nAnd we're just figuring out if it's tight enough to walk on.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:25.000\nAnd one way I put his foot on it and it gets right off because something is wrong.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nAnd I'm looking at him over here.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:30.000\nAnd you're kind of where my boyfriend is standing.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nHe's going to like, he shouts my name.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nI turn and I look and the lamppost is right here.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nI do.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:41.000\nYou found one of Portland's many scandalous fake lampposts that they had stalled to get\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:47.000\nall that, you know, nearly blind grant money.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:53.000\nThere was like, they found like a bunch of like, in the 70s to the 90s, like New York\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:59.000\nhad like a whole shitload of fake fire hydrants that they just put that they did not have\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nwater underneath them.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nIt had to do with like city funding or something.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nAnyways, look it up.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nI'm one of those guys that goes, I read this, but then you'll look it up and it's all bullshit.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:12.000\nBut anyways, a concrete lamppost comes crashing down on you.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nAnd where did it hit you?\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.000\nIt hit me right here.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nOn your head.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nAnd then it hit you right here.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nLike a lamppost is like a million.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nIt's enormous.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nAnd it has a lamp.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nIt's everything.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nSo here's what happened.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nThe lamp hit me here and then gave me this little laceration right up here.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nOn her head.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nShe's pointing to her head.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nIt's a podcast, Alma.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nCome on.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\nShe's pointing at her head.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nShe's pointing at her head.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:37.000\nSo right in the middle, like right on the top of my scalp, it's like an inch long or so.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nThey had to close out with staples.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nOh, damn it.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nAnd then you went home and you explained to your mom.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nShe's like, what were you doing?\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nWhat's the lamppost?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nI called my dad from the hospital.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nHe's like, what?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nWere you fixing a lamppost?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nNo, dad.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nI was slack roping.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nAnd I wasn't even on the line.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nLike that's the really distressing thing.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nLike I was just standing there.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nAre you, is there any like hangover from that?\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nIs there any like lasting injury to that?\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nYeah, I'm still, that's where the pain's coming from.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.000\nI have a mid-foot spray and that is yet to heal.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:14.000\nLike I had a broken ankle and stitches and surgery and nonsense and bad things and like\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nsix months on it.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nNone of this is covered by insurance, I assume.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nI would not.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:26.000\nIf I was an insurance company, I would say you tether a lamppost and pull them down as\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:30.000\npart of your ad hoc clown act at your own peril.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:35.000\nWhen that goes wrong, it's force majeure as far as we're concerned here at Allstate.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.000\nThat is also what the city said.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:43.000\nI mean, but simultaneously I think only in Portland, coolest city in the world.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nPeople shouldn't do that more often.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\nAnd you totally should.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nThis is not a cautionary tale.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nDo go slack lining.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:52.000\nDon't use a lamppost, but do go slack lining because it's a lot of fun.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:55.000\nI would have thought those things were like deep into the ground.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:59.000\nThere was a whole lamppost high thing that like dropped it in.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nNo, no.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:01.000\nOh, no.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:05.000\nThey're designed to pop right off if you hit them in a car.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nOh.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nSo it's like Grand Theft Auto.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nYeah.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nWait, they're designed to break?\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:15.000\nYeah, like if you hit a tree, tree stays put.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nIf you hit a lamppost, lamppost's gone.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nBut I guess the trade-off is that you're alone.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nThat's our first commandment.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:30.000\nWe're slowly going to compile a religion here.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nOh, no.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nI think God talks like a caveman.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nYeah.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nYeah.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nTime limited.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nHit tree, tree stays put.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nHit lamppost, lamppost's gone.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:41.000\nKilling people bad.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nDon't be a dick.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nFuck off.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nAll right.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:51.000\nSo because you sustained that injury, the food cart that you worked for was like, go fuck yourself.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nI had recently left them.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:59.000\nI had a two or three-week period plan where I was going to take a week or two off in the summertime,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nhave fun, and then go to work at a different food cart.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nAnd in between is that's when the accident happened.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nOh.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:13.000\nAnd so I'm still looking at bread go by on a conveyor belt, thinking about what you used to be.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nIt's actually not that set.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nRight now I'm just getting to the happy part.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nWe're on the upswing now.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:21.000\nFinally, I have a degree in baking, so baking is what I want to do.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nIt's what I love to do.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nSo you're not in a painful transition?\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nI am because my foot prevents me.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:30.000\nMy injury prevents me from doing more.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:35.000\nI'm working two days a week right now with the third training day, and I can't do any more than that.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.000\nYou're adjusting to life with someone who's not allowed to slack line?\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nI'm adjusting.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nYes.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nRight?\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nOkay.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nWell, that's Alma.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nAll right.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:45.000\nLet's have a hand for Alma for sharing her pain.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nAlma.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:52.000\nIs there, well, just one more question.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:56.000\nLike, if there's anything that you could do, it doesn't stop at slacklining, right?\n\n33:56.000 --> 34:04.000\nLike, what would you do if you could do anything?\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nEverything.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nOh.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nAll right.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:11.000\nInspiring, but boring.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nThat's fine.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nIt's a fine, healthy answer.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:14.000\nI guess that would be mine too.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nIt would be a long fucking walk.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nI'd go for a fucking bike ride.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nAll right.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:22.000\nAlma, the slackliner who would do everything.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nAll right.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:30.000\nWe're going to, Alma, we're going to do your, you can go eat some pita bread, and we're\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:36.000\ngoing to, we're going to do a movie for Alma.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nOkay.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nI've been having some success with this.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:42.000\nI want to do, like, Alma's, like, life story, I guess.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:52.000\nIt's, it's called, uh, slackliner, slackliner.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nAlma?\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nHoney, it's time to get up.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nDad.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nYes.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nAlma, come on.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nIt's time to get up.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nBreakfast is ready, Alma.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nDad, I was dreaming.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nDreaming about what?\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:06.000\nMore of that slackline?\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nDoor comes down.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:14.000\nListen, you come from a long line of tight liners.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:17.000\nWe keep our lines taught.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:23.000\nIf I find you walking on a line that is not taught, what have I told you about non-taught\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nlines?\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nWhat have I always told you?\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nYou don't give, uh, the slack...\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nWe're going to break an ankle doing that shit.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nYes.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nBut you had a saying about it too.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.000\nAll right.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:39.000\nSo I'm going to go back to work at the, at the, uh, lamppost factory.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:42.000\nHe just doesn't get me.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:43.000\nAll right.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:50.000\nI'm going to, I'm going to do my last day of work at the, uh, food truck.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nAlma?\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nYes.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nYou're fired.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nWhat?\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nBut I've been...\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.000\nNo.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nYou're fucking, you're fired.\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nYou, I, I...\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:00.000\nYou guys keep moving the truck.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:01.000\nI can't find you.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nIt's called the food truck.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:04.000\nYeah.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nIf it, if it, if it didn't have wheels, we'd call it a restaurant.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:08.000\nThis thing has wheels on it.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:13.000\nAlso, I found out yesterday that you served some cheese that wasn't grilled.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:17.000\nWhat have I told you about grilling cheese?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nIt must be grilled.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nOr, or you're breaking ankle.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nYou're cruising for a bruise, Alma.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:25.000\nYou're fired.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nYou just like my dad.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nFuck you.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nStupid truck.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:34.000\nI'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to get a job at a place\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:39.000\nthat is almost identical to a food truck, but without the truck part.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.000\nOh, wait.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:43.000\nLook at this giant loaf of bread rotating around those buildings.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nBonjour, ma cuisine.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nOh, hello.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nWelcome to my bakery.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nWould you like a job?\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nHey.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nYes.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:57.000\nAre we fair enough?\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nMy, my name is Alma.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:00.000\nAlma what?\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:03.000\nAlma bitches?\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:14.000\nIt's, it's a, it's a French joke.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nForgive me.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nYeah.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nYeah.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nRight.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:21.000\nOkay.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nYou're hired because I like your sense of humor.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.000\nBe careful.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:25.000\nToe the line.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nDo not do anything different than the rules state.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nNo, you're going to break an ankle.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:30.000\nHey, I'm, I'm fine.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:31.000\nI'm fine.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:34.000\nI've got, I've got two good feet and a brain ready to do everything.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.000\nLater that night.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nHey, Alma, how's it going?\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:38.000\nWhoa.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.000\nHey Sasquatch.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nHey.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nIt's Yeti.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nAnyway, that's cool, man.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.000\nIt's Portland fucking deal.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:45.000\nYeah.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:51.000\nIf I had a dollar for every one of my friends that was named after the mythical abominable\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:52.000\nsnowman.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:56.000\nHey, look, man, Alma, I know that you come from a long line of top liners, but me and\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nwe're going to go fucking slack landed later on.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nIt's not for me.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nIt's not for me.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:02.000\nEveryone's doing it.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nThe line is less taught Sasquatch.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nNo way.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:09.000\nWe're going to tie off to the, we're going to, your father worked at the lamppost mill.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nWe know that those are going to be sound instead.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nHe's also a tight liner.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nI know.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nWe're going to slack line on it, man.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nIt's less taught.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.000\nThere's less tension there, man.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:21.000\nI mean, even girl thought balloon.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:25.000\nMy dad is a tight liner and he makes a lamppost.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nI have so lonely.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:32.000\nI want to fuck Sasquatch so bad.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nListen, I'll just check it out and see what it looks like.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nLook, man, I'll tie it off.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:41.000\nLook, I'll come over to, man, this is one of your dad's lampposts.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nI'm going to tie it off.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:46.000\nOh, by the way, if you cross this, I'm going to fuck you so fucking hard afterward, man.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nWell, it's, you know, let's anchor it up, but not too tight.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nHey, careful.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nDon't break your ankle.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:57.000\nAll right, Sasquatch.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nWell, you test it out.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nThat's good.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:05.000\nOh, my head.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:12.000\nKubrickian unconscious scene.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:16.000\nNot a montage, but like a sequence.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nThat's the word I lost.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:22.000\nKubrickian unconscious sequence.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nTight liner.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nSlack liner.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:30.000\nThat's my dad dressed as a loaf of bread.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nBonjour.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.000\nHe's French.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:36.000\nYou're all going to break everybody's ankles now.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:39.000\nBut there's a monkey on the other side of the room.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nHello, I'm a Sasquatch.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:44.000\nWow.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:47.000\nThe monkey and the Sasquatch and the bread.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nEverything's the same.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nHoney, honey, wake up.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nIt's your father.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:53.000\nDad.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nHi.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:55.000\nYou were having a...\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:56.000\nThe door goes down.\n\n39:56.000 -->

51:45.000\nfrom the trees\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nto the bushes\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nto the rocks\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nEverything\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nis

Jesus Christ.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:24.000\nI was told by Morgan, our tour manager, that I need to announce that after the show we're going to the Lucky Labrador across the street.\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:25.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:35.000\nAnd that's where Spencer and I will be selling merch and where you can buy prints and t-shirts and Dan and Jeff will sign them only $50 a signature.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:36.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:40.000\nI'll sign anything you buy and also you don't have to buy anything.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nI'll sign, I'll sign

--> 55:58.000\nAlso, Spencer and I have a special kissing booth where you can stand in the middle and we'll kiss your teeth.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.000\nAnd watch them kiss, they will kiss each other.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nAlright, Spencer, can we get our character sheets please?\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:04.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nSpencer's passed that down to...\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:09.000\nSpencer's now dispensing the character shirts.\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:10.000\nYeah, shirts.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:11.000\nSpencer, get us up to date.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:18.000\nWould you please, in the campaign, when we last met, the party was still trapped in the confines of the Infinifish.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:25.000\nAfter taking out a lung and returning to where Quark had countered the kidney, the party took on the massive ordnance and the spidery spark...\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:26.000\nAh, fuck.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:29.000\nAnd the spidery sparks guarding it.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:37.000\nThe kidney was eventually destroyed and the gang pressed on through a thicket of fleshy cords, sliding down a slimy slide to a pink flat form.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:38.000\nFuck.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:43.000\nAt the bottom, they fought a tricky slime in case in which was a book.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:49.000\nAnd after slicing and dicing the bloody slime, Sharpie was able to retrieve said magical toe.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:54.000\nThe only way out appeared to be a large sphincter on the floor.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:57.000\nWhat would they do?\n\n56:57.000 --> 57:04.000\nI think I've said this before, but it would be so handy to have Spencer, like, in your day-to-day life as an alcoholic.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:08.000\nYou went to the drawing room and started doing shots of Ferdinand Branca.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:11.000\nYes, you left your credit card there.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:16.000\nAt about 3 p.m. Geno came by and you ended up going to the LA Zoo.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:20.000\nSearching for your wallet, do you realize?\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:24.000\nIf you get a text from Margaret, don't answer it.\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:25.000\nMargaret?\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:26.000\nYeah.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:27.000\nAlright, so now...\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:28.000\nThat's why.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:38.000\nI'm gonna say, just to start things off with a fun note, I'm gonna just take a foot through that sphincter on the floor and see what goes.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nJust the one foot?\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:41.000\nListen, you know what?\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:46.000\nI'm gonna run and I'm gonna go like a long jumper.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:52.000\nOne, two, and then I'm gonna put my hands up on my head and I'm gonna feet first to go through the sphincter on the floor.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nBut what are you gonna do in D&D?\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:55.000\nHuh?\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nNice, nice.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nDon't just snap.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:00.000\nJust snap.\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nAt what time is it appropriate?\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nI just saw these t-shirts over here.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:05.000\nWhen do we bring those up?\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:06.000\nIn a bit.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:07.000\nIn a bit.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:08.000\nAlright.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:09.000\nYes.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:10.000\nWow.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:16.000\nDan Harmon fucked my mama and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:20.000\nAll my mama got was these lousy herpes.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nNo, they're great herpes.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:23.000\nNo, they're great.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:26.000\nBaby, babe, they're great herpes.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nThey're weaponized.\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:35.000\nAlright, so I do a one, two, three, and I make myself like, I go feet first through the sphincter on the floor, Spencer.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:36.000\nBloop.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:41.000\nYou swiftly slide through the sphincter and find yourself in a small chamber.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nIn front of you is a meat curtain.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:47.000\nYou sense something powerful and dangerous behind.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:51.000\nOh man, is this gonna be like the Indiana Jones thing, but it's a turd, like, rolling?\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:54.000\nCause you're obviously in a colon, right?\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nYou're running from a round ball.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nI'm looking at a meat curtain, yeah.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nSo what are my surroundings?\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nYou're just in a small area.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nIt's pretty closed off.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nYou just flew through like a giant sphincter.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:15.000\nOkay, I do a cartwheel and do a round off.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:23.000\nAnd as I round off, I try to round off through the meat curtain so that when I emerge through the other side of the meat curtain, I go like,\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nTa-da!\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:29.000\nSo I do a cartwheel and then tuck and then do a round off and I land.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nI go through the meat curtain.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nOkay, so cartwheel, tuck the knees.\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:34.000\nYeah.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:35.000\nRound off.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:36.000\nRight.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:37.000\nMeat curtain, ta-da.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:38.000\nRight.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:39.000\nOkay.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:42.000\nI'm upside down doing the tuck as I go through the meat curtain.\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:48.000\nAnd ideally, I would round off and be facing whatever I'm facing at the other side of the meat curtain.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nWell, you attempt that.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nAll right.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nYour shoulders get stuck in the meat curtain.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nNo!\n\n59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nYou fall unceremoniously outward.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nShould have done five more round offs.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nI fall where?\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nInto a largest room.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nOh, so I've gone through the meat curtain.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nYou can see through the meat curtain.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nI wouldn't say you're entirely through it.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nBut I'm in a largest room.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nYeah, and you're also like falling on the ground from failing your cartwheel maneuver.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nOkay, then I just crawl, like army crawl, hand over hand through the meat curtain into the greater room.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nThe room is littered with flabby tubes and arteries.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nThe walls are covered in web-like lattices of veins and strands of fibrous tissues.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nYou can see a large throbbing heart standing in the center of the room.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nHanging from the ceiling are two orange orbs of tissue, perhaps some sort of nerve cluster or other thing.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nTwo flabby tubes reminiscent of slag might stand up straight, near by the heart.\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nFlabby tubes, he was an actor in all those old John Wayne movies, right?\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nYeah, no, it's terrible what happened to him.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nThe studio system really victimized him.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nHey, you can go into that heart, are you?\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nThere's gold in there.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nThe famous story is that flabby tubes murdered that kid, but it was all, it's not true.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nWalt Disney murdered the kid and blamed it on flabby tubes.\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nI hollered a Sharpie and Mulraine and said,\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nHey guys, I think I found the heart and possibly two nerve clusters. Get on in here.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nOh, is he coming back up through the sphincter?\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nNo, I hollered.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nDid the sound carry through meat curtains?\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nYou hear the faint, squelchy sound of Quark's voice coming through the sphincter.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nDoes it sound like he's saying, don't come down here, I'm being digested by a sphincter?\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nOr does it sound like he's maybe saying data in the goonies, hey, I found another room?\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nYou hear, it sounds like he mentioned something about a heart.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nOkay, well, I jumped down through the sphincter.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nYou can jump through the sphincter, you can leave your friends behind,\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000\ncause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance, they're not friends of mine.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nSphincter dance.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nNo, no, don't fucking clap for that shit.\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nDon't reward that.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nIf you don't give a shit about the goonies reference, then fuck the safety dance.\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nJust let me sit up here and die in front of you of old age.\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nLet me turn into Mount Rushmore.\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nNo, no, no, don't.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nSherby, you can't just go through the sphincter, you have to cartwheel through the meat curtains\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nand then army crawl through the rest of the meat curtain.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nI actually want to use that stick that you gave me that has the button on it.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nI'm gonna put the stick through the sphincter, so to speak,\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nand then slide down it like a fireman's pole.\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nBecause I pressed the button.\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nIs this because you went to the embers today?\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nEmbers is awesome, the fish tank bar.\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nWe didn't have a big fight, but it's cool that there's fish in the bar\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nand then inevitably someone's gonna go, oh, those fish aren't being taken care of.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nLike, come on, but they're in a bar.\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nIt's a tranny bar, right?\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nYeah, but the fish don't know that.\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nI don't think anyone was like, oh, these trannies are a bad influence on the fish.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nThey're gonna start dressing up as snakes.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nYeah, it's a drag queen, they have drag queen shows, yeah.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nBut this was during the day, they're open at like 11, you can go sit there and it's like beautiful\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nand they're gonna fish tank bar.\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nEmbers, I enjoyed it.\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nI didn't want to feel bad for the fish, I thought the fish were, there's goldfish,\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nthey're a robust species of fish.\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nAnd the whole bar is a fish tank.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nThat means that the fish are over here and they could go all the way to the end of the bar.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nIf you were a fish, they came from a lake.\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nNo, they didn't come from a lake.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nNo one from Embers goes out in a raincoat like a Vandy Camp Spisherman and catches,\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000\noh, another goldfish for the bar.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nThey're boring in a goddamn paper cup at a carnival.\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nAnd the ones that get adopted by the drag queen from Embers are like,\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nthey're the luckiest fucking goldfish in Portland.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nAnd they pour them in there and the fish are like, what's happening?\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nAnd it's like a Pixar movie, Albert Brooks comes up and goes like, holy shit, you wouldn't believe it.\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nThere's a whole bar.\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nAnd then every once in a while, yeah, someone crashes through the top of the bar because they get angry\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nand then probably a fish gets crushed, but at least there's no turtles eating them.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nOkay, at least there's no turtles.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nAll right, so I'm waiting for my friends for the meat curtains.\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nYou see a staff poking its head through the sphincter and then the meat curtain.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nChubby! Hey!\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nI'd recognize that.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nWhat's up?\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nThis shitty dude.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nI grab on to the end of the staff and pull him through.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nIt's stuck.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nWhat?\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nOh, I'm sorry, let me press that button.\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nYou pull it.\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nYou know, Sharpie, are you on it or are you already through this one?\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nOh, boy, stickler over here.\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nIt's important.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nAll right, I... God damn it.\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nYou can just pick one. It's fine.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nAm I on the pole or what?\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nYeah, did you already come through on the pole or is he pulling you through now?\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nI wanted to slide through this picture.\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nOkay, yeah, well, that happens.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nAnd then, okay, so you slide through.\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nHey, what happened?\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nI got it.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nMulraine, press the button and come through.\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nYeah.\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nOkay.\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nAll right, so you slide through.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nNow you're there.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nNow you grab the thing.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nNow it's grabbed.\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nGot the staff.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nYou guys threw the door.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nYou guys cut it in a cartwheel.\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nI wanted to do something cool.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nAll right, so what are our surroundings now, Spencer?\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nAm I there?\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nYeah, you're there now too.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nHey, guys.\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nHey, good to have you back.\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nSo what do we see now?\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nYou're in a room.\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nNo, so I explained the heart, right?\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nSo there's a giant throbbing heart.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nHanging from the ceiling are two orbs of orange tissue,\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nperhaps some sort of giant nerve cluster.\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nI said that already.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nThere's the two flabby tubes.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nThey're venting noxious gases in the colors of green and orange.\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nAnd you can also see a few tentacles\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nwaving around nearby the ground.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nIn the center of the room,\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nyou can see that ice stalk that you encountered earlier.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nShit.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nAnd it begins swaying ponderously.\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nGentlemen,\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nare we trying to destroy the fish,\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nor should we just want to leave the fish, right?\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nWell, I think...\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nWe have to kill it.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nYeah, I would say.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nBut if we kill it, are we going to fall down into nothing?\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nYeah, but...\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nI used my far sword attack.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nHere's my plan about that.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nWhile they're fucking mulling shit over,\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nbecause I'm a barbarian,\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nI swing my far sword as hard as I can at the heart.\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nAt the heart itself, right?\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nYes.\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nOkay.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nAh, you miss.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nFuck everybody.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nYour far sword goes wide,\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nand rather than hitting the heart,\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nit instead strikes a tentacle.\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nIs that good?\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nIt's better than not hitting anything,\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nor hitting yourself in the foot.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nI remove...\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nYou deal seven damage.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nAll right.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nI remove two...\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nThe arrows!\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nOh, she did?\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nShe...\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nAnd as I'm pulling them out,\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000\na sparkle from my eye catches Quirk's eye.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nAnd I pull back, and I shoot my arrows.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nAt...\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nAt adventure!\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nThat doesn't...\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nAt the heart.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nAt the heart.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nAt the heart.\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nYou shoot two arrows at the heart.\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nSpenser V arrows.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nYeah, V arrows at the heart.\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nI'm listening.\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nBoth of them strike the heart\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\ndirectly in its center of mass.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nYay!\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nSpink dirt battles.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nDealing six damage.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nSix, six.\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nYeah, six damage.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nThe eye ball plays wonderfully.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nThat's some Seattle shit right there.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nI just randomly thought maybe they had a rivalry with Seattle.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nI do.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nI do.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nI was really tired today,\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nand I think for a half an hour,\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nI thought it was literally in Seattle,\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nand I met someone, and they're like,\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nyeah, I'm from like an hour north of Seattle.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nI was like, all right, so an hour away?\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nYou're in Seattle?\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nPerlin's way better, though!\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nIt was Eddie better.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nYou know, is it?\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nWow.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nI thought he had something in his mouth.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nCouldn't understand it.\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nOh, you just gotta go to voodoo donuts\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nand do some slacklining.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nThe tentacles shoot out of the floor\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nand grapple you.\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nThey wrap themselves around your legs.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nYou feel as if you can't move.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nAt the same time, the ponderous eyeball\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nsways and its eye turns purple,\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nand it looks directly at Sharpie.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nWhat?\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nSharpie.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nI go like this.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nLike what?\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nIt seems like an impressive response.\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nAs you make your excited and cool maneuver,\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nyou feel a haze come over you,\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nand all of a sudden you feel the presence\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nof several enemies surrounding you.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nI've been charmed against you guys.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nUse some magic.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nNo, I've...\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nYeah, use some magic.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nYou're a mage.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nOh, can I resist it?\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nNo, you can fight the enemies you see.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nNo, I don't want to fight my friends.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nYou do, that's the thing, though.\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nYou can tell me that I want to fight them.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nI've watched you go through this with Cheth.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nOkay, you cast Scorching Ray.\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nIt hits.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nDealing eight damage.\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nEight damage.\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nEight damage.\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nThat's like fucking some average shit.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nSome bend Oregon kind of style.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nThat was some Eugene shit.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nThat was some Medford style bullshit.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nWhat's Medford style?\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nMessed on now, no.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nI know, what do you want from me?\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nI just want the old Dan back.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nWhy don't you take your shirt off?\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nTake your shirt off.\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nTake your shirt off.\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nSave it, save it, save it.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nI said take your shirt off.\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nOh, take my shirt off, okay.\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nAll right, so whose turn is it Spencer for fuck's sake?\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nYou see those orange things I mentioned earlier\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nfrom the ceiling.\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nThey're shaking wildly and\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nshaking a violent red powder onto you.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nIt's making you guys sick.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nYou feel kind of sick to your stomachs.\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nI go into, I use Power Attack.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nOne of the orange sacky things.\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nThey're pretty high up.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nYou'd have to jump to hit them.\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nI run and I first jump off of Mulraine's shoulders,\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nthen onto Sharpie's shoulders,\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nand then jump as high as I can and swing my sword\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nat one of the orange sacks.\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nTaking a few steps back to prepare your charge,\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nyou leap forward, catapulting yourself\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\noff the back of the half-elf.\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nYou leap high into the air and swinging your sword\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nin a wide arc.\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nYou slice cleanly at the cord,\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nholding the dangling nerve cluster.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nIt falls off and falls to the ground\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nand explodes into a pile of dust.\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nNever had a lesson.\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nNever had a lesson.\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nYou hear the beast give an unearthly shake around you\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nas well as a long, far-off wail\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nas if it were in immense pain.\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nOh, we're close, you guys.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nSomebody attack the other nerve cluster.\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nI take out my longsword and, yeah.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nZip.\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nI take out my longsword.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nIt looks great.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nAnd I attack the other nerve cluster.\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nWell, it's too high up.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nWell, you're too high up.\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nYeah, I am.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nI jump.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nOkay.\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nI jump off Sharpie's back.\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nI jump off Sharpie's back.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nOkay.\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nSuper cute style.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nAll right.\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nOr would it be better to do arrows, Spencer?\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nIt would be better to do arrows to hit things far away.\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nIs it too late?\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nThe question is how many arrows should she shoot?\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nSix.\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nFourteen.\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nWell, I mean, I don't want to be a bad D&D player.\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nI did already say that I have the sword.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nIt's true.\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nJumping off your friend Sharpie,\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nyou launch yourself at the nerve cluster.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nYou get right up to it and pulling your sword from its holster.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nYou swing in a wide arc.\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nHowever, it misses and you tumble to the ground.\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nBoom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bam.\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nTungent snap.\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nSame team.\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nThank you.\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nI will next time, ma'am.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nI will.\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nYeah, Vellison hasn't even followed you guys.\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nHe's just making sandwiches.\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nHe's back in the last area.\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nSharpie, finish him off.\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nSharpie, you shake off the effects of your charm.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nOh.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nI cast Buya.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nNo.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nSharpie, you attacked me.\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nI wasn't myself.\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nIt's like last night when we got in that fight.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nOver the straw.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nWhat was the straw fight about?\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nI handed her a Diet Coke.\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nI handed her a Diet Coke, right?\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nAnd she handed it back and the straw looked like an animal had mangled it.\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nIt looked like a child had chewed it all day.\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nIt was all twisted and I thought it was funny, so I went, what the fuck?\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nBut because I'm a professional entertainer, I wasn't smiling and laughing when I was like,\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nhey, what the fuck?\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nAnd she was ignoring me because she was round that bend.\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nThe fact that we had gotten Taco Bell should tell you what state we were in.\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nSo I just looked at the mangled straw and I went, hey, hey, what the fuck?\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nBecause I was, yes, ending the fact that she was an animal.\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nI was like, what's with the fucking mangled straw?\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nBut Dan, I think it's important to say that right before this happened, Dan was like,\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nI didn't get enough tacos.\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nSo I gave him my taco.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nIt's not important.\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nThat's like saying the sky is blue.\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nI never get enough tacos.\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nI always complain about whatever.\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nAnyway, you said what the fuck?\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nI didn't think it was a joke.\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nI thought you were starting a fight over a straw.\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nWell, you're starting a fight over a fight over a straw.\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000\nLook, I love you more.\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nNice.\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nOh, well, that was supposed to be cute.\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nAnd yet it wasn't.\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nYou're the best.\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nI cast magic.\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nWho gives a shit?\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nSorry.\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nI cast scorching rain.\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nThere's a ray.\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nIt's a scorching ray.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nIt's hotter than the cold ray, hotter than the sun.\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nI'm gonna scorch rain, and then we're done.\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nScorching rays gonna cast damage on these motherfuckers.\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nPortland got a scorching ray.\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nMotherfucker got a 4th fret winter cup.\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nWhat do you shoot it at?\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nYou gotta aim it at something.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nIs the eye stock still there?\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nThere is that eye stock.\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nYeah, fuck that guy.\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000\nThe guy that got me, the guy that charmed me.\n\n01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nAll right.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nYour

sir.\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nYou seem lumberjack style.\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nOur first dude of the night.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nRyan.\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nRyan, everybody.\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nA Portlandologist.\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nRyan.\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nGrab a mic.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nAll right.\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nSo Portland actually is named after Portland, Maine, off a penny flip.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nWho is flipping the penny?\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nSo two guys moved here, one from Boston, one from Portland,\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nand they both wanted to name it after their home cities,\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nand they flipped the penny, and it came up Portland,\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nand now that penny is in the museum.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nNo shit?\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nYou know the craziest thing about it?\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nBecause that was 1820.\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nThere was no one on the penny.\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nSo there was no...\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nPeople say that Portland just made it up.\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nBecause Abe Lincoln was just running around, he was in college.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nOne side just had the word heads.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nAnd the other side had tails.\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nJust said penny side one, penny side two.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nAnyways.\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nRyan, are you a local?\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nNo, I moved here four years ago to start med school,\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nand I'm actually moving away tomorrow because I just graduated.\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nOh, good for you.\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nCongratulations.\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nWhat kind of...\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nI'm a chiropractor.\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nSo kind of real medicine.\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nOh, fuck you guys.\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nSome like spine surgeon just booed you.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nChiropractor, boo.\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nWell, I went to a chiropractor for a while.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nI had to.\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nI have a terrible history of back pain in my family,\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nbut then I got one of those inversion tables.\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nThose are awesome.\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nDo your people...\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nThey don't recommend them though, right?\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nNo, the inversion tables are great.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nAnd you're out of a job.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nIt doesn't fix everything, it just helps.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nIt fixes everything, for me.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nI mean, it made me not have to go to a chiropractor ever again.\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nI mean, I don't care if you don't see me,\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nI just feel that if you get better, that's all I want.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nReally?\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nHugging him.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nI'm making up with chiropractors tonight.\n\n01:27:50.000

doesn't matter.\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nYo.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nIt's Ryan.\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nRyan.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nYo, yo.\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nRyan.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nRyan.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nBack pain.\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nRunning the rain.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nI'm going to feel the strength and heal myself with my pain.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nI'm going to bend over backwards for my lower lumbar.\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nI fucked your mama so hard she never comes so far.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nI fucked your mama until she had back spasms.\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nI fucked your mama and her pussy was a chasm.\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nThe sky dove down to its bottom.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nI fucked your mama so hard I started to feel it was a Gotham.\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nI didn't really want to rap, but I think that's what...\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nIt wasn't feeling it.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nI wanted to talk to Ryan for a little bit about Portland.\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nThat's why you brought him up.\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nI don't care.\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nWhen he played that song, it felt joyless and forced.\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nI liked it.\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nI thought it was good.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nThanks.\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nYo.\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nYo.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nYeah.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nI'm awful sorry I blamed my bad rap on you.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nI didn't mean to take a crap on you.\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nI came up to Portland to transform.\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nI fucked your mama so hard I needed chloroform.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nThat doesn't mean it was non-consensual.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nI fucked your mama good, but it was quite sensual.\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nI met her at a diner and said let's go out.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nI fucked her good and then she started to scream and shout,\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nbut not in protest.\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nEnjoy.\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nI fucked your mama and pregnant her and made a boy.\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nIt was you.\n\n01:29:27.000

Northwest.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nIt's such a cool town because the food is great and the booze is flowing.\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nI like the fact that the hoses are throwing.\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nIt's a weird thing.\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nHoses actually turn into bros.\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nAnd that's why the water always flows.\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nOh shit god damn it.\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nLet's get the pink ladies up here.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nThe pink t-shirt

far and near.\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nI fucked your mama till I generated a joyful tear.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nI did it in the Northwest.\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nFucked

sprayed.\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nOkay.\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nSorry.\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nAnd then I saw the droplets.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nDroplets.\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nNeed to shave.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nWicked Ryan spitting out of my face.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nI fucked your mama so hard.\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nHer shoe needed a new lace.\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nHer shoe came off her foot because I fucked it hard.\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nI fucked your mama until she had flubber for lard.\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nThey're the same thing.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nI went to sing, sing, and whoever came out and bring a thing.\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nI fucked up so bad.\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nI really want to rap better than I've ever have.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nI got three ladies in pink and I don't want to do so bad that I stink.\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nOne of them rap.\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nI'm

--> 01:35:02.000\nSpit and fire, blowing free is a stream.\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nI swear to God, I'm not thinking of anything I'm saying.\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nI really mean it.\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nI'm going to open my mouth and let it fly.\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nI'm going to be transparent so my eye is God's eye.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nJust want to say this is the best city in the world.\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nI'm sorry if I offended any boy, any girl.\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nKeep making sculptures and eating your weird hot dogs.\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nI want to fuck you so hard like a Lincoln log.\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nGo downtown, get into a taxi.\n\n01:35:27.000 -->

chiropractor named Ryan.\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nHe keeps crackin' my back.\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nHe's not a doctor.\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000\nHe's just tryin'.\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nHe went to medical school.\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nHe ain't nobody's school.\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nPink ladies smaggin' the mandolin.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nOh, Peter O'Toole.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nThat's probably not her name.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nI'm just tryin' to rhyme.\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000\nIt's the name of the rap game.\n\n01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nSpencer for hire up in his t-shirt.\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nI heard Portland was where they invented dirt\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nand took it down to Seattle\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nwhere they eat it because they're a bunch of human cattle.\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nThe Northwest is the place to be.\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nI fucked your mama so hard she turned into a bee.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nShe made some honey and I took it, put it on some bread.\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nAnd then I squeezed her little head.\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nAnd then the honey came out of her ears\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nand I turned it into a pale lager.\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nSome kind of beer and served it across the street\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nat that Labrador place with a little piece of taco meat.\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nThis is free and the health code is up to snuff.\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nI fucked your mama so hard that enough is enough.\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nI fucked your mama in her keys, in her purse, in her hat.\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nShe said, please, please don't do it anymore.\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nI've had enough.\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nIt feels abusive and misogynistic.\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nAnd I said, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nIt's just where my mind goes.\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nIt's because I love women.\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nI give them too much power\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nand then I try to take it back from them.\n\n01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nAnd so it comes off as rapey and creepy and gross.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nAnd we all know that that's how that works.\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000\nLike every man that you meet that seems abusive to you\n\n01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000\nand threatening to you, he's really just saying to you,\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nwhen I see you, I get intimidated by you.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nAnd then I'm trying immediately to counteract that\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nwith some kind of power attack.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nAnd meanwhile, you're just a girl going,\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000\nwell, he's bigger than me and so this feels really gross\n\n01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nand you're incompatible.\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nAnd then you end up going out with some beta male type\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000\nwho's equally psychologically inside out, like in different ways.\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nI know, I know.\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nYou don't have to tell me.\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nSo everybody just communicate with each other\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000\nand I fucked your mama's shoe.\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nCome on now to harm itself.\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nTurn the ground upside down.\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nHe is your boobish breath.\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nCome on now to harm itself.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nMotherfuckin' got a motherfuckin' rap rap.\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nMotherfuckin' got a rap.\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nShe's got a
