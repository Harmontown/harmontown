00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
I have some very good news for you guys, the apartment town is now in session.

00:21.000 --> 00:50.000
Will you join me in welcoming the mayor of the apartment town, Mr. Dan Harmon?

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
What on earth?

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
Jesus, Jeff, take it easy.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Take it easy?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
For the podcast listeners out there.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Dan Harmon emerges from the shadows with no shirt on and a camera on his head.

01:23.000 --> 01:34.000
He has a GoPro camera strapped to his head and a stomach that clearly has been off its diet for the last two weeks.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
That is a comment that would hurt the corporeal, Jeff, but I am man-transformed.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
I have been on a 20-day tour. I am now in the cradle of American civilization, Portland.

01:52.000 --> 02:05.000
I am in the basin, the hot tub, the bath, the belly button, the voodoo doughnuts of the United States.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Are you going to get into the whole show with no shirt and a camera on your head?

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I don't know, Jeff. I probably tell you. I don't know.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
I don't know, Jeff. What do these people do for a living?

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
Are they industrial or do they make art? Are they teachers? It's Portland.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
We do what the fuck we want, Jeff.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
We are activated humanity.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
I truly hope that somebody, at least one person's here tonight, has no idea what Harmontown is.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
My favorite is, like I said, the couples who come because their underage son or daughter couldn't come to the show.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
They just came to get a community DVD signed.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
It's like two 40-year-old men and women coming up to me after the show and going,

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Hi, could you just make it out to Rachel? What the fuck was that?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Look, here's the thing.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
You got no shirt on.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm almost certain that's illegal. You're not allowed to come out here with no shirt on.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, we did get almost arrested in Vegas when I did this.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
But I think that's because you're not supposed to sing Sassudio at karaoke.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
The reason I'm doing this, Jeff, is because I'm sitting back in the green room.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
We're being given all these gifts.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Portland is the San Francisco of the Northwest.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Certainly.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I think that's safe to say.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
The culture is high. Everyone's practically a lesbian.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
And they don't give a shit, and they're friendly about it, too.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
People that aren't lesbians are still just welding shit and calling it art.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
There's a mental and cultural health here, Jeff, that is,

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
if there is a place that we're going to call Harmontown that is earthbound, it would be here.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
I apologize to our friends back home in Los Angeles.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I apologize to our friends we're going to talk to in San Francisco.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
You know I love San Francisco, too.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
But here's the thing. We came in here.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
There's people showering us with someone made Spencer special copper dice.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, really cool like that.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Someone made us all t-shirts. By the way, this might be a good time to give me my shirt.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
No, Dan, do the whole show like that.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I need to be mic'd and stuff.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I wanted to participate in their fucking artistic abandon.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I want to be a Portlandier.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Somebody made me this pin.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It's just a pin with a tie on it, which I love.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Paul, are you out there, Paul?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Thank you, Paul, and Noel, thank you.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
And then somebody made me a tie with Adidas stripes on the tie.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And on the back, because this is Nike Town.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I got a Sharpie shirt. Someone made this.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Someone made Spencer a shirt.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
There was a guy, like Portland's version of the obnoxious guy that tries to zig when he should zag.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Like any other city, like there's always a guy that's like,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
well fuck this, I'm not going to be a fan.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I'm going to impress the hell out of this guy by telling him to go fuck himself.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
The Portland's version of that guy printed up like,

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
political literature about getting me recalled as mayor of Harmontown.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
It's filled with material. It's so dense.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I couldn't finish reading it all on the thing.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
There was like flyers. I think his name was Kyle.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
He had me sign a petition.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
About me, mine said Jeff Davis suit and tie?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
That's how heightened things are here.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Because it's the, I don't know, it's the ocean air.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It's the yogurt. What do they do here?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
They keep it weird here.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Portland is a fantastically weird and groovy.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
They keep it practical.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
They ask the question, why are we doing this society?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And if the answer is I don't know, they fucking drop it like a goddamn hot potato.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Why can't you park here? Fuck it, we can.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Who should I have sex with tonight?

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
I like Ted, but also David said, fuck it, I'm a lesbian.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm going to make love to a woman like she has never been made love to before.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And I'm going to run a local brewery.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And I'm going to be cool to straight guys because they're not a threat either.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
Like everything's fine. Let's all just hang out, play board games.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Nice.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
And fly kites and just like run around in Portland. I'm on fire here.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
You're the show.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Please, what can I do for you?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I heard dance take your shirt back off.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
God damn it, the more I heard about you, the more I loved you.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Don't choke up on the bat. Take that shirt back off, man.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Or take a shirt off and put your pants on as a shirt.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah, come on. We've been on the tour bus.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
If I take my pants off, it's going to get like uncomfortably clinical.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
In terms of laundry.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Rick Rapp, Rick Rapp, Portland, Portland Rapp.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm going to rap about Portland, Portland Rapp.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Bayside, it's a place in the Northwest.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I fucked your mama in her crotch and her chest up.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Came on her titties and said, that's enough.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I fucked your mama so hard she was like a box of snuff in old time Europe.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
George Washington, I fucked your mama so hard she was astonished.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Cross the Delaware, fucked your mama's underwear,

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
fucked your mama, fucked your mama in her pussy, Portland.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Whatever.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Now, now, thank you. You're very kind.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
You're good people. You're wonderful people.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Terrible rap. Tired of it, Jeff.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Transformation is what's going to happen tonight.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
We came out nearly naked because Portland, in our story circle,

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
if I haven't already transformed, then this whole tour has been for nothing.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
You've heard me talk about, oh, we must be dying here tonight.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We must be resurrected here tonight.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Portland is like the second to last stop.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
San Francisco's a gimme, whatever.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
San Francisco.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Fuck those guys.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It's the Portland, California.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
That's just nothing.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
That's practically, we could run to Los Angeles from San Francisco

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
if they start booing and we'll be home before they can catch us.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
It's a long run.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
This is the place where, across the return threshold,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
if I have transformed as a human being,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
then we're going to see evidence of that tonight.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
If I am no longer a caterpillar, tonight is where we see my wings.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
So I came out with my shirt off because I got nothing.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't know, I don't think I've been on a journey.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What do you feel like you should transform into?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I have an idea.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
I've been fighting the whole cult religious thing forever

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
because who would trust me?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But then it dawned on me today.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Okay, I was in the back, I was talking in the green room to Morgan,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
our road manager, whose relatives are in Portland.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
He spent, he had dinner with his brother.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
How's your family, Morgan?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Oh, my parents couldn't make it.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
My dad's meds, blah, blah, blah.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
What's wrong with your dad?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
His dad's got bone cancer.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Worst of the cancers.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
And cancer is the worst of the diseases.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
It's the Portland of diseases.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
No, it's...

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
No, no, no.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I mean, get up.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Meaning is the best.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
What Jeff means is that in disease world,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
in the monsters incorporated of disease world,

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
cancer is like high-fives people on the way

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
it's job of making people miserable in normal world.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
So he's right.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Cancer writes a bike and has a Zach Galifianakis beard.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Cancer is the Billy Crystal of diseases in disease world,

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
which is weird because Billy Crystal is the cancer of people in normal world.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
I just got that.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But I can't.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Thank God.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
You can't wear a camera in your head the whole time.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It constricts your head.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It's so...

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
All right.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
So I was saying, oh, Morgan, that's terrible.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Bone, bone, bone.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I heard that's the worst of them.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Like, it's...

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, pancreatic.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Well, pancreatic's the worst, but it's fast, isn't it?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
No.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
No? Okay.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
All right.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
All right.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't want to get cancer.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, I do want to get a cancer debate.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
That's fine.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm not shrugging that off.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
We can talk about cancer.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
But sir, at least admit this much.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It's bad to have bone cancer.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay, God.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Okay.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That's what...

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
I was in the green room having a conversation, and it was like, oh, our tour manager, his

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
dad, and boom.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And I just expressed it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
It was like, what is God doing?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
What is his end game?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
What's his problem?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Like, what's this guy's deal?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And Morgan's like, what do you mean?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
It was like, what's he doing?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
What's he doing to us?

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
And Morgan said, yeah, he definitely needs a hobby about God.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
God needs a hobby.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
He needs a hobby that's too focused.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Then it dawned on me.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Then it dawned on me.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Hobby.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Dungeons and Dragons.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Spencer is God.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I would go for that for sure.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
That's an acceptable religion.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Like, if I started to L. Ron Hubbard into a kind of like Philip Seymour Hoffman master,

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
kind of like Tom Cruise, Magnolia kind of like vibe where I was like, this is how you

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
feel.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Like, everyone would go, eh, it's funny if it's a joke and he's fatty, stupid.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
He's fired from comedian.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
But if we started to worship Spencer, it would never get abused.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And also, God needs a hobby.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
If that hobby was Dungeons and Dragons, all of life's rules would be consistent.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
All of the randomness would be die rolls.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
And we would all have character sheets.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
And everything, we could all level up consistently or die and be resurrected as other things.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It all works.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
And I think that based on his freestyle rapping, like, Spencer may be actually God.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Like, he could be like God on earth.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
And it makes sense to think about everything you know about Spencer, our dungeon master.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
He appeared out of nowhere.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
We don't know anything about him.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
He raised his hand in the audience and said, do we need a dungeon master?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And he went, I'm a dungeon master.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And he came that night not knowing that you were going to say that, but he came with the idea,

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I have to drive from Simi Valley to Hollywood, which I never did.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Someone needs a dungeon master.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Because I want to play D&D with Dan Harmon.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
He came that night and you asked him to come up.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
You can listen to the podcast.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It's recorded where he just appears out of nowhere and goes, I am a dungeon master.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
He wears shorts in the snow.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
That's another God-like quality.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
He's the best freestyle rapper ever.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
He can rap about dinosaurs.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
He can rap about...

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Also, he's very bashful.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
He's a shy guy.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
However, he's the most unflappable person on stage.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
You can't tamper with Spencer.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
He has a...

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And this is where it gets kind of Christ-like, where it's like half God, half man.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Or Hercules, if you're offended by the Christianity thing.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
It's like, it doesn't matter.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
The idea of half man, half God, has existed forever.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Google it.

13:28.000 --> 13:41.000
He is relatable because you can access him, but he's incorruptible at the same time.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
He's separate from us.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
We talk about love.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
He's like, I love.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Love is for people.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm not a people.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
He kind of disagrees with everything.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
You take him to a bar and he goes like, I've been to four bars.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It's not really working.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And he went off to a garden somewhere and he can't like...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Let's bring him out.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Let's bring God out.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Yee-haw!

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
No, it's a program.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It's like Toby Keith would...

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
All right.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Well, I'm proud to have Spencer.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Ask my Lord and God.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Stars and Mars and Americas and dice rollin' hard.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Well, with those chickens, sheites come a terrorist icing me.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
I'm going to refer him to Spencer and have him get a critical hit for me.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
He's got a beard and he's not on a cloud.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
He's down here playin' D&D.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
Spencer is my God, America, you and me.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
Sorry, it's not a good song, but...

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Too much.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Too much.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I like it.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
He likes it.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
He likes it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Am I on?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah, it sounds good.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
All right.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
How's it going, guys?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Hey, hey.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Spencer, I'm being attacked by a mankind...

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
By Toby Keith.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
...approaching you in a shirt that can only be described as tight and ill-fitting.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
The blue and black plaid screams out, trying too hard.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
With a lilting voice and a pin that plugs his Denver-based eye-heart of this barbecue

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
and grill, whatever the fuck that place was.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
He starts to play a song about a red cup or some shit.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That's all.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
That's all I got.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
All right.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
That's one.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Again, the references, you know, not my forte.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Can we get our mics up a little bit?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
At least in the monitor, please?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Sound guy?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Check one, two.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Shit.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
There we go.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah, Portland.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Nice city.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What's up with your mics?

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
We like everything else, but mics are a little cold.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I can't really see anybody except people in the front row.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Have you been to Portland before, Dan?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, I've been to Portland.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
I spoke at this thing, this XOXO festival.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It was like six months ago.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
I came here.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I hung out with Adam Savage from Mythbusters.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Oh, shit.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Damn.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Ate a sandwich with him.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Very lukewarm applause for Adam Savage.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
More important than that, did someone boo him?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Can you imagine someone coming?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
God, bust too many myths.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
No, he doesn't.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Jamie Hinderman busts the myths.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
He's fucking hanging on for dear life.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, that's what it is.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Jamie's doing all the fucking heavy lifting on that show.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
I am actively endeavoring to bust the myth of our lack of friendship between me and Adam.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I told him as much.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm sure he never gets that.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Are you guys pals?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm trying to make it happen.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Are you a fan of that show?

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, I saw like six episodes of it a long time ago.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Are they still doing them?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Jesus.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
I think that show busts the myth that they're funny.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Because they keep doing sketch comedy and it's the worst.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Please stop asking those fuckers to do sketch comedy.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Just tell me the facts.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Bust a myth.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Don't do sketch comedy.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Don't dress up like ninjas and be like,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Who's the 20 fucking guy that always hurts himself?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Tori.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Tori, what a cunt.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
He's like, yeah, I'm a ninja.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
Just fucking just build something and don't be a dick and fucking get on with it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Well, all right.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Toby Keith.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Jimmy Buffett.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Fuck it.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Tori from fucking myth buzzers.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Fuck him.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Jeff.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
We are in the Nike capital of the country.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Nike?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Fuck Nike.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Does anybody work at Nike?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
No.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
No, because Nike.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
It's just an office and it's just like there's a PO box.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
You have to be a 14 year old girl from Kuala Lumpur to work at Nike.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
But you can become CEO.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
There's no glass ceiling there.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, I thought that because we were trying to sponsor our show with Nike earlier.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
We gave Nike a chance and they dropped the ball.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
We tried to cattle one.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
What the hell's going on over there?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
No, they're just ordering nothing.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
There's ordering, ordering, ordering us to be distracted.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
What are you looking on your phone right now for?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I wanted to check and see.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Did you get a text?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
What's going on over there?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
No, no, no.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I just wanted to make sure I didn't make any notes and I sure didn't.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I don't know.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
No.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Nope.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Just hanging out in Portland.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Hope this gets better.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I have to say about Portland, without a doubt, is one of my favorite cities I've ever been

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
to in the world.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Portland is the fucking graveyard.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Very strangely, you guys take food very seriously here.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
But even simple things, like a grilled cheese is better here for some reason.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Speaking of...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah, we're not drinking cattle one tonight.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
If we go through a city that has their own local vodka and it's decent, we're drinking

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
house spirits.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
It's a Volstead vodka, right?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, I don't know.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Volstead, named after the act that prohibited alcohol for what?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
15 years?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
How long was the prohibition?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
20 years?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
15?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
20 till what?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
33.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
33?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
13 years, yeah.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Sports Corner!

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh my God, everybody keep clapping until I find the music for it.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh my God.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't know where it's at.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Oh my God.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Sports Corner.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Hello, Portland Oregon.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
It's Sports Corner time with Dan Harmon.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
He loves sports.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I know you do too, because you're Harmontown fans.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
If anything says sports, it says Harmontown.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Nike, brought to you by Nike.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Nike, we're racists.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Go fuck yourself.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Hey, Dan, how about those blazers this year?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
What do you think?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Finally.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Finally.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, you can hear it in the crowd.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
The blazers have really turned it around.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
What do you think they came from and where are they headed?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
What direction of the blazer is headed?

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
I like to think they come from Portland, but I make no assumptions.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
The free agent system being what it is, the new drafts, the second drafts, the third drafts.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You don't go into regionals with the team you want.

20:56.000 --> 21:07.000
You get the team that you get, and I think Coach Norfolk, he knows how to pick the winners

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
at the beginning of the draftable season.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Do you think it was a mistake to bring Steve Nash in after the injury?

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
Steve Nash's injury was, to me, largely cosmetic.

21:17.000 --> 21:31.000
It's no big deal, we're just summoning a giant moth.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
She protects us.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
It's going to seem like a monster, but when Godzilla gets here, you'll be thankful.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
Dan, I know this is a hot button topic for you, especially because you love soccer so much.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
The timbers versus the sounders.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
The Cascadia Cup is coming up in a couple of days.

21:50.000 --> 22:02.000
I've always said timbers, sounders, Jeff, I say merge them together, put them into a timbersounder.

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
But until the league allows us to do that, timbers are an offensive team and the sounders are defensive.

22:11.000 --> 22:19.000
It's always been the way it is since the 40s going through Jacobson and all the way through Landgraf,

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Greenblatt, and all those coaches.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
The only Jewish soccer coach in MLS history.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
His famous, this is a team, speech.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
I know you're a big Greenblatt fan, can you give us some of the Jewish coach speech?

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
Who can forget him saying, this is a way to kick a ball.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
This is a way to kick a ball.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
You don't throw, you don't write.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
Just a smidge of offense is always the best defense, but what do I know?

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Dan, next season, coin toss. Who do you like? Ducks or beavers?

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
I'm telling you beavers for sure, for only one reason.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
You've got a front line that's amazing, they're always there ahead of the back line.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
They know how to charge forward and gain that valuable footage and yardage and stack it against.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
They keep the knees iced, they keep the defense on the point and they flank correctly.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
I can't tell you how many of that sports, particular teams...

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Which of the two schools do you like?

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
The schools of thought regarding the sport that we're talking about?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Which university do you like the most between Ducks and Beavers?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
I think that...

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Are you saying which...

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
I'm just asking you to name one of the schools.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
A University of Portland, I think.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
UP, UP.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
UP, they've got it tied up in a ribbon.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
OK, Sports Corner with Dan Harmon.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Something happened after the Mothra attack, we're ringing out now.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
I kicked a chord and it all held broke loose.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I kicked a chord.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
And I liked it.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Who's in pain tonight?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I don't say I'm pancreatic. No, that's fine.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I don't know why I would adjust. Don't come up and be a pancreatic cancer.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
We don't want your bullshit up here.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Who's in transitional, emotional...

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You're moving tomorrow?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I had one back up there.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
It's hard for me to see from up here.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Is that a gal? What's your name?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Alma.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Alma, get up here. Alma, everybody.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
If you want to, if you want to come up.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
I learned in either Madison or Minneapolis,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
I can't remember which, that we got to remember to say,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
would you like to come up here?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So that if they're assholes, you get to ask them,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
why did you come up here?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I made the mistake.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I got in the habit of like, get up here.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And then a guy was like, hey, I'm an asshole.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And I was like, why are you being an asshole?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
He's like, you told me to come up here.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And I kind of didn't have a...

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
Hello, Alma.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Hello.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Hello.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
So you're in a transition in your life?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I am.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
What kind?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
In fact, well, I just started a new job recently.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Can you give us details?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I work at a bakery. I'm a baker.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
That's your new job?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
It's not that awesome bakery with the windows where you can look in.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I walked past one from my...

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Were you on Alberta?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I don't know.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I should have more information for you.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
There are a lot of bakeries that do that.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I do have a fish bowl at my bakery.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I could smell cookies everywhere.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
It's like, why is it cooking?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
It's midnight.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And then I walked past this place and I looked in the window and there was...

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
There's just bread, loaves of bread going everywhere,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
like little trolley cars and...

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
That doesn't sound like my bakery, unfortunately.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Okay.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
It sounds fantastic.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
And yours, the bread just sits there like a...

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Like in a big pot of bread.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, I mean, it's well displayed.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It's not open to the public.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Because we're like peering in.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It's displayed.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
It's just...

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
And I sell pastries, lots of pastries.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
So that's your new job?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
It's the new job.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I just started it in December.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And your old job was...

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I worked at a food cart where I made grilled cheese sandwiches,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
but that job ended back in June.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Right.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
So it's been a long...

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, so really it was...

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
The pain was about the period of unemployment.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yes.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Did you collect unemployment?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
No.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Did you know that you can?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I didn't.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I didn't.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
It's the way that I became unemployed.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
It's causing me...

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Oh.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Physical pain as well.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I was injured.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Oh.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Injured.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Like in a food cart?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
No.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Regrettably.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
What?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
That would have been more often.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh, you get injured off duty.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Well, what happened?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I got hit by a cement lamppost.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
Is that your revisionist way of saying you walked into a lamppost?

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Because those don't tend to move around a lot.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
I got stabbed by a lamppost seven times.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
A fire hydrant kicked my foot.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
You mean you're an alcoholic?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
No.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
That's what you mean.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I mean, Alma, what...

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Lampposts are fucking vicious.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
I got attacked.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
No, explain what happened.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
So, I was at a park on the 4th of July and some friends of mine were there

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
and they had a slack line.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Do you know what slack lining is?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
No, no.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I do.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Explain to them.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
All right.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
So, it's kind of...

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
That's 40 bucks downtown, right?

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
So, it's...

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
I saw somebody poop in your chest, right?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
It's a...

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Okay.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
I mean, if you want, I...

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
What is slack lining?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Slack lining is...

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
So, you've got a nylon rope similar to what we'd used for climbing.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And you set it up between two things.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And in this case, we're setting up really low to the ground.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
So, no higher than this.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Okay.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Knee level.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Knee level?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Okay.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
And so, we were at a park and we were like, hey, let's play with the slack line.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
So, okay, we'll set it up.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And the two trees that we picked were too far apart.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So, somebody else said, hey, lampposts, let's try that.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
But wait, I have to stop you.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Because what are you doing with the rope?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Oh, sorry.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Sorry.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
You walk across.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
You took it like a tight rope walker.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Moreness.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Instead of tight, it's slack line.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Oh, wait, wait.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
So, it's like an entertainment thing?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Like a performance?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
You do a tight rope act?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Well, in this case, we're just fucking around.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Right.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Well, no.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
But yes, you could do it for entertainment.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
There's a movie.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
The name which I can't remember.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
The subtitle is Flight of the Frenchies.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And they're doing something similar.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
But that's way more extreme.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Man on a wire.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Well, I don't think that's.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
The subtitle, Flight of the Frenchies and Man on the Wire.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Maybe not.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
You're doing a tight rope act.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
You're fucking around, which is entertainment, whatever.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Okay.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
We're all on the same page now.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
So, the idea is that you have to have a little bit of tension on the line or you can't walk

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
on it.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It's useless.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
There's a little bit of tension on the line.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
And I'm standing.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So, if this is the tree, that's the lamppost.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I'm standing right about here.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
And the lamp, it just set up.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
And we're just figuring out if it's tight enough to walk on.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
And one way I put his foot on it and it gets right off because something is wrong.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
And I'm looking at him over here.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
And you're kind of where my boyfriend is standing.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
He's going to like, he shouts my name.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I turn and I look and the lamppost is right here.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I do.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
You found one of Portland's many scandalous fake lampposts that they had stalled to get

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
all that, you know, nearly blind grant money.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
There was like, they found like a bunch of like, in the 70s to the 90s, like New York

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
had like a whole shitload of fake fire hydrants that they just put that they did not have

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
water underneath them.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It had to do with like city funding or something.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Anyways, look it up.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm one of those guys that goes, I read this, but then you'll look it up and it's all bullshit.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
But anyways, a concrete lamppost comes crashing down on you.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
And where did it hit you?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
It hit me right here.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
On your head.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
And then it hit you right here.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Like a lamppost is like a million.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
It's enormous.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
And it has a lamp.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
It's everything.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
So here's what happened.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
The lamp hit me here and then gave me this little laceration right up here.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
On her head.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
She's pointing to her head.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
It's a podcast, Alma.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Come on.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm sorry.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
She's pointing at her head.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
She's pointing at her head.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
So right in the middle, like right on the top of my scalp, it's like an inch long or so.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
They had to close out with staples.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Oh, damn it.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
And then you went home and you explained to your mom.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
She's like, what were you doing?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
What's the lamppost?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I called my dad from the hospital.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
He's like, what?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Were you fixing a lamppost?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
No, dad.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I was slack roping.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And I wasn't even on the line.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Like that's the really distressing thing.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Like I was just standing there.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Are you, is there any like hangover from that?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Is there any like lasting injury to that?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Yeah, I'm still, that's where the pain's coming from.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
I have a mid-foot spray and that is yet to heal.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
Like I had a broken ankle and stitches and surgery and nonsense and bad things and like

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
six months on it.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
None of this is covered by insurance, I assume.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I would not.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
If I was an insurance company, I would say you tether a lamppost and pull them down as

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
part of your ad hoc clown act at your own peril.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
When that goes wrong, it's force majeure as far as we're concerned here at Allstate.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
That is also what the city said.

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
I mean, but simultaneously I think only in Portland, coolest city in the world.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
People shouldn't do that more often.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
And you totally should.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
This is not a cautionary tale.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Do go slack lining.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Don't use a lamppost, but do go slack lining because it's a lot of fun.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
I would have thought those things were like deep into the ground.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
There was a whole lamppost high thing that like dropped it in.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
No, no.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Oh, no.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
They're designed to pop right off if you hit them in a car.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Oh.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
So it's like Grand Theft Auto.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
That's interesting.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Wait, they're designed to break?

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, like if you hit a tree, tree stays put.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
If you hit a lamppost, lamppost's gone.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
But I guess the trade-off is that you're alone.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
That's our first commandment.

32:23.000 --> 32:30.000
We're slowly going to compile a religion here.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Oh, no.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I think God talks like a caveman.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Time limited.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Hit tree, tree stays put.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Hit lamppost, lamppost's gone.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Killing people bad.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Don't be a dick.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Fuck off.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
All right.

32:45.000 --> 32:51.000
So because you sustained that injury, the food cart that you worked for was like, go fuck yourself.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I had recently left them.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
I had a two or three-week period plan where I was going to take a week or two off in the summertime,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
have fun, and then go to work at a different food cart.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
And in between is that's when the accident happened.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Oh.

33:04.000 --> 33:13.000
And so I'm still looking at bread go by on a conveyor belt, thinking about what you used to be.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
It's actually not that set.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Right now I'm just getting to the happy part.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
We're on the upswing now.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Finally, I have a degree in baking, so baking is what I want to do.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
It's what I love to do.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
So you're not in a painful transition?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I am because my foot prevents me.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
My injury prevents me from doing more.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
I'm working two days a week right now with the third training day, and I can't do any more than that.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
You're adjusting to life with someone who's not allowed to slack line?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm adjusting.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Yes.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Right?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Okay.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Well, that's Alma.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
All right.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Let's have a hand for Alma for sharing her pain.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Alma.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
Is there, well, just one more question.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Like, if there's anything that you could do, it doesn't stop at slacklining, right?

33:56.000 --> 34:04.000
Like, what would you do if you could do anything?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Everything.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Oh.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
All right.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Inspiring, but boring.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
That's fine.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
It's a fine, healthy answer.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
I guess that would be mine too.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It would be a long fucking walk.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I'd go for a fucking bike ride.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
All right.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Alma, the slackliner who would do everything.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
All right.

34:23.000 --> 34:30.000
We're going to, Alma, we're going to do your, you can go eat some pita bread, and we're

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
going to, we're going to do a movie for Alma.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Okay.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
I've been having some success with this.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
I want to do, like, Alma's, like, life story, I guess.

34:42.000 --> 34:52.000
It's, it's called, uh, slackliner, slackliner.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Alma?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Honey, it's time to get up.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Dad.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Yes.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Alma, come on.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
It's time to get up.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Breakfast is ready, Alma.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Dad, I was dreaming.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Dreaming about what?

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
More of that slackline?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Door comes down.

35:08.000 --> 35:14.000
Listen, you come from a long line of tight liners.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
We keep our lines taught.

35:17.000 --> 35:23.000
If I find you walking on a line that is not taught, what have I told you about non-taught

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
lines?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
What have I always told you?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
You don't give, uh, the slack...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
We're going to break an ankle doing that shit.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Yes.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
But you had a saying about it too.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
All right.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.000
So I'm going to go back to work at the, at the, uh, lamppost factory.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
He just doesn't get me.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
All right.

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm going to, I'm going to do my last day of work at the, uh, food truck.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Alma?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Yes.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
You're fired.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
What?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
But I've been...

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
No.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
You're fucking, you're fired.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
You, I, I...

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
You guys keep moving the truck.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
I can't find you.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
It's called the food truck.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Yeah.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
If it, if it, if it didn't have wheels, we'd call it a restaurant.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
This thing has wheels on it.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
Also, I found out yesterday that you served some cheese that wasn't grilled.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
What have I told you about grilling cheese?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
It must be grilled.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Or, or you're breaking ankle.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
You're cruising for a bruise, Alma.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
You're fired.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
You just like my dad.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Fuck you.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Stupid truck.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to get a job at a place

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
that is almost identical to a food truck, but without the truck part.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Oh, wait.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Look at this giant loaf of bread rotating around those buildings.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Bonjour, ma cuisine.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Oh, hello.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Welcome to my bakery.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Would you like a job?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Hey.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Yes.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
Are we fair enough?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
My, my name is Alma.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Alma what?

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Alma bitches?

37:03.000 --> 37:14.000
It's, it's a, it's a French joke.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Forgive me.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Yeah.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Right.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Okay.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
You're hired because I like your sense of humor.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Be careful.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Toe the line.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Do not do anything different than the rules state.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
No, you're going to break an ankle.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Hey, I'm, I'm fine.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
I'm fine.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
I've got, I've got two good feet and a brain ready to do everything.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Later that night.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Hey, Alma, how's it going?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Whoa.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Hey Sasquatch.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Hey.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
It's Yeti.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Anyway, that's cool, man.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
It's Portland fucking deal.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
If I had a dollar for every one of my friends that was named after the mythical abominable

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
snowman.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
Hey, look, man, Alma, I know that you come from a long line of top liners, but me and

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
we're going to go fucking slack landed later on.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
It's not for me.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
It's not for me.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Everyone's doing it.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
The line is less taught Sasquatch.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
No way.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
We're going to tie off to the, we're going to, your father worked at the lamppost mill.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
We know that those are going to be sound instead.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
He's also a tight liner.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I know.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
We're going to slack line on it, man.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
It's less taught.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
There's less tension there, man.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
I mean, even girl thought balloon.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
My dad is a tight liner and he makes a lamppost.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I have so lonely.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
I want to fuck Sasquatch so bad.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Listen, I'll just check it out and see what it looks like.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Look, man, I'll tie it off.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
Look, I'll come over to, man, this is one of your dad's lampposts.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
I'm going to tie it off.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Oh, by the way, if you cross this, I'm going to fuck you so fucking hard afterward, man.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Well, it's, you know, let's anchor it up, but not too tight.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Hey, careful.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Don't break your ankle.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
All right, Sasquatch.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Well, you test it out.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
That's good.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
Oh, my head.

39:05.000 --> 39:12.000
Kubrickian unconscious scene.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
Not a montage, but like a sequence.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
That's the word I lost.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Kubrickian unconscious sequence.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Tight liner.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Slack liner.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
That's my dad dressed as a loaf of bread.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Bonjour.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
He's French.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
You're all going to break everybody's ankles now.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
But there's a monkey on the other side of the room.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Hello, I'm a Sasquatch.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Wow.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
The monkey and the Sasquatch and the bread.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Everything's the same.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Honey, honey, wake up.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
It's your father.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Dad.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Hi.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
You were having a...

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
The door goes down.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
You were having a terrible dream.

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
Were you dreaming about doing anything other than what you're supposed to do by following the rules?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
No.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
Never, ever, ever follow your dreams.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm a man.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
You're a woman.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I run shit.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
Anything you do out of the ordinary is going to break your ankles.

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
Inside Alma's father's bloodstream...

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
I'm a monster.

40:30.000 --> 40:37.000
I'm an alien monster.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Alpha monster.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Beta bloodstream monster reported for duty.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
Let's give this asshole bone cancer.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Pancreatic cancer.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Pancreatic, it's way worse.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Okay, alright.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
That's maybe too soon, but...

40:58.000 --> 41:07.000
Turning the little-known giant valve inside every human body that gives them cancer.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Outside Alma's father's body.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Honey?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Dad?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Oh, shit.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
And another thing, dad.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
My bones.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
What?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Oh, dad!

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
You just broke my ankle.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Oh, dad!

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
The hunters become the hunted.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Run!

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Run!

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
The whole house is crumbling apart for some reason.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
I'm leaping.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
Actual Sasquatch comes up and says, fucking you.

41:36.000 --> 41:42.000
In mid-air, with the Sasquatch fucking me, I turned a sumo at a volleyball interest

41:42.000 --> 41:49.000
frame and I hit it, at which point we transitioned to the 2018 Olympics on a beach.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
Oh, and Alma wants the women's volleyball championship.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
It's in the way that she uses it.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Come, there you go.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
I can do everything!

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
There you are, Alma.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
Wow, that's a good movie.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That seemed like a good movie.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
I would grant that.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I had everything.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I had a little bit of everything.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
I would rent that.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Did you know that Matthew Lillard played the Sasquatch?

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
I did not know that.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Pretty cool.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Spencer, what did you think about that?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I thought it was great.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Definitely, definitely in the top three sketches.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think that, you asshole.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
What rap battle?

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Fuck this guy!

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Rap battle, angry, angry at him.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Rap battle, anger!

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
I'm the king of the rap stage with my microphone.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I fucked your mama because I hate being alone.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I'm so lonely deep inside.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
I fucked your mama so hard, pushing out wide.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I said, hang out, I'll be back later.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I fucked your mama because I'm an alligator.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
I chopped your pussy with my big teeth

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
and a bird came in and cleaned them out.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Yeah.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Oh, yeah.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Go, Spencer.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Yo, Dan Harmon's putting me down,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
but you all just see that he's a sad clown.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
He's standing over there and doing a dance,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and we can all see that there's holes in his pants.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
I'm sitting over here and I'm having a good time

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
trying to come up with my next rhyme.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
I think I'm gonna rhyme about the audience being cool.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I think you don't even really drool.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Your pants are fine.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Oh, thank you.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
It's a big conflict.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
How are we doing on time, Jeff?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
We're good.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
What time do we start? I have no idea.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
What time is it? 7.30?

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Oh, shit, we're late.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Here's some facts about Portland, Jeff.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Did you know some facts about Portland?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I did not.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
There's no second act to Portland.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Was that a heckle?

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Are you Roger Ebert?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
There's no second act.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Aristotle.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
What's that?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Bobcat's not up next.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I'm a screenwriter, so when I heard second act,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I was like, fuck you, there's a second act.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
What do you call that rap battle, you asshole?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
You see the sweat on my forehead?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
There's a fucking second act. Holy shit.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
We started at 7.30 impossible. What time do we go on?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
No.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
7.45? Okay, fuck it.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
But we haven't touched them yet.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
We touched Elmo.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I saw Squatch fucked you.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Is there a quick way to touch them

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
and then play D&D and then touch them hard?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
She wants to be touched.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
You want to be touched?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Come up and get touched, I guess.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Is it that simple?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Get touched. Much fuck.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Much get touched.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Touch corner.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
New segment. Touch corner.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Welcome to Touch Corner.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
We're Dan Harmon.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Yeah, I met Megan at the Thinkacross trade.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Hello, Megan.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Touch corner.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Oh, Megan. Dickens, Faggin.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
That's it.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Megan, what's up with you?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Lots of things.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Did you literally just want to get touched physically?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Well, yeah, but...

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
But also emotionally, deeply,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
spiritually, physically, psychically.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
What part of you, Megan,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
spiritually has gotten untouched until tonight?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Oh, all of it.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
The whole spirit, the whole soul?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Basically everything.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Narrow it down a bit.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Narrow it down.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Well, I'm very untouchable.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
You're untouchable?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Kind of. I'm very...

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I'm an asshole.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Do you work with Elliott Ness in the...

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
No.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Do you bring a knife to a gun fight?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I work in an office

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
and I don't

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
get along with anybody there.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
What's wrong with the people

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
that you work with or what's wrong with you?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
What's keeping you from connecting

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
with people?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm not a very nice person.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
You are? I'm not.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
So what do you do in a typical exchange?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
What keeps you there? So let's do a scene.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I'm a co-worker.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I'll be Sasquatch.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Oh, God.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Oh, God.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Oh, God.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Megan, where do you work?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I work in an office

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
in a manufacturing plant.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Okay, alright.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Hey, Megan.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
These manufacturing papers

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
don't indicate

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
enough of...

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Ah, fuck you.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Motherfuckers, I just...

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
What the fuck, Megan? I'm just...

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I'm doing my job.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I can do it better.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Hey, do you want to go out sometime?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
You know what?

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I'm taking this

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
to your supervisor.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Wait, wait, wait.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Wait, wait, wait.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
If you say

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
that you did this,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I'll let it go.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Okay.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Wow, that's tempting.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I did this.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I did this.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Alright, alright.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I'm tuned.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Mr. Jacobson, I...

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I did this with the manufacturing papers.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
You did this? Yeah.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
You're hired.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Oh, fuck you.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Megan, now I'm your boss.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Yeah, but...

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Now do you want to go out? Yeah.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Alright.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Let's go to...

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Let's go to the dance club.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Oh, there's a famous rapper

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
up on stage.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Breakdown.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I'm a famous Portland rapper.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
My name is Crippity Crapper.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I rap from the shorelines

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
to the coast.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I'm a famous Portland rapper.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Blah, blah, blah.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Whoa, this is great.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I love coming to this.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I like it.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Yeah.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Let's go back to your place.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Jesus Christ, there's human heads everywhere.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I know.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
What the fuck is your problem?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Wait, wait, wait.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
You better have a good explanation for this.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Okay, I know. I know it looks really bad.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
This is so bad.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
You start talking.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Okay, okay, okay.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I have a lot of experience morning.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
There's like so many experiments.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I think the experiment is over

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and heads can't live

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
when they're not on bodies.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Okay, there's like different levels.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Yeah, the head level and the body level.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
They're supposed to work together.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Okay, so like this one.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
This one is running like

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
what happens?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Do you chop a head off?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Wait a minute.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
One of these heads is Hitler.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Okay, okay, okay.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
No, Hitler's...

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
That looks really bad.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Hitler's rapping.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Oh, Hitler rapping.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
My name is Hitler and I'm here to say

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I'd like to take over Europe today.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I'm about to go with my sleeping plan

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and sweep through sweets

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
and that's all I can do.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And next Poland and wear a uniform.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I should have stayed in art school.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Wow, that's really great.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
You know what?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I'm very Polish.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I'm starting to warm up to you.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I'm super Polish.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm super Polish, too.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Well, let's get married.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
That's good.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
All right.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Eight years later...

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
You call this a

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
a fucking sandwich?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Yeah, well what the fuck do you want from me?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
What the fuck do you want from me?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You're never there!

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You're never there!

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I'm so angry!

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
You're never there!

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Yeah, of course he's fucked up.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
You're never there!

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Oh shit, our children are rapping.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I wish mom and dad would fight.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I wish I was never born.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I wish I wasn't white.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I wish I had a better life

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
from a little baby child of Megan and Pam.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Stop dancing!

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
These fucking kids are shitty rappers.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I hate this sandwich.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Of course it does!

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
In a magazine I took a quiz

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
and said if you go to a woman's house

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
and she has decapitated hands

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
and one of us is an animatronic hitler

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and that's gonna be shit

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and I didn't listen to it

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and I fucking regret this.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I regret this shit.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I regret working with you.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I regret handing you that paper.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I regret all the chances I took on you.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
But I love you.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I can't stay mad at you.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I love you so much.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Everything is so important.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Everything is so important.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Everything in life

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
comes down to that one moment.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Everything is important

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
from the trees

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
to the bushes

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
to the rocks

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Everything

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
is important.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Sasquatch comes in.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
A long crawl

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
about statistics of Sasquatch Rape.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
There are 75,000 instances

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
of Sasquatch Rape

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
in the Northwest.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Most people don't report it.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
That knows that too.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
The Library of Congress.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
They don't believe us.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
All right, Megan everybody.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Megan.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I guess we got to New Portland

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
a little better.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
That makes sense.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
We learned a lot about Portland today.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Makes sense to me.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Although I'm pretty blown out.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
What is this called? Volstead?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
All right, we should play D&D now.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Look at this guy over here.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Is it time?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You know what?

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
A guy came up to me

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
at the bar,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Spencer. A guy came up to me and he said,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I love your podcast.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I have one note, and I was like, here we go.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And he said, you should separate

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
the D&D from the podcast

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
and do a whole D&D thing with Spencer

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
and have celebrity guests.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
And I was like, Andrew, shut up.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I did it. I sold that show.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
We're going to do that on the web.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
It's going to be a whole different thing.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
That's Spencer, dungeon master.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Fuck yeah.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
It's D&D time.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
He was like, oh, I already knew that.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I just wanted to, like, I invented it

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
to talk to you about.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And I was like, I ripped up his face.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
And I was like, dad.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
And he was like, like, I'm sorry.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I had polio.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Let's get Erin McGathy to the stage.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Erin McGathy, are you up there?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
All right.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
All right.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
What have Aaron came up with his shirt off?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I was toying with the idea.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I just had my tights off

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
with, like, a target around my pussy.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Everybody, did we go?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Like, Spencer's wearing a t-shirt

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
that says Master of Dungeons.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I'm wearing a t-shirt that says Sharpie.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I spilled. I had a rob.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Rob's the awesome guy who made all these shirts.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Let's go.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I'm going to go.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I'm going to go with the awesome guy

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
who made all these shirts.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Let's hear from Rob.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
He made me a shirt

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
with two arrows that said

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
adventure, I spilled vodka over it.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
But I had it on earlier.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Vodka leaves a terrible stain.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
But Rob, let me tell you,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
she spills vodka over everything she loves.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Including vodka.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Like, like, like, like.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Her boyfriend. The planet.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Birth certificates.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
It's a christening.

54:44.000 --> 54:53.000
Wait, this guy's got a camera on his head and he went to the bathroom, did you just film yourself taking a piss?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Oh, I don't know.

54:55.000 --> 55:02.000
There's no red light on it, is it out of D12 or whatever?

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Oh my god, he has blood all over his face.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Neil, make sure it's still rolling.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
And also, give him $3 off his ticket price? Jesus Christ.

55:12.000 --> 55:24.000
I was told by Morgan, our tour manager, that I need to announce that after the show we're going to the Lucky Labrador across the street.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:25.000 --> 55:35.000
And that's where Spencer and I will be selling merch and where you can buy prints and t-shirts and Dan and Jeff will sign them only $50 a signature.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
No, no, no, no.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
I'll sign anything you buy and also you don't have to buy anything.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I'll sign, I'll sign your napkin, I'll sign.

55:42.000 --> 55:51.000
I will, for no price, I will mime Sasquatch rape you.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Portland, you guys are fucking weird, I love this.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
Also, Spencer and I have a special kissing booth where you can stand in the middle and we'll kiss your teeth.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
And watch them kiss, they will kiss each other.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Alright, Spencer, can we get our character sheets please?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Spencer's passed that down to...

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
Spencer's now dispensing the character shirts.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Yeah, shirts.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Spencer, get us up to date.

56:11.000 --> 56:18.000
Would you please, in the campaign, when we last met, the party was still trapped in the confines of the Infinifish.

56:18.000 --> 56:25.000
After taking out a lung and returning to where Quark had countered the kidney, the party took on the massive ordnance and the spidery spark...

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Ah, fuck.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And the spidery sparks guarding it.

56:29.000 --> 56:37.000
The kidney was eventually destroyed and the gang pressed on through a thicket of fleshy cords, sliding down a slimy slide to a pink flat form.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Fuck.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
At the bottom, they fought a tricky slime in case in which was a book.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
And after slicing and dicing the bloody slime, Sharpie was able to retrieve said magical toe.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
The only way out appeared to be a large sphincter on the floor.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
What would they do?

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
I think I've said this before, but it would be so handy to have Spencer, like, in your day-to-day life as an alcoholic.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
You went to the drawing room and started doing shots of Ferdinand Branca.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
Yes, you left your credit card there.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.000
At about 3 p.m. Geno came by and you ended up going to the LA Zoo.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
Searching for your wallet, do you realize?

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
If you get a text from Margaret, don't answer it.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Margaret?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Yeah.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Alright, so now...

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
That's why.

57:28.000 --> 57:38.000
I'm gonna say, just to start things off with a fun note, I'm gonna just take a foot through that sphincter on the floor and see what goes.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Just the one foot?

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Listen, you know what?

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
I'm gonna run and I'm gonna go like a long jumper.

57:46.000 --> 57:52.000
One, two, and then I'm gonna put my hands up on my head and I'm gonna feet first to go through the sphincter on the floor.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
But what are you gonna do in D&D?

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Huh?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Nice, nice.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Don't just snap.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Just snap.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
At what time is it appropriate?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I just saw these t-shirts over here.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
When do we bring those up?

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
In a bit.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
In a bit.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Alright.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Yes.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Wow.

58:10.000 --> 58:16.000
Dan Harmon fucked my mama and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
All my mama got was these lousy herpes.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
No, they're great herpes.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
No, they're great.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Baby, babe, they're great herpes.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
They're weaponized.

58:28.000 --> 58:35.000
Alright, so I do a one, two, three, and I make myself like, I go feet first through the sphincter on the floor, Spencer.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Bloop.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
You swiftly slide through the sphincter and find yourself in a small chamber.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
In front of you is a meat curtain.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
You sense something powerful and dangerous behind.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
Oh man, is this gonna be like the Indiana Jones thing, but it's a turd, like, rolling?

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
Cause you're obviously in a colon, right?

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
I don't know.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
You're running from a round ball.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I'm looking at a meat curtain, yeah.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
So what are my surroundings?

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
You're just in a small area.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
It's pretty closed off.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
You just flew through like a giant sphincter.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
Okay, I do a cartwheel and do a round off.

59:15.000 --> 59:23.000
And as I round off, I try to round off through the meat curtain so that when I emerge through the other side of the meat curtain, I go like,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Ta-da!

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
So I do a cartwheel and then tuck and then do a round off and I land.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I go through the meat curtain.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Okay, so cartwheel, tuck the knees.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Yeah.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Round off.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Right.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Meat curtain, ta-da.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Right.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Okay.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm upside down doing the tuck as I go through the meat curtain.

59:42.000 --> 59:48.000
And ideally, I would round off and be facing whatever I'm facing at the other side of the meat curtain.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Well, you attempt that.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
All right.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Your shoulders get stuck in the meat curtain.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
No!

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You fall unceremoniously outward.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Should have done five more round offs.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I fall where?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Into a largest room.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Oh, so I've gone through the meat curtain.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You can see through the meat curtain.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I wouldn't say you're entirely through it.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But I'm in a largest room.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah, and you're also like falling on the ground from failing your cartwheel maneuver.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Okay, then I just crawl, like army crawl, hand over hand through the meat curtain into the greater room.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The room is littered with flabby tubes and arteries.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The walls are covered in web-like lattices of veins and strands of fibrous tissues.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You can see a large throbbing heart standing in the center of the room.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Hanging from the ceiling are two orange orbs of tissue, perhaps some sort of nerve cluster or other thing.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Two flabby tubes reminiscent of slag might stand up straight, near by the heart.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Flabby tubes, he was an actor in all those old John Wayne movies, right?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah, no, it's terrible what happened to him.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The studio system really victimized him.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Hey, you can go into that heart, are you?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
There's gold in there.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
What's happening?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000
The famous story is that flabby tubes murdered that kid, but it was all, it's not true.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Walt Disney murdered the kid and blamed it on flabby tubes.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I hollered a Sharpie and Mulraine and said,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Hey guys, I think I found the heart and possibly two nerve clusters. Get on in here.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Oh, is he coming back up through the sphincter?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
No, I hollered.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Did the sound carry through meat curtains?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You hear the faint, squelchy sound of Quark's voice coming through the sphincter.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Does it sound like he's saying, don't come down here, I'm being digested by a sphincter?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Or does it sound like he's maybe saying data in the goonies, hey, I found another room?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You hear, it sounds like he mentioned something about a heart.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Okay, well, I jumped down through the sphincter.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
You can jump through the sphincter, you can leave your friends behind,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance, they're not friends of mine.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Sphincter dance.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
No, no, don't fucking clap for that shit.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Don't reward that.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
If you don't give a shit about the goonies reference, then fuck the safety dance.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Just let me sit up here and die in front of you of old age.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Let me turn into Mount Rushmore.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
No, no, no, don't.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Sherby, you can't just go through the sphincter, you have to cartwheel through the meat curtains

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and then army crawl through the rest of the meat curtain.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I actually want to use that stick that you gave me that has the button on it.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I'm gonna put the stick through the sphincter, so to speak,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and then slide down it like a fireman's pole.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Because I pressed the button.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Is this because you went to the embers today?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Embers is awesome, the fish tank bar.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
We didn't have a big fight, but it's cool that there's fish in the bar

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and then inevitably someone's gonna go, oh, those fish aren't being taken care of.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Like, come on, but they're in a bar.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It's a tranny bar, right?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Yeah, but the fish don't know that.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I don't think anyone was like, oh, these trannies are a bad influence on the fish.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
They're gonna start dressing up as snakes.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Yeah, it's a drag queen, they have drag queen shows, yeah.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But this was during the day, they're open at like 11, you can go sit there and it's like beautiful

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and they're gonna fish tank bar.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Embers, I enjoyed it.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I didn't want to feel bad for the fish, I thought the fish were, there's goldfish,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
they're a robust species of fish.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And the whole bar is a fish tank.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
That means that the fish are over here and they could go all the way to the end of the bar.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
If you were a fish, they came from a lake.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
No, they didn't come from a lake.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
No one from Embers goes out in a raincoat like a Vandy Camp Spisherman and catches,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
oh, another goldfish for the bar.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
They're boring in a goddamn paper cup at a carnival.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And the ones that get adopted by the drag queen from Embers are like,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
they're the luckiest fucking goldfish in Portland.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And they pour them in there and the fish are like, what's happening?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And it's like a Pixar movie, Albert Brooks comes up and goes like, holy shit, you wouldn't believe it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
There's a whole bar.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And then every once in a while, yeah, someone crashes through the top of the bar because they get angry

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000
and then probably a fish gets crushed, but at least there's no turtles eating them.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Okay, at least there's no turtles.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
All right, so I'm waiting for my friends for the meat curtains.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You see a staff poking its head through the sphincter and then the meat curtain.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Chubby! Hey!

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I'd recognize that.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
What's up?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
This shitty dude.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I grab on to the end of the staff and pull him through.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It's stuck.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
What?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Oh, I'm sorry, let me press that button.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You pull it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
You know, Sharpie, are you on it or are you already through this one?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Oh, boy, stickler over here.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It's important.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
All right, I... God damn it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
You can just pick one. It's fine.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Am I on the pole or what?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yeah, did you already come through on the pole or is he pulling you through now?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I wanted to slide through this picture.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Okay, yeah, well, that happens.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And then, okay, so you slide through.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Hey, what happened?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I got it.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Mulraine, press the button and come through.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Okay.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
All right, so you slide through.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Now you're there.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Now you grab the thing.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Now it's grabbed.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Got the staff.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You guys threw the door.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You guys cut it in a cartwheel.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I wanted to do something cool.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
All right, so what are our surroundings now, Spencer?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Am I there?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Yeah, you're there now too.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Hey, guys.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Hey, good to have you back.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So what do we see now?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
You're in a room.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
No, so I explained the heart, right?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
So there's a giant throbbing heart.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Hanging from the ceiling are two orbs of orange tissue,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
perhaps some sort of giant nerve cluster.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I said that already.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
There's the two flabby tubes.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
They're venting noxious gases in the colors of green and orange.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And you can also see a few tentacles

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
waving around nearby the ground.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
In the center of the room,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
you can see that ice stalk that you encountered earlier.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Shit.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And it begins swaying ponderously.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Gentlemen,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
are we trying to destroy the fish,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
or should we just want to leave the fish, right?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Well, I think...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
We have to kill it.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah, I would say.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But if we kill it, are we going to fall down into nothing?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Yeah, but...

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I used my far sword attack.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Here's my plan about that.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
While they're fucking mulling shit over,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
because I'm a barbarian,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I swing my far sword as hard as I can at the heart.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
At the heart itself, right?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Yes.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Okay.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Ah, you miss.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Fuck everybody.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Your far sword goes wide,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and rather than hitting the heart,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
it instead strikes a tentacle.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Is that good?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
It's better than not hitting anything,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
or hitting yourself in the foot.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I remove...

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
You deal seven damage.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
All right.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I remove two...

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
The arrows!

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Oh, she did?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
She...

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And as I'm pulling them out,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
a sparkle from my eye catches Quirk's eye.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And I pull back, and I shoot my arrows.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
At...

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
At adventure!

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That doesn't...

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
At the heart.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
At the heart.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
At the heart.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
You shoot two arrows at the heart.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Spenser V arrows.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Yeah, V arrows at the heart.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I'm listening.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Both of them strike the heart

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
directly in its center of mass.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Yay!

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Spink dirt battles.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Dealing six damage.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Yeah.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Six, six.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Yeah, six damage.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The eye ball plays wonderfully.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
That's some Seattle shit right there.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I don't know.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I just randomly thought maybe they had a rivalry with Seattle.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I do.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I do.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I was really tired today,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and I think for a half an hour,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I thought it was literally in Seattle,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
and I met someone, and they're like,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
yeah, I'm from like an hour north of Seattle.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I was like, all right, so an hour away?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You're in Seattle?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Perlin's way better, though!

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It was Eddie better.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
You know, is it?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Wow.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I thought he had something in his mouth.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Couldn't understand it.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Oh, you just gotta go to voodoo donuts

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and do some slacklining.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
The tentacles shoot out of the floor

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and grapple you.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
They wrap themselves around your legs.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
You feel as if you can't move.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
At the same time, the ponderous eyeball

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
sways and its eye turns purple,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and it looks directly at Sharpie.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
What?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Sharpie.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I go like this.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Like what?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It seems like an impressive response.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
As you make your excited and cool maneuver,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
you feel a haze come over you,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and all of a sudden you feel the presence

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
of several enemies surrounding you.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Oh, shit.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I've been charmed against you guys.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Yeah.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Use some magic.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
No, I've...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Yeah, use some magic.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
You're a mage.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Oh, can I resist it?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
No, you can fight the enemies you see.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
No, I don't want to fight my friends.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You do, that's the thing, though.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
You can tell me that I want to fight them.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I've watched you go through this with Cheth.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Okay, you cast Scorching Ray.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It hits.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Dealing eight damage.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Eight damage.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Eight damage.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
That's like fucking some average shit.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Some bend Oregon kind of style.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That was some Eugene shit.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That was some Medford style bullshit.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
What's Medford style?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Messed on now, no.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I know, what do you want from me?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I just want the old Dan back.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Why don't you take your shirt off?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Take your shirt off.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Take your shirt off.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Save it, save it, save it.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I said take your shirt off.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Oh, take my shirt off, okay.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
All right, so whose turn is it Spencer for fuck's sake?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
You see those orange things I mentioned earlier

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
from the ceiling.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
They're shaking wildly and

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
shaking a violent red powder onto you.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
It's making you guys sick.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
You feel kind of sick to your stomachs.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I go into, I use Power Attack.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
One of the orange sacky things.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
They're pretty high up.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
You'd have to jump to hit them.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I run and I first jump off of Mulraine's shoulders,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
then onto Sharpie's shoulders,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
and then jump as high as I can and swing my sword

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
at one of the orange sacks.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Taking a few steps back to prepare your charge,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
you leap forward, catapulting yourself

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
off the back of the half-elf.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You leap high into the air and swinging your sword

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
in a wide arc.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
You slice cleanly at the cord,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
holding the dangling nerve cluster.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It falls off and falls to the ground

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and explodes into a pile of dust.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Never had a lesson.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Never had a lesson.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You hear the beast give an unearthly shake around you

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
as well as a long, far-off wail

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
as if it were in immense pain.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Oh, we're close, you guys.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Somebody attack the other nerve cluster.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I take out my longsword and, yeah.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Zip.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I take out my longsword.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It looks great.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And I attack the other nerve cluster.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Well, it's too high up.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Well, you're too high up.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Yeah, I am.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I jump.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Okay.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I jump off Sharpie's back.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I jump off Sharpie's back.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Okay.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Super cute style.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
All right.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Or would it be better to do arrows, Spencer?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It would be better to do arrows to hit things far away.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Is it too late?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
The question is how many arrows should she shoot?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Six.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Fourteen.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Well, I mean, I don't want to be a bad D&D player.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I did already say that I have the sword.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's true.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Jumping off your friend Sharpie,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
you launch yourself at the nerve cluster.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
You get right up to it and pulling your sword from its holster.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You swing in a wide arc.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
However, it misses and you tumble to the ground.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bam.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Tungent snap.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Same team.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Thank you.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I will next time, ma'am.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I will.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah, Vellison hasn't even followed you guys.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
He's just making sandwiches.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
He's back in the last area.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Sharpie, finish him off.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Sharpie, you shake off the effects of your charm.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Yeah.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Oh.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I cast Buya.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
No.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Sharpie, you attacked me.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I wasn't myself.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
It's like last night when we got in that fight.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Over the straw.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
What was the straw fight about?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I handed her a Diet Coke.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I handed her a Diet Coke, right?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And she handed it back and the straw looked like an animal had mangled it.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It looked like a child had chewed it all day.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
It was all twisted and I thought it was funny, so I went, what the fuck?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But because I'm a professional entertainer, I wasn't smiling and laughing when I was like,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
hey, what the fuck?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And she was ignoring me because she was round that bend.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
The fact that we had gotten Taco Bell should tell you what state we were in.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
So I just looked at the mangled straw and I went, hey, hey, what the fuck?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Because I was, yes, ending the fact that she was an animal.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I was like, what's with the fucking mangled straw?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
But Dan, I think it's important to say that right before this happened, Dan was like,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I didn't get enough tacos.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So I gave him my taco.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It's not important.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
That's like saying the sky is blue.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I never get enough tacos.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I always complain about whatever.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Anyway, you said what the fuck?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I didn't think it was a joke.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I thought you were starting a fight over a straw.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Well, you're starting a fight over a fight over a straw.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Look, I love you more.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Nice.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Oh, well, that was supposed to be cute.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And yet it wasn't.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
You're the best.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I cast magic.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Who gives a shit?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Sorry.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I cast scorching rain.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
There's a ray.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
It's a scorching ray.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It's hotter than the cold ray, hotter than the sun.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I'm gonna scorch rain, and then we're done.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Scorching rays gonna cast damage on these motherfuckers.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Portland got a scorching ray.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Motherfucker got a 4th fret winter cup.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
What do you shoot it at?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You gotta aim it at something.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Is the eye stock still there?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
There is that eye stock.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Yeah, fuck that guy.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
The guy that got me, the guy that charmed me.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
All right.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Your scorching ray strikes true.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It strikes the eye directly in its lens.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Dealing 18 damage.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
The eye stock closes its eye and starts crying a bit.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Aw, I go like this.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Aw.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I attack with my emerald dagger at the eye stock.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You attack the eye stock with the emerald dagger?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yes.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Okay.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Attacking the eye stock with your emerald dagger,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
you notice that it misses.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
It strikes by a lot.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I notice that it misses.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's a sad state of affairs, but there you go.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I look at my dagger and go, way to go.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It goes, well that's the first time you've ever talked to me.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I say to the dagger, look, I didn't know you could speak.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Yes, you know, there's a lot of magic items that can speak.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Okay, well look, let's not fight like Aaron and Dan.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Let's just...

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You should kill that other orange thing.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It seemed like it pissed that thing off.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Don't tell me what to do, dagger.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I'm in charge here.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Do you know how magic I am?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I don't know.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I didn't know you could talk.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
If I knew that you were a magical talking dagger,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I'd have asked you what to do.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Well, apparently we can fill a book with stuff you don't know,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
but I know you should kill that because he's a barbarian.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
But I know that you should attack that orange thing

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
because I'm magic and a dagger.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Okay, well, I tried to attack the ice dog

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and you fucking failed me.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
This relationship has to be built on trust.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Yeah, well, I didn't trust that we could harm that ice dog.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Okay, look, I'm patient with the conversation.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Shut the fuck up, Mulraine.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I'm having a conversation with my dagger right now.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I have to say, I wonder if the podcast is going to get

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
seven emails talking about how your relationship

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
with the dagger ruined the podcast.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I don't know. I liked it. It felt honest.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I mean, I really love you and the dagger together, but...

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
You both need to chill.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
All right, because my dagger is not a person, it's a dagger,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I come to an agreement and I say,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
look, from now on in the future,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
let's just communicate with each other.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And if I'm ever not living up to your standards

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
as a dagger holder, then you just say so

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
and I'll try to become a better barbarian.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And if I ever have a problem with your effectiveness as a dagger,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I'll just say so and then maybe together we can grow

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
and one day I'll live up to who I should be

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and what you should be and together we'll form a union

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and be better people for it.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Love expert Jeff Davis, everybody.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And then I say, and the next time I fucking

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
attack an ice-talk, fucking get your shit together.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So partnership is equals. That sounds pretty good.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
All right.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Yeah. All right. Let's attack stuff together.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Hey, you know what? Dagger.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Talking to you, dagger.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Oh, I thought you meant you're throwing an ice-talk in my bed.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Now, dagger?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Okay, what's up? Hey.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You're okay.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
You too, man.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I love my dagger.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The worst TV pilot ever.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Quark and Dagger.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Slash most of it.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Quark and Dagger.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Starring Demny Coleman.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
That's your boss that sent you out.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Quark?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
What is it, dagger?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
You don't have a dagger in your pocket, do you?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
No, I don't.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
What was that? What was that sound?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
That was my badge and my gun.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Quark and Dagger. Friday.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
You know this police department has a strict rule against talking daggers.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So, yeah, are you going to hit stuff?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Dagger?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Hey.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I know it's not my turn.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Let's go out of turn one more time.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Oh, I don't think you've taken any combat action.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Okay.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Dagger?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I tell dagger, I believe in you.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And I want you to hold me like a dagger.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And the dagger summons a power to use me as a sword and holds me and wields me like a blade.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And we charge towards the last remaining nerve sack.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And the dagger wields me like a dagger and like holds my ankles in my head and goes straight.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I hold my sword up like in the air and the dagger swings me at the last remaining nerve sack.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You know the crazy thing is that I had a cursed sword that actually would wield its wielder like that?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Like, so that's not even an entirely original ideal.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Oh, dungeon, like super dungeon.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I just, I like, it's a good plan, but that's not the magic that's enchanting this dagger unfortunately.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Dungeon snap, writer's workshop snap, like Los Angeles snap.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So you're saying that can't happen?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
No, but I mean.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
All right, okay, fuck it.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I just, I take my dagger with our newfound relationship and with an extra confidence that I never knew existed.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I wield my emerald dagger and I run right at the heart.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Right at the heart.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You strike it critically.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Look at that, that's crazy.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
What are the fucking odds, right?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
How much?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
What are the odds of that? Like, honestly, dealing 30 damage.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
30 damage!

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You all ready for this?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
You strike a great blow against the heart.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It gives a violent shudder and starts to ooze blood.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000
The entire room you're in shudders and quakes and you take some damages.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
We all do?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah, from the quaking and shaking of the thing you're inside of.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Fair enough.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You all take four damage.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Yeah, that's nothing.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
That's some quake shit.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It's definitely injured, but not dead.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
By the way, Spencer's using the dice that whoever brought the dice.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Yeah, who got me these awesome dice? These are fucking sweet.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Who did it?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Oh, I can't see him anymore.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
What's his name?

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Nice.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Tom.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Tom? Thank you, Tom.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
These are the coolest things ever.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:59.000
He looks like a very crafty Jesus in the back.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Good-looking guy.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Thanks, Tom.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
These are some sweet dice.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
All right, guys, finish it off.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I had a breakthrough with my sword.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So, Spencer, is the heart done?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
It's not.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I mean, we might want to break here, to be honest.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Oh, the heart's a full-time job, huh?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Well, yeah, it's a tough job, but someone's got to pump it.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Before we stop, can I shoot two good arrows?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
At.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
At the heart?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
At the heart.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Yes, yes, you can.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And give me 20.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Well, I tried.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
One of your arrows strikes the heart directly in the heart.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Dealing 11 damage.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Just dagger winks at me.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
No.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
No eyes.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
But the jewel glimmers in a winking fashion.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
It glistens.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And I accept that glisten as a wink.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
That's fair.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Do you think the heart's really at that full-time job?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
We should stop here, huh?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah, no, you're not.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
You haven't killed it.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
All right, well, let's stop that.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Spencer, everybody.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Spencer Cliffhanger!

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Fuck yeah.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Erin McGathy in the main.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Erin McGathy and Spencer Crittenden.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Wow.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
All right, Portland.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000
A home of good, wonderful, artistic, beautiful, clean, spiritual, wonderful, transparent people

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000
through whom God flows constantly and that government cannot crack.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
We need to come up with our fucking constitution here before we go to San Francisco,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
because you know in San Francisco, they'll just go like,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
you should be able to park wherever you want, and they'll be like crazy.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So in Portland, these are people who sculpt things and understand things.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
They program things.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
They're a practical people, Jeff.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
They're a good people.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
They're a port people.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It's called Portland.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's named after the port of Portland.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Is that right?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Ships come in.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
You have to get shit done.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
When a ship full of salt comes in, you've got to put the salt somewhere.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
There's another ship full of pepper coming in.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
They've adapted a culture of, it's called the New York of the West.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Can we get a representative of Portland?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Somebody who feels that they know the most about it.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Who among us right now would be the most representative?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Do we want to...

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yes, sir.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
You seem lumberjack style.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Our first dude of the night.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
What's your name, sir?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Ryan.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Ryan, everybody.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
A Portlandologist.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Ryan.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Grab a mic.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
All right.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
So Portland actually is named after Portland, Maine, off a penny flip.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
All right.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Who is flipping the penny?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
So two guys moved here, one from Boston, one from Portland,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and they both wanted to name it after their home cities,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and they flipped the penny, and it came up Portland,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and now that penny is in the museum.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
No shit?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
You know the craziest thing about it?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Because that was 1820.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
There was no one on the penny.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So there was no...

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
People say that Portland just made it up.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Because Abe Lincoln was just running around, he was in college.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
One side just had the word heads.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And the other side had tails.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Just said penny side one, penny side two.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Anyways.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Ryan, are you a local?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
No, I moved here four years ago to start med school,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and I'm actually moving away tomorrow because I just graduated.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Oh, good for you.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Congratulations.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
What kind of...

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I'm a chiropractor.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Oh, okay.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So kind of real medicine.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Oh, fuck you guys.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Some like spine surgeon just booed you.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Chiropractor, boo.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Well, I went to a chiropractor for a while.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I had to.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I have a terrible history of back pain in my family,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
but then I got one of those inversion tables.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Oh, yeah.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Those are awesome.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Do your people...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
They don't recommend them though, right?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
No, the inversion tables are great.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And you're out of a job.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
It doesn't fix everything, it just helps.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It fixes everything, for me.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I mean, it made me not have to go to a chiropractor ever again.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I mean, I don't care if you don't see me,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I just feel that if you get better, that's all I want.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Really?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Yeah.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Hugging him.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I'm making up with chiropractors tonight.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yo, yo, yeah, yo.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Backdoctor, yo.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I want to rock, rock, rock, rock her.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But it doesn't matter.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Yo.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
It's Ryan.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Ryan.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Yo, yo.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Ryan.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Ryan.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Back pain.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Running the rain.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I'm going to feel the strength and heal myself with my pain.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'm going to bend over backwards for my lower lumbar.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I fucked your mama so hard she never comes so far.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I fucked your mama until she had back spasms.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I fucked your mama and her pussy was a chasm.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
The sky dove down to its bottom.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I fucked your mama so hard I started to feel it was a Gotham.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I didn't really want to rap, but I think that's what...

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
It wasn't feeling it.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I wanted to talk to Ryan for a little bit about Portland.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
That's why you brought him up.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I don't care.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
When he played that song, it felt joyless and forced.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I liked it.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I thought it was good.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Thanks.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yo.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Yo.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Yeah.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I'm awful sorry I blamed my bad rap on you.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I didn't mean to take a crap on you.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I came up to Portland to transform.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I fucked your mama so hard I needed chloroform.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
That doesn't mean it was non-consensual.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I fucked your mama good, but it was quite sensual.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I met her at a diner and said let's go out.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I fucked her good and then she started to scream and shout,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
but not in protest.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Enjoy.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I fucked your mama and pregnant her and made a boy.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
It was you.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Ryan.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I'm your father.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I'm down to harm and tell.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Turn that brown upside down.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Back pain.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Yellow poop is brown.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Lumbar.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I'm down to harm and tell.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Little bones from your butt to your neck.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
They make your whole body work and if they get wrecked,

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
you're fucked up as heck.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
You gotta go to a doctor, but if it's not a real doctor,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
you gotta go to a chiropractor.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
He'll delay you down.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
He'll snap your back and he'll turn you around and he'll say,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
does that feel good?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And you'll say, yes it did.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And he'll say, come back in a week no matter what.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
We always have to come down to harm and tell.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Scam.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Down upside down.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Snap it.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
There is yellow poop is brown.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Pelvis.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Come on down to harm and tell.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Rapidy rap.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Rapidy rap.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I didn't think I was going to rap more.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Sorry.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Ryan take it.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Ryan.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Okay wait.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Yeah.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Yeah go.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I came to harm and tell.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I had my two frowns turn upside down.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Then harm and made me feel so good.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I have a little bit of wood.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Whoa.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And a harm and tell.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Turn that brown upside down.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Boner.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And now a poop is brown.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Come on down to harm and tell.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I'd like to reach out and touch that wood.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
The one you just mentioned.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Rub it like I should.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I won't make a wish.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I won't wish for a genie.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I just want to reach out and touch your weenie.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I hope that it makes my back feel better.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I hope you look good in a cashmere sweater.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Want to take you home and put on some music.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Electra fuck your mama so hard she won't know how to use it.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Referring to her pussy.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Gary Busey.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Come on down to harm and tell.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Turn that brown upside down.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Sorry.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Boner.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Spencer.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
You go to a chiropractor for your spine.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
If you think that you can get it you will be fine.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
After about three sessions you're feeling better.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And if you know it pussy something wetter.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Gonna wrap, gonna wrap some more.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
It's gonna reveal really like rhymes galore.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And if you think you're really good then you give me what for.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I don't know what's going on for taking to the forest.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Come on down to harm and tell.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Master.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Turn that brown upside down.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Come on down to harm and tell.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Oh shit now it's my turn to wrap.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Is my mic even on?

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I've been sitting over here for so long I don't even know.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I've listened to Dan and Ryan and Spencer flow.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
But now I guess I have to let the lyrics flow.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I've been sitting there and I think I love Portland so much.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
It's the coolest town in the Northwest.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
It's such a cool town because the food is great and the booze is flowing.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I like the fact that the hoses are throwing.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
It's a weird thing.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Hoses actually turn into bros.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And that's why the water always flows.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Oh shit god damn it.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Let's get the pink ladies up here.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
The pink t-shirt ladies.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
They made t-shirts you guys.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Thank you Ryan.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Ryan the carer back there.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
He's gonna go get an adjustment.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
They got the shirt said Dan fucked my mom and all that guy was in a lousy t-shirt.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Yo.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Alright.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
You ready?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Okay yo.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You're gonna wrap it and the towels are gonna sit.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yo.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Here we go.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yo.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yo.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Yo.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
What's your name?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Jen.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Jen.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Nice to meet you.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I fucked your mama but it's a way that I greet you.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I did it far and near.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I fucked your mama till I generated a joyful tear.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I did it in the Northwest.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Fucked her booby on her chest.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I can't hear the, I fucked, I'm off the beat.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Okay.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Just give me a second.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Just give me a second.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
This is Portland.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
It's a land of second chances and I just sprayed.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Okay.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Sorry.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And then I saw the droplets.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Droplets.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Need to shave.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Wicked Ryan spitting out of my face.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Her shoe needed a new lace.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Her shoe came off her foot because I fucked it hard.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I fucked your mama until she had flubber for lard.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
They're the same thing.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I went to sing, sing, and whoever came out and bring a thing.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
God damn it.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I fucked up so bad.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I really want to rap better than I've ever have.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I got three ladies in pink and I don't want to do so bad that I stink.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
One of them rap.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I'm going to go to them.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Just give me a second to clear my mental plan.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
What's your name?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Megan.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I'm going to rap.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I'm going to just sing one thing and then it'll be the done.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I don't know what you were saying.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Yeah.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Okay.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Yeah.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Bad idea.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
It was a bad idea.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
It was a bad idea.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Pink turned that brown up side there.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Girls.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
It's yellow.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Who's pissed?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Portland.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Get it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Get it.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Spit and fire, blowing free is a stream.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I swear to God, I'm not thinking of anything I'm saying.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I really mean it.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I'm going to open my mouth and let it fly.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I'm going to be transparent so my eye is God's eye.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Just want to say this is the best city in the world.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I'm sorry if I offended any boy, any girl.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Keep making sculptures and eating your weird hot dogs.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I want to fuck you so hard like a Lincoln log.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Go downtown, get into a taxi.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I fucked your mama's pussy till her pet was a maxi.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I fucked your mama in her hat and her shoe.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I fucked your mama so hard.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Fuck Oregon.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
What you going to do?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Thank you so much everybody.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Good night.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
We love you.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Thank you, Portland.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
What were your names, girls?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Megan.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Amanda.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Amanda.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And Fiona.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
The pink ladies thing.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
We'll be across the street signing stuff and having pictures of beer.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Come over and join us there.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Thank you all.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Thank you.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Thank you.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Is this a special treble based rap beat?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Oh, shit.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Special tracks, secret tracks, special tracks.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Chiropractor going to fix you back.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Got a special track, have a heart attack.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Yo, make that line, have some slack.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Not tight slack and fucking rockin' between it.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Get a lamppost in my back.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Go to a chiropractor named Ryan.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
He keeps crackin' my back.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
He's not a doctor.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
He's just tryin'.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
He went to medical school.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
He ain't nobody's school.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Pink ladies smaggin' the mandolin.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Oh, Peter O'Toole.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
That's probably not her name.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I'm just tryin' to rhyme.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
It's the name of the rap game.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Spencer for hire up in his t-shirt.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I heard Portland was where they invented dirt

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
and took it down to Seattle

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
where they eat it because they're a bunch of human cattle.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
The Northwest is the place to be.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I fucked your mama so hard she turned into a bee.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
She made some honey and I took it, put it on some bread.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And then I squeezed her little head.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And then the honey came out of her ears

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
and I turned it into a pale lager.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Some kind of beer and served it across the street

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
at that Labrador place with a little piece of taco meat.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
This is free and the health code is up to snuff.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I fucked your mama so hard that enough is enough.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I fucked your mama in her keys, in her purse, in her hat.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
She said, please, please don't do it anymore.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I've had enough.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
It feels abusive and misogynistic.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And I said, I'm so sorry.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
It's just where my mind goes.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
It's because I love women.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I give them too much power

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
and then I try to take it back from them.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And so it comes off as rapey and creepy and gross.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And we all know that that's how that works.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Like every man that you meet that seems abusive to you

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and threatening to you, he's really just saying to you,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
when I see you, I get intimidated by you.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
And then I'm trying immediately to counteract that

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
with some kind of power attack.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And meanwhile, you're just a girl going,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
well, he's bigger than me and so this feels really gross

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
and you're incompatible.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And then you end up going out with some beta male type

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
who's equally psychologically inside out, like in different ways.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I know, I know.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
You don't have to tell me.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
So everybody just communicate with each other

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
and I fucked your mama's shoe.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Come on now to harm itself.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Turn the ground upside down.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
He is your boobish breath.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Come on now to harm itself.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Motherfuckin' got a motherfuckin' rap rap.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Motherfuckin' got a rap.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
She's got a motherfuckin' rap rap rap rap

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
rap rap a rap many rap rap a rap rap

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Rap rap rap rap rap governments

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
We're ripping!
