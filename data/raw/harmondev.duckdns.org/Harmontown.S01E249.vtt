00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
From Mountain View, California, the first ever idiot fest, Harmontown, is now in session.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
Spencer Crittenden into the stage, everybody. Spencer!

00:16.000 --> 00:31.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, you know him, you love him, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm not supposed, I shouldn't be offended that these seats are empty, right?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Those are famous people's seats, it's just other famous people don't like me.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
That's the Harmon guarantee, that's fine.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Those were empty for the other people, right?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
No, that was full.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Wait, did Portlandia fill these seats or were those empty too?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
They were all full, weren't they?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
They were full.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
You know why?

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
Because Crooked Fred Armisen makes promises to other famous people that I don't make.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm an outsider.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
A lot of those people, though, were paid by Fred Armisen to be here.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Absolutely.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
They were paid seat fillers.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Crooked Fred Armisen and crazy Kerry Brownstein.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
If you like her, you should hate him.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
If you like him, you should hate her, etc.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Comey's a leaker.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And I drained the swamp.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
The swamp is empty up here.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
But thank you for coming. It's a nice sound.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It's a hot day.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
You're walking around.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
You come into a tent.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
What could be funnier?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Comedy works with high ceilings, outdoors.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
You took a big chance and I want to make it pay off for you.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
It's amazing the first year this festival is going on, right?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Chris Hardwick is trying a new thing.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
He's a good guy.

01:59.000 --> 02:09.000
You guys all know this. You're probably Chris Hardwick fans.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
He's got that amount of niceness that brings out the badness in you.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
When you're talking to him, he makes you wonder what you could do to make him mad.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
What if I ate a baby? Would you frown?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Would that make you upset?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Evil people have that technique.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You've been intoxicated with evil.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
You start coming up with hypotheticals.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
You tell people, what if I ate a baby?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
That's the only one I have.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Because we're in an outdoor tent right now,

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
your hair is blowing in an awesome Stevie Nicks rock and roll fashion.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm trying to think of a Stevie Nicks.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
You can tell from one syllable I was trying to do Stevie Nicks.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And then I gave up.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I want to be Stevie Nicks.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I can't do it. I can't do it no matter how you try.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I kind of got good at Roger Waters last night,

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
because I watched The Wall with Cody in the hotel room,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
because there's not a lot of places to keep out here.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
We just stayed in the hotel room and tried to find The Wall.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Pink Floyd's The Wall, you millennials.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
You don't know what maybe that is.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I misjudged you.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
But it's hard to find The Wall.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
There's something happened.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
By the way, how are you Spencer?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm good.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody. He came out here.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
You're too kind.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
But do you guys think Roger Waters,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
it's like the mastermind behind The Wall.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
So remember The Wall, it came out.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
When I was a kid, it was like, yeah, The Wall.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
It was like education.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And then when The Wall, the Berlin Wall was coming down,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
he did that big concert, and it was like, it's relevant again.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And then Cody was saying like,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
because he just did a concert again,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
because now Trump is like saying, build a wall,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
and now he's doing, he's got a new album.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And Cody's saying, no, you know Roger Waters is stoked about Trump.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
I think that he's just like, time to get back out there.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Ah, the smell of grease paint. Ah, the limelight.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
All right.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Take that, Roger Waters.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Wait, Dan, but you started off by saying

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
that you are doing a pretty good Roger Waters impression these days?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, no, because the acoustics in here

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
probably won't sound like a good impression to you.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
But I was thinking it would be funny if that song,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
you know, that starts with like, I got a little black book,

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
I poems in, got a bag, got a toothbrush, and a comb,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
that if the list just kept going and it wasn't relevant to anything,

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
that he was just like, I got six cowboy hats with ice cream inside two of them,

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
and the third one has a frog with a screwdriver.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So you're not going to do the impression for us?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
No.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
That's the thing, it's like, I can't, no,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
you have to be in an elevator with me or very close with me in bed

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
in order for the, to sound like, Roger Waters is a,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
he wasn't somebody that could have worked in like 1930s radio

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
or at Woodstock or something, he's like,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
he's an artist that's reliant on a certain layered high-tech,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
high-fidelity thing.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
So don't fucking, don't look at me like I'm less than talented.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Blame God for the speed of sound and the laws of nature.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
There's a place in my shower, if I get right into a corner in my shower,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
at a certain place, a certain distance from the corner of my shower,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
I can sound exactly like a cello.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
It sounds exactly like a cello, but I can't do it anywhere else.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
It sounds like me humming like an asshole.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Spencer, do you ever sing in the shower?

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, I sing in the shower.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Do you sing anywhere else? Do you sing in a car?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, I really let loose in my car.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
If there was a car in my car, I'd be in prison, I think.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
I just scream, just scream onomatopoetic sounds.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
By the way, where the fuck are we?

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
That's not to offend you guys.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
It's my own ignorance.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
We get in a plane, we flew for an hour.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
We're in Mountain View, California.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
What is that? Where did we go?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It's where the white people live.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Hawaiian people?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
The white people.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
We went to a restaurant.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
There's a weird contradiction here.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
I think it's a college town, but it's also a place where white people go to die.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
Or invent things that make everyone else live, which kills them.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
They invented the iPhone 7, which I can't plug into the goddamn jack here.

07:01.000 --> 07:11.000
There's a strip mall near our hotel that's the size of fucking Babylon,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
which was famous for its size.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
I'm just saying, it's just endless, endless.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Every single store is some place where you can buy a thousand dollar pants

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
or a plate you can't eat off of.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
But then in between every third one is a restaurant,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
but it's like corn dogs, that's it.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
It's like shitty restaurants where you order at the counter

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
and there's shit on the table and there's just a 16-year-old going,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't want to make you food.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
What's with you people? Pick a lane.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Are you rich or are you going to kill yourselves?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It sounds like you're describing a mall.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You went into a mall.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I guess I haven't been in a mall in a long time.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, that's what it is, okay.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It's not your fault.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
There's a mall in your town and I blame you for it, I guess.

08:04.000 --> 08:13.000
We went into a place, and the young lady that was at the hostess counter,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
when we went in, she said,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Now, I don't...

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Roger Waters!

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
The weird thing is, if she in any way has a disability,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
then this is a terrible thing to do, is to imitate her voice.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I say you roll those dice, Dan.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
It would be in her head.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I guess the idea is you're never supposed to make fun of anybody

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
or imitate them because you might...

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
But then what? Then what do we do?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
What if you found out Trump was disabled?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
He is! He's a terrible president.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Did you hear the news?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What if they diagnosed that?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And then you're like every time you went,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Comey's a leaker, and then you're like,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
That's the equivalent of going,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
What are we supposed to do?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
The answer is just be bad people.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This is our invitation.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
There's a horrible man in the White House.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
You just be a troll now.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
This bitch at this restaurant, fuck her.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Here's how she talked.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
What I'm just saying, she did this thing.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
It was like a Seinfeld low talker thing.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
We couldn't understand her.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It was like a loud music playing.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And she kept going like...

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
And then we just leaned in.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Until one syllable became stuff.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And when you leaned in enough,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
you zoomed in on the wave lengths.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And so you could hear and enhance.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
We're kind of crowded.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
You can sit.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You can order right away.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
But the kitchen's backed up.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Food might take long.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
That's every...

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You can't just say that.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
That's every restaurant's disclaimer.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
That doesn't make any sense.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
We can't compare that to anything.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
By the way, we ordered the food and it came out right away.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So they're like the fastest restaurant in the world.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
But hey, listen, you should know there's something...

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And there was a picture on the wall of Steve Jobs.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It was like a portrait.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
A portrait of Steve Jobs stroking his chin hairs.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
But he was flipping a middle finger.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
And I was like, to me?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
To society?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't... Do you hate the guy?

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
The waiter swiped my credit card on an iPhone.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
But the thing was Steve Jobs flipping me the finger.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Was I him trying to like outdo Einstein's picture

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
of him sticking his tongue out?

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
What does that even mean?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, I don't know.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm not going to say do you love him or hate him.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I'll get some weird biased opinion from 500 people in a tent.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Maybe you all hate Steve Jobs because he didn't give you a kidney.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't know.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I'll never get the truth.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Who made that art?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Some guy that wanted clicks.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And then some restaurant person hanging on a wall

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
who has no sense of time, doesn't know when their restaurant's fast,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
put their niece in charge.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Ugh, we're slow today.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Fuck your city.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I've seen all I can see.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
I know everything about your people.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I pronounce you terrible.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I've had a very...

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Wow.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, now you seem interesting.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
The only negative experience I've had since I was here

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
as walking down University Street Avenue, whatever that is,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
where all the kind of bougie restaurants are,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
and I was walking down the road looking for a bar

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
to have a drink on a Sunday morning.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
But it was all people having brunch and screaming kids

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
so I couldn't hang with that.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Then there was one bar that was too bro-y

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
and it kind of smelled like last night's body odor

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
and I couldn't dig that.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And I'm walking down the road and there's this really good-looking young gal

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
and tight jeans.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
What's she going to stop me for?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
She's standing outside of a shop.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Has anybody ever experienced the makeup people

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
that stand out there and fucking stop you?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Anybody?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I met some of the people who crossed the street around that place

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
and this really good-looking gal.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
She goes, you want a sample? You shave?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
You want some aftershave lotion? It's really good.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I go, okay, cool, thank you.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Wait, wait, wait, come here.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Something else that's really, really good.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm like, okay.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
She goes, come inside.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
What do you use for your skin?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And she says, come in and she sits me down

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and she puts some shit, like some collagen stuff.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
It cleans off my eye,

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
like some foamy cleanser eye, I presume.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
And she cleans my eye and she puts some shit on my face

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
and it takes a folder and starts fanning it.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And it feels like there's cement on my eyeball.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And then he only puts it on one eye

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and then she goes, okay, now put your hand over your eye.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
And she holds a mirror up to me to show me how...

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It's like, look at the bags under your other eye.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Look at how shitty this eye looks over here.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Like, do you feel this one tightening up?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Well, keep your hand there.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Keep your hand on the one that's tightening up and being good.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Do you feel how...

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Look at how shit you look over here.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You fucking, you're 43-year-old alcoholic.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
You look like shit over here.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And then she goes, now, now take your hand off.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
You see, there was no fucking difference.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Except this side of my face

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
felt like there was plaster on it.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And this side felt fine.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
And I still look like I stayed up too late last night

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and had a million beers.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, well, some people have had their health care taken away.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Anyways.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
This fucking guy.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh, hell no!

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
High road.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
High road.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Do not take the low road.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Low road is off limits.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
High road.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Dance limits.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
That's what's going to be in this tent an hour from now.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
They have the lights.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
They have the equipment.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
They are ready to go.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
What was your...

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
We are in the way of a fucking EDM revolution.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
These chairs are obstructionists.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
You are going to be happy when I'm gone.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
That's my 44-year-old depression of whatever EDM is.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You, like, what?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
That's your prom night, you fucking old piece of shit.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Can we...

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Do we have the capabilities tech people back there

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
to get some EDM lights going from the EDM tent?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Can we do an EDM check?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Let's just make sure it's ready.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Like, do you have beats you can put on?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
No new taxes.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Comey.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Comey's a leaker.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Someone's got a tambourine.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's like a tribal thing here now.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
You bought a fucking tambourine to the show.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Oh, it's got lights on it.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Wow.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh, it's like an MDMA tambourine.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
It's like blinking lights on it.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And the people around him are like,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
please kill yourself.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
The people around him are going to kill themselves

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
at his cult meeting six months from now.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
He's a charismatic, glowing tambourine guy.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Be honest, are you on Molly or anything right now?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
A little bit?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
A tiny bit?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Are you coming down off last night?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
All right.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Are you criss-crossing with Molly and something else?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
The tambourine doesn't lie.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Who's on something that would make him freak out

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
if I started talking directly to them?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Hands went up and like, I'm on something,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
but don't want to discuss it on stage with you.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You're doing what I do in your house.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You just covered your mouth.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Who here right now is holding felonious amounts

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
of class A narcotics?

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I would like to come up and discuss that with us

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
in front of the police.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Now, we don't want anybody up here.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Look at that.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
There's a microphone in the middle.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
They're drawing season three.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Have you ever done Harmontown?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
In fact, by now, they're done drawing it.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It's sitting in a vault.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
He keeps saying that I've been to the studio.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
They're just doing nothing over there.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Yes, because they're drawing.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
They don't give a shit about the show.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
They don't care about you.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
That's true because they're drawing it.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
We cared a long time ago.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I feel like I go out and I Instagram me getting my mail

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
box and I'm like, that's spider scary.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And 15 dudes are like,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
yeah, this is what you're doing?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Make Rick and Morty.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I go to the studio.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
There's a big dry erase board

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
and it's just pictures of tits and dicks and balls.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
That's what they're drawing

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
over at Starburns Industries.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The people that are responsible for it taking this long

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
finished working on it a long time ago.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
That's the beauty of being slow,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
shitty people that in the hand

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
work off to talented, fast people.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
They're behind schedule,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
but I can't do anything about it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Which country did you send it off to

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
to have animated and drawn?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Canada. A little

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
sweatshop called Canada.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Boo indeed.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You're outsourcing jobs

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
by American.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
That disgusting troll

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Justin Trudeau.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
What a grody

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
autocrat

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
leaping out of caves

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
taking selfies with tourists.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Sexy

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
gross monster.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I just want to

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
cuddle him to death.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Roll around with him

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
in a big pool of syrup.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Maple syrup.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Is that what they make up there?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Maple syrup? I'm going to make maple syrup

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
up there.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Because I'm a boot

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
to come.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That shouldn't get

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
that big a reaction.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Whatever

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
makes you give that big a reaction.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
They were just happy that that bit

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
had come to a close.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
We recognized that you're doing comedy.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
That's like giving a cat peanut butter

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
if it just kind of does something.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Check guy out there with the

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
light panel.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Who's doing the lights back there?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
What's your name? I'm non-binary

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and my name is

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
nothing.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Sorry to be funny.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I was like a tech guy or tech lady

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and then you like I wrote that and you were like

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
it's stellar.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
What's your name?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Carter.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
If Dan ever tells a joke that totally

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
bombs just go right into EDM place.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
But I'm not telling jokes.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
That'll be the signal

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
that you guys are supposed to laugh

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and this show

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
is no Portlandia.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What if I say something that works?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Can't I get a celebration for that?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Carter we'll leave it to you. If you want to celebrate it

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
when something really good happens

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
or if you want to be ironic

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
when there's a real turd.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Or if I say hit it.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
That too.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That's another. So keep your eyes peeled for all that.

19:26.000 --> 19:38.000
Let's just test it right now. Hit it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Whip!

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Whip!

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That was good. That was just a test.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Okay.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Alright.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You're ready to go.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, I almost finished the word wicked.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That's how I was getting into it.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
But I was getting tired

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
so it's good you stopped.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm going to be catching my breath

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
for the next few measures.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah, so it's...

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But you're already out of breath

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
from that four second of dancing.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
That's what I just said.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
You can't shoot me through a whole eye shot.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
It's called self-deprecation.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It makes me invincible.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Everyone on the internet

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
with the fucking I'll hit you

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
where you just hit yourself.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I hit myself there.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I said I'm fat. I said it already.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm not fat anymore.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
You can't make me fat.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I said I'm fat.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That's just a big crowd of fat people over there.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
A bus from a camp that they...

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Let's go see our hero.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And then now...

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
I fucked that up.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Mountain View.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So most of you guys are

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and ladies and

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
anything you're going to...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Are you students?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It's a college town, right?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Okay, so it's like...

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Let me keep walking through guesses.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It's like Woodstock.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
There's nothing normally here

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
but we all decided to come here.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Okay.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Got it. I don't know what my third guess was.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It's a weird...

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Shut...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I can't speak.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Fidelio.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Fidelio, but the I is a 1.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
You have to watch the movie.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
That's the password that Tom Cruise uses

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
to get into the sex party.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Do you guys think that Hollywood

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
is controlled by an elite

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
cabal of pedophiles?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Because there was an article

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
where Nicole Kidman said that Stanley Kubrick

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
told her that was the case

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and that now she's catching some flak for that.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
There was recently a big thing

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
about British pedophiles

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
up in high, high government.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That was a real thing and we kind of like...

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, that was a weird thing.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And you'd expect if pedophiles controlled the world

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
that story wouldn't be huge

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and it wasn't.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So you're a believer.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
No, no.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I think it could be real.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
It's really crazy, but it's weird to talk about it

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
without seeming insane.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
The reason you can't talk about it

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
is because you'll either be a target

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
of a secret cabal of pedophiles

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
or in your enthusiasm

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
for explaining to people that it's possible

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
you'll come off like a pedophile

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
because you'll be like, think about it.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
If you were rich, you'd fuck kids.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's the first thing you do.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Hit it.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Hit it.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Pedophilia.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It's the, it's the,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
it's the Maserati of sex.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Heck, go to heck

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
when you want to fuck a kid.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Go to get your neck out.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Eat out a 12-year-old

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
like a Ferrari going all the way.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I want a yacht,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
but I don't want anyone over 13

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
today.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Ha!

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
That one took a lot out of me.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Aerobically

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
and spiritually.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I think we all lost a little part of ourselves

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
in that one. That was rough.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I lost two pounds and gained

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
a horn.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm going to die and God

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
will be fine with it.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm out of breath.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I got to get back on the elliptical.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Yeah, I was so proud of myself.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I heard them cheering and I was like, kicking.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
And then my stomach was like,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
what do you mean?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
You got to stop.

23:46.000 --> 24:12.000
I got to fuck more kids.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
I put on a bib with a little chin on it.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Time to fuck a kid.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
The applause is getting less enthusiastic.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
As the...

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
No, no, no, no.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I wasn't

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
telling you to pump it up.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I was

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
standing next to you saying,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
we all feel that we don't want this to be a runner.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
That's what I'm saying.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Your natural behavior is right

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and good.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I think that diminished applause,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
that slightly less applause,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
was kind of the feeling that that was Act 2.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
That was the Empire Strikes Back of a Trilogy.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
The payoff will be

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
in Act 3 of your child's

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
pedophilia of sex.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I got to tell you, in most pedophile driven stories,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Act 3 is not that satisfying.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's either someone

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
escapes from a garage

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
or it's told from the other side.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Dear idiot fest,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
here's why our sponsorship is being revoked.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It's signed Microsoft,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Pentium,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Google,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Monster Energy,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and of course Red Bull.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Are all those stormtroopers walking around?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Are they all cosplayers?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Those aren't...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
They're real stormtroopers.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Because I walked out

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
and the first thing I saw was like 14 stormtroopers.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Are they like the waiters?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
They look like...

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Pardon?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh, shit.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It's like a Union, like a fake Union.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
That's cool, that's cool.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It's like Civil War reenactors.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
They put them in that drawer

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
in terms of

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
sexual probability.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
It sounds like a bully thing you say.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
They're not going to get laid because they're nerds, whatever.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I mean, look at me. I'm out.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
What else can we rate in terms of

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
sexual probability?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Chances of reigning men.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
20%

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
partly cloudy.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Anyways,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
that would be a smart thing for Trump

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
to do.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
He could just pretend to be a Star Wars fan

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and then he'd have

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
the street cred with nerds

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
and then he'd start dressing cops like stormtroopers.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
You could really beat down the people

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
that would be the first to resist.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
You could target high IQ people

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
and take their asthma inhalers away

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
and step on their faces

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and if anyone had a problem with it,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Trump would be like, I don't get why these people

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
are such haters about Star Wars.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Like,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I'm looking forward to the movies.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I enjoy it. Give me a little pleasure.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You know, and you'd have people

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
behind you more.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Because he's really hurting.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
He's not going to do fine at all.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
We're all going to die.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
We're all in the midst of dying.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
It's permission to have fun.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
If you're 25, I'm sorry.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Sorry about the burning husk

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
filled with water.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Good luck growing gills

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
figuring out a way to express yourself

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
in coal

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
dust

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
on the hammered flat surface

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
that used to be a radiator

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
in your fucking

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
eared horn cave

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
drilled into the

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
side of a

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
ruined skyscraper

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
by a robot pterodactyl

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
powered by coal.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
My vision.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Fuck you, Alan Moore. I have a vision too.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Anyone can do this.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It doesn't just have to be zeppelins

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
if it's a dystopia. Maybe it's robot pterodactyls.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Thank you.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
All right.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Let's get on with the show.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I say so, yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Let's stop delaying things.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
That was all the cold open.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Idiot, yeah.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
But one of the eyes is a one,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
but you don't know which one.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I don't know.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
When you try to Google it, you write an idiot fest

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and nothing comes up. You've got to put the 10 in there

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
and it's all fucked up.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Maybe it's genius. I don't know.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
He's Hardwick.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
No, I go.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I go where Hardwick tells me to go.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
You know, idiot like that is like

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
in Apple stores

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
when a customer is an idiot,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
you might say they're having an ID10T

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
error and it's a code name

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
for they're an idiot.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You don't have to clap.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
That's just

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
relevant, right?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
How is that a clever code?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Oh, you say ID10,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
so it's if you say it in front of the customer

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
they don't know.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Yeah.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I was in the back of a squad car once

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
and the cop said to another cop,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
yeah, I got a DFW

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and I said drunk fucking,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
god damn it, it was a DFI.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I think it was a drunk fucking idiot

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and the cop was like,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
yeah, I cracked your code.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
You're not going to use code.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It was like three letters.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I was just like, yeah, I know what I am.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And you're not going to offend me.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Like, what do you, what happens now?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Like, I change squad cars,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
quick waste and taxpayer money, take me home.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm drunk.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Were you being arrested?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
No, because I'm the fucking Teflon drunk, man.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I was, I saw the cop,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I pulled over, got out of the car,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
he came roaring up. What were you doing?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Not driving.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
That's what counts.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
And he said, oh yeah,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
where are you going? I said, to a friend.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Or I said, I'm coming from a friend.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
And he said, what's your friend?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I said, Carl?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And he's like,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
where's Carl live?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I said, I don't know, I'm drunk.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Can't remember where Carl lives.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I just know I wasn't driving and I walked.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
He said, what if I said I saw you driving?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I'd say, I don't know, I'm drunk.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I just came from Carl's.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And he said, what if I went up to

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
every one of these houses and knocked on it

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
and asked for Carl? I'd say, at that point,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
who's winning?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And he put me in the car

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
and then made me wait forever.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And another cop came up

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
and said, what do you got? A couple DFI's.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And I said, I know I'm still drunk.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Still smarter than all of you.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Like, it's not that big a deal.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I respect you because

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
you can shoot people.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Not because you're smart.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Drive me home.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm sorry, I took this into an ugly

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
place.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, we took

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
a kind of a sad turn from

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
pedophilia into that dark

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
realm.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Remember the good old days

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
of pedophile jokes, you guys?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Now, there's a kid, there's a kid there.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I can see there's kids everywhere.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I got that

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
born identity kid vision.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Why is that, Dan?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Because I protect them.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Why do I

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
know where every exit and child is?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
This better not translate to any online

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
medium.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It's just, it's all about

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
context these days.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It's 442, I feel like we should

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
maybe, do we?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Should we? Up to you, baby.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Let me crunch some numbers for a second.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm kind of famous for it.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
My math skills.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
That's like the 50 minute to go mark.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
50?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
No, 40.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Let's hash all this out.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Let's meet one person

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
from the area.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I don't know how you get them.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
What are you doing? You're running up

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
to the microphone.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Okay, let's meet you.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
All right.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
This is great.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Wait, don't look behind you, sir.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh, they already voted.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Do not look behind you.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Whatever you do, do not turn around.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Wait, what is going on?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
What is the DMV?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
What the fuck is going on?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Speed round.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah, well, okay.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I mean, fine.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
What is your name? My name is Chewy.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Chewy? Welcome, Chewy.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So, first off, I want to say

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
that Abed was the first character

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I've ever seen in anything that connected directly

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
to me. All right.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And no one will ever shut down the Delta Cubes.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
All right. Oh, nice.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Oh, man. The Delta Cubes.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So, Heat Vision and Jack

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
was one of my favorite shows,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and I only saw one episode of it.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I was wondering if you feel like

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
the timing, the cultural timing

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
was what made that not work

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
versus other things you're doing now or if there's some other?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Heat Vision and Jack.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I don't think it was cultural time.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Well, I guess maybe cultural if you've got...

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah, it was...

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
The audiences weren't fragmented enough

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
that one million people

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
wanting to watch something meant

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Cha-ching yet, which it now does.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I mean, and I think a million people

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
would have liked to watch Heat Vision and Jack

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
because it asked the question, what is television?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
But back then it was like, I think you'd need

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
20 million people to want to watch something

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
before somebody wants to make something.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
You know, Jack Black on a talking motorcycle.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It was great. It was a pilot,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
and they didn't pick it up.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
They thought it would be expensive,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and it was like, there were things before that.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
You're just a baby.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Sledgehammer. I'll say these words to you.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Google them. Look well.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
A naked gun.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Or what was the police squad?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
There's shows that kind of like

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
skew absurdity and stuff,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
and then it's like, oh, can I watch this or is this a sketch?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I think it was just that.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
In a few days, you could put something like

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Heat Vision and Jack on sci-fi, maybe.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Too long an answer.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Thank you, Chewie.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I didn't know we could do it at Q&A.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
It's great though.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Oh, shit.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It's Craft Punk, actually.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It's what?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
It's from the Eric Andre show.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It's called Craft Punk.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I think you can hear yourself

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
in there.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
It's called Craft Punk.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Like, you know, Daft Punk, but

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I throw cheese at people and

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
feel like that.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
But, um, I, um...

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Well, first off, I want to dance with you.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
If we can do a dance-off, that'd be cool.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Okay.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
What do you got?

35:06.000 --> 35:16.000
Oh, shit.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
This is the most applause you've ever gotten.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
He wins!

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Dan is doing push-ups.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Dan, he did the worm, not push-ups.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
He was doing the worm, I think.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I was kind of just, like, humping the ground, kind of.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah, I'm hammering it.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
It's like he's taking a little,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
taking a little nap.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Alright, Dan, let it go.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Let it go.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Thank you very much.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Thank you, whatever your name was.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
It was, uh, I'll call you Carl.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Hello, Sir, what's your name?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
His second question was about

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
world hunger.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Hi, I'm John,

36:02.000 --> 36:08.400
John, and I was wondering, this is a question for all three of you, what guest at Harming

36:08.400 --> 36:10.880
Quest would you ever want to join?

36:10.880 --> 36:13.920
Who would be our favorite guest to have on Harming Quest?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.720
Yeah, that hasn't appeared yet.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.720
Chris Hardwick!

36:16.720 --> 36:17.720
Woo!

36:17.720 --> 36:18.720
There you go.

36:18.720 --> 36:26.320
He asked, were we talking about getting Dwayne The Rock Johnson on?

36:26.320 --> 36:32.160
I was Dwayne The Rock Johnson!

36:32.160 --> 36:33.160
Famous people are great.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.960
They don't come to my show, but they're great.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.480
Yes, old timey root beer spokesmodel.

36:39.480 --> 36:46.280
So, having seen Harming Quest, I know there's a lot of chaos to your creative process.

36:46.280 --> 36:51.360
How much do you feel that fan theories influence where Rick and Morty goes, because some of

36:51.360 --> 36:55.280
those fan theories are really sophisticated, and you might not have meant them, but I

36:55.280 --> 36:56.880
bet you could run with them.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.840
Well, I'm sure fan theories are just as good, if not better, of anything that we would come

37:00.840 --> 37:08.000
up with in a writer's room, but I don't personally go to those forums since community, because

37:08.000 --> 37:11.320
I don't want to be influenced.

37:11.320 --> 37:15.760
It's sci-fi, so it's like higher stakes to let yourself be influenced by a theory, you

37:15.760 --> 37:16.760
know what I mean?

37:16.760 --> 37:19.840
And also, to tell you the truth, I hope this doesn't spoil anything, but I don't think

37:19.840 --> 37:23.680
Rick and Morty, there's not going to be an underlying fucking, like, I don't know, we

37:23.680 --> 37:28.840
have conversations in the room, and then one's canon to canon, but I'm not a person that

37:28.840 --> 37:32.680
would ever be like, okay, from the beginning of the series, I've always got this thing

37:32.680 --> 37:36.920
that inside the back, behind his ear, if you look real close, there's an egg, and the egg

37:36.920 --> 37:41.760
means the whole show's a lie, like, I don't, he's an old drunk guy that's smarter than

37:41.760 --> 37:46.600
everyone, and for some reason, he's incredibly selfish and wants to, I mean, we'll figure

37:46.600 --> 37:49.440
it out as we go.

37:49.440 --> 37:55.480
But I have seen, like, I did have, like, I've had, like, when we sat down and started writing

37:55.480 --> 37:58.680
the show, I was like, should we have one of those, just in case?

37:58.680 --> 38:00.680
And Mike McMahon, one of the writers, was like, how about this one?

38:00.680 --> 38:04.200
I was like, holy shit, that's amazing, let's do that.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.640
And then two years later, I could see people were like, what if this?

38:07.640 --> 38:12.160
And I was like, fuck that, no, no, like, if you can sit and shouldn't do that, like,

38:12.160 --> 38:16.080
audiences are a render farm of ideas, they have nothing to do but sit there and think,

38:16.080 --> 38:18.600
like, so if your show is payoff based, you're fucking yourself.

38:18.600 --> 38:27.040
I think, but I'm just an old Batman that just stops staring at me like that.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.540
Alright, thank you.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.560
We have time for a couple more, we can't do everybody, because we have some business

38:31.560 --> 38:33.560
to attend to.

38:33.560 --> 38:38.280
When you guys, you guys do festivals, do you stick around and watch bands, or do you go

38:38.280 --> 38:40.960
straight to the hotel room for Minecrafts?

38:40.960 --> 38:46.120
It's funny, you should ask that, sir, because last night, because last night, the saddest

38:46.120 --> 38:51.160
text message in the world came from Jeff to all of us, because he went to Weezer and Spencer

38:51.160 --> 38:56.360
stayed at the hotel and played Minecraft, and it would play, Jeff sent us video and

38:56.360 --> 39:00.240
then said, have fun playing Minecraft, and it was sad.

39:00.240 --> 39:05.960
Yeah, because Steve Levy, if you know Steve, he'll probably come up here in a little bit,

39:05.960 --> 39:11.840
we went down to see OK Go, and the people here at the festival gave us nice tickets,

39:11.840 --> 39:17.440
check out in the main amphitheater, and we saw that, we came backstage and had a drink,

39:17.440 --> 39:20.880
you know, like, you know, Demetri Martins hanging out back there in Hardwick, and we

39:20.880 --> 39:25.320
walked back out, and to get back to our seats, we have to walk by the front row, and we walked

39:25.320 --> 39:31.680
by in the security guard that is in front of the photograph pit, right in the front,

39:31.680 --> 39:35.760
happened to be a Who's Len is an Anyway fan, he's like, oh man, Jeff, he's like a stoner

39:35.760 --> 39:41.800
dude, he's super cool, and he goes, oh, I'm a big fan, man, I said, cool, can I come

39:41.800 --> 39:42.800
in the photo pit?

39:42.800 --> 39:47.000
He's like, yeah, so we just watched the first three songs of Weezer right in the front,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.560
and we just took a bunch of photos and sent it to these assholes who were home in the hotel

39:50.560 --> 39:51.560
playing Minecraft.

39:51.560 --> 39:56.960
Well, wait, I mean, that's a cool story, but how can that match, like, I was in the overworld,

39:56.960 --> 40:01.880
and I went through an obsidian portal, where there happened to be gasts flying around in

40:01.880 --> 40:06.840
lava rocks everywhere, and I didn't know where I was going, but then I found a blaze and

40:06.840 --> 40:11.960
I shot a fireball, I mean, you didn't get a fireball shot at you, no, I didn't.

40:11.960 --> 40:22.280
Oh my God, you guys, millions have been deprived of their health care, hit it.

40:22.280 --> 40:29.680
The High Road Dance, everybody, let's give it up for MC High Road.

40:29.680 --> 40:37.640
When you take a low road, you won't get far, take the High Road, tell people where you

40:37.640 --> 40:45.960
are, say, I'm bisexual, you hurt me in your contextual argument, because this is who I

40:45.960 --> 40:51.840
am, took the High Road to the peanut butter and jam of the real conversation, I fucked

40:51.840 --> 41:01.240
your mama all across the nation, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

41:01.240 --> 41:02.400
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

41:02.400 --> 41:07.640
All right, no, I didn't mean that bisexual people take the High Road, that was a weird,

41:07.640 --> 41:09.720
I didn't, that was just say weird.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.720
What did you mean, Dan, what did you mean?

41:10.720 --> 41:12.160
I don't know, I was rapping.

41:12.160 --> 41:16.320
And then, so MC High Road just immediately starts fucking your mother, that's the High

41:16.320 --> 41:17.320
Road, do you?

41:17.320 --> 41:21.120
No, I think MC High Road is like has a has an ironic

41:22.200 --> 41:24.200
Propulsion for the low road

41:25.000 --> 41:29.760
That's like how old was old dirty bastard. We don't know. I mean he was older than Wu Tang, but

41:30.760 --> 41:32.120
All right

41:32.120 --> 41:37.240
All right, Dan, you're gonna fuck any mothers tonight. Will you mind fucking my mama?

41:37.240 --> 41:45.080
Oh, sir, I would be honored. All right, we'll take one more question and we're gonna play some D&D

41:47.640 --> 41:51.560
I just want to say I listen to your guys's podcast every day that it you know

41:51.560 --> 41:55.920
It comes on and I actually wanted to talk to Spencer and ask if you've seen the street

41:56.000 --> 41:58.800
That is your last name. That's like really close

41:59.680 --> 42:05.280
Maybe not this exact one or maybe yeah, cuz I've driven around Northern California fair amount

42:05.280 --> 42:11.600
But I've seen a ton of streets not even on purpose. They just drive by streets that are cringed in so it happens

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
There's way too many of them. It's weird

42:14.040 --> 42:16.040
Well, it's here and it made me

42:16.720 --> 42:22.760
Thank you so much. I'll check it out. All right. Thank you very much. Oh, we have mr. Meeseeks is here. I think everybody

42:27.880 --> 42:31.440
Really really alarming. Yeah, that is

42:31.440 --> 42:34.880
That is for the for the podcast listener a lot of people

42:36.720 --> 42:38.720
There's a lot of

42:40.440 --> 42:44.240
No, I so did myself my first time

42:45.440 --> 42:47.440
However, I do have one question

42:47.440 --> 42:49.440
I have several questions for you

42:50.640 --> 42:52.480
But go ahead. I

42:52.480 --> 42:58.140
Mean I serve you if you have a question. No, no, I was I was just making a terrible joke. Go ahead, please

42:58.140 --> 43:04.020
Well, if you tell a Meeseek that you have a question, he's not gonna he's gonna stop this pain. What do you want?

43:04.020 --> 43:05.820
I just want to

43:05.820 --> 43:11.300
Just this is you know, we didn't press the button. You're going you're barking up the wrong tree dog

43:11.900 --> 43:13.500
This is bad nerdery

43:13.500 --> 43:18.340
Well his task if someone might have pressed a button and said go out and learn everything about stuff

43:18.540 --> 43:22.020
We don't know. All right. One of those Meeseeks. So I just want to know

43:23.140 --> 43:26.420
Even though Jerry has been divorced and whatnot

43:26.420 --> 43:33.180
Season three some of us are still left around. We need to know if his short game is gonna get any better

43:39.660 --> 43:42.300
Are you saying you're more of a stickler me seek to leave

43:43.580 --> 43:50.260
Meeseeks I wasn't even in the scene, but I mean I yeah, no, I think eventually he could become a purpose

43:50.260 --> 43:56.020
This is follow through me see yeah, no, I think he'll eventually become better

43:56.020 --> 44:00.860
But while he learns they go dip your Meeseek feet in a river

44:01.780 --> 44:04.540
You know like do like awakening stuff. I

44:05.940 --> 44:11.180
Don't know how much along I can this like this. He better be Tiger Woods five years ago tomorrow

44:12.020 --> 44:15.940
It's a circular conversation at this point. I'm just saying like I can't control it

44:15.940 --> 44:22.420
I mean, you're not gonna make me disappear anyway. So thanks for helping. All right. Well. Goodbye. Thank you, mr. Meeseeks

44:26.740 --> 44:32.100
I want to I have I want to know what's in that fanny pack so bad most basic conversations are

44:33.100 --> 44:39.660
Costumes have like bigger head like they make the bigger head. Yeah, it's like it's like a weird to make it to let it be regular

44:39.660 --> 44:46.420
sized head is like John Wayne Gacy's pointy clown makeup. It's like it's just a subtle but fundamental choice to have a

44:46.420 --> 44:49.700
Meeseek with like a tiny head and I'm like, okay

44:49.700 --> 45:09.700
All right, well the opposite of tiny heads one of the biggest brains in the world. Let's bring up Steve Levy to the stage everybody

45:11.060 --> 45:13.060
How's it going everybody?

45:13.060 --> 45:19.860
Man, hi. We had a pretty good night last night, didn't we? We had a great night. Yeah, we totally partied down. Yeah. Yeah

45:19.940 --> 45:25.260
It's wonderful. Lots of good music. Yeah a lot of good times. Yeah a lot of memories

45:25.980 --> 45:29.620
Memories that we'll have for the rest of our lives. It was a nice harmonious night

45:31.980 --> 45:36.300
It's fine, I don't care I watched the wall with my girlfriend. I had a great time

45:37.660 --> 45:39.660
Okay, I

45:39.660 --> 45:43.820
Don't get jealous of people anymore. I don't care. I have a perfect life

45:45.660 --> 45:48.380
You seem pretty mad about your restaurant experience today

45:49.020 --> 45:53.500
It's a bad restaurant. I don't understand. They didn't they also didn't have salt on the table

45:53.500 --> 45:58.340
I don't like restaurants that don't put salt on the table. I feel judged by them like I have low blood pressure

45:58.340 --> 46:04.300
So judge someone else like I if you serve hash browns at your restaurant, you don't put salt on the table

46:04.300 --> 46:10.300
I what you're saying to me is wait it gets better

46:13.660 --> 46:18.980
Nothing makes you question what you're currently saying like the vision of someone just walking out. You're like wait, what am I doing?

46:18.980 --> 46:20.620
What am I doing?

46:20.620 --> 46:26.940
It doesn't matter. They might have diarrhea. They're not trying to send that signal, but it makes you really think twice

46:26.940 --> 46:30.300
I think everyone but they walk they walked out on a pair. Do you think they both have diarrhea?

46:30.300 --> 46:35.620
Everyone who's ever talking should always have to have an image of someone walking out of a tent

46:36.180 --> 46:38.300
While they're talking it'll keep you on your toes

46:39.460 --> 46:43.660
All right, so we're gonna play our second round of our new campaign of Pathfinder everybody

46:45.940 --> 46:47.060
Yeah

46:47.060 --> 46:50.820
Now leave you weren't you weren't with us for the first for the for the pilot episode

46:50.820 --> 46:55.500
I was not but I certainly listen to it. Yeah, we didn't get a lot done

46:55.500 --> 47:03.900
Did anybody here hear that for here last week's D&D? All right, not that many suspense or you're gonna have to catch us up

47:03.900 --> 47:06.860
It would not a lot happens. So you're kind of coming in pretty fresh like

47:07.860 --> 47:10.380
You'll be easily caught up on this, right?

47:10.780 --> 47:14.300
And do you want to lay on the intro for us? What huh? You want to give us the intro?

47:15.060 --> 47:19.500
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have character sheets for us? Sure. Yeah

47:21.220 --> 47:23.220
All right, I'll come grab those I

47:23.220 --> 47:27.020
Think that you know one thing that's gonna

47:28.500 --> 47:33.980
Gonna be tough because we're gonna have to like make sure we hear each other. It's a tent

47:35.420 --> 47:37.820
We're doing stuff that's going into Canon. Yeah

47:38.460 --> 47:43.300
Rob or Carter was it? Is there a way to get a little bit more of our mics in the monitor so we can get up here

47:43.300 --> 47:44.980
Each other a bit more

47:44.980 --> 47:48.260
That's a check one two two. There we go. Oh, yeah, Dan talk

47:48.260 --> 47:53.020
What if that results in feedback, you know, they the right line back don't point your mic at the monitor

47:53.020 --> 47:55.300
You've never been in a rock band? No

47:59.540 --> 48:02.060
All right, I'm just looking for my character sheet

48:03.220 --> 48:05.220
It's fine

48:05.260 --> 48:06.660
Not cares

48:06.660 --> 48:12.420
We're not doing anything a lot of people. Spencer. I'm gonna give you the intro music and you're gonna lay it on us. All right, what?

48:13.620 --> 48:15.900
You can't hear it. No, it's great

48:15.900 --> 48:23.420
All right, you guys last time a town was in peril and they dispatched the church

48:23.420 --> 48:27.180
That is to say you guys to help solve the problem

48:27.620 --> 48:36.100
Upon seeing a house you immediately demand an entrance pushed past the homeowners and went upstairs to a cost of child

48:37.660 --> 48:41.580
Bedridden you attacked the child and punched him in the face

48:41.580 --> 48:46.340
Luckily it turned out he was possessed by a demon. So it wasn't like

48:47.260 --> 48:51.020
Entirely terrible, but it was bad news and a ghost came out

48:51.020 --> 48:55.980
Oh boy the demon attacked and you guys didn't know what was going on

48:55.980 --> 49:03.100
And so you told the mom to make some bad soup like Adams family and then you left and then it was over

49:03.860 --> 49:05.860
That's all

49:07.780 --> 49:09.780
We're caught up

49:09.780 --> 49:11.780
Okay

49:11.780 --> 49:16.980
The most important thing that I don't have is my list of spells. Yep

49:25.500 --> 49:30.860
I feel like you you like it that I'm not prepared. Yeah, it's great

49:30.860 --> 49:36.300
I'm really digging this can't you can't you go on our so can't you go on our slack down and find your spells are on there

49:36.300 --> 49:39.860
They I don't know if I have a list of my spells on the slack

49:41.060 --> 49:43.580
Players handbook. Oh, but it doesn't thank you sir. I

49:44.940 --> 49:47.820
I'll try you know, I mean the other thing is that

49:49.020 --> 49:55.940
Going on to slack will require me to shut off my iPad and turn it back on so I can get on the

49:57.020 --> 49:58.220
AT&T

49:58.220 --> 50:03.340
Fucking network interesting. How about if I just spend this adventure eating shit?

50:03.340 --> 50:09.820
Well, yeah, you can not cast spells or you could cast healing spells. It'll be great. Let's worry about it

50:10.860 --> 50:14.180
So, where are you guys you guys you just left a house?

50:15.420 --> 50:17.060
and

50:17.060 --> 50:19.060
Diarrhea juniors there

50:20.140 --> 50:22.900
Hey guys, hey DJ. How's it going?

50:23.740 --> 50:31.500
Good. I I finally caught up with you after you left me in the last village to clean up that mess you made

50:31.500 --> 50:36.660
Yeah, well, you know, we had the wagon and the horses and you know and six o'clock means six o'clock. You were late

50:36.660 --> 50:38.660
And so we we left with that you

50:39.420 --> 50:42.220
All right. Well, I'm here now. Yeah

50:42.980 --> 50:45.220
What did I miss we well?

50:46.580 --> 50:49.060
Carlos punched a child that was in bed and

50:50.180 --> 50:53.180
A ghost came out, but we didn't know how to get rid of the demon ghosts

50:53.180 --> 50:57.140
So we left and we're gonna go investigate these burned out ruins over here. We think

50:57.140 --> 51:04.020
All right, let's do it. I mean, do you have any spells that you think could get a demon out of a out of a child?

51:04.020 --> 51:07.220
I'm just a fighter. Okay, forget it then

51:08.660 --> 51:11.160
So we're pretending that we do you

51:11.780 --> 51:17.580
Before we started the last one or what did we you've known me? Yeah, it took me under your wing

51:18.380 --> 51:23.460
This is kind of unceremonious. This is like reunion. I know he wasn't he was just late

51:23.460 --> 51:28.700
He didn't make the wagon time at late in time. He was back taking care of another thing and you and I went ahead

51:28.700 --> 51:31.660
You don't you remember you exclaimed my work here is done

51:31.660 --> 51:36.620
And then everything was on fire and I had to stay behind and just put out the fires

51:38.700 --> 51:41.800
And you left so you're kind of like an assistant to me

51:43.460 --> 51:45.460
Whatever you won't think

51:45.980 --> 51:47.980
All right

51:47.980 --> 51:55.500
Yeah, hey DJ, you're not his assistant. You're you're a priest of the silver flame just like he is just like I am

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
Don't let him don't let him talk to you like that. I

51:58.500 --> 52:05.980
Appreciate him. He can say what he wants, you know, I feel like he's walking all over you. Okay. I don't let's go check out

52:05.980 --> 52:11.300
There's ruins that were across the from the street from the kid that I punched

52:11.300 --> 52:19.620
You walk over there and you see the charred burnt ruins of what looks like it was a barn and then a house

52:20.220 --> 52:24.580
There's only kind of the skeletal structure of blackened buildings. I

52:26.740 --> 52:29.220
Investigate the blackened charred. Oh

52:30.020 --> 52:34.460
Man, it looks like it was a recent fire. There's ashes everywhere

52:34.460 --> 52:42.220
Do either of you have any magical ability to kind of find important things while my iPad boots I

52:47.460 --> 52:50.260
Take out my magnifying lens. Oh

52:51.300 --> 52:52.820
Shit and

52:52.820 --> 52:54.820
Examine the charring wood

52:55.620 --> 53:00.220
Examining the charred wood you see that the floorboards don't line up perfectly

53:00.220 --> 53:07.620
Hidden among the ashes in the dust there seems to be the outline of some sort of trapdoor or something

53:07.660 --> 53:09.660
It looks like there's a trapdoor

53:10.060 --> 53:12.060
Nicely done squire

53:12.060 --> 53:14.060
Thank you

53:14.780 --> 53:16.780
Let's examine it

53:17.060 --> 53:19.060
Can I do a trap door?

53:19.300 --> 53:21.780
I I pick up like a like a

53:22.260 --> 53:28.740
Chunk of like burnt wood throw it at the trapdoor to see if it springs any mechanism. No, it doesn't it just lands

53:28.740 --> 53:32.540
It's it kind of it hits as if it's like a little hollow underneath it

53:32.540 --> 53:36.060
But otherwise it just lands. All right, I go up to it and I wipe off some of the charred

53:36.540 --> 53:42.340
Dust ash away from it and try to lift up the door. All right, you do that inside

53:42.980 --> 53:45.140
You see two charred corpses

53:48.140 --> 53:50.140
Appropriate I

53:51.780 --> 53:55.620
Investigate them to see if there's any identifying like clothing or marks or anything like that

53:55.620 --> 54:01.580
Uh, not really they seem really heavily burned as if they perished in the blaze

54:01.820 --> 54:05.780
Do they look like do they look like humans like human? Oh, yeah, they look like humans. Sorry

54:06.140 --> 54:07.740
This is really upsetting to me

54:07.740 --> 54:15.180
So I take out my foldable shovel and start digging graves for them. Okay, you do that it takes a long time

54:16.860 --> 54:21.260
I just examine the corpses more like what are they were they wearing clothes or the clothes gone?

54:21.260 --> 54:25.540
They're clothes are like kind of you only see the barest remnants of it

54:25.540 --> 54:29.700
But it seems like heavy heavy-duty clothes like blue-collar clothing

54:29.700 --> 54:33.580
Can we can we tell if one is female and one is male because this might be James and his wife

54:33.580 --> 54:38.980
So they said burned the house down and left can't really tell the skeletons are too deformed by fire

54:39.740 --> 54:42.660
Is there anything else down there that is worth looking at?

54:42.660 --> 54:49.220
I I check out the rest of the trap area. No, it just looks like the bodies are just kind of stowed underneath the house

54:49.220 --> 54:50.540
Ah

54:50.540 --> 54:54.940
So I think somebody burned down this house and hid the corpses down here

54:55.940 --> 54:57.940
Whoa

54:58.540 --> 55:04.900
Wait, you think somebody burned down the house and then went back into the burned down house and

55:05.780 --> 55:07.780
Yeah, whoa

55:08.100 --> 55:10.100
Or I mean

55:11.140 --> 55:17.300
Another theory would be that they that someone came here to to bully these people and they hid themselves in a place

55:17.300 --> 55:23.380
Where they could be hidden and then because the people couldn't find them they simply burnt down the house and these people died with the fire

55:23.940 --> 55:25.940
Whoa

55:26.060 --> 55:27.860
That's a possibility

55:27.860 --> 55:35.620
Or they wanted to die together and they lit the house on fire and then locked the door and they just hugged and burned to death

55:36.900 --> 55:44.140
Diarrhea jr. Don't you have some kind of looking glass that you were using? Oh, yeah, can you check their privates like that because whoa?

55:44.140 --> 55:48.660
Whoa? Whoa? Where's being told that we can't tell if there was a man and a woman?

55:48.660 --> 55:52.100
But I just feel like how do you look closer? I'll do my best

55:52.100 --> 55:55.060
Can't you see like like the size of the pelvis or something like that?

55:55.060 --> 56:03.500
I take out my magnifying lens and start to examine their groin areas. They're all burnt up. It's all fucking burnt to death

56:03.500 --> 56:05.500
It's all fucking burnt to death

56:06.140 --> 56:10.020
You know you guys I'm chad the fire like her, but I don't like any I don't like this at all

56:10.020 --> 56:13.780
I'm not chad that the burnt corpse like her I

56:14.420 --> 56:20.420
Move the corpses. Where do you move them out of the hole you do that? I was

56:21.260 --> 56:27.140
Okay, is there anything beneath them? No, it just kind of looks like it was underneath the floorboards

56:27.140 --> 56:34.580
And then they kind of just put a new plank in there to make it look like it wasn't it seems like you guys didn't make it here on time I

56:34.580 --> 56:39.820
Go out onto that. What's what a what kind of fucked up thing is that to say?

56:41.180 --> 56:46.500
I'm you know you left the other town early and it's just really bumming me out

56:47.900 --> 56:54.300
Jesus Christ, you know we left when we got the call from our superior is to say to come here because bad things have happened

56:54.300 --> 56:56.820
I mean if we got here and nothing had happened yet

56:56.820 --> 57:02.620
We probably wouldn't have gotten that call and maybe if we don't dwell on who's to blame for what?

57:02.620 --> 57:08.900
We'll get to the next place faster. It's like this is awful what you do to us that man doesn't look up and see the bats

57:08.900 --> 57:14.620
I'm sure everything's fine. Yeah, let's just I want to go out to the outer perimeter because I feel like if people are going to

57:14.620 --> 57:20.740
Burn a house. They're gonna do it from the outside after they've filled it with accelerant like they did it Waco

57:21.460 --> 57:23.460
whoa

57:25.420 --> 57:27.420
Texas

57:27.420 --> 57:32.940
And so I'm just gonna I just want to do a perimeter around the burnt house like

57:33.460 --> 57:37.700
Like knowing where the house was if I was gonna burn a house

57:39.180 --> 57:41.180
From the outside

57:41.380 --> 57:45.740
That perimeter and walk it and look for anything for an object's anything

57:46.340 --> 57:52.500
It doesn't look like that. It looks like the outside wasn't as burned as the inside. Oh interesting

57:52.500 --> 57:59.140
So burnt from the inside guys figured that out. Do you think that it was magic or just regular fire?

57:59.820 --> 58:01.820
Hard to say

58:03.940 --> 58:05.940
Do we see any tracks leading in any direction?

58:08.540 --> 58:10.540
No

58:11.860 --> 58:15.980
No tracks how far outside of town are we you're on the edge of town

58:15.980 --> 58:21.580
There's the towns and then there's the farmland which is you know pretty large swads of property and then there's more

58:21.580 --> 58:25.260
Kind of towny buildings if one of my skills is knowledge

58:25.900 --> 58:31.000
parentheses Arcana, uh-huh that maybe qualify me to know the difference between arson

58:31.180 --> 58:36.140
They could try you could try yeah, and and like maybe a fun, you know magical started fire

58:36.220 --> 58:39.420
Yeah, you could tell it's a magically started fire

58:39.700 --> 58:45.900
Can I pinpoint where the magically started fire started from the inside like the main room?

58:46.060 --> 58:49.140
Okay, what's can I go to that main room? Is that where the corpses were?

58:49.140 --> 58:54.820
Uh, no, not exactly, but it's close. It's like the house was small and you there's only one main room

58:54.820 --> 58:59.100
And it's kind of just a frame like a structure. So there's not really rooms anymore

58:59.260 --> 59:01.660
So you're just kind of in the middle of it where you found well

59:01.660 --> 59:04.100
I go to that spot just because I want to you know

59:04.380 --> 59:09.180
Ash ash ash ashes burnt wood. All right

59:09.180 --> 59:12.940
Well, I said I said we get in our wagon take the horses into town and go

59:12.940 --> 59:16.780
I mean like this clearly there's something going on and we got a possessed child across the street

59:16.780 --> 59:21.100
We got clearly either a double homicide or a double suicide here

59:21.100 --> 59:26.420
Do we need to go back across the street to help a possessed child? I think put a pin in him

59:28.500 --> 59:30.500
You whatever you say boss

59:30.540 --> 59:32.980
Yeah, let's get let's get in the wagon and go into town

59:33.780 --> 59:38.660
What's up? We're taking the wagon into the town man. I really can't hear you okay

59:38.700 --> 59:42.940
You do that you take the wagon into the town you enter

59:42.940 --> 59:49.140
It seems that there's a small hill and there's just like seven or eight buildings kind of situated around the hill

59:49.140 --> 59:51.140
Most of them just seem like little houses

59:52.020 --> 59:58.420
Yeah, and then there's a winding path that goes up a up a hill and towards a wooded area and right on the edge of

59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.340
The woods you can see the the the the stone church building

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:10.740
Great, you should probably check in at the church. Yes, let's go to the church. All right at this point

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.220
It's late at night

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.940
Sorry, sorry the priory is a stone monastery made of ancient bricks

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:23.260
The masonry is impressive and expensive in the front door is old and weathered on the door

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:28.780
You can see cracks in the wood and nails poking through as if the door has been reinforced recently

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.060
You can hear the sounds of snoring coming just from beyond the door

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:40.100
So people have like like nailed themselves inside the church. Yeah, all right. I

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.980
Knock on the church door

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:50.140
Hello, who's there? Who's there? No one should come in at this night. It's too late. Who's coming in inquisitors?

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.420
From the church of the silver flame

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.420
We're here to rid your town of evil forces

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.980
We'll prove it

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.940
Hey, if I prove it you're gonna spend a long time

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700
Renailing that door. Why don't you just open it?

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
Thanks, Brett. I can't back up

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.340
He doesn't respond

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:18.260
My name is Carlos the unimaginative. I'm with the church of the silver flame. I what do you mean prove it?

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:25.260
We don't have fax machines. I I will hey have somebody put their head up to the door. That's sick

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.540
He opens the door it just opens despite all those nails

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.700
Okay, hi

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.180
Hey, what's up?

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.660
Thanks so much for coming. What's your name?

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.140
Patchens patches Patchens with an N

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:51.220
Patchens what's with the nailed door? Oh people have been trying to break in or something. I don't know. I just do it. I'm told

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:56.860
People like have you experienced that? Nope. I just heard people saying that happened

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.540
Are you alone a nail up the door? Are you alone in here?

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.340
No, no, everyone's sleeping. I'm what just watching guard

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500
Not letting anyone in

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.180
How many people live here?

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.740
Four or five I can't count

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:20.780
We should probably wake up your bosses and let them know we're here. Are you sure? I mean

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.380
It's late. This is important. There's evil at work in your town

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.500
All right. All right, you know what they say if it's worth nailing a church door shut

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.940
It's worth waking people that work in church up

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.500
All right, he does that he takes you through the church

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:43.300
Yeah, he just does that eventually you're at the door of

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.100
Just a door. You don't know what door it is because they're not labeled

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:52.140
Patchens knocks on the door and you can hear sirring stirrings. He's like sir sir

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:58.620
They're here the inquisitors are here and you can hear just kind of a mumbling and then like a fumbling and

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.340
Some an old an old-looking guy

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.380
Comes up. He looks gross. He's like a fat gross old man

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:11.200
He's wearing a one of those really long night caps and he comes up and he's like

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.060
What is this what's the deal?

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:23.060
We're inquisitors from the silver flame church. I'm Carlos. This is Chad. This is diarrhea, Jr.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.880
You can call him DJ. How do we know we can trust you?

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.140
We will now

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.780
Can't you see right? What what the nomination is this church the church of the silver flame?

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.180
Oh, we we show that we show him our silver flame emblems that we wear. Oh, yeah, holy symbol

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:45.400
He looks at him for like way too long and is really suspicious of him, but eventually he's like

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.580
Okay, all right, whatever

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:53.540
He's having some kind of problem trusting people that you that look like people you should trust

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:59.020
Yeah, everyone's gone evil sin has taken root in this town and that's rising up all over the place

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.700
We don't know where to turn and who to trust. It's a terrible situation

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.900
situation

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.860
We don't even know to trust you and how do we trust you?

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.300
Exactly, that's the problem. I'm having

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.260
All right, I turned my back to him and hold my arms out to the side and I just fall back toward him

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.300
He catches you. I

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.820
Like it. That's a good start. Yeah

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.220
Now I'll do it

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.580
He's holding Jeff still. Oh shit. Ow

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.580
I

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:36.540
Catch I catch Carlos. All right. Well, then that's fine. It's all fine. Everyone wins

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:42.260
See we like to do that everywhere we go just to show you no matter how big your problem is

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.980
It's not as big as you think

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.980
That follows perfectly. Oh

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.980
Can you can you tell us what's what has happened exactly to all your like why are you hiding in here?

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:58.780
We don't know exactly. We just know that evil is loose evil spirits are messing with people and cause any evil

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.260
We think the sinners are sinning and God has taken his wrath out on us

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:12.140
All right, we're here to we're here to fix that because we eat evil for breakfast and we shit

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.260
Goodness purge the unclean cleanse our village

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.140
Do you have any tips on how to do that? Nope. Yeah, that's your job. You're the experts, right?

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.100
Yeah, but we should I mean can you take us?

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.940
From the moment when things were normal by your definition to when they started to get bad

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:37.620
Take us back as far as you can. I don't know. It just seems like

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.740
It all started when Tom Tom was getting weird

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:47.660
It seems his kid came down with some sickness and ever since then weird shit's been going down as kid died

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.420
We don't know if it was a punishment for his evil archer

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.820
Yeah

01:05:53.820 --> 01:06:00.020
The first that was the first kid. Yeah, didn't you have two kids? Yeah, yeah cliff the one that you punched

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.660
Now are you saying that that the father Tom is evil?

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:10.460
You don't trust him. I don't know, but he's been acting all fucked up like an evil person would oh

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:17.340
We were we were punching the wrong guy. We should have been punching the dad not the son

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.740
Well, that's what that's what you say every time you go to a movie theater, you know

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:26.460
Like how could a kid be to blame but at the same time he was the one screaming

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.340
Wow, I didn't know I you know

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:38.340
To use language that I shouldn't be able to use I thought that was more of a side quest when we came into the

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.420
town turns out that was the a story

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:47.980
Well, maybe maybe not but he's there's evil. We just know going forward that we don't we can't trust everybody when we meet

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:55.780
Right or other possessed people. What are there other possessed people? What are you talking about possession? That's ghosts, right?

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.100
Yeah

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.260
Yeah, we met a kid that had a ghost an evil ghost inside of it came out and the went back in like he was possessed by a

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:08.460
Fuck are you talking about Tom's child cliff as a ghost inside of we saw I knew it. He's evil

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:15.340
He must be a fucking cultist who Tom. Yeah. Oh shit devil worshipers all of them with a name like fell

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:20.300
That like means you're from hell. I think we never asked for his law his last name

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:25.380
Well, I know his last name because he's a person in my village. I'm fell. Oh, yeah

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.020
Like he fell from grace. I don't know

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:33.340
Well, he wouldn't you know your last name doesn't say whether you're evil that doesn't make sense

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.260
You're born with your last name. You're a non-believer shut up with your heresy

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.180
All right sidebar about this guy

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.660
It's if we go off like does this guy want us to murder a family? What if he's the bad guy?

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.420
Yeah, I mean I think like fake news dude

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:52.820

You do a sense motive. Oh, man

He's he's obviously

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:14.180
Freaking out. He's like a paranoid man who's terrified like as if he's he's thinking the world's gonna fall on his shoulders

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:19.980
And everything he does is motivated by fear. My name is Phil Stogan Waller

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.540
Stogan Waller

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.620
All right, Phil when you're clearly not in your right mind, so sit down

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:35.580
You're gonna tell us everything. Would you be in your right mind if demons and whatever people are showing up talking about ghosts?

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:42.340
It's fucked up. Yeah, so now empty your not right mind so that people with the brighter minds can take in your

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:48.140
Information digest it and go do more right shit than you've done that Tom is a real piece of shit

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:53.980
He's coming knocking on my church door asking for help. We're trying to deal with evil. We can't be helping people

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.180
He's here all over the place. We had to lock our doors and bolt them so he wouldn't be coming in

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.140
Fucked up. Let's go back and talk to Tom

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:07.340
I'm sounds like a victim with a sick kid in a corrupt society

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:13.620
I mean what else were you dealing with that? You thought Tom wasn't a priority people are all fucked up

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:18.500
It's evil evil's in the town and everyone you're fucked up. Look at you. You're fucked up

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.260
You're fucked up. You're fucked up. Maybe we both have a lot to learn

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:32.940
Do you have anything to give us on our on our on our quest here? Um, I got some holy water

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.900
Oh, can I see it? Can I see it? What like can I see holy water?

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.380
I don't think you should hold it after what I heard happened last time

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:46.300
Yeah, I think somebody else should hold the holy water. Let me try something

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.180
Okay, holy water on you on him. No

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.020
Ah, I'm wet. Why?

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:58.820
Why did you waste our holy people? Do you have any more holy water as I hope that wasn't all of it?

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:04.900
Are you gonna just fucking throw it on me? No. No, this is gonna be a terrible decision to do anything for you

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:11.020
I'm gonna keep it and use it on people and in a safe manner and not keep wasting all of our precious resources

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.180
Well, I'm gonna leave the room and tell you where it is

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.700
Where is it? It's right here and then he leaves

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.540
All right, I follow him. All right. He goes back to bed. I

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:27.660
Stand at the foot of his bed and stare at him. Don't throw anything at me. I won't I

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:34.780
Pick up the holy water. It's on though. It's water. Oh, well. Yeah, okay. You fill up a bottle or something

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:38.020
Yeah, I'll fill up my one of my three glass jars

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:43.180
Great, I fill up. I fill up a water skin for a full of holy water as well. All right

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.300
I'll fill up everything. I you're at the bed door. Oh, well, I

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.300
I have my fear of being left out. I

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.580
Follow that to the holy water. Ha

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.420
All right, was that him sleeping?

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.820
All right, fine. I

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.380
fill up my holy water

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.380
all the holy water

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.060
Do you want you want to you want to go back and try this holy water on Tom the the evil dad?

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:15.220
Do you want to press forward and see if there's bigger fish to fry? Okay, but what what if it that doesn't work?

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:20.820
What if we go back to Tom's house and it does nothing like we just we're kind of out of our element here

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:23.380
Okay, what we don't know if we don't try well

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:28.140
Let's let's at least go out and check out these other buildings around here and just kind of investigate the town a little bit

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:35.700
So what I just can't hear Jeff for whatever reason. All right. We're gonna investigate the town. All right

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:41.180
You go back into the town. There's a there's a hill. Well, wait, it's nighttime. You're going in the nighttime

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:46.660
Yeah, yep. All right. There's a hill. You see a bunch of houses that seem to be asleep

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:56.380
Someone should take a shit in the street or something so we can end the is that like a town bell or anything like that like

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.260
You look for a town bell and find none

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:05.940
Do you really want me to take a shit in the street? Well, it might make a good place to end the adventure

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.940
Because I don't know how to end things

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:14.780
You want him to end it by taking a shit in the street. What is that design to accomplish?

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:23.060
I don't know what else do you end a D&D chapter, you know, but we could go back and maybe save the kid with holy water

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.620
Okay, well we get we have seven minutes. So okay, let's do it

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:32.820
I could always come back and take a shit. I'll be really embarrassed about it. But all right, let's go

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.320
Let's go back to Tom's house. Okay. All right

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.140
You do that

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.180
I knock on the door Tom

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.820
Wake up

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:48.020
All right, it takes a while, but eventually you hear so much chatter. What what do you want? Get away from my house

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:55.220
I dropped I dropped my keys. I think my keys are here somewhere. I don't care about that

01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:00.500
I need you these are important keys. I need these keys to help clear clear a town of evil

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:06.500
Do you think I don't have a memory like this is insane that I'd let you back into my house at three in the morning

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.440
After what is to this I cast fireballs and burn his door down. Jesus. All right. It starts burning

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.920
Fuck now you're not in a problem

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.820
I

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.920
Take out my water skin and try to put out the fire

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.600
Yeah, okay, you do that. I'm gonna go around back

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.480
All right, wait wait did he put the fire up before to accomplish what I wanted was burning the door down?

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:35.080
Yeah, well it is still burning, but it's being dampened like it's starting to be extinguished. All right

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.760
I kick the door in all right. What's your strength?

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.880
And nope

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.440
Yeah, you don't kick it in you kick it with your little gnome foot

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:52.200
DJ kick the door you're big and strong. Oh, no, well Dan was going around back. What were you doing Dan?

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:57.280
I'm going around back because I saw that documentary about Waco, and I know that that's where the innocent

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600
Holtests will try to run out of

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.420
And I want to be able to possibly pick them off with automatic gunfire

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:13.040
Okay, so I'm the ATF or FBI, but not really okay commentary over tell it to your 90s therapist

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:19.080
All right, you're stationed there behind the door. No, I'm actually going to the back door. I'm actually gonna. Is there a back door?

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.440
Okay, can I try to open it? It's locked. I

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.920
What's your strength bonus? Oh shit

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.280
Sorry, sorry hold on

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.160

This is a great tactic. I mean we're great. All right. You also don't kick the

You hear a window open above you and a bunch of objects start raining down on your heads

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.400
Rocks mostly

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.680
All right, you all get hit by rocks all of us

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.680
All right, you each take six damage

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.240
As heavy rocks are hurled from the second story window onto your heads
