Would you frown?\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nWould that make you upset?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:28.000\nEvil people have that technique.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nYou've been intoxicated with evil.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nYou start coming up with hypotheticals.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:36.000\nYou tell people, what if I ate a baby?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:39.000\nThat's the only one I have.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nBecause we're in an outdoor tent right now,\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:49.000\nyour hair is blowing in an awesome Stevie Nicks rock and roll fashion.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nI'm trying to think of a Stevie Nicks.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nYou can tell from one syllable I was trying to do Stevie Nicks.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nAnd then I gave up.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nI want to be Stevie Nicks.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nI can't do it.

He came out here.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nYou're too kind.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nBut do you guys think Roger Waters,\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nit's like the mastermind behind The Wall.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nSo remember The Wall, it came out.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nWhen I was a kid, it was like, yeah, The Wall.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nIt was like education.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nAnd then when The Wall, the Berlin Wall was coming down,\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nhe did that big concert, and it was like, it's relevant again.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nAnd then Cody was saying like,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nbecause he just did a concert again,\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nbecause now Trump is like saying, build a wall,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nand now he's doing, he's got a new album.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nAnd Cody's saying, no, you know Roger Waters is stoked about Trump.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nI think that he's just like, time to get back out there.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nAh, the smell of grease paint. Ah, the limelight.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nAll right.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nTake that, Roger Waters.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nWait, Dan, but you started off by saying\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nthat you are doing a pretty good Roger Waters impression these days?\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nWell, no, because the acoustics in here\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nprobably won't sound like a good impression to you.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nBut I was thinking it would be funny if that song,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nyou know, that starts with like, I got a little black book,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\nI poems in, got a bag, got a toothbrush, and a comb,\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nthat if the list just kept going and it wasn't relevant to anything,\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nthat he was just like, I got six cowboy hats with ice cream inside two of them,\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nand the third one has a frog with a screwdriver.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nSo you're not going to do the impression for us?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nNo.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nThat's the thing, it's like, I can't, no,\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nyou have to be in an elevator with me or very close with me in bed\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nin order for the, to sound like, Roger Waters is a,\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nhe wasn't somebody that could have worked in like 1930s radio\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nor at Woodstock or something, he's like,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:25.000\nhe's an artist that's reliant on a certain layered high-tech,\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nhigh-fidelity thing.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:33.000\nSo don't fucking, don't look at me like I'm less than talented.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nBlame God for the speed of sound and the laws of nature.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nThere's a place in my shower, if I get right into a corner in my shower,\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:44.000\nat a certain place, a certain distance from the corner of my shower,\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:48.000\nI can sound exactly like a cello.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nIt sounds exactly like a cello, but I can't do it anywhere else.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nIt sounds like me humming like an asshole.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nSpencer, do you ever sing in the shower?\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nYeah, I sing in the shower.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nDo you sing anywhere else? Do you sing in a car?\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nYeah, I really let loose in my car.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nIf there was a car in my car, I'd be in prison, I think.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:14.000\nI just scream, just scream onomatopoetic sounds.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nBy the way, where the fuck are we?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nThat's not to offend you guys.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nIt's my own ignorance.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nWe get in a plane, we flew for an hour.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nWe're in Mountain View, California.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nWhat is that? Where did we go?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's where the white people live.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nHawaiian people?\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nThe white people.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nWe went to a restaurant.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nThere's a weird contradiction here.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:51.000\nI think it's a college town, but it's also a place where white people go to die.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:57.000\nOr invent things that make everyone else live, which kills them.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nThey invented the iPhone 7, which I can't plug into the goddamn jack here.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:11.000\nThere's a strip mall near our hotel that's the size of fucking Babylon,\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nwhich was famous for its size.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:19.000\nI'm just saying, it's just endless, endless.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:23.000\nEvery single store is some place where you can buy a thousand dollar pants\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nor a plate you can't eat off of.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nBut then in between every third one is a restaurant,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nbut it's like corn dogs, that's it.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nIt's like shitty restaurants where you order at the counter\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nand there's shit on the table and there's just a 16-year-old going,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nI don't want to make you food.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nWhat's with you people? Pick a lane.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:49.000\nAre you rich or are you going to kill yourselves?\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nIt sounds like you're describing a mall.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nYou went into a mall.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nI guess I haven't been in a mall in a long time.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nYeah, that's what it is, okay.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nIt's not your fault.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\nThere's a mall in your town and I blame you for it, I guess.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:13.000\nWe went into a place, and the young lady that was at the hostess counter,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.000\nwhen we went in, she said,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nNow, I don't...\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.000\nRoger Waters!\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nThe weird thing is, if she in any way has a disability,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nthen this is a terrible thing to do, is to imitate her voice.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nI say you roll those dice, Dan.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nIt would be in her head.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nI guess the idea is you're never supposed to make fun of anybody\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nor imitate them because you might...\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nBut then what?

All right.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nAnd no one will ever shut down the Delta Cubes.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nAll right. Oh, nice.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nOh, man. The Delta Cubes.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nSo, Heat Vision and Jack\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nwas one of my favorite shows,\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nand I only saw one episode of it.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nI was wondering if you feel like\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nthe timing, the cultural timing\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nwas what made that not work\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nversus other things you're doing now or if there's some other?\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nHeat Vision and Jack.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nI don't think it was cultural time.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nWell, I guess maybe cultural if you've got...\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nYeah, it was...\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nThe audiences weren't fragmented enough\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nthat one million people\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nwanting to watch something meant\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nCha-ching yet, which it now does.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nI mean, and I think a million people\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nwould have liked to watch Heat Vision and Jack\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nbecause it asked the question, what is television?\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nBut back then it was like, I think you'd need\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\n20 million people to want to watch something\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nbefore somebody wants to make something.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nYou know, Jack Black on a talking motorcycle.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nIt was great. It was a pilot,\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nand they didn't pick it up.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nThey thought it would be expensive,\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nand it was like, there were things before that.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nYou're just a baby.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nSledgehammer. I'll say these words to you.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nGoogle them. Look well.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nA naked gun.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nOr what was the police squad?\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nThere's shows that kind of like\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nskew absurdity and stuff,\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nand then it's like, oh, can I watch this or is this a sketch?\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nI think it was just that.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nIn a few days, you could put something like\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nHeat Vision and Jack on sci-fi, maybe.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nToo long an answer.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nThank you, Chewie.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nI didn't know we could do it at Q&A.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nIt's great though.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nOh, shit.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nIt's Craft Punk, actually.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nIt's what?\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nIt's from the Eric Andre show.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nIt's called Craft Punk.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nI think you can hear yourself\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nin there.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nIt's called Craft Punk.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nLike, you know, Daft Punk, but\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nI throw cheese at people and\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nfeel like that.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nBut, um, I, um...\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nWell, first off, I want to dance with you.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nIf we can do a dance-off, that'd be cool.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nOkay.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nWhat do you got?\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:16.000\nOh, shit.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nThis is the most applause you've ever gotten.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nHe wins!\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nDan is doing push-ups.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nDan, he did the worm, not push-ups.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nHe was doing the worm, I think.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nI was kind of just, like, humping the ground, kind of.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nYeah, I'm hammering it.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nIt's like he's taking a little,\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\ntaking a little nap.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nAlright, Dan, let it go.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nLet it go.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nThank you very much.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nThank you, whatever your name was.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nIt was, uh, I'll call you Carl.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nHello, Sir, what's your name?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nHis second question was about\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nworld hunger.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nHi, I'm John,\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:08.400\nJohn, and I was wondering, this is a question for all three of you, what guest at Harming\n\n36:08.400 --> 36:10.880\nQuest would you ever want to join?\n\n36:10.880 --> 36:13.920\nWho would be our favorite guest to have on Harming Quest?\n\n36:13.920 --> 36:15.720\nYeah, that hasn't appeared yet.\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:16.720\nChris Hardwick!\n\n36:16.720 --> 36:17.720\nWoo!\n\n36:17.720 --> 36:18.720\nThere you go.\n\n36:18.720 --> 36:26.320\nHe asked, were we talking about getting Dwayne The Rock Johnson on?\n\n36:26.320 --> 36:32.160\nI was Dwayne The Rock Johnson!\n\n36:32.160 --> 36:33.160\nFamous people are great.\n\n36:33.160 --> 36:35.960\nThey don't come to my show, but they're great.\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:39.480\nYes, old timey root beer spokesmodel.\n\n36:39.480 --> 36:46.280\nSo, having seen Harming Quest, I know there's a lot of chaos to your creative process.\n\n36:46.280 --> 36:51.360\nHow much do you feel that fan theories influence where Rick and Morty goes, because some of\n\n36:51.360 --> 36:55.280\nthose fan theories are really sophisticated, and you might not have meant them, but I\n\n36:55.280 --> 36:56.880\nbet you could run with them.\n\n36:56.880 --> 37:00.840\nWell, I'm sure fan theories are just as good, if not better, of anything that we would come\n\n37:00.840 --> 37:08.000\nup with in a writer's room, but I don't personally go to those forums since community, because\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:11.320\nI don't want to be influenced.\n\n37:11.320 --> 37:15.760\nIt's sci-fi, so it's like higher stakes to let yourself be influenced by a theory, you\n\n37:15.760 --> 37:16.760\nknow what I mean?\n\n37:16.760 --> 37:19.840\nAnd also, to tell you the truth, I hope this doesn't spoil anything, but I don't think\n\n37:19.840 --> 37:23.680\nRick and Morty, there's not going to be an underlying fucking, like, I don't know, we\n\n37:23.680 --> 37:28.840\nhave conversations in the room, and then one's canon to canon, but I'm not a person that\n\n37:28.840 --> 37:32.680\nwould ever be like, okay, from the beginning of the series, I've always got this thing\n\n37:32.680 --> 37:36.920\nthat inside the back, behind his ear, if you look real close, there's an egg, and the egg\n\n37:36.920 --> 37:41.760\nmeans the whole show's a lie, like, I don't, he's an old drunk guy that's smarter than\n\n37:41.760 --> 37:46.600\neveryone, and for some reason, he's incredibly selfish and wants to, I mean, we'll figure\n\n37:46.600 --> 37:49.440\nit out as we go.\n\n37:49.440 --> 37:55.480\nBut I have seen, like, I did have, like, I've had, like, when we sat down and started writing\n\n37:55.480 --> 37:58.680\nthe show, I was like, should we have one of those, just in case?\n\n37:58.680 --> 38:00.680\nAnd Mike McMahon, one of the writers, was like, how about this one?\n\n38:00.680 --> 38:04.200\nI was like, holy shit, that's amazing, let's do that.\n\n38:04.200 --> 38:07.640\nAnd then two years later, I could see people were like, what if this?\n\n38:07.640 --> 38:12.160\nAnd I was like, fuck that, no, no, like, if you can sit and shouldn't do that, like,\n\n38:12.160 --> 38:16.080\naudiences are a render farm of ideas, they have nothing to do but sit there and think,\n\n38:16.080 --> 38:18.600\nlike, so if your show is payoff based, you're fucking yourself.\n\n38:18.600 --> 38:27.040\nI think, but I'm just an old Batman that just stops staring at me like that.\n\n38:27.040 --> 38:28.540\nAlright, thank you.\n\n38:28.540 --> 38:31.560\nWe have time for a couple more, we can't do everybody, because we have some business\n\n38:31.560 --> 38:33.560\nto attend to.\n\n38:33.560 --> 38:38.280\nWhen you guys, you guys do festivals, do you stick around and watch bands, or do you go\n\n38:38.280 --> 38:40.960\nstraight to the hotel room for Minecrafts?\n\n38:40.960 --> 38:46.120\nIt's funny, you should ask that, sir, because last night, because last night, the saddest\n\n38:46.120 --> 38:51.160\ntext message in the world came from Jeff to all of us, because he went to Weezer and Spencer\n\n38:51.160 --> 38:56.360\nstayed at the hotel and played Minecraft, and it would play, Jeff sent us video and\n\n38:56.360 --> 39:00.240\nthen said, have fun playing Minecraft, and it was sad.\n\n39:00.240 --> 39:05.960\nYeah, because Steve Levy, if you know Steve, he'll probably come up here in a little bit,\n\n39:05.960 --> 39:11.840\nwe went down to see OK Go, and the people here at the festival gave us nice tickets,\n\n39:11.840 --> 39:17.440\ncheck out in the main amphitheater, and we saw that, we came backstage and had a drink,\n\n39:17.440 --> 39:20.880\nyou know, like, you know, Demetri Martins hanging out back there in Hardwick, and we\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:25.320\nwalked back out, and to get back to our seats, we have to walk by the front row, and we walked\n\n39:25.320 --> 39:31.680\nby in the security guard that is in front of the photograph pit, right in the front,\n\n39:31.680 --> 39:35.760\nhappened to be a Who's Len is an Anyway fan, he's like, oh man, Jeff, he's like a stoner\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:41.800\ndude, he's super cool, and he goes, oh, I'm a big fan, man, I said, cool, can I come\n\n39:41.800 --> 39:42.800\nin the photo pit?\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:47.000\nHe's like, yeah, so we just watched the first three songs of Weezer right in the front,\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:50.560\nand we just took a bunch of photos and sent it to these assholes who were home in the hotel\n\n39:50.560 --> 39:51.560\nplaying Minecraft.\n\n39:51.560 --> 39:56.960\nWell, wait, I mean, that's a cool story, but how can that match, like, I was in the overworld,\n\n39:56.960 --> 40:01.880\nand I went through an obsidian portal, where there happened to be gasts flying around in\n\n40:01.880 --> 40:06.840\nlava rocks everywhere, and I didn't know where I was going, but then I found a blaze and\n\n40:06.840 --> 40:11.960\nI shot a fireball, I mean, you didn't get a fireball shot at you, no, I didn't.\n\n40:11.960 --> 40:22.280\nOh my God, you guys, millions have been deprived of their health care, hit it.\n\n40:22.280 --> 40:29.680\nThe High Road Dance, everybody, let's give it up for MC High Road.\n\n40:29.680 --> 40:37.640\nWhen you take a low road, you won't get far, take the High Road, tell people where you\n\n40:37.640 --> 40:45.960\nare, say, I'm bisexual, you hurt me in your contextual argument, because this is who I\n\n40:45.960 --> 40:51.840\nam, took the High Road to the peanut butter and jam of the real conversation, I fucked\n\n40:51.840 --> 41:01.240\nyour mama all across the nation, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,\n\n41:01.240 --> 41:02.400\noh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n41:02.400 --> 41:07.640\nAll right, no, I didn't mean that bisexual people take the High Road, that was a weird,\n\n41:07.640 --> 41:09.720\nI didn't, that was just say weird.\n\n41:09.720 --> 41:10.720\nWhat did you mean, Dan, what did you mean?\n\n41:10.720 --> 41:12.160\nI don't know, I was rapping.\n\n41:12.160 --> 41:16.320\nAnd then, so MC High Road just immediately starts fucking your mother, that's the High\n\n41:16.320 --> 41:17.320\nRoad, do you?\n\n41:17.320 --> 41:21.120\nNo, I think MC High Road is like has a has an ironic\n\n41:22.200 --> 41:24.200\nPropulsion for the low road\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:29.760\nThat's like how old was old dirty bastard. We don't know. I mean he was older than Wu Tang, but\n\n41:30.760 --> 41:32.120\nAll right\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:37.240\nAll right, Dan, you're gonna fuck any mothers tonight. Will you mind fucking my mama?\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:45.080\nOh, sir, I would be honored. All right, we'll take one more question and we're gonna play some D&D\n\n41:47.640 --> 41:51.560\nI just want to say I listen to your guys's podcast every day that it you know\n\n41:51.560 --> 41:55.920\nIt comes on and I actually wanted to talk to Spencer and ask if you've seen the street\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.800\nThat is your last name. That's like really close\n\n41:59.680 --> 42:05.280\nMaybe not this exact one or maybe yeah, cuz I've driven around Northern California fair amount\n\n42:05.280 --> 42:11.600\nBut I've seen a ton of streets not even on purpose. They just drive by streets that are cringed in so it happens\n\n42:11.600 --> 42:13.600\nThere's way too many of them. It's weird\n\n42:14.040 --> 42:16.040\nWell, it's here and it made me\n\n42:16.720 --> 42:22.760\nThank you so much. I'll check it out. All right. Thank you very much. Oh, we have mr. Meeseeks is here. I think everybody\n\n42:27.880 --> 42:31.440\nReally really alarming. Yeah, that is\n\n42:31.440 --> 42:34.880\nThat is for the for the podcast listener a lot of people\n\n42:36.720 --> 42:38.720\nThere's a lot of\n\n42:40.440 --> 42:44.240\nNo, I so did myself my first time\n\n42:45.440 --> 42:47.440\nHowever, I do have one question\n\n42:47.440 --> 42:49.440\nI have several questions for you\n\n42:50.640 --> 42:52.480\nBut go ahead. I\n\n42:52.480 --> 42:58.140\nMean I serve you if you have a question. No, no, I was I was just making a terrible joke. Go ahead, please\n\n42:58.140 --> 43:04.020\nWell, if you tell a Meeseek that you have a question, he's not gonna he's gonna stop this pain. What do you want?\n\n43:04.020 --> 43:05.820\nI just want to\n\n43:05.820 --> 43:11.300\nJust this is you know, we didn't press the button. You're going you're barking up the wrong tree dog\n\n43:11.900 --> 43:13.500\nThis is bad nerdery\n\n43:13.500 --> 43:18.340\nWell his task if someone might have pressed a button and said go out and learn everything about stuff\n\n43:18.540 --> 43:22.020\nWe don't know. All right. One of those Meeseeks. So I just want to know\n\n43:23.140 --> 43:26.420\nEven though Jerry has been divorced and whatnot\n\n43:26.420 --> 43:33.180\nSeason three some of us are still left around. We need to know if his short game is gonna get any better\n\n43:39.660 --> 43:42.300\nAre you saying you're more of a stickler me seek to leave\n\n43:43.580 --> 43:50.260\nMeeseeks I wasn't even in the scene, but I mean I yeah, no, I think eventually he could become a purpose\n\n43:50.260 --> 43:56.020\nThis is follow through me see yeah, no, I think he'll eventually become better\n\n43:56.020 --> 44:00.860\nBut while he learns they go dip your Meeseek feet in a river\n\n44:01.780 --> 44:04.540\nYou know like do like awakening stuff. I\n\n44:05.940 --> 44:11.180\nDon't know how much along I can this like this. He better be Tiger Woods five years ago tomorrow\n\n44:12.020 --> 44:15.940\nIt's a circular conversation at this point. I'm just saying like I can't control it\n\n44:15.940 --> 44:22.420\nI mean, you're not gonna make me disappear anyway. So thanks for helping. All right. Well. Goodbye. Thank you, mr. Meeseeks\n\n44:26.740 --> 44:32.100\nI want to I have I want to know what's in that fanny pack so bad most basic conversations are\n\n44:33.100 --> 44:39.660\nCostumes have like bigger head like they make the bigger head. Yeah, it's like it's like a weird to make it to let it be regular\n\n44:39.660 --> 44:46.420\nsized head is like John Wayne Gacy's pointy clown makeup. It's like it's just a subtle but fundamental choice to have a\n\n44:46.420 --> 44:49.700\nMeeseek with like a tiny head and I'm like, okay\n\n44:49.700 --> 45:09.700\nAll right, well the opposite of tiny heads one of the biggest brains in the world. Let's bring up Steve Levy to the stage everybody\n\n45:11.060 --> 45:13.060\nHow's it going everybody?\n\n45:13.060 --> 45:19.860\nMan, hi. We had a pretty good night last night, didn't we? We had a great night. Yeah, we totally partied down. Yeah. Yeah\n\n45:19.940 --> 45:25.260\nIt's wonderful. Lots of good music. Yeah a lot of good times. Yeah a lot of memories\n\n45:25.980 --> 45:29.620\nMemories that we'll have for the rest of our lives. It was a nice harmonious night\n\n45:31.980 --> 45:36.300\nIt's fine, I don't care I watched the wall with my girlfriend. I had a great time\n\n45:37.660 --> 45:39.660\nOkay, I\n\n45:39.660 --> 45:43.820\nDon't get jealous of people anymore. I don't care. I have a perfect life\n\n45:45.660 --> 45:48.380\nYou seem pretty mad about your restaurant experience today\n\n45:49.020 --> 45:53.500\nIt's a bad restaurant. I don't understand. They didn't they also didn't have salt on the table\n\n45:53.500 --> 45:58.340\nI don't like restaurants that don't put salt on the table. I feel judged by them like I have low blood pressure\n\n45:58.340 --> 46:04.300\nSo judge someone else like I if you serve hash browns at your restaurant, you don't put salt on the table\n\n46:04.300 --> 46:10.300\nI what you're saying to me is wait it gets better\n\n46:13.660 --> 46:18.980\nNothing makes you question what you're currently saying like the vision of someone just walking out. You're like wait, what am I doing?\n\n46:18.980 --> 46:20.620\nWhat am I doing?\n\n46:20.620 --> 46:26.940\nIt doesn't matter. They might have diarrhea. They're not trying to send that signal, but it makes you really think twice\n\n46:26.940 --> 46:30.300\nI think everyone but they walk they walked out on a pair. Do you think they both have diarrhea?\n\n46:30.300 --> 46:35.620\nEveryone who's ever talking should always have to have an image of someone walking out of a tent\n\n46:36.180 --> 46:38.300\nWhile they're talking it'll keep you on your toes\n\n46:39.460 --> 46:43.660\nAll right, so we're gonna play our second round of our new campaign of Pathfinder everybody\n\n46:45.940 --> 46:47.060\nYeah\n\n46:47.060 --> 46:50.820\nNow leave you weren't you weren't with us for the first for the for the pilot episode\n\n46:50.820 --> 46:55.500\nI was not but I certainly listen to it. Yeah, we didn't get a lot done\n\n46:55.500 --> 47:03.900\nDid anybody here hear that for here last week's D&D? All right, not that many suspense or you're gonna have to catch us up\n\n47:03.900 --> 47:06.860\nIt would not a lot happens. So you're kind of coming in pretty fresh like\n\n47:07.860 --> 47:10.380\nYou'll be easily caught up on this, right?\n\n47:10.780 --> 47:14.300\nAnd do you want to lay on the intro for us? What huh? You want to give us the intro?\n\n47:15.060 --> 47:19.500\nSure. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have character sheets for us? Sure. Yeah\n\n47:21.220 --> 47:23.220\nAll right, I'll come grab those I\n\n47:23.220 --> 47:27.020\nThink that you know one thing that's gonna\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:33.980\nGonna be tough because we're gonna have to like make sure we hear each other. It's a tent\n\n47:35.420 --> 47:37.820\nWe're doing stuff that's going into Canon. Yeah\n\n47:38.460 --> 47:43.300\nRob or Carter was it? Is there a way to get a little bit more of our mics in the monitor so we can get up here\n\n47:43.300 --> 47:44.980\nEach other a bit more\n\n47:44.980 --> 47:48.260\nThat's a check one two two. There we go. Oh, yeah, Dan talk\n\n47:48.260 --> 47:53.020\nWhat if that results in feedback, you know, they the right line back don't point your mic at the monitor\n\n47:53.020 --> 47:55.300\nYou've never been in a rock band? No\n\n47:59.540 --> 48:02.060\nAll right, I'm just looking for my character sheet\n\n48:03.220 --> 48:05.220\nIt's fine\n\n48:05.260 --> 48:06.660\nNot cares\n\n48:06.660 --> 48:12.420\nWe're not doing anything a lot of people. Spencer. I'm gonna give you the intro music and you're gonna lay it on us. All right, what?\n\n48:13.620 --> 48:15.900\nYou can't hear it. No, it's great\n\n48:15.900 --> 48:23.420\nAll right, you guys last time a town was in peril and they dispatched the church\n\n48:23.420 --> 48:27.180\nThat is to say you guys to help solve the problem\n\n48:27.620 --> 48:36.100\nUpon seeing a house you immediately demand an entrance pushed past the homeowners and went upstairs to a cost of child\n\n48:37.660 --> 48:41.580\nBedridden you attacked the child and punched him in the face\n\n48:41.580 --> 48:46.340\nLuckily it turned out he was possessed by a demon. So it wasn't like\n\n48:47.260 --> 48:51.020\nEntirely terrible, but it was bad news and a ghost came out\n\n48:51.020 --> 48:55.980\nOh boy the demon attacked and you guys didn't know what was going on\n\n48:55.980 --> 49:03.100\nAnd so you told the mom to make some bad soup like Adams family and then you left and then it was over\n\n49:03.860 --> 49:05.860\nThat's all\n\n49:07.780 --> 49:09.780\nWe're caught up\n\n49:09.780 --> 49:11.780\nOkay\n\n49:11.780 --> 49:16.980\nThe most important thing that I don't have is my list of spells. Yep\n\n49:25.500 --> 49:30.860\nI feel like you you like it that I'm not prepared. Yeah, it's great\n\n49:30.860 --> 49:36.300\nI'm really digging this can't you can't you go on our so can't you go on our slack down and find your spells are on there\n\n49:36.300 --> 49:39.860\nThey I don't know if I have a list of my spells on the slack\n\n49:41.060 --> 49:43.580\nPlayers handbook. Oh, but it doesn't thank you sir. I\n\n49:44.940 --> 49:47.820\nI'll try you know, I mean the other thing is that\n\n49:49.020 --> 49:55.940\nGoing on to slack will require me to shut off my iPad and turn it back on so I can get on the\n\n49:57.020 --> 49:58.220\nAT&T\n\n49:58.220 --> 50:03.340\nFucking network interesting. How about if I just spend this adventure eating shit?\n\n50:03.340 --> 50:09.820\nWell, yeah, you can not cast spells or you could cast healing spells. It'll be great. Let's worry about it\n\n50:10.860 --> 50:14.180\nSo, where are you guys you guys you just left a house?\n\n50:15.420 --> 50:17.060\nand\n\n50:17.060 --> 50:19.060\nDiarrhea juniors there\n\n50:20.140 --> 50:22.900\nHey guys, hey DJ. How's it going?\n\n50:23.740 --> 50:31.500\nGood. I I finally caught up with you after you left me in the last village to clean up that mess you made\n\n50:31.500 --> 50:36.660\nYeah, well, you know, we had the wagon and the horses and you know and six o'clock means six o'clock. You were late\n\n50:36.660 --> 50:38.660\nAnd so we we left with that you\n\n50:39.420 --> 50:42.220\nAll right. Well, I'm here now. Yeah\n\n50:42.980 --> 50:45.220\nWhat did I miss we well?\n\n50:46.580 --> 50:49.060\nCarlos punched a child that was in bed and\n\n50:50.180 --> 50:53.180\nA ghost came out, but we didn't know how to get rid of the demon ghosts\n\n50:53.180 --> 50:57.140\nSo we left and we're gonna go investigate these burned out ruins over here. We think\n\n50:57.140 --> 51:04.020\nAll right, let's do it. I mean, do you have any spells that you think could get a demon out of a out of a child?\n\n51:04.020 --> 51:07.220\nI'm just a fighter. Okay, forget it then\n\n51:08.660 --> 51:11.160\nSo we're pretending that we do you\n\n51:11.780 --> 51:17.580\nBefore we started the last one or what did we you've known me? Yeah, it took me under your wing\n\n51:18.380 --> 51:23.460\nThis is kind of unceremonious. This is like reunion. I know he wasn't he was just late\n\n51:23.460 --> 51:28.700\nHe didn't make the wagon time at late in time. He was back taking care of another thing and you and I went ahead\n\n51:28.700 --> 51:31.660\nYou don't you remember you exclaimed my work here is done\n\n51:31.660 --> 51:36.620\nAnd then everything was on fire and I had to stay behind and just put out the fires\n\n51:38.700 --> 51:41.800\nAnd you left so you're kind of like an assistant to me\n\n51:43.460 --> 51:45.460\nWhatever you won't think\n\n51:45.980 --> 51:47.980\nAll right\n\n51:47.980 --> 51:55.500\nYeah, hey DJ, you're not his assistant. You're you're a priest of the silver flame just like he is just like I am\n\n51:55.500 --> 51:57.500\nDon't let him don't let him talk to you like that. I\n\n51:58.500 --> 52:05.980\nAppreciate him. He can say what he wants, you know, I feel like he's walking all over you. Okay. I don't let's go check out\n\n52:05.980 --> 52:11.300\nThere's ruins that were across the from the street from the kid that I punched\n\n52:11.300 --> 52:19.620\nYou walk over there and you see the charred burnt ruins of what looks like it was a barn and then a house\n\n52:20.220 --> 52:24.580\nThere's only kind of the skeletal structure of blackened buildings. I\n\n52:26.740 --> 52:29.220\nInvestigate the blackened charred. Oh\n\n52:30.020 --> 52:34.460\nMan, it looks like it was a recent fire. There's ashes everywhere\n\n52:34.460 --> 52:42.220\nDo either of you have any magical ability to kind of find important things while my iPad boots I\n\n52:47.460 --> 52:50.260\nTake out my magnifying lens. Oh\n\n52:51.300 --> 52:52.820\nShit and\n\n52:52.820 --> 52:54.820\nExamine the charring wood\n\n52:55.620 --> 53:00.220\nExamining the charred wood you see that the floorboards don't line up perfectly\n\n53:00.220 --> 53:07.620\nHidden among the ashes in the dust there seems to be the outline of some sort of trapdoor or something\n\n53:07.660 --> 53:09.660\nIt looks like there's a trapdoor\n\n53:10.060 --> 53:12.060\nNicely done squire\n\n53:12.060 --> 53:14.060\nThank you\n\n53:14.780 --> 53:16.780\nLet's examine it\n\n53:17.060 --> 53:19.060\nCan I do a trap door?\n\n53:19.300 --> 53:21.780\nI I pick up like a like a\n\n53:22.260 --> 53:28.740\nChunk of like burnt wood throw it at the trapdoor to see if it springs any mechanism. No, it doesn't it just lands\n\n53:28.740 --> 53:32.540\nIt's it kind of it hits as if it's like a little hollow underneath it\n\n53:32.540 --> 53:36.060\nBut otherwise it just lands. All right, I go up to it and I wipe off some of the charred\n\n53:36.540 --> 53:42.340\nDust ash away from it and try to lift up the door. All right, you do that inside\n\n53:42.980 --> 53:45.140\nYou see two charred corpses\n\n53:48.140 --> 53:50.140\nAppropriate I\n\n53:51.780 --> 53:55.620\nInvestigate them to see if there's any identifying like clothing or marks or anything like that\n\n53:55.620 --> 54:01.580\nUh, not really they seem really heavily burned as if they perished in the blaze\n\n54:01.820 --> 54:05.780\nDo they look like do they look like humans like human? Oh, yeah, they look like humans. Sorry\n\n54:06.140 --> 54:07.740\nThis is really upsetting to me\n\n54:07.740 --> 54:15.180\nSo I take out my foldable shovel and start digging graves for them. Okay, you do that it takes a long time\n\n54:16.860 --> 54:21.260\nI just examine the corpses more like what are they were they wearing clothes or the clothes gone?\n\n54:21.260 --> 54:25.540\nThey're clothes are like kind of you only see the barest remnants of it\n\n54:25.540 --> 54:29.700\nBut it seems like heavy heavy-duty clothes like blue-collar clothing\n\n54:29.700 --> 54:33.580\nCan we can we tell if one is female and one is male because this might be James and his wife\n\n54:33.580 --> 54:38.980\nSo they said burned the house down and left can't really tell the skeletons are too deformed by fire\n\n54:39.740 --> 54:42.660\nIs there anything else down there that is worth looking at?\n\n54:42.660 --> 54:49.220\nI I check out the rest of the trap area. No, it just looks like the bodies are just kind of stowed underneath the house\n\n54:49.220 --> 54:50.540\nAh\n\n54:50.540 --> 54:54.940\nSo I think somebody burned down this house and hid the corpses down here\n\n54:55.940 --> 54:57.940\nWhoa\n\n54:58.540 --> 55:04.900\nWait, you think somebody burned down the house and then went back into the burned down house and\n\n55:05.780 --> 55:07.780\nYeah, whoa\n\n55:08.100 --> 55:10.100\nOr I mean\n\n55:11.140 --> 55:17.300\nAnother theory would be that they that someone came here to to bully these people and they hid themselves in a place\n\n55:17.300 --> 55:23.380\nWhere they could be hidden and then because the people couldn't find them they simply burnt down the house and these people died with the fire\n\n55:23.940 --> 55:25.940\nWhoa\n\n55:26.060 --> 55:27.860\nThat's a possibility\n\n55:27.860 --> 55:35.620\nOr they wanted to die together and they lit the house on fire and then locked the door and they just hugged and burned to death\n\n55:36.900 --> 55:44.140\nDiarrhea jr. Don't you have some kind of looking glass that you were using? Oh, yeah, can you check their privates like that because whoa?\n\n55:44.140 --> 55:48.660\nWhoa? Whoa? Where's being told that we can't tell if there was a man and a woman?\n\n55:48.660 --> 55:52.100\nBut I just feel like how do you look closer? I'll do my best\n\n55:52.100 --> 55:55.060\nCan't you see like like the size of the pelvis or something like that?\n\n55:55.060 --> 56:03.500\nI take out my magnifying lens and start to examine their groin areas. They're all burnt up. It's all fucking burnt to death\n\n56:03.500 --> 56:05.500\nIt's all fucking burnt to death\n\n56:06.140 --> 56:10.020\nYou know you guys I'm chad the fire like her, but I don't like any I don't like this at all\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:13.780\nI'm not chad that the burnt corpse like her I\n\n56:14.420 --> 56:20.420\nMove the corpses. Where do you move them out of the hole you do that? I was\n\n56:21.260 --> 56:27.140\nOkay, is there anything beneath them? No, it just kind of looks like it was underneath the floorboards\n\n56:27.140 --> 56:34.580\nAnd then they kind of just put a new plank in there to make it look like it wasn't it seems like you guys didn't make it here on time I\n\n56:34.580 --> 56:39.820\nGo out onto that. What's what a what kind of fucked up thing is that to say?\n\n56:41.180 --> 56:46.500\nI'm you know you left the other town early and it's just really bumming me out\n\n56:47.900 --> 56:54.300\nJesus Christ, you know we left when we got the call from our superior is to say to come here because bad things have happened\n\n56:54.300 --> 56:56.820\nI mean if we got here and nothing had happened yet\n\n56:56.820 --> 57:02.620\nWe probably wouldn't have gotten that call and maybe if we don't dwell on who's to blame for what?\n\n57:02.620 --> 57:08.900\nWe'll get to the next place faster. It's like this is awful what you do to us that man doesn't look up and see the bats\n\n57:08.900 --> 57:14.620\nI'm sure everything's fine. Yeah, let's just I want to go out to the outer perimeter because I feel like if people are going to\n\n57:14.620 --> 57:20.740\nBurn a house. They're gonna do it from the outside after they've filled it with accelerant like they did it Waco\n\n57:21.460 --> 57:23.460\nwhoa\n\n57:25.420 --> 57:27.420\nTexas\n\n57:27.420 --> 57:32.940\nAnd so I'm just gonna I just want to do a perimeter around the burnt house like\n\n57:33.460 --> 57:37.700\nLike knowing where the house was if I was gonna burn a house\n\n57:39.180 --> 57:41.180\nFrom the outside\n\n57:41.380 --> 57:45.740\nThat perimeter and walk it and look for anything for an object's anything\n\n57:46.340 --> 57:52.500\nIt doesn't look like that. It looks like the outside wasn't as burned as the inside. Oh interesting\n\n57:52.500 --> 57:59.140\nSo burnt from the inside guys figured that out. Do you think that it was magic or just regular fire?\n\n57:59.820 --> 58:01.820\nHard to say\n\n58:03.940 --> 58:05.940\nDo we see any tracks leading in any direction?\n\n58:08.540 --> 58:10.540\nNo\n\n58:11.860 --> 58:15.980\nNo tracks how far outside of town are we you're on the edge of town\n\n58:15.980 --> 58:21.580\nThere's the towns and then there's the farmland which is you know pretty large swads of property and then there's more\n\n58:21.580 --> 58:25.260\nKind of towny buildings if one of my skills is knowledge\n\n58:25.900 --> 58:31.000\nparentheses Arcana, uh-huh that maybe qualify me to know the difference between arson\n\n58:31.180 --> 58:36.140\nThey could try you could try yeah, and and like maybe a fun, you know magical started fire\n\n58:36.220 --> 58:39.420\nYeah, you could tell it's a magically started fire\n\n58:39.700 --> 58:45.900\nCan I pinpoint where the magically started fire started from the inside like the main room?\n\n58:46.060 --> 58:49.140\nOkay, what's can I go to that main room? Is that where the corpses were?\n\n58:49.140 --> 58:54.820\nUh, no, not exactly, but it's close. It's like the house was small and you there's only one main room\n\n58:54.820 --> 58:59.100\nAnd it's kind of just a frame like a structure. So there's not really rooms anymore\n\n58:59.260 --> 59:01.660\nSo you're just kind of in the middle of it where you found well\n\n59:01.660 --> 59:04.100\nI go to that spot just because I want to you know\n\n59:04.380 --> 59:09.180\nAsh ash ash ashes burnt wood. All right\n\n59:09.180 --> 59:12.940\nWell, I said I said we get in our wagon take the horses into town and go\n\n59:12.940 --> 59:16.780\nI mean like this clearly there's something going on and we got a possessed child across the street\n\n59:16.780 --> 59:21.100\nWe got clearly either a double homicide or a double suicide here\n\n59:21.100 --> 59:26.420\nDo we need to go back across the street to help a possessed child?
