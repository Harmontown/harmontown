WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, yeah! You know what this means? This means that I'm controlling tonight.

00:18.000 --> 00:31.000
Let me hear you say, oh, shit! Oh, shit! Let me hear you say, chelps!

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session! Freak out!

00:39.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you so much for coming down to tonight's show. Let's give it up for our resident Dungeon Manster, Spencer Crittenden!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes!

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Look at him! Look at him sit down with his bag of holding.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I got stuff.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You got stuff.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I got gifts.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You got gifts.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Just my presents.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Chips? No, no, no. Animated gifts.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Animated gifts.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, you guys are in for a treat tonight.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
So, without any further ado, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown. You know him. I love him, Mr. Dan Harmon Man!

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Thank you.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes!

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
That was a smooth groove we have.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Thank you so much.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
What an improvement from last week. We filled in some seats. That's nice.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh, Dan, you didn't have a lot of seats filled last week?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh, yeah.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Who wasn't there?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, wow.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
You know, Jeff's been out with his vocal surgery?

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Right, right. So they didn't come because Jeff wasn't here or somebody else.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
A lot of our audience is racist. Brandon was controlling. So that always takes us to get the racist.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, but I've been here when the place has been packed and Brandon's here. So, I mean, I don't know. I just, what else was missing?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Alright, maybe, I guess maybe people like you.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Really?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I have no problem with people liking you.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, you do.

02:32.000 --> 02:42.000
I have a problem with people not liking me, which really is counterintuitive being me.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Like, so, I'm going to start to warm up to people liking you. You can come around whenever you want.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Thank you for guest comptrolling. We have some interesting guests to talk to.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You were just talking to me right now.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
You said you were warming up to me.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I've known you since you were 19.

03:03.000 --> 03:15.000
You're warming up to me. I can come around at any time. What kind of weird kind of talk is that to somebody who's your best man at your wedding?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
What are you talking about? Like, you're acting like, oh, yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
It's a compliment. He said he's warming up to you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I don't help him.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
Do you guys, are you supposed to suck your gut in all the time?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
Because it feels like that's a lie, but then people tell you, like fitness people tell you suck it in because that's like helping, but it's like...

03:41.000 --> 03:52.000
I heard that long-term sucking in your gut can cause problems because it's like, it's stretching it for way too long, but realistically, you probably won't keep it held for that long.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Right, you'll forget.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, this is bad. What you're doing right there is bad for breathing. You're supposed to breathe from your stomach, not from your chest.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
If your shoulders go up, that means you're breathing wrong.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Your belly's supposed to inflate like a balloon. That's good. That's good. Right there.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Right here.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
I went down a weird YouTube spiral. It was like a kind of a red-pillish spiral where I was...

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I can't remember how I ended up there, but I started learning about posture.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
There were all these guys that were talking about nerd neck. They're demonstrating and I'm like...

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Let's see it.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, like, you know, nerd neck, I definitely have it. It's like when the 45 degree, it has to do...

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
It starts with your shoulders moving forward, and then it has something to do with your head.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
It's like heavy, so then things like compensate, and then you get nerd neck.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Nerd neck.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Nerd neck.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Nerd neck.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Nerd neck.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
So I guess if you just start moving your shoulders back and sticking your chest out.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
I was watching all these videos that were about like alpha posture and how you're supposed to send a signal.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
It's all about fooling women. I guess not fooling them because no one's attacking us.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
So I guess it's not a lie if you're like, I'm confident because you might as well be.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
But the idea is to expose more of your ventral surface to injury, which proves to the woman unconsciously

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
that you don't have anything to worry about.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
And that in turn means maybe you have more fiefdoms or something, like biologically.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
You know these guys.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, we know.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
That's why the most popular guys are giant fat guys with targets painted on their bellies.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Like that guy in the stock footage that gets shot with the cannonball.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Right, exactly. Everyone loves him.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
That guy. You know how that guy died? Drowned in pussy.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
You were going to say cannonball shot wound.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Cannonball wound.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's what you call it.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Cannon shot wound.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Sure.

05:58.000 --> 06:10.000
Do you think he cried after the footage cut?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
And people would look at him like, man, get over yourself.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
You got to get shot with a cannon and the guy could cry a little.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I do want to know.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Right?

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Those people are being really unreasonable to judge him for that.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
That stock footage also is a high speed camera.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Because you see his belly go like, and it doesn't look, I mean he looks like a large man,

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
but does he really look like someone whose wheelhouse is getting shot?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I wonder if they're just like, it was basically just like a, you know,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
they put a little bit of explosive behind a cannonball because they were really excited about the camera.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Like it was like a myth busters thing.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Like I wouldn't want your belly jiggle.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
I heard that he's actually laying on a table and they dropped the bowling ball on his stomach.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It was the first use of green screen.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
How do you practice for that?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
How do you warm up?

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Do you think they just started with like a small cannonball and just worked their way up?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
How do you practice?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
How do you do something?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Here's a wacky idea.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Look at that cannon.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
How about you?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Let me take my shirt off first.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
He took his shirt off.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Why are you taking his shirt off?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Look, we're going to go.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You probably got some cardboard underneath there.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
What was I thinking about?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Something that I was watching and I was like, how do you practice this without dying?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I can't remember what it was.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Tie your rope walking.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
You get the net underneath you.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, that's a good point.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
So if you fall off, you don't die.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Train eating.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
You can probably use a thicker rope.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
It probably starts as like, like the rope is like as thick as like a barrel.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Here's it.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Here's it.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Two ropes.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Two ropes.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
They probably start you on two ropes.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Remember that guy that was that French guy that walked between the World Trade Center?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Just went up there and just did it.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
After he stepped on a nail.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
How the fuck does this.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I don't understand if the wind blows, you're just dead.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I don't get that.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
It just seems like white bother.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
It wasn't a windy day.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
And then they use it.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And then there's there's solution to that as they bring out a giant stick.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
That's like, it's like, isn't this just making problems to solve?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Like, like, like, like, like, like if you lose the stick because because like, what are you

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
doing with the stick?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, well, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Like, like, like, well, I would lose the stick.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
But I guess that's why, you know, I'm not a tightrope walker.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
No.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm just a fucking thin.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Alpha Nect Death Valley t-shirt.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Boo's Swillin Cowboy.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Spencer, what, what, what have you been doing lately?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Doing any, um, doing anything lately?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh, yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I was at Comic Con.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Did you get recognized?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yay.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I got recognized.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
It's weird.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I clocked how many times I got recognized and how many times I just got like a, hey, how

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
long you've been growing that beard?

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
And it was like about the same, which was interesting.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
How many times of each?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
About six on the highest.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Like you're like a human beard.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
People, you're interchangeable with your beard.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
You, you're, yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
It's so strange.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Like people really just go, oh yeah, a beard.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
That's something I'm allowed to like talk to you about.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Except can I give you a little cynical fame 101?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh, God.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Straight from the cynical heartline.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
About 30% of those people that are talking to you about your beard, they know what's up.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
They know what's up.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh, yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
They're playing it stealth because they're like, oh, I don't want to be a fan.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I would like, I would.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
That would be interesting.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
They'll, they'll buy you a drink and then they'll talk to you about the economy.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And then on their way out, they'll be like, by the way, big fan.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
What?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
You fucker.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I thought you were a nice person.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
You know how like Patton Oswalt and, and like Brian Cranston, like they wear the mask and

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
they walk through so they could be with the people in the comic con?

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
I thought there's the Spencer put on just a mask with the beard and not change anything

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
else.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I think you would still be recognizable.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Like if you'd dressed like a ghost writer.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Mark Hamill dressed as a stormtrooper and I thought that was cute.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
No, I didn't see that.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
It's funny because he, and he referenced like, you know, he's like, I know I'm a little short

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
for this costume.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It's cute.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
He referenced that.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
He referenced.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
He referenced that.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
He referenced the line from Star Wars where he enters Princess Leia.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
He just kept saying that over and over again.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
No, he's in his, in his Instagram caption.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I mean, that's asking to be going, you're out.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I like Mark Hamill.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't know if I ever mentioned this on this podcast, but I, like when we were, I think

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
I must have, when we were doing a community and we were picking, like, you know, we ended

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
up with Louise Guzman as the statue in the courtyard and we were going through people

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
like, well, there should be a statue of someone in the courtyard.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I must have talked about this.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I don't remember.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
One of the, one of the people was with the proposals was what about Mark Hamill?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Cause he's like, it's like, he's Luke Skywalker, but he's Mark Hamill.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
And like, what if he was like the statue, he was the most famous alumnus of the, of,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
of Greendale.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And I, and I sent him an email or, I think, I don't think I sent him an email.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.800
I think the charming thing was that I got a, like a hand typed letter from him in response

11:20.800 --> 11:22.920
to a casting director reaching out to him.

11:22.920 --> 11:30.000
So I was the schmock, the, the, the cigar chomping, get me Mark Hamill.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
And, and, and, and got this like lovingly crafted letter from Mark Hamill that was like,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
dear Dan Harmon, pleased to meet you.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm Mark Hamill.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
And I shit my pants and keep reading the letter.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And he's like, I'm so flattered.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I got the script.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
It's very funny.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
And, and, but, you know, I think we both know the jokes on me a little bit.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Like he, he wasn't defensive about it.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It wasn't like Gene Simmons' interview with Terry Gross.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It was like, it was like Mark Hamill.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Like he got, he kind of called us on it.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
He was sort of like, yeah, the joke is kind of like, I'm a schnook, you know, like, and,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
and it's, I do agree.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
It's funny, but also like, I kind of like, I'm not ready to just be like that yet or

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
something like that.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
He just explained it very concisely and very, very politely and empathically.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And then it was like, also I'm a director.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
So if you want to give me a serious job, fucking asshole.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
And I was, I was, I was, I actually, this is Mark Hamill wrote me a letter.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Did you save it?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, come on.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
You know, you move, you move, you meet people, you say hello, you say goodbye, yada, yada.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
You know, our first guest is just sort of a surprise.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
I found this, this, this kid like out in the alley, like, like LA is like, it's a wasteland

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
of talent.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Like there are too much people, people come here.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
They come here on a carpet of dreams.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
They, they sell the carpet.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
They sell shoes.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
They got some dreams, dream shakens left over.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
They sell watermelon on the side of the road, fruits and vegetables.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
You've seen these people.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You've seen these people selling things.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
Let's, let's, let's bring out this poor kid.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Jeff Davis.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Jeff Davis.

13:13.000 --> 13:42.800
So Jeff, I heard his terrible story out in the alley, like he's just had a vocal

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
surgery.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.800
So he's drinking hot tea and he can't talk that much yet.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.800
So that's why he's not, normally I just make a kid from the alley, a comptroller.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.800
You did.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.800
I'm just here to listen tonight, Dan.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Okay.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.800
You gotta eat that mic.

14:05.800 --> 14:06.800
Yeah.

14:06.800 --> 14:13.800
I'm, I'm already paying for myself, Dan.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.800
Can we hear a little bit about, I've never known a human being.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
So Jeff, Jeff.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.800
I've never known a human being.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.800
I've known they know lizards and crustaceans.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.800
I only know ghosts and minotaurs.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.800
I've never known a human being.

14:29.800 --> 14:34.800
You, sir, will be his first human being.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.800
Make it good.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.800
What is it like to not be able to talk for two weeks, three weeks?

14:42.800 --> 14:45.800
It was two weeks of total vocal silence.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
Because of what you, what did you have?

14:47.800 --> 14:54.800
I had a polyp on one of my, I think my left vocal fold and there's a tiny little pea,

14:54.800 --> 14:59.800
like not even a pea shape, like, like if a pea grew peas, that's what the pea would look

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
like.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.800
And it was a very tiny little thing and I had some doctors go down in my throat and they

15:03.800 --> 15:06.800
were very good and it was like a sleep for like an hour and a half and they,

15:06.800 --> 15:12.800
Did you wake up during, during the, and see if they were talking shit about you?

15:12.800 --> 15:15.800
I woke up and I was just covered in dicks and balls drawings.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.800
Oh yeah.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.800
Yeah.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
Rob woke up during his colonoscopy.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
How did you pronounce that?

15:21.800 --> 15:24.800
Hey, Colin.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
Would he cut open your colon?

15:26.800 --> 15:29.800
Didn't you go in with Colin Hanks and get an endoscopy?

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
Yeah, yeah.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.800
That's a colonoscopy when they start with him.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
Even though it's his throat, it's a colonoscopy.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.800
I don't think my insurance is going to cover this.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.800
You kind of sounded like Colin Hanks when he said that.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.800
I sounded who?

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
I don't think there's insurance.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.800
You kind of sounded like Colin Hanks.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.800
I wasn't trying to.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
No, that's good.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
Oh no, I'm sorry.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.800
I'm doing a terrible job.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.800
Yeah, Rob woke up during his colonoscopy.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
We've already told this.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.800
All right.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
Well, yeah, we told every story all the time.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
We got, we got a couple things that are, that we haven't talked about.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.800
Keep talking.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.800
One is a shooting and the other is a,

16:01.800 --> 16:02.800
do your friend that departed?

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Since I couldn't talk.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.800
I threw up on my groceries.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
Go ahead.

16:05.800 --> 16:13.800
I'm not going to be able to butt in tonight, you guys.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
You guys, you guys do all the talking.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.800
I was just going to say that since I was able to talk,

16:19.800 --> 16:23.800
this amazing story happened to me, which I cannot tell you,

16:23.800 --> 16:27.800
because I am on vocal arrest.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.800
I really hope it doesn't get church in trouble,

16:31.800 --> 16:36.800
because I heard, because it's such a funny joke that,

16:36.800 --> 16:39.800
I think he got to Dino and then Dino told it to me.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.800
Dino said, church says that even though Jeff can't talk at all,

16:43.800 --> 16:47.800
he still figures out ways to interrupt her.

16:47.800 --> 16:52.800
It's because I'm a showman.

16:52.800 --> 17:00.800
Speaking of the glass ceiling and alpha neck,

17:00.800 --> 17:01.800
you get that?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.800
Is that the glass ceiling?

17:03.800 --> 17:04.800
Put it on.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.800
It looks so practical.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.800
I always imagine it being more oppressive.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.800
Oh, it's like, you can wear it like a helmet.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.800
Bad will happen.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.800
Hello, Mr. Bob.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.800
Thanks.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.800
Expect you to die.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.800
Does it sound as cool as it sounds?

17:23.800 --> 17:28.800
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

17:28.800 --> 17:34.800
Rob's holding a plexiglass container on his head.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.800
I was going to say, speaking of...

17:35.800 --> 17:37.800
Oh, it's a trash can.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.800
Yeah, yeah.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
I was going to say, but why don't I just bring her out,

17:42.800 --> 17:44.800
and I want to bring her out.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.800
It's my chance to do my Don Pardo impression.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.800
He was an announcer in the 70s on SNL.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.800
Please welcome Lorraine Newman.

17:53.800 --> 18:05.800
Thank you.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.800
Thanks for coming.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.800
Thank you.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.800
It's been a rough week.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
It has, yeah.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
We were talking backstage about it.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.800
I hazarded a guess, but without realizing that, of course,

18:17.800 --> 18:20.800
you knew him because you were on Metalocalypse

18:20.800 --> 18:22.800
that we lost our friend, John Schnep.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
I don't know how many of you are familiar with him.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.800
We're in L.A.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
It's just...

18:28.800 --> 18:31.800
What kind of host brings you out

18:31.800 --> 18:32.800
and then just drops that on you?

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
I don't know.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
How are you doing?

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
Happy days.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.800
I'm doing great.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.800
Okay, so let's talk about our dead friend.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.800
Okay, no.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
I just like...

18:43.800 --> 18:45.800
I wanted to eulogize him a little bit because I haven't...

18:45.800 --> 18:48.800
I always feel sociopathic when...

18:48.800 --> 18:51.800
I don't know.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.800
I remember the color of the floor

18:54.800 --> 18:57.800
when I found out that he had just...

18:57.800 --> 18:59.800
boom, like crazy stroke.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.800
It does feel like life turns on a dime

19:02.800 --> 19:04.800
because I was just saying that I saw hereditary with him

19:04.800 --> 19:06.800
three weeks ago.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.800
And then there's this tremendous guilt.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.800
Now you're talking about someone in the past tense.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.800
But I think it's just...

19:15.800 --> 19:17.800
Everything about it feels awful.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.800
So I don't know what I thought that was podcasting dynamite,

19:19.800 --> 19:22.800
but I also don't know what my job is.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.800
But just because...

19:25.800 --> 19:27.800
I see people's Instagrams and stuff,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.800
and I just wanted to lend our voice to his eulogy.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.800
I think that there are some people when they die,

19:32.800 --> 19:33.800
it's like, yeah.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.800
But with him, you can't believe that.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.800
I think that's important to acknowledge.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
You can't believe that.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.800
I can't believe that he passed away.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.800
He was so just vibrant.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.800
So that's, I think, the difference.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.800
He was such a...

19:47.800 --> 19:50.800
I think he epitomized workaholism, right?

19:50.800 --> 19:53.800
I mean, this is a city driven by workaholics,

19:53.800 --> 19:55.800
and I'm trying to get over that therapy,

19:55.800 --> 20:01.800
but John was both cautionary tale and role model.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.800
I mean, he just kept working and working,

20:05.800 --> 20:07.800
and he just loved sitting in front of his avid

20:07.800 --> 20:09.800
and making crazy shit.

20:09.800 --> 20:15.800
And every anecdote about him, from adult swim to...

20:15.800 --> 20:18.800
everywhere else he's worked, it's like an editor.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.800
Every anecdote is about coming into the office at 9 a.m.,

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
and he's been there all night,

20:23.800 --> 20:26.800
and he's created some ridiculous, elaborate thing

20:26.800 --> 20:28.800
that they can't even use in the show.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.800
He's a consummate artist.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.800
I mean, really, he really lived to create art.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.800
So yeah, we love you, John.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
I hope you're listening.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.800
I hope that's how the universe works.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.800
Unless that's all it is, unless you're just vapor,

20:41.800 --> 20:42.800
and you have to listen.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.800
You have to have people listening to podcasts.

20:43.800 --> 20:44.800
That's awful.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.800
Then sign me up for atheism.

20:47.800 --> 20:52.800
If it's just listening to shit in your local area forever.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.800
And then the whole planet goes away,

20:54.800 --> 20:56.800
and you're just like, hello!

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
And you can't even hear the other people.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.800
You can't even look forward to your friends.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.800
Or you only just get the intros to the podcast.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.800
Just the intros where people vamp for 20 minutes,

21:05.800 --> 21:09.800
and you want to kill yourself.

21:09.800 --> 21:14.800
We don't know what that's like at all.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.800
Yeah, on the off chance that you're listening, John,

21:17.800 --> 21:21.800
I'm part and parcel of it.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.800
It's narcissistic to feel guilty about,

21:23.800 --> 21:24.800
like, oh, I didn't talk to you enough.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.800
I wasn't close enough and all that stuff, but whatever.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.800
I don't think it's narcissistic.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.800
It's just kind of regret that we don't value people

21:33.800 --> 21:36.800
while they're here.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
No, I'm totally kidding.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.800
And it really wasn't worth it.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.800
Well, if you weren't kidding, what would you have meant?

21:43.800 --> 21:47.800
Would that have been a dire warning to me?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.800
I know things, Dan.

21:49.800 --> 21:50.800
I know things.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
It sounded like a threat.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.800
I think she was saying that you didn't value John

21:54.800 --> 21:57.800
while he was here, and that's your giant blunder in life.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.800
Yeah, I have a feeling I make that blunder

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
with just about everybody.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.800
Rob, certainly, yeah, there he goes.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
No, I just learned to appreciate, you know,

22:08.800 --> 22:10.800
I'll just think of someone,

22:10.800 --> 22:13.800
and I'll text them that I'm thinking of them.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.800
And that in itself, I think...

22:15.800 --> 22:17.800
You text the memory of them?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.800
No, well, not...

22:19.800 --> 22:21.800
Oh, oh, oh, I thought you meant...

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
In terms of, you know, acknowledging people

22:23.800 --> 22:25.800
while they're here, you know,

22:25.800 --> 22:27.800
I think it's just so nice to do that now.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.800
Your texts are usually you up?

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
Yeah, well...

22:31.800 --> 22:33.800
Just to you, honey.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.800
Thank you.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
Yeah.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.800
I have started a new policy.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.800
The positive version of your friends

22:42.800 --> 22:45.800
unexpectedly passing is in this town,

22:45.800 --> 22:48.800
your friends blow up, they become super famous.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.800
They're on the cover of Time Magazine or something one day,

22:51.800 --> 22:54.800
and the other day, you were having coffee with them,

22:54.800 --> 22:57.800
and I feel like our instinct,

22:57.800 --> 23:00.800
probably not yours, you seem more grounded.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.800
Oh, I'm a saint.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.800
But my instinct used to be like,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.800
well, they don't want to...

23:06.800 --> 23:08.800
The last thing they need is some schlub text to them

23:08.800 --> 23:10.800
and saying, remember back here?

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
Yeah, but that's so valuable to them.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.800
Yeah, and it's like also, like,

23:14.800 --> 23:16.800
what if they get nominated for something or something?

23:16.800 --> 23:19.800
It's like, oh, the idea that they don't want you to...

23:19.800 --> 23:21.800
That's so narcissistic.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.800
Like, that's just ego.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
Like, oh, they don't want to hear me say

23:25.800 --> 23:27.800
good job on that music video.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.800
It's afraid of being vulnerable.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.800
Because you don't want the silence to...

23:31.800 --> 23:33.800
Yeah.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.800
But I think any chance to acknowledge people

23:35.800 --> 23:37.800
and your appreciation of their work

23:37.800 --> 23:39.800
is not wasted.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.800
And it's not about you.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
You don't look foolish.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
You don't look...

23:45.800 --> 23:47.800
You're not open to some sort of, you know,

23:47.800 --> 23:49.800
put down just because you've acknowledged,

23:49.800 --> 23:51.800
you know, congratulations to someone

23:51.800 --> 23:53.800
or something like that.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
Have you coped with...

23:55.800 --> 24:00.800
I mean, whatever.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
Have you...

24:02.800 --> 24:05.800
You're like, I'm carving out your grim leg.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.800
Like, Dan, you've given me a sandbox

24:07.800 --> 24:09.800
of cat turds to play with.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.800
I made Santa do,

24:11.800 --> 24:13.800
and now you're going to knock it over when they're like,

24:13.800 --> 24:15.800
good job.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.800
Yeah, all I'm trying to say is don't be too cool

24:17.800 --> 24:19.800
to let people know that you appreciate them.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.800
Yeah, and I just got that now.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.800
Like, I...

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
I mean, I just...

24:25.800 --> 24:27.800
So I could start texting you again.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.800
Yeah, I mean, it's nice to hear from you.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.800
Yeah.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.800
Good to... It'd be good to hear.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.800
I'm warming up to you.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.800
I told you at the top of the show.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.800
Am I on mute?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.800
Is that... Did you mute my...

24:41.800 --> 24:43.800
my handle?

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
No!

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
You were so busted.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.800
I... Have you...

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
Have you... Have you...

24:49.800 --> 24:51.800
Where are you at with mortality?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.800
I'm sorry, I keep handing you these gems.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.800
I'm for it! I'm for mortality!

24:55.800 --> 24:57.800
Well, that's a safe...

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
safe bet.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.800
I'm four days away.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
I just kind of...

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
I... Do you...

25:05.800 --> 25:07.800
Do you... Do you...

25:07.800 --> 25:09.800
Look, I can't talk a lot, so my jokes have to be short

25:09.800 --> 25:11.800
and stupid.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.800
Where am I with mortality?

25:13.800 --> 25:15.800
Yeah, do you push it to the...

25:15.800 --> 25:17.800
I have complete denial about it.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.800
Oh, good. That's refreshing. Thank you.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.800
I just... I'm never... I'm...

25:21.800 --> 25:23.800
I'm not going to die. I'm not going to get old.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.800
Even though I hurt, like, hell!

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
Fantastic.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
Every morning, and what could that...

25:27.800 --> 25:29.800
What's wrong? Oh, you're old.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.800
You know what? Can we enter a unique friendship

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
where we back each other up on this?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.800
You're never going to die, Lorraine Newman.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.800
I fucking got your back.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.800
Like, now lie to me and let's be just best friends

25:39.800 --> 25:41.800
about this.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.800
Thank you.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.800
We're going to be the ones, the exceptions.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.800
Yeah, because, you know, yeah, science every day.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.800
Science with the science.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.800
And what a joy it would be

25:49.800 --> 25:51.800
to hang out here forever.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.800
A dynasty typewriter?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
Oh, sure.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.800
Yeah, what...

25:57.800 --> 25:59.800
That's an interesting question.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.800
Would you accept immortality

26:01.800 --> 26:03.800
if you could...

26:03.800 --> 26:05.800
within a perimeter of 500 feet?

26:05.800 --> 26:07.800
For...

26:07.800 --> 26:09.800
If you could be, like, just...

26:09.800 --> 26:11.800
I'm going to live forever, but everyone has to come visit me.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
Yes, but I'm at Bevmo.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.800
Yeah.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.800
And they're, like, pushing the decision.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.800
And you're like, this offer is available

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
for, like, 14 minutes.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
Yeah.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.800
Either you're going to die of prostate cancer

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
at a random die, or you're going to live forever

26:27.800 --> 26:29.800
here at Bevmo.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.800
Within 500 feet, yeah.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.800
Yeah, that sounds like hell.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.800
I think you would pass it up, right?

26:35.800 --> 26:37.800
You'd go, like, okay, I've seen enough movies to know.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.800
How much have you seen the vampires?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.800
They get tired. They get bored.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.800
They get lonely. They're tired of seeing people

26:43.800 --> 26:45.800
get old and die.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.800
I would want to ask, can I kill myself

26:47.800 --> 26:49.800
to the person?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.800
Because I don't know if vampires can't, can they?

26:51.800 --> 26:53.800
Oh, yeah.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
Hey, guys.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.800
They just open. They just walk outside.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.800
Well, yeah, if they can't, they just go...

26:59.800 --> 27:01.800
Yeah.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.800
Yeah, if vampires couldn't commit suicide,

27:03.800 --> 27:05.800
then the sunlight thing wouldn't be...

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
Yeah, yeah.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.800
Because anytime someone dragged him out in the sunlight,

27:09.800 --> 27:11.800
they'd just go, my idea, my idea!

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
Yeah.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.800
I want this! I want it, Van Helsing.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.800
I think this is great.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.800
You're not cool.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.800
I don't watch enough vampire stuff,

27:21.800 --> 27:23.800
but do vampires commit suicide by walking outside?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.800
Is that a thing?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.800
Yeah, but then, you know, I mean,

27:27.800 --> 27:29.800
the whole lore has gotten so, you know,

27:29.800 --> 27:31.800
blown up that they can reconstitute themselves.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.800
I mean, you name it.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
They just don't die.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.800
Did you watch The Strain?

27:37.800 --> 27:39.800
The Strain? Did you see The Strain?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.800
Or was it anybody?

27:41.800 --> 27:43.800
No, that was crazy.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.800
Hey, Lorraine, have you watched Blade?

27:45.800 --> 27:47.800
Blade? Yeah, I love Blade.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.800
Pretty fucking badass, right?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.800
Yeah, it's great!

27:51.800 --> 27:53.800
He walks around in the day.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.800
He's the daywalker.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.800
He's half-human.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.800
Can you do it for me, Rob, because you're Comptroller.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.800
Oh, my God.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.800
Would you please do your Kris Kristofferson as...

28:03.800 --> 28:05.800
Was his name Whistler?

28:05.800 --> 28:07.800
Whistler, could you give me one line

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
as Blade sidekick and Blade?

28:09.800 --> 28:11.800
Well, I can't imagine what line that would be.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.800
The only...

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
Did I catch you fuckers at a bad time?

28:21.800 --> 28:23.800
Yeah.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
What movie was it that I saw?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
Blade! Blade! It was from Blade.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.800
I saw Two Vampires.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.800
I think it was like a vampire couple,

28:31.800 --> 28:33.800
and they held hands and they sat on a beach

28:33.800 --> 28:35.800
and they watched the sunrise together,

28:35.800 --> 28:37.800
and I thought I was going to die.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.800
God, was it that one with...

28:39.800 --> 28:41.800
Steven Dorff?

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
No, no, not Steven Dorff.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
That's Blade.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.800
That's Blade.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.800
And that's the one with Wesley Snipes.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.800
Thank you.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.800
Sorry, what?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
Only Lovers Left Alive.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.800
Left Alive.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.800
Is that the one with Childish Swinton?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.800
Yeah.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.800
Okay, maybe I saw...

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
I forgot the title, but...

29:05.800 --> 29:07.800
And it might have happened in Two Vampire Movies.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.800
What was the one where...

29:09.800 --> 29:11.800
What's his name?

29:11.800 --> 29:13.800
Steven, the other guy...

29:13.800 --> 29:15.800
Deacon Frost?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.800
What? No.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.800
The guy, and he's in the...

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
Wait, is it also Steven Dorff?

29:21.800 --> 29:23.800
Is he in a vampire movie where in the future

29:23.800 --> 29:25.800
everyone's a vampire?

29:25.800 --> 29:27.800
That's Daybreak.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.800
Who's that guy?

29:29.800 --> 29:31.800
Ethan Hawke.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.800
Steven Dorff and Ethan Hawke

29:33.800 --> 29:35.800
are easy to confuse.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.800
And I think they'd both be flattered by that.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.800
Yes.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.800
I think they'd both simultaneously go...

29:41.800 --> 29:43.800
That's what I'm going for, and then they go...

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
Ha!

29:47.800 --> 29:49.800
I think Steven Dorff gets the better of that deal.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.800
I agree.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
Shots fired.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.800
Yeah, fuck that guy.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.800
I've got No Vampire in this race.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.800
I don't really care.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.800
In that movie, we learned that you can

30:01.800 --> 30:03.800
be cured of vampirism

30:03.800 --> 30:05.800
because if daylight will kill you,

30:05.800 --> 30:07.800
but

30:07.800 --> 30:09.800
no one ever thought of this,

30:09.800 --> 30:11.800
if you drive a car really fast

30:11.800 --> 30:13.800
and then you smash through the windshield into daylight,

30:13.800 --> 30:15.800
but

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
shortly after, while you're still on fire,

30:17.800 --> 30:19.800
you land in water

30:19.800 --> 30:21.800
and you're cured.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.800
That's the first thing I would try.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.800
That's the first thing every vampire

30:25.800 --> 30:27.800
would ever try.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
Why? Why? Why?

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
I haven't seen this movie.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.800
That's called science.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.800
It turns out curing vampirism

30:35.800 --> 30:37.800
easier than escaping killer bees.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.800
There's shit you're not even allowed

30:39.800 --> 30:41.800
to do when you're running for bees

30:41.800 --> 30:43.800
that you can do if you're a dying vampire

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
that'll give you immortality

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
or mortality, I guess, is what they're after.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.800
What does the car and the windshield have to do

30:49.800 --> 30:51.800
with helping you...

30:51.800 --> 30:53.800
Yeah, why does it have a windshield involved?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.800
It's a future where vampires drive around

30:55.800 --> 30:57.800
during the day and they have, like, blackout...

30:57.800 --> 30:59.800
UV blackout cars.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.800
You only use the cameras to get around

31:01.800 --> 31:03.800
so you can go meet mortals

31:03.800 --> 31:05.800
under a tree in the shade

31:05.800 --> 31:07.800
and hatch schemes,

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
but then the vampire cops

31:09.800 --> 31:11.800
who have head-to-toe body armor

31:11.800 --> 31:13.800
to shield them from the sun will come out

31:13.800 --> 31:15.800
and go,

31:15.800 --> 31:17.800
furies!

31:17.800 --> 31:19.800
But then he finds out quite an accident.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.800
Like, yeah.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.800
There's a show called iZombie

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
which I really loved

31:25.800 --> 31:27.800
where somebody got cured of being a zombie.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.800
Do you remember that?

31:29.800 --> 31:31.800
I don't know how they did it.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.800
You got to be in the trunk of that car

31:33.800 --> 31:35.800
when a vampire...

31:35.800 --> 31:37.800
Have you seen Santa Clarita Diet?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.800
You ever watch that?

31:39.800 --> 31:41.800
I tried. Should I give it another shot?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.800
Can I tell you?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.800
I'm a snob.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.800
The pilot, I was like,

31:47.800 --> 31:49.800
and I...

31:49.800 --> 31:51.800
but then, like...

31:51.800 --> 31:53.800
Cody was up for a job on it

31:53.800 --> 31:55.800
so she watched the whole season

31:55.800 --> 31:57.800
and I was just like, my hands were tied.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.800
That shit got funny.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.800
It just got really funny.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
Oh, I'm excited. I got something to watch.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.800
I'm excited, too.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.800
Why are...

32:07.800 --> 32:09.800
I always judge shows too early.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.800
I judge them by their first season and their pilot.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.800
I stopped watching Preacher for that reason.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.800
Mr. Robot, I was like, you mean Fight Club? Please.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.800
Then I walked away

32:17.800 --> 32:19.800
and then I hear everybody going,

32:19.800 --> 32:21.800
I'm like, come on,

32:21.800 --> 32:23.800
that Fight Club show.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.800
Turns out that's what they were doing

32:25.800 --> 32:27.800
on purpose or something.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.800
Fargo.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.800
I'd watched the first one. I was like, you're just doing Fargo.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.800
More like Far... you.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.800
I turned it off.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.800
Never watched again.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.800
Season two comes around. Oh, Fargo.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.800
Oh, it's so good. Yeah.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.800
Yeah, you got to give it a shot.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.800
It's too late now.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.800
Still haven't seen Atlanta. Still.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.800
Atlanta you haven't seen?

32:53.800 --> 32:55.800
No, I'm fucking on the worst.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.800
Well, I've seen it in Emmy submissions

32:57.800 --> 32:59.800
and it's great, but I don't watch it.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.800
I like crime drama

33:01.800 --> 33:03.800
and horror.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.800
What about crime nonfiction?

33:05.800 --> 33:07.800
Forensic files.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.800
What kind of horror?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.800
Everything except

33:11.800 --> 33:13.800
kind of found footage.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.800
Yeah.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.800
Did you see that sound boogins?

33:17.800 --> 33:19.800
Pardon me?

33:19.800 --> 33:21.800
I call it the sound boogins.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.800
In a quiet place.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.800
A quiet place.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.800
Yes, I did.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.800
They got the sound boogins running around.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.800
I saw sound boogins.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.800
It's good, right? Yeah, it's good.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.800
If I could definitely see

33:35.800 --> 33:37.800
why everyone on Earth that told me

33:37.800 --> 33:39.800
it was the best movie ever said that

33:39.800 --> 33:41.800
is because everyone on Earth hadn't told them

33:41.800 --> 33:43.800
it was the best movie ever.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.800
Sound boogins.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.800
My doctor told me that's one of the nicest

33:47.800 --> 33:49.800
sounds you can say when you're recovering from vocal surgery.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.800
Seller door.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.800
Sound boogins.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.800
Stairway nail.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.800
So what about hereditary, everybody?

33:59.800 --> 34:01.800
What do you think? I haven't seen hereditary.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.800
I heard it was fucked up.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.800
Wow, have you seen it? No.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.800
I recommend it.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.800
I didn't mean to sound so...

34:09.800 --> 34:11.800
I sounded like a puppet

34:11.800 --> 34:13.800
on some show teaching you manners.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.800
No.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.800
No.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.800
I'm Daniel Crabtree.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.800
It's...

34:21.800 --> 34:23.800
What's amazing about it is

34:23.800 --> 34:25.800
once you realize what the story is,

34:25.800 --> 34:27.800
it's like, oh, well, movies

34:27.800 --> 34:29.800
about this have been made

34:29.800 --> 34:31.800
before but not like this.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.800
Is this a movie or a show?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.800
Hereditary is a movie.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.800
All right, well, I guess don't spoil it.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.800
Come on, who likes that movie?

34:39.800 --> 34:41.800
Yeah.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.800
Who hates that movie?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.800
Oh, one guy.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.800
That's fair.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.800
Lorraine, do you like

34:49.800 --> 34:51.800
Pinhead?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.800
In Hellraiser?

34:53.800 --> 34:55.800
I hate the Clive Barker stuff.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.800
It bores me to death.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.800
Even the first Pinhead?

34:59.800 --> 35:01.800
Well, I never got past that one.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.800
Well, here's the trick

35:03.800 --> 35:05.800
that's on you, Lorraine.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.800
When you watch a Clive Barker movie

35:07.800 --> 35:09.800
and you hate it,

35:09.800 --> 35:11.800
your suffering is your pleasure.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.800
Yeah, yeah.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.800
That's what he wants.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.800
I got that far.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.800
No, I rose, please.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.800
It's a waste of good suffering.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.800
Everything opposite will be

35:23.800 --> 35:25.800
opposite, too.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.800
What you call torture,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.800
I call a chicken palm sandwich.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.800
Chains in my flesh are such

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
things to see.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.800
What?

35:39.800 --> 35:41.800
What are you talking about, Jack?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.800
When we were on Ghost,

35:43.800 --> 35:45.800
when we were on Ghost,

35:45.800 --> 35:47.800
Ryan Ridley and I would

35:47.800 --> 35:49.800
giggle like we would do

35:49.800 --> 35:51.800
impressions of Pinhead

35:51.800 --> 35:53.800
as done by Ted Knight.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.800
We'd be like, oh, oh, oh,

35:55.800 --> 35:57.800
oh, oh.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.800
This is a biggie.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.800
He's just like, oh,

36:01.800 --> 36:03.800
you'll soul apartment role,

36:03.800 --> 36:05.800
Ted Knight.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.800
Thank you.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.800
The only 55-year-old.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.800
Frank Knight is in the house.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
When was he knighted?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.800
Dumb. All right. No, that was good.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.800
Look, secret to dad jokes.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.800
You don't have to have a kid. You turn 45

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
and they start fucking...

36:21.800 --> 36:23.800
I just make puns all day lately.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.800
It's like a rash.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.800
Do you read signs, too?

36:27.800 --> 36:29.800
Out loud in the car?

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
Yeah.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.800
Do you twist them into puns?

36:33.800 --> 36:35.800
Custer, yogurt, more like...

36:35.800 --> 36:37.800
No, dads don't get that far.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.800
They just go like...

36:39.800 --> 36:41.800
They just be driving and they go...

36:41.800 --> 36:43.800
Norms.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.800
Chick-fil-A.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.800
Dollar general.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.800
Maybe not by myself,

36:51.800 --> 36:53.800
but I'm assuming there's someone else in the car.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.800
Cooles hardware.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.800
They really be like that, though.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.800
Dads.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.800
It's true.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.800
What were you telling me about the James Franklin

37:11.800 --> 37:13.800
Jamestown thing?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.800
Oh, well, here's another reference nobody will know.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.800
Does anybody know who Lucille Ball was?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.800
Yeah.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.800
Well, her hometown is Jamestown,

37:21.800 --> 37:23.800
upstate New York, Buffalo.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.800
And they approached her when she was still

37:25.800 --> 37:27.800
living, obviously, and said,

37:27.800 --> 37:29.800
we want to do a museum dedicated to you.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.800
And she said,

37:31.800 --> 37:33.800
I would much prefer

37:33.800 --> 37:35.800
if you do a museum celebrating comedy.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.800
Wow.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.800
So the National

37:39.800 --> 37:41.800
Comedy Center was built.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.800
They started on it eight years ago,

37:43.800 --> 37:45.800
and I took a tour

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
a week ago, and it is

37:47.800 --> 37:49.800
mind-blowing.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
If anybody's a comedy nerd, you will weep.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.800
It's absolutely mecca.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.800
What

37:55.800 --> 37:57.800
town in New York is that,

37:57.800 --> 37:59.800
like a bigger town, is the Jamestown near?

37:59.800 --> 38:01.800
I don't know,

38:01.800 --> 38:03.800
because I am from the West Coast,

38:03.800 --> 38:05.800
and I do not know my way around there.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.800
I'm going to be up there not too long.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.800
Buffalo is the biggest.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.800
Oh, you've got to check it out.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.800
Yeah, and there's a big opening.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.800
It's funny, Harmontown was never asked to...

38:15.800 --> 38:17.800
Pardon me?

38:17.800 --> 38:19.800
To contribute?

38:19.800 --> 38:21.800
We still haven't been inducted.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.800
We don't have a chair alone.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.800
I got a Harmontown question,

38:25.800 --> 38:27.800
as I normally sort of...

38:27.800 --> 38:29.800
These still suck.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.800
Yeah, they're the worst.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.800
They're so uncomfortable.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.800
I've been saying it for years, and they're still here.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.800
We're guests here.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.800
It's a fine theater.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.800
You want us to start asking for...

38:41.800 --> 38:43.800
We'd have to provide our own.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.800
I feel like we brought these chairs.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.800
Yes, because they were at the castle.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.800
You cut to just these really comfortable chairs

38:49.800 --> 38:51.800
throughout.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.800
That's awesome.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.800
Lorraine Newman.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.800
Conehead Stories, go.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.800
Conehead Stories, go.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.800
Okay.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.800
All right.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.800
This one's called Conehead Stories.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.800
Take it away.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.800
Okay, well, one time,

39:09.800 --> 39:11.800
we wanted to kill off the Coneheads

39:11.800 --> 39:13.800
and send them back to Remulax,

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
so we did some actual outside filming

39:15.800 --> 39:17.800
where Dan Acroy, Jane Curtin,

39:17.800 --> 39:19.800
we were just driving around,

39:19.800 --> 39:21.800
I think New Jersey or something.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.800
And the thing that they attached

39:23.800 --> 39:25.800
the cone with

39:25.800 --> 39:27.800
was something that's not used anymore

39:27.800 --> 39:29.800
called spirit gum.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.800
And we'd only been at it

39:31.800 --> 39:33.800
for like five minutes when we did a sketch,

39:33.800 --> 39:35.800
but this was like several hours

39:35.800 --> 39:37.800
and it started to burn like fuck.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.800
You know?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.800
And I don't know,

39:41.800 --> 39:43.800
I think I'm not speaking out of school

39:43.800 --> 39:45.800
when I say that Danny and Jane

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
smoked weed to deal with the pain.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.800
They can take the hit.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.800
Their careers can take it.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.800
I think TMZ is here tonight.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
That's probably whose phone rang.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.800
Oh, dear God.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.800
But Danny and Jane can take it.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.800
Yeah, I mean, Jane is still waters.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.800
I heard he called her an ignorant slut once.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.800
He did.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.800
But I mean, when the Stones...

40:07.800 --> 40:09.800
TMZ, out to the street.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.800
When the Rolling Stones hosted our show,

40:11.800 --> 40:13.800
Jane Curtin's dressing room was next to mine

40:13.800 --> 40:15.800
and I remember opening the door

40:15.800 --> 40:17.800
and Jane was in a bathrobe and curlers

40:17.800 --> 40:19.800
smoking and Mick Jagger was there.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.800
Just the two of them.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.800
It's like this...

40:23.800 --> 40:25.800
he should be in my dressing room.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.800
Why is he...

40:27.800 --> 40:29.800
She hasn't sunk in for me that it's just legal now.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.800
Isn't it just legal?

40:31.800 --> 40:33.800
It's sort of like in this whole fracas...

40:33.800 --> 40:35.800
I mean, I had a medical card

40:35.800 --> 40:37.800
and I would go talk to the guy with the ponytail

40:37.800 --> 40:39.800
on the stethoscope and like pretend

40:39.800 --> 40:41.800
I had sleep apnea.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.800
It's not legal in New York.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.800
Because my older child

40:45.800 --> 40:47.800
was complaining.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.800
She wanted some edibles.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.800
She was freaking out because she had bed bugs.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.800
And she was sure

40:53.800 --> 40:55.800
that she was finding them all over the house.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.800
It was kind of like Coke bugs.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.800
But she said, God, I could use some edibles.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.800
I said, go out and get some.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.800
It's illegal in New York and I had no idea.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.800
Huh.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.800
Because you're like it always seemed legal

41:07.800 --> 41:09.800
when I was here.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.800
What's the problem?

41:11.800 --> 41:13.800
I think we got a little

41:13.800 --> 41:15.800
sidetracked from the conehead story.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.800
Did you ever keep

41:17.800 --> 41:19.800
shit? Is the cone

41:19.800 --> 41:21.800
hollow? Is the conehead...

41:21.800 --> 41:23.800
Well, it's not

41:23.800 --> 41:25.800
hollow, but it is firm and...

41:25.800 --> 41:27.800
Well, I...

41:27.800 --> 41:29.800
I've officially become Regis Philbin, by the way.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.800
I don't remember.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.800
What do you put in there?

41:33.800 --> 41:35.800
It's the cone hollow. You put things in there.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.800
I put an omelet.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.800
Was there like another act to the spirit gum

41:39.800 --> 41:41.800
story when you were all burning to death?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.800
That was it. You know, we did need to

41:43.800 --> 41:45.800
pump gas at one point, which

41:45.800 --> 41:47.800
was fun. Do you remember

41:47.800 --> 41:49.800
back when the conehead

41:49.800 --> 41:51.800
movie was coming out and we

41:51.800 --> 41:53.800
at Comedy Spores

41:53.800 --> 41:55.800
had to wear coneheads and we played

41:55.800 --> 41:57.800
the game Doctor Conehead because

41:57.800 --> 41:59.800
we were... That's right.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.800
Comedy Spores was hoping we would get on a local commercial.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.800
Oh, my God.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.800
That was so sad. Tell that story.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.800
Yeah, like Paramount

42:07.800 --> 42:09.800
did the coneheads movie

42:09.800 --> 42:11.800
and, yeah, the part

42:11.800 --> 42:13.800
of the promotion was that they sent coneheads.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.800
I mean, I'm kind of just repeating what you said, but we

42:15.800 --> 42:17.800
worked at Comedy Spores. Well, you know, like back in the

42:17.800 --> 42:19.800
the commercials

42:19.800 --> 42:21.800
where they go, we loved it.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.800
Yeah, they were wearing a conehead

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
or something, and so our comedy

42:25.800 --> 42:27.800
club took it, they were like,

42:27.800 --> 42:29.800
oh, that means that we could get

42:29.800 --> 42:31.800
some promotion.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.800
Like, no, they're not...

42:33.800 --> 42:35.800
It was so sad that we like

42:35.800 --> 42:37.800
perverted our show to like instead of

42:37.800 --> 42:39.800
we used to play Doctor Know-It-All, you know, that theater

42:39.800 --> 42:41.800
sports game or Mr. Know-It-All, where you do

42:41.800 --> 42:43.800
three people and then you answer one word at a time.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.800
Let's do a round. Hey, somebody ask

42:45.800 --> 42:47.800
a question.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.800
I heard, why is the sky blue? You fucking

42:49.800 --> 42:51.800
slow pokes.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.800
Here's the thing, it doesn't matter what the fucking question

42:53.800 --> 42:55.800
is.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.800
The...

42:57.800 --> 42:59.800
Sky is blue.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.800
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Sorry.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.800
Sorry.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.800
Go ahead.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.800
Why would you go from here to here?

43:07.800 --> 43:09.800
It's my fault.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.800
You go. You go.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.800
I was thinking of you as the referee.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.800
He's going to get the suggestions from the audience.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.800
Anyways, so our little

43:25.800 --> 43:27.800
improv troupe, they changed

43:27.800 --> 43:29.800
the name for that

43:29.800 --> 43:31.800
six-month period

43:31.800 --> 43:33.800
to Doctor Conehead, so we all

43:33.800 --> 43:35.800
had to wear Coneheads, because the idea was

43:35.800 --> 43:37.800
that we could send

43:37.800 --> 43:39.800
the tapes that they religiously taped every

43:39.800 --> 43:41.800
show from the back of the soundboard. And we hated it.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.800
Oh, good, those tapes look. We hated it.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.800
We just taped in a black box theater. Where was this done?

43:45.800 --> 43:47.800
Milwaukee. Oh.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.800
And we hated it, and so we would go

43:49.800 --> 43:51.800
out of our way to screw it up, so

43:51.800 --> 43:53.800
the footage would be unusable.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.800
Yeah.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.800
Diabolical. I can't remember what we did.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.800
Do you wear the coat on? I don't know.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.800
I think it was just like

44:03.800 --> 44:05.800
just doing terrible.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.800
I mean, soon after that, you and I were not

44:07.800 --> 44:09.800
allowed on stage together.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.800
Yeah.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.800
Rob and I were forbidden to be on stage

44:13.800 --> 44:15.800
together.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.800
It's kind of a

44:17.800 --> 44:19.800
fun part of our friendship.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.800
I guess we were too powerful

44:21.800 --> 44:23.800
comedically. That's how we

44:23.800 --> 44:25.800
chose to look at it.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.800
Somebody might burst into flames.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.800
Yeah.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.800
Comedy fire, yeah.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.800
When you were doing

44:33.800 --> 44:35.800
improv,

44:35.800 --> 44:37.800
what stuff were you doing

44:37.800 --> 44:39.800
before SNL? What kind of crazy stuff?

44:39.800 --> 44:41.800
I was part of

44:41.800 --> 44:43.800
this improv workshop, and from

44:43.800 --> 44:45.800
that workshop, we formed the Groundlings.

44:45.800 --> 44:47.800
Oh, really? Yeah.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.800
You were

44:49.800 --> 44:51.800
afoundling.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.800
I'm afoundling. Who is

44:53.800 --> 44:55.800
in your true?

44:55.800 --> 44:57.800
Here's the original people, and nobody

44:57.800 --> 44:59.800
here is going to know who these people are.

44:59.800 --> 45:01.800
Tim Matheson.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
Pat Merida.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.800
Yeah.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.800
Jack Sue.

45:07.800 --> 45:09.800
Valerie Curtin,

45:09.800 --> 45:11.800
who was married to Barry Levinson and his

45:11.800 --> 45:13.800
writing partner at the time,

45:13.800 --> 45:15.800
and she's also Jane's cousin.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.800
Because, you know, everything's connected.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.800
And I guess,

45:21.800 --> 45:23.800
you know, I don't think you'd know

45:23.800 --> 45:25.800
the other people, but a lot of them turned out

45:25.800 --> 45:27.800
to be showrunners in the 80s

45:27.800 --> 45:29.800
and 90s.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.800
Yeah.

45:31.800 --> 45:33.800
And Lauren kind of came and saw you

45:33.800 --> 45:35.800
and scooped you up, or what happened?

45:35.800 --> 45:37.800
Yeah, he saw me.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.800
I was doing characters,

45:39.800 --> 45:41.800
and he came with Lily Tomlin.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.800
He was producing her special.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.800
They hired me for that.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
And then later, Lauren came

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
back and saw me doing new characters

45:49.800 --> 45:51.800
and hired me for SNL.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.800
What characters were you doing?

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
And let's see one of them.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.800
Was there anything that we might

45:57.800 --> 45:59.800
recognize, or was it all news stuff?

45:59.800 --> 46:01.800
I was doing The Valley Girl,

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
and Sherry the Stewardess,

46:03.800 --> 46:05.800
and the Swedish Kyke Lady

46:05.800 --> 46:07.800
who did one

46:07.800 --> 46:09.800
appearance on SNL.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.800
An angry Jewish poet,

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
his name's Sarah Lynn, who had

46:13.800 --> 46:15.800
one appearance on SNL.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.800
Alice,

46:17.800 --> 46:19.800
who, you know, her mundane existence,

46:19.800 --> 46:21.800
she thought was really weird.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.800
One

46:23.800 --> 46:25.800
appearance on SNL.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.800
And then Emily Cohnhead,

46:27.800 --> 46:29.800
37.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.800
Yeah.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.800
I got a million of them.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.800
That's amazing.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.800
How was Lily Tomlin?

46:37.800 --> 46:39.800
She was great.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.800
This was in the 70s, and tapings

46:41.800 --> 46:43.800
can go on forever.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
She was at level three in the morning,

46:45.800 --> 46:47.800
and she was out there doing stand-up

46:47.800 --> 46:49.800
to keep the audience going.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.800
I really admired that so much.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.800
I'm confused about that.

46:53.800 --> 46:55.800
You're talking about SNL?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.800
No, this was a Lily Tomlin special.

46:57.800 --> 46:59.800
Okay.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
Lauren came and scouted you from the ground links

47:01.800 --> 47:03.800
to do the Lily Tomlin special.

47:03.800 --> 47:05.800
They actually were looking for men,

47:05.800 --> 47:07.800
but they hired me.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.800
That is a double achievement,

47:09.800 --> 47:11.800
as all you ladies know.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.800
The ground links that we might know.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.800
Archie Hahn?

47:15.800 --> 47:17.800
Yeah, I know the name, but not now.

47:17.800 --> 47:19.800
I don't think you'd know any of them,

47:19.800 --> 47:21.800
except for the people I mentioned.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.800
My very first play was four years old.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.800
I was at the Ground Links Theatre.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.800
You're kidding.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
And Paul Rubens was doing a show,

47:29.800 --> 47:31.800
and one of his characters was Pee Wee.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.800
Oh, my God.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.800
And we weren't allowed to see it,

47:35.800 --> 47:37.800
because apparently it was not for kids.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.800
It wasn't.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.800
He was an architecture student.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.800
His hair was this long,

47:43.800 --> 47:45.800
ring-less,

47:45.800 --> 47:47.800
and we did an improv show there.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.800
And then I left

47:49.800 --> 47:51.800
to join this improv group

47:51.800 --> 47:53.800
that became the Ground Links,

47:53.800 --> 47:55.800
and then when I got SNL, Paul asked me

47:55.800 --> 47:57.800
if he should go to the Ground Links,

47:57.800 --> 47:59.800
and I said, yes.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.800
Do you still actively do improv?

48:01.800 --> 48:03.800
Every once in a while,

48:03.800 --> 48:05.800
the alumni shows at the Ground Links.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.800
But I also do improv classes

48:07.800 --> 48:09.800
taught by this guy, Bill Steinkelner,

48:09.800 --> 48:11.800
who is a showrunner for Cheers

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
and lots of other sitcoms.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.800
You're taking them as a student?

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800
Yeah, it's just for fun.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.800
It's all Ground Links alumni.

48:19.800 --> 48:21.800
That is actually the most fun I can recall

48:21.800 --> 48:23.800
is when we were doing workshops

48:23.800 --> 48:25.800
at Comedy Sports,

48:25.800 --> 48:27.800
because you just do these crazy scenes.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.800
If you had a cool teacher,

48:29.800 --> 48:31.800
you would just do these in the middle,

48:31.800 --> 48:33.800
in the back room of a bar

48:33.800 --> 48:35.800
at three in the afternoon,

48:35.800 --> 48:37.800
for 90 minutes,

48:37.800 --> 48:39.800
and it's the best audience in the world,

48:39.800 --> 48:41.800
which a bunch of other drunk people

48:41.800 --> 48:43.800
that are like, this is amazing

48:43.800 --> 48:45.800
that we do this.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.800
People are all very, very old,

48:47.800 --> 48:49.800
and so it's like, well, George couldn't make it.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.800
He had knee replacement.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.800
That feeling, especially when

48:55.800 --> 48:57.800
there's nothing to lose anymore,

48:57.800 --> 48:59.800
when it's not like, oh, I hope I get into the AAA.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.800
Yeah, but the games

49:01.800 --> 49:03.800
that Bill has created

49:03.800 --> 49:05.800
are so sophisticated

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
and wonderful and so fun,

49:07.800 --> 49:09.800
and nothing like

49:09.800 --> 49:11.800
the Violas Bowling games.

49:11.800 --> 49:13.800
He's just grown it to a...

49:13.800 --> 49:15.800
I hate using that word exponential.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.800
Do you find yourself going through,

49:17.800 --> 49:19.800
when you do improv and you enter a scene,

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
do you black out?

49:21.800 --> 49:23.800
Do you...

49:23.800 --> 49:25.800
Rob and I have talked about this

49:25.800 --> 49:27.800
as bad as we are at improv.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
We're not like

49:29.800 --> 49:31.800
guys that you would compare

49:31.800 --> 49:33.800
to good, long-form people

49:33.800 --> 49:35.800
that we see who are such great listeners

49:35.800 --> 49:37.800
and maybe disciplined and all this stuff,

49:37.800 --> 49:39.800
but I don't...

49:39.800 --> 49:41.800
Is there this thing where you kind of like...

49:41.800 --> 49:43.800
Do I black out? Yeah, absolutely.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.800
I'm a shitty improviser. I was never good.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.800
I always did character monologues at the ground links.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.800
I was never a good improviser.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.800
Do you think it's because you're a bad listener

49:51.800 --> 49:53.800
or bad holding tasker?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.800
You need to process and everybody else

49:55.800 --> 49:57.800
is all over. I'm a slow processor.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.800
I watch the Ascat things.

49:59.800 --> 50:01.800
And I'm watching these guys and I'm like,

50:01.800 --> 50:03.800
how on earth did they split the difference

50:03.800 --> 50:05.800
between this much crowd-pleasing

50:05.800 --> 50:07.800
and this much actual discipline?

50:07.800 --> 50:09.800
I don't even know, because also they're denying

50:09.800 --> 50:11.800
all this shit that I learned as rules.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.800
It's like, oh, the only way through a scene

50:13.800 --> 50:15.800
is if you apply all these fucking rules

50:15.800 --> 50:17.800
and then maybe something good will come out of it.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.800
But UCB,

50:19.800 --> 50:21.800
they teach just this crazy...

50:21.800 --> 50:23.800
No, this is how you do a sketch

50:23.800 --> 50:25.800
in three minutes,

50:25.800 --> 50:27.800
which I guess is how they kind of rose to the...

50:27.800 --> 50:29.800
That's nice for them.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.800
They do really hard shows.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.800
They have a show called The Crazy Uncle Joe show.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
And it's all suggestions

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
from the audience.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.800
And what they do is they do like short little scenes

50:41.800 --> 50:43.800
and they go back and forth in time

50:43.800 --> 50:45.800
so they have to remember what they established

50:45.800 --> 50:47.800
and the characters they established

50:47.800 --> 50:49.800
in each scene.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.800
That's hard.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.800
That is really hard.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.800
I find watching improv...

50:55.800 --> 50:57.800
I do a lot of improv, it's mostly short stuff,

50:57.800 --> 50:59.800
like gamey stuff.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.800
Watching other people do improv

51:01.800 --> 51:03.800
scares the shit out of me.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.800
Doing improv doesn't scare me at all.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.800
Being in the audience, I'm sweating.

51:07.800 --> 51:09.800
I'm nervous.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.800
You project yourself up on stage,

51:11.800 --> 51:13.800
you're like, I wouldn't have thought of that.

51:13.800 --> 51:15.800
I wouldn't have done that.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.800
I'd be fucked up there. I wouldn't be able to make it.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.800
But when you're up on stage,

51:19.800 --> 51:21.800
you go into that blackout, you roll your eyes back

51:21.800 --> 51:23.800
and just bite like a shark.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.800
My big limitation is

51:25.800 --> 51:27.800
I was always like a bad listener.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.800
You bite like a shark, you guys.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
I don't know if you should be biting.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
This is real improv talk, you guys.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.800
I would just wait off stage and see a scene

51:37.800 --> 51:39.800
and go, okay, I think I'll be the plumber.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.800
They clearly need a plumber here.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.800
And then I got this great idea

51:43.800 --> 51:45.800
and I come in and I don't fucking...

51:45.800 --> 51:47.800
You hold on to the idea.

51:47.800 --> 51:49.800
I watch other people doing it better

51:49.800 --> 51:51.800
even though they're talking, they're still listening.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.800
And they're able to.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.800
But I think Schrab and I are in the same category.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.800
It's like, you come in as a plumber,

51:57.800 --> 51:59.800
you already decided that you're a plumber

51:59.800 --> 52:01.800
and that the reason you're a plumber is because Voltron's parked outside

52:01.800 --> 52:03.800
and if somebody's like, hold on, I need Ben Franklin,

52:03.800 --> 52:05.800
you're like, Ben Franklin doesn't exist.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.800
There's a Voltron outside.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.800
You're like, fuck everybody.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.800
I have an idea. If you just give it a chance, you'd learn.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.800
And that's maybe...

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
I don't know if that's like a writer's mind

52:15.800 --> 52:17.800
or it's just...

52:17.800 --> 52:19.800
Why don't I call it what it is? Bad improv.

52:19.800 --> 52:21.800
It's also, it's like in relationships

52:21.800 --> 52:23.800
where you want that person to feel

52:23.800 --> 52:25.800
heard and understood

52:25.800 --> 52:27.800
but you're really just waiting for them to stop talking

52:27.800 --> 52:29.800
so you can go ahead and say the thing you already made up your mind.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.800
Yeah, which applies to life, yeah.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.800
That's a problem in improv. That is a problem.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.800
And in real life, too.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.800
I find the secret is to come out on stage

52:37.800 --> 52:39.800
and as soon as possible make a butt

52:39.800 --> 52:41.800
or a titty or a dick joke.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.800
Why are you leaving out farts?

52:43.800 --> 52:45.800
You're blowing my mind, Lorraine.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.800
That's that groundling shit.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.800
Would you mind if we brought up

52:49.800 --> 52:51.800
my friend Steve Levy

52:51.800 --> 52:53.800
to the stage?

52:53.800 --> 52:55.800
And Dan,

52:55.800 --> 52:57.800
speaking of Levy

52:57.800 --> 52:59.800
I'm not allowed to talk

52:59.800 --> 53:01.800
when my voice gets tired of starting to get tired

53:01.800 --> 53:03.800
so I will take my Levy as you welcome a new Levy.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
All right, let's hope we won't.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.800
We'll see you this.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.800
And let's all welcome

53:09.800 --> 53:11.800
Jeff's replacement.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
No pressure, Steve Levy.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.800
Oh, man.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.800
The new Jeff.

53:17.800 --> 53:19.800
That is a lot of pressure.

53:19.800 --> 53:21.800
Oh, boy.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.800
Watch this.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.800
Detonate.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.800
Oh, no.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.800
Steve, I just...

53:29.800 --> 53:31.800
Oh.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.800
What's going on?

53:33.800 --> 53:35.800
What's...

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
And tell me whenever I'm being forward.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.800
Totally.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.800
But your love life, what's going on?

53:41.800 --> 53:43.800
Are you dating or whatever?

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
You know.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.800
People want to know, but we don't have to know.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
No, no, look.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.800
I'm not dating anybody.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.800
Just talk slowly.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.800
I'm not dating

53:55.800 --> 53:57.800
anybody.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.800
Why did you make him do that?

53:59.800 --> 54:01.800
I thought it was going to be sexy.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.800
Sexy.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.800
You know.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.800
You're not dating anybody.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.800
It's hard out there in the streets.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.800
Look, I'm on those...

54:11.800 --> 54:13.800
I'm on those bumbles and I'm even on those rias.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.800
You got on those rias?

54:15.800 --> 54:17.800
Yeah, Steve got into ria.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.800
Sorry for yelling. Steve got into ria.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.800
What is that?

54:21.800 --> 54:23.800
It's for famous people.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.800
But I'm not famous.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.800
Steve.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.800
Yeah.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.800
Meanwhile, I'm sitting over here.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.800
I'm on Bumble.

54:33.800 --> 54:35.800
What?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.800
I got to get you on ria.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.800
That's what I've been saying.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

54:41.800 --> 54:43.800
Ria is...

54:43.800 --> 54:45.800
I'll try to explain it to Lorraine.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.800
How do you know?

54:47.800 --> 54:49.800
Well, I don't entirely know.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.800
So maybe we can access it.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.800
I try to explain it to Lorraine.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.800
It's one of the dating apps.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.800
But it's selective for...

54:57.800 --> 54:59.800
Famous people.

54:59.800 --> 55:01.800
You start with the baseline of famous people,

55:01.800 --> 55:03.800
but then also it could be

55:03.800 --> 55:05.800
construed as rich people.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.800
It's basically like elite people.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.800
But it also turns out to be based on some algorithm

55:09.800 --> 55:11.800
that it has to do with Instagram followers.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.800
And that's it.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.800
No, no.

55:15.800 --> 55:17.800
But you also need references

55:17.800 --> 55:19.800
and to submit an application.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.800
It's like an episode of Black Mirror.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.800
It is.

55:23.800 --> 55:25.800
It's almost worse than that.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.800
Yeah, because it's sort of like...

55:27.800 --> 55:29.800
I'm sure nobody on it is complaining,

55:29.800 --> 55:31.800
but I'm sure none of them want

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
anyone else to know it exists,

55:33.800 --> 55:35.800
because it makes such an easy target.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.800
It's such an obscenely,

55:37.800 --> 55:39.800
like, elitist thing

55:39.800 --> 55:41.800
that would only draw derision from anyone

55:41.800 --> 55:43.800
that isn't able to get into it.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.800
You'd be like, oh, my God.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.800
Well, don't people have trouble admitting

55:47.800 --> 55:49.800
they're on a dating site to begin with?

55:49.800 --> 55:51.800
Yeah. Do they now?

55:51.800 --> 55:53.800
Yeah, I mean, this app covers it up

55:53.800 --> 55:55.800
and it just says, like, connecting.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.800
This is a dating app.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.800
It's for professionals seeking other professionals.

55:59.800 --> 56:01.800
Is that a true thing, though,

56:01.800 --> 56:03.800
being on an app?

56:03.800 --> 56:05.800
That's not a...

56:05.800 --> 56:07.800
Don't most people...

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
You have young daughters.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.800
Isn't it part of, like,

56:11.800 --> 56:13.800
youthful society to just...

56:13.800 --> 56:15.800
Like, everybody's on two or three of these things?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.800
No? They're on a lot of them.

56:17.800 --> 56:19.800
A lot of different ones, I think.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.800
My kids said...

56:21.800 --> 56:23.800
No, people in general.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.800
They always seem to find people

56:25.800 --> 56:27.800
without that.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.800
Oh, all right. Well, maybe for the Newman's.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.800
But...

56:31.800 --> 56:33.800
Einbinders. That's their name.

56:33.800 --> 56:35.800
Oh, okay.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.800
Anyway, that was a conversation stopper.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.800
No.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.800
Well, I just...

56:41.800 --> 56:43.800
I got to get...

56:43.800 --> 56:45.800
You got to get on there because it's...

56:45.800 --> 56:47.800
Why can't I get on?

56:47.800 --> 56:49.800
I couldn't get any Bumble matches,

56:49.800 --> 56:51.800
but on Raya, so many matches.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
I'm famous.

56:53.800 --> 56:55.800
Wait, you have to try?

56:55.800 --> 56:57.800
Let me...

56:57.800 --> 56:59.800
Let me pull some strings, you know.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.800
Yeah, no, pull some strings.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.800
I'll get you on that, Raya.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.800
Hey, he got me first class at Boston.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.800
I did. Yes.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
That has to cost way more money than joining an app.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.800
Yeah.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.800
So, go ahead, Dan, yes?

57:13.800 --> 57:15.800
Didn't you say something about Raya

57:15.800 --> 57:17.800
being so exclusive that...

57:17.800 --> 57:19.800
if they just...

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
Yeah, it's international.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.800
It's not just whatever city you're in.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.800
Yeah, I'm matching with people in Sweden,

57:25.800 --> 57:27.800
the U.K., all over America.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.800
Oh, it's the lead singer of

57:29.800 --> 57:31.800
Icelandic rock band.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.800
Australian.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.800
Here's hoping we hook up one day.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.800
Yeah.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.800
I think it's kind of exciting talking to people

57:39.800 --> 57:41.800
from other places.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.800
Yeah, because they're famous.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.800
Yeah, that's why, because they're famous.

57:45.800 --> 57:47.800
It's a guarantee.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.800
I mean...

57:49.800 --> 57:51.800
Oh, it's exceedingly gross.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.800
I should have explained before I said,

57:53.800 --> 57:55.800
look, it's kind of gross what I was going to say before saying it.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.800
Steve's dick.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.800
Look, it's kind of gross.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.800
My dick's on there.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.800
It's webbed.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.800
So, like all the other dating apps,

58:05.800 --> 58:07.800
you get a profile

58:07.800 --> 58:09.800
and there's a play button and you hit the play button

58:09.800 --> 58:11.800
and there's a

58:11.800 --> 58:13.800
really nice, like...

58:13.800 --> 58:15.800
Like...

58:15.800 --> 58:17.800
Like a company logo.

58:17.800 --> 58:19.800
Like a...

58:19.800 --> 58:21.800
Are you allowed to be telling us this?

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
Isn't this how Bruce Lee died?

58:23.800 --> 58:25.800
It's like a picture presentation

58:25.800 --> 58:27.800
with whatever song you choose,

58:27.800 --> 58:29.800
which gives you a lot of...

58:29.800 --> 58:31.800
This is so terrible.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
It is terrible.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.800
Good business is where you find it.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.800
It's a sizzle reel.

58:37.800 --> 58:39.800
Oil.

58:39.800 --> 58:41.800
It's like you lifting a weight.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.800
Oh, a sizzle reel for dating.

58:43.800 --> 58:45.800
That is the end of civilization.

58:45.800 --> 58:47.800
It really is.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.800
It's the invention of...

58:49.800 --> 58:51.800
Remember when video dating first happened

58:51.800 --> 58:53.800
before it was...

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
Jeff might just be leaving because, yeah.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.800
Oh, there's no back door.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.800
Have you been back there?

59:03.800 --> 59:05.800
We love you, Jeff.

59:05.800 --> 59:07.800
Remember when video... Before computer dating,

59:07.800 --> 59:09.800
it was video dating.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.800
I was a kid,

59:11.800 --> 59:13.800
but the idea was the modern...

59:13.800 --> 59:15.800
Everyone was like, is this going to ruin love?

59:15.800 --> 59:17.800
It's so systematized

59:17.800 --> 59:19.800
because you'd go to a place

59:19.800 --> 59:21.800
and then check out videos

59:21.800 --> 59:23.800
and take them into a private room

59:23.800 --> 59:25.800
and watch candidates.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.800
There'd just be them

59:27.800 --> 59:29.800
against a backdrop, the same backdrop.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.800
Usually I'd go, my name's Maggie

59:31.800 --> 59:33.800
and I like walks on the beach

59:33.800 --> 59:35.800
and Jesus Christ.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.800
So many posted those old videos

59:37.800 --> 59:39.800
on Facebook. They are hilarious.

59:39.800 --> 59:41.800
They really are.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.800
It's like bad family photos,

59:43.800 --> 59:45.800
that kind of thing.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.800
There's a big...

59:47.800 --> 59:49.800
I was listening to this podcast,

59:49.800 --> 59:51.800
The Illusionist.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.800
It's like a language... Helen Zaltzman.

59:53.800 --> 59:55.800
Yeah, yeah. Great podcast.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.800
And she had a dating

59:57.800 --> 59:59.800
app, kind of, I don't know,

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.800
specialist expert, somebody was talking about

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.800
profiles that get swiped

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.800
or whatever the fuck.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800
Interesting question, like whether you're supposed to lie

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.800
to people, trick people,

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.800
what the truth is, like what is

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.800
charisma?

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800
It's so primal

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800
and so ridiculous still.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.800
We got this whole new generation of kids

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.800
they're using these apps, but you can

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.800
clearly from what I'm hearing

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.800
from their conversation, it's like, oh, it's just

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.800
a bunch of morons doing the same things

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.800
that we always did.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.800
It's guys thinking that if you just

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.800
treat a girl mean, it'll

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.800
be like, well, who's this bruiser?

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800
And sometimes

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.800
they're right accidentally in the fucking

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.800
match made in hell and now you're going to have a serial killer.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.800
Did anybody...

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.800
God, anybody watch

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.800
Nikki Glazer's show? She had this bit

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.800
where

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.800
she would create...

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.800
God, let me just see

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800
if I can say this succinctly.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.800
It would be like an online dating

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.800
thing, but we would see the chat

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800
and the chat from her

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800
and would be so egregious

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.800
and horrible and the guess was

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.800
how long would the guy stay on?

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.800
And it was hilarious.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.800
Isn't that a good story?

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.800
It is crazy the

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.800
disproportionate reality

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.800
of like

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.800
like how...

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.800
like your average guy

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.800
and how clueless

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.800
like the average guy is

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800
versus how socialized

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.800
for like, I'll make

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.800
anything work and also

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.800
I have a million ways out of this.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.800
Like the women who are like

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.800
socialized to tolerate this shit.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.800
Like how early does that happen

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.800
that like by 17

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.800
you can see it like the guys

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.800
are just like hammerhead sharks.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800
I don't know if that's how hammerhead sharks work.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.800
I just picture hammerhead sharks is like

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.800
beating against a boat until it sinks.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.800
Otherwise, why would you shape a shark like that?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.800
I mean... Drowning and pussy.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.800
Shape your sharks right, bro.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.800
Talking to you, God.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.800
Chesting up with my anti-

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.800
nerd neck.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800
Shape your sharks right.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800
What are you, a nerd God?

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.800
That was bad

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.800
when I said drowning and pussy, right?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.800
I couldn't resist.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800
That was so funny.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.800
Such a great visual.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.800
Just the cannonball guy, yeah.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.800
But yeah, I don't know.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800
I guess I just brought that up.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.800
I had nothing. It doesn't land anywhere.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.800
But you just like...

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.800
So anyway, this gross thing that I do.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.800
Oh, you... Yeah, yeah.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.800
I forgot to finish that. Did I interrupt you a million years ago?

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.800
Who cares?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.800
It's probably going to suck anyway.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.800
But look, the profile, it links you to their Instagram.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.800
You can click on it.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.800
You can see if they're a cool person or not.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.800
But like the thing I always clock is

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.800
how many Instagram followers they have

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.800
because they make it a requirement

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800
for the app.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.800
And I'm like, oh, this person seems extra famous.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800
Maybe I do want...

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.800
I weigh that in my consideration of whether I swipe or not.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.800
That is attractive.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800
What do you have to put in?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.800
Thanks, Vince.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.800
Well, this app is for you, bud.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800
I'm going to get you right on there.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800
When you set up your profile,

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.800
what do you have to say?

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.800
Oh, I mean,

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.800
you select however many pictures you want.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.800
Then you go through like...

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.800
essentially Spotify

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.800
and pick whatever song you want.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.800
What song did you pick?

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.800
I picked Good Times, Bad Times

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800
by Led Zeppelin.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.800
Okay.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.800
So you're like, what are you going to get with me?

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.800
A schmarcus board.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.800
Yeah, I mean, I didn't really...

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800
Not promise and shit.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.800
You're going to get a human being.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.800
Ups and towns, baby.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.800
I'm a fucking idiot. I didn't think about it like that.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.800
I just like, you know,

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.800
I like classic rock.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.800
I'm going to steer away from Dave Matthews.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.800
Led Zeppelin.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.800
Why do you steer away from Dave Matthews now?

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.800
Is that your dirty secret?

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.800
I mean, look, it's not a secret.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.800
It's dirty, but it's not a secret.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800
I love them,

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.800
but I don't want people judging me.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800
You're aware of the stigma.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.800
Of course there's a fucking stigma.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800
Spencer.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.800
At least it's not Nickelback.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800
I don't know why people beg on that band.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.800
I don't know their sound.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.800
I'm sure I've heard Nickelback.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.800
But they're a punchline.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.800
I always hear bands like that.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.800
I'll hear the band name,

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.800
because I'll see a stand-up comic or something.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800
They'll go like, at least I'm not Hoosin' Fussin'.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800
And then I'll be like,

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.800
I'm going to steer away from this Hoosin' Fussin'.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.800
I'll find out six months later.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.800
I'm like, I love this guy's toe-tapping jukebox song.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.800
Hoosin' Fussin'.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800
They're the guys that did Straw Digger.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.800
Nickelback is just a funny-sounding name.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800
Yeah, it's like Pennywise.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800
That could be.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.800
It's got a bunch of K's in it.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.800
What's that?

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.800
It is like Pennywise.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800
Are you a Pennywise fan, since you don't like Pennywise?

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.800
And how?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.800
Did you like the new Pennywise?

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.800
I did.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.800
Did you like the old Pennywise?

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.800
I did. Oh, God, yeah. Tim Curry.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.800
Yeah, Dan, Tim Curry.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.800
Did you like that, Dan?

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.800
The mini-series?

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.800
Yeah.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.800
We always get through the whole thing whenever we watch it.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.800
That and Langoliers.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.800
Did you like Langoliers?

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.800
Langoliers.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.800
Yeah.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.800
I think it's safe to say now,

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.800
because I didn't want to, like,

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.800
I don't know.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.800
So Stephen King's son,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.800
which I'm sure he does not want to be known as,

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.800
because he's an author.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.800
Joe Hill.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.800
He came to the Boston show,

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800
and it's like, you've met him?

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.800
Have you seen a photo of him?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.800
Yeah. What the fuck?

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.800
Dude, how dense is that Stephen King gene?

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.800
I know.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.800
It was like, how much other people

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.800
do you have to add

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.800
to Stephen King's come?

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.800
I, like, before...

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.800
And the answer, because he brought his kids,

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.800
and his kids were like, okay,

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.800
now we're cooling down a little here.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.800
And Stephen King, by the way,

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.800
nah, I want to make it clear,

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800
not an ugly man.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.800
I think he's got a very curious handsomeness,

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.800
and his son is, like, all the more...

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.800
Curious handsomeness.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.800
All the more rugged and...

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.800
That's what I'd like to be described as.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.800
Curious handsomeness.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.800
But so specific.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.800
It's just like, oh, Stephen King!

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800
Oh, my God, Stephen King.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.800
Holy shit, Stephen fucking King gene.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800
Yeah, we got to call you something different.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.800
We never got to hear about the...

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.800
RISD?

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800
What is it called?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.800
We never got to hear about it.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800
It sounds like it's going

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.800
either perfectly or horribly,

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.800
and there's no difference.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.800
What's the video you had to make?

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.800
I just put a bunch of pictures.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.800
So have you met up with anybody?

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.800
I have not, but I've spoken with a bunch of people.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.800
A lot of them live all over the world.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.800
It's hard to meet up.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.800
That's fantastic. I love that.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.800
But I made some new long-distance

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.800
friends.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.800
Which is fine, right? That's nice.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.800
Oh, yeah.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.800
I guess...

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.800
I guess famous people

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.800
should be more poised

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.800
and globalist

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.800
and friend-friendly.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.800
Famous people should be more friendly.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.800
Yeah.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.800
Because they're famous, they're fortune.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.800
Right.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.800
I'm not going to be famous by being grouchy

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.800
because I've heard some Icelandic guitarist.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.800
It's a good practice

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.800
for bigger levels of fame.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.800
What would be your song, Dan?

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800
It's the best described

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.800
in your montage.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.800
Take Me Home

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.800
by Phil Collins?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.800
Take Me Home.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.800
How's that going?

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.800
Well, the important part of the lyrics

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.800
that I would want a prospective mate to hear is,

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.800
I can turn off my feelings

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.800
like I'm turning off a light.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.800
Yeah.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.800
Oh.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.800
I feel like it's important to know.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.800
Like, it absolves them

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.800
of a certain amount of responsibility.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800
Right.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.800
And it warns them.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Okay, not as funny as I thought.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800
No.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.800
Because you detected

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.800
not as untrue as I would like to believe.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.800
It is good advice.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800
That was the old reversal of...

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.800
I thought it would be

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.800
one of those things where...

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.800
Spencer, what would your theme song be?

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.800
Oh.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.800
Oh.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.800
Dave Matthews.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800
I think that Steve

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.800
made a grave error

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.800
by not going with Dave Matthews.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800
It's too on the nose.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.800
But I think yours would be that

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.800
Teen Titans song. How does that one go?

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.800
Oh, there's this song...

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.800
It's not funny to explain.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.800
There's a song called Night Begins to Shine.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.800
It's fun to listen to

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.800
on repeat, like, for two hours straight.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.800
It's really good.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.800
And he's done it. I've been there.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.800
Oh, Steve's been there.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.800
But Spencer's

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.800
version of it's great.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.800
Can you give us a little bit of it?

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.800
I don't know.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.800
Are we going to get sued?

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.800
No.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.800
What are you...

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.800
No. Go ahead.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.800
Dude.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.800
We've done everything else on this podcast.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.800
Let's get sued.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.800
We're going to court.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.800
All right.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.800
Hold on.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.800
Teen Titans coming at you.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.800
Bigger than regular teams.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.800
That's true.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.800
Each of them is bigger than you

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.800
and their teams.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.800
I'm going to fast forward.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.800
This guy loves this song.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.800
Night begins to shine

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.800
The night begins to shine

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.800
Shine begins to shine

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.800
The night begins to shine

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.800
We'd be on the road

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.800
and it would be like a silence

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.800
and Spencer will just...

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.800
And this will seem loaded, Lorraine,

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.800
and you can lie if you want,

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.800
but you're 23-year-old.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.800
Is she single?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800
She doesn't tell me.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.800
Steve doesn't need any help.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.800
Get me on Raya.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800
Jesus Christ.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.800
I was trying to set you up

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.800
with a real new man clone.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.800
I'm too...

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.800
I go off half-cocked.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.800
That's what's known about me.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.800
I had you this close to SNL Legacy.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.800
I blew it.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.800
I blew it.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.800
All right.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.800
Who was affected by this horrible shooting

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.800
with Trader Joe's?

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.800
We were out of town.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.800
I wasn't.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.800
It happened very close to where I live.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.800
We were on Doug Love's movies

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.800
while this was all happening.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.800
Nobody in the audience

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.800
got a loved one hurt or anything, did they?

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.800
My partner went to the other Trader Joe's

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.800
at that very moment.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800
Almost went to that one.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.800
As he said, in case nobody heard,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.800
your partner went to the other Trader Joe's

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.800
at that moment.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.800
It was like a fluke.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.800
I was like, oh, you were a Trader Joe's.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.800
You might have seen the thing,

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.800
but no.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.800
Oh, my God.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.800
I just went to the other one.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.800
I don't have to.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.800
All right.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.800
I solicited it.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.800
It was good.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.800
It was all good. Everyone wins.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.800
I just don't want him to feel bad.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.800
Everyone wins tonight.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.800
What else do we have to accomplish?

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.800
D&D.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.800
Should we play D&D?

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.800
Yeah.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.800
Lorraine, you have a choice.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800
I don't want to put you on the spot.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.800
You can exhunt.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.800
You're going to play D&D?

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.800
Yeah.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.800
I'll be leaving.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.800
I don't know anything about it.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.800
Let's all thank the fabulous and honest

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.800
Lorraine Newman.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800
Thank you so much for coming.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.800
Thank you.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.800
Thank you.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.800
Fantastic.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.800
I'll pass out the thing.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.800
Oh, God.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.800
Friend of the podcast, Lorraine Newman.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.800
Who would have thought? That was so good.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.800
It's kind of like living in a crazy dream, Los Angeles.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.800
You end up rubbing elbows

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.800
with the people that you watched

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800
on the Magic Box.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.800
So fun.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.800
Then after a while,

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.800
you've done enough.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800
You get tired.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.800
You start to go, this box was never magic.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.800
I was controlling it the whole time.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.800
Okay.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800
Here we go, then.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.800
With the game.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.800
Do you remember what?

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.800
Oh, you weren't here the last.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.800
I love this tradition.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.800
It's good.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.800
The fabulous Lorraine Newman.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.800
Second exit.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.800
Lorraine Newman.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800
Garrett Morris.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.800
We used to sit around and do that.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.800
We would do that impression.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.800
I do that impression.

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.800
Sometimes you go into the

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.800
later years.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.800
Spence, you want to hit us?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.800
Zach, you got that D&D music queued up?

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800
Oh, hell yeah.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.800
Spence, hit us with a recap, bro.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.800
I think this would be your music.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.800
Yeah, I was going to say that,

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.800
but that seemed too on the nose.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.800
This is his day, Matthew.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800
Right.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.800
Last time on Harmon Time,

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.800
our heroes were escaping from town.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.800
After they

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800
tried to kidnap Shrove,

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.800
and Shrove got away.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.800
They gave up and left the town,

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.800
but DJ went back to the town and got kidnapped.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.800
So the gang had to rescue them,

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.800
and they did, and then they got in a fight

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.800
where they found some clues

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.800
that led them to find Patchen's Jeff.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.800
After killing

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800
some vampires,

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.800
they went to go help with a fire.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.800
And then when they were helping with the fire,

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.800
they caused more fire or something.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.800
I think they put out the fire,

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.800
and then restarted the fire.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.800
That sounds right.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.800
And then they made a hasty retreat,

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.800
but they were followed by a couple farmers,

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.800
and as they escaped,

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.800
the farmers pursued them,

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.800
and then they started cutting the farmers down to sides.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.800
It was pretty much overkill,

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.800
because they were just farmers,

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.800
and they were poorly armed.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.800
And so then they just kind of,

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800
I think you guys convinced them to just go away,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.800
and you're like, we're just going to leave,

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.800
and you've got a raven

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800
telling you to go on a new mission,

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.800
which you were going to do,

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.800
and then you were going towards the new mission place,

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.800
and then you saw a colt,

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.800
and it sounded like you were going to attack the colt.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.800
Now...

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.800
Farmer's down.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.800
What are you eating?

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800
Either I forgot to take my Adderall this morning,

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.800
or this shit's going to get cray cray.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.800
But you know what?

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.800
It tastes like attention.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.800
That's why I love it.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.800
You're not going to go to bed until four tonight.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.800
Well, it depends.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.800
Did I take somewhere earlier?

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.800
I can't remember.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.800
Maybe I'll learn some new software.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800
Spence, last thing that happened,

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.800
was Chad attacking the people?

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.800
Yeah, but Chad...

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.800
He's...

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.800
No one's playing him right now, right?

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.800
Or do you want to play Chad instead of...

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.800
Instead of the shambling mouth?

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.800
Gary? No.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.800
Okay.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.800
What about our friend Michael Waldron?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.800
Oh, yeah, Waldron's here.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.800
He's white.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800
He just gave a look like...

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800
I'll come up.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.800
Okay, we've got a lot of volunteers.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.800
All right.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.800
Wait, how do we do this fairly?

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.800
Don't play on my sense of fairness.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.800
He's blind.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800
Wait a minute.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.800
I'm hearing podcast dynamite.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.800
How blind are you?

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.800
He's blind. I legally blind.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.800
That's fair. Let's still count.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.800
Make my way up there.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.800
Is that part of the albinism?

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.800
Is that...

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.800
You're living with albinism?

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.800
All right, get up here.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.800
And someone help him.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.800
I think the stairs are on the other side.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.800
Oh, there are stairs.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.800
Geez, what a hero.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.800
Like, really...

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.800
I have some albino questions.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800
Starting with, is the word albino...

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.800
Because I haven't...

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.800
How is this offensive?

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800
There are two different things, but I don't get offended by it.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800
There's too many groups getting pissed about us playing villains,

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.800
and we're actually all villains.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.800
Right?

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.800
I have a friend, Victor Varnado.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800
He was channel 101 guy,

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.800
and he cast his villains

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.800
like angels

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.800
that are fallen angels.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.800
Angels or pedophiles

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.800
in suits.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.800
So, is the word...

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.800
So, is that part...

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.800
Is the suit...

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.800
You're wearing a beautiful pinstripe suit.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.800
Like, are you...

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.800
A hit man?

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.800
I would be the shittiest hit man ever.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.800
Unless it was nighttime.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800
Do you...

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800
Are you compensating for exotic good looks?

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.800
Because you don't want...

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.800
Because you're like, look, I'm in a fucking suit.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.800
Respect me as a human being.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.800
Don't...

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800
I don't know, I just always like them,

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.800
and also they breathe more than shirts,

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.800
so the sun doesn't touch as much of my skin.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.800
Like a vampire...

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.800
What's your name, by the way?

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.800
Kaelin.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800
What's your last name?

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.800
Chase.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.800
You just doxed him.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.800
What?

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.800
Well, he doxed himself.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.800
Oh, I don't know what happened.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.800
Maybe it doesn't...

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.800
First and last name, I don't know.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800
Don't worry about it, it's on IMDB.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.800
See?

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800
Alright, alright, alright.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.800
What?

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.800
Sorry, I...

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.800
What, you can't say names now?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.800
I don't know what you can do, obviously.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.800
I'm just saying...

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.800
Kate and Chase sounds

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.800
like a badass.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.800
That's it.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.800
It does, Kaelin Chase.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.800
Mr. Chase,

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.800
will you please

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.800
dispatch...

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.800
Alright, well, let's get you a glass.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.800
Jesus Christ.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800
Steve's on it.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.800
I have followed

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.800
Chad the Fire Liker a little bit.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.800
I can't see what he has, I'll just ask Spencer

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.800
what I can throw at stuff.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800
Oh, yeah, I mean, Chad's out of spells

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.800
right now, basically, too, so it's not...

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.800
I'll just use my poison cunning.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.800
Yeah.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.800
Wait, but as long as I have you,

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.800
so I have this chance.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.800
So I just want to know...

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.800
The language of it all.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800
Is it rude to call

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.800
someone albino?

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.800
In what context?

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.800
Can you tutor me?

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.800
So the albinos,

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.800
like from that movie

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.800
with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800
where the guy with the pink eyes,

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.800
albinos have

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.800
20-20 vision, pink eyes,

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800
and they're a little more pale,

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.800
and albinistic people usually have

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800
ocular, so I have a pigment

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800
in the front of my eyes, but I have vision problems.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.800
My eyes shake and stuff like that,

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.800
but I look more normal, so it's much more funny

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.800
when I bump into things and things like that.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800
They're like, oh, I thought you were just a Scandinavian

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.800
who's clumsy.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.800
So that

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.800
actually is.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800
That gets complicated. There's a minefield there

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800
because you can be caught.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.800
Because it's not even like, oh,

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800
yeah, so an albino

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.800
is...

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.800
But it seems like

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800
with language, the key is

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.800
let's not call people things.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800
So calling someone

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800
unautistic is like,

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800
a bad idea.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.800
And so calling someone an albino

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800
I would assume is like, bad,

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.800
but I'm hearing that you can't say,

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.800
oh, that person with albinism

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.800
because that would be you instead,

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.800
and you'd be like, don't lump me in with that

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.800
fucking pink eye.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.800
Generally, if somebody's really interested

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800
if they ask me, and I say, excuse me, I'm sorry

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.800
to ask, are you albino? And I'd be like,

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.800
technically yes, and if you'd like to know the reason

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.800
and you have a minute, I'll tell you, but

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.800
it's like, most people are just like, oh yeah, he has no pigment

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.800
and that's fine. I'm like, yeah.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.800
I don't mind. I'll lump myself in with them.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.800
It's just, you know, I don't have the pink eyes

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.800
and I can't drive. It's like if you asked

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.800
Worf if he was a Romulan.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.800
I think you take more offense than I do,

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.800
but I'm pretty easy going, I suppose.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.800
How often

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800
do strangers

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800
in a public place, do they

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.800
do they inquire about that?

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.800
Mostly, it's

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.800
way less around here, because there's so many weirdos

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.800
and just people

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.800
because if you can handle

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800
David Duchovny sitting near you

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.800
without acknowledging it,

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.800
we're trained to respect people

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.800
by treating them like ghosts. You can go most places,

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.800
but yeah, anywhere in the Midwest

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.800
it's the moms, the tourists

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.800
they'll go like, excuse me, could you tell me?

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.800
Yeah, and then the farther east

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.800
you get, they're just like, hey.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.800
Hey, settle the bet.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.800
You an angel?

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.800
Yes.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.800
Give me three wishes.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.800
Is that how angels work?

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800
You gotta rub the lamp.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.800
How come your eyes ain't pink?

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.800
You gotta rub the lamp?

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.800
Yeah, you take advantage.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800
Thank you for answering all those questions

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.800
and not being like, because I know

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.800
that's gotta be like, whatever.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.800
I don't know, it could be irritating.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.800
I now go forth into the world

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.800
a little more educated.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.800
The East Coast thing, though, it's more funny.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.800
By the way, I could Google it

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800
if I really had empathy, but

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.800
instead I just wait

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.800
and just abuse

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.800
strangers in front of my microphone.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.800
But thank you, thank you for joining us.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.800
Alright, so Kaelin Chase, what a...

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800
Cool first and last name.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.800
Glad we found it out.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.800
That's alright.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.800
Now that I know he's an actor, that's fine.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.800
Yeah, so last we left off,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.800
Chad was attacking these cultists.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.800
Well, he certainly was

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800
announcing he was attacking

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800
and seemingly charging towards.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.800
I have no spells, so I'd like to stop

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.800
in my tracks swiftly and look back at my crew.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.800
Oh, shit. You do that.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.800
They're looking at you

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.800
as if maybe for guidance or confusion.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.800
What a false alarm.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.800
I'd like to defer to Carlos

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.800
or someone who knows more and has spells.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800
That's a good instinct.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.800
They were doing aerobics?

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800
What were they doing?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.800
They were doing aerobics, seemingly.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.800
They were very far away.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.800
I mean, I love aerobics.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.800
We should join them.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.800
I think that's actually as

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.800
ridiculous as your pitches usually are

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.800
compared to attacking them.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.800
I'm willing to...

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.800
Yeah, let's just join in.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.800
He did aerobics with those aerobics cultists

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.800
like many episodes ago.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.800
Like he got all about it.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.800
Dude, I'm so good at jumping tax, you got no idea.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.800
Do we need mats to lay down?

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800
Or can we just...

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800
I mean, I'm asking.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.800
Do we need mats...

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.800
To lay down?

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800
To lay down? Is it dirt floor?

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800
Are they doing yoga?

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800
You're on an expansive

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.800
plains.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.800
It's like a flat part

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.800
and an otherwise rolling landscape

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.800
of hills and paths.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.800
Do we need mats?

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.800
I unroll my bedroll

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.800
and I stand on it and I start doing

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.800
whatever moves these guys are doing.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.800
You're very far away, so you're going to have to

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.800
approach them.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.800
I pick him up and I carry him over there.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.800
Hell yeah, let's go.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.800
I say, you have to let me use your mat now.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.800
Okay, we can share it.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.800
Yeah, we'll share it.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.800
It's great, just don't sweat too much, okay?

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.800
I'm made out of plant.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.800
You're a big monster and so as you approach

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.800
the cult kind of looks at you

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.800
and they stop doing their

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.800
things and they just all kind of turn to look.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.800
No, no, no.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800
We love what you're doing here.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.800
He's a good guy.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.800
He's a good man.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.800
Don't be afraid.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.800
He's a good guy.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.800
Are you being harangued by that monster?

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.800
No, he's my friend.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.800
His name's Gary, he's a good dude.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.800
This guy just wants to do some yoga with you guys.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.800
Let's all chill out.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.800
He's not a monster, he's a good person.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.800
What's yoga?

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.800
Question, what are you guys doing?

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.800
Oh, we're just

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.800
templifying our bodies.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.800
We know all about that, can we join?

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.800
Oh yeah,

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.800
templify your bodies and purify your mind.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800
They hand you a white robe

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.800
with gold trim.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.800
Whoa, this is a pretty sweet little robe.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.800
That's what they're wearing.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.800
It's a little small on me.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.800
It's very heavy, it feels like it's weighted.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.800
Not like very, very heavy,

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800
but heavier than clothes.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.800
Is there something in a pocket?

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.800
This sounds important.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.800
It's like weighted.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.800
Is it the gold that makes it heavy?

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.800
No, it's the clothes.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.800
So this is like extra,

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.800
it's like when you're hiking

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.800
and you decide to put on a weighted vest

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.800
and you're just getting a little extra,

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.800
holding them in your hand

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.800
that reminds you of that exactly.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.800
Oh man.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.800
I tie the sleeves around my waist

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.800
like I'm a

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.800
badass grunge guy.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.800
Uh-huh.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.800
It's badass.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.800
Like a grunge guy.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.800
I put the robe on. How does it feel?

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.800
It's heavy.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800
No, but is it soft?

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.800
What am I working with here?

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.800
It's nice. It's not like high-grade cloth,

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.800
but in terms of robes,

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.800
it's nice. Not like a fine robe.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.800
Like hotel bathrobe?

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.800
Yeah, like a hotel bathrobe.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800
No, not quite, but let's say yes.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.800
Doesn't it?

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.800
That doesn't have pockets.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.800
When does this become blasphemy for the church

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.800
is what I want to know?

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.800
Kaelin is legally blind and he can see the social cues.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.800
Yeah.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.800
I was like exercising near Chad

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.800
and I'm like, hey Chad,

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.800
because honestly I'm part of the problem too.

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.800
I was leaning in and just saying,

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.800
why are we here?

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.800
Putting on these robes,

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.800
but now we're trying to dress like them.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.800
It seems like eventually this is going to go too far.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.800
Do you remember

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.800
why we came here?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.800
Well, we were on our way to do a mission.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.800
There was two different ones.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.800
There was a pageant's gem and then we were supposed to go

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.800
from the church to the other place that's going to happen first.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.800
And now we're wearing

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.800
heath and robes and this is bad news.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.800
Right. He's right.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.800
Dude, I mean,

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.800
yeah, but look, I'm getting jacked.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800
So when we hit that mining town,

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.800
I'm going to be ready for the fight.

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.800
I said we fuck off and go then.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.800
But that's bad guys.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.800
You'd be fighting as bad guys.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.800
Well, we don't want to fight the good guys.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.800
I think we're supposed to be here.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800
I guess I need larger clarity on what the issue is

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.800
at the mining town.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.800
Like, is it like an episode of Night Rider?

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.800
We re-consult the note.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.800
I look at the note again.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800
Hope this note finds you well.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.800
Okay.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.800
Okay.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.800
Fontius is the guy that we're supposed to help

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.800
against the union.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.800
Fontius is the town.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.800
Fontius is the

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.800
Mr. Liberty.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.800
We should go there.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.800
Right.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.800
And so it's the union that we're upset with

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.800
because we're good guys.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.800
Fuck the union.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.800
Damn.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.800
Wow, this guy's

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.800
crazy.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.800
Well,

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.800
hey, this is great exercise.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.800
Where's the mine?

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.800
One of them holds you,

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.800
hands you a big kettlebell

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.800
and purify those abs.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.800
Purify those abs.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.800
And now we're going to do this all day.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.800
All right, I purify a couple abs.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.800
With a kettlebell.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.800
You feel the sin leaving your body.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.800
It's great.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.800
Hey, does anybody know where the mines are?

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.800
Yeah, no.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.800
You are on your way there.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.800
They're just down this road you were traveling on already.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.800
All right.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.800
Thanks for helping us get jacked.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.800
We're going to go head that way.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.800
We're at our branch office

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.800
in Blade Glen sometime.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.800
What's it called?

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.800
The branch office of the church of the body temple.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.800
Hey, I like branch offices.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.800
Hey, oh.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.800
All right.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.800
You thought I was a monster.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.800
I'm actually hilarious.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.800
Oh, you.

01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.800
That's right.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.800
You are funny.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.800
Better leave.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.800
Here we go.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.800
I thought these guys.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.800
Thanks for the sweet road.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.800
All right.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.800
Well, now you see another cult.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800
You've been walking for one more day.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.800
You're almost there.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.800
But now you see a different cult.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.800
Completely different.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.800
Different robes and everything.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.800
Let's hide our robes real quick.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.800
Just in case it's rival, rival cult.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.800
I mean, the punchline is you guys fucked up.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.800
You thought running into cults is so special.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.800
They grow on trees.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.800
They grow on trees.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.800
It's random cults.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.800
These ones aren't wearing white robes.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.800
They're wearing like black robes

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.800
that have bloody colored runes on them.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.800
They sound like cool people.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.800
I take my robe off

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.800
and I put it in my sack

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.800
and I go,

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.800
whoa, hey guys,

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.800
can I join

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.800
whatever you're doing

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.800
and that robe looks pretty

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.800
freaking cool.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.800
What the fuck?

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.800
Um...

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.800
Okay, so you're really far off

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.800
again like the last time

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.800
when you're seeing this cult.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.800
I pick him up and I carry him over.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.800
Yeah.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.800
And then I take off

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.800
my white robe

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.800
and I'm like, yeah, yeah.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.800
It just got done kicking the shit out of these

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.800
white robe guys.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.800
I think I'll wipe my ass

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.800
a little bit with this white robe

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.800
because I don't like it that much.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.800
Shit.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.800
Hey, you guys look cool, huh?

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.800
Yeah.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.800
You don't have any white robes around here

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.800
because we don't like them at all.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.800
These guys seem very busy.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.800
There's about six of them.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.800
You guys look busy, huh?

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.800
Yeah, and most of them are chanting

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.800
and kind of involved

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.800
in incantation that doesn't seem to involve you.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.800
They do notice your approach

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.800
and one of them who isn't chanting

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.800
kind of points that at somewhere to stand

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.800
because you seem cool.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.800
Yeah, I know.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.800
You're welcome, you're welcome.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.800
And then he hands you like a big black candle.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.800
Well, do we get robes?

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.800
No, no.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.800
Okay, so

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.800
do you want to take our spots there?

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.800
Yeah, I got a candle.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.800
Okay, we walk over and take our spots

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.800
with these candles.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.800
All right, well, they're chanting.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.800
It's like a ritual.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.800
We have agents on the floor

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.800
forming a sort of spell circle

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.800
or summoning ritual.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.800
Did we detect magic real quick

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.800
before this gets out of hand?

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.800
I think you might have detect magic.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.800
Okay, good. I'd like to do that.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.800
I'm going to say you're about 80 feet off

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.800
unless you want to define your approach differently.

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.800
I'm going to sneak up after all that exuberance.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.800
I'm just going to sneak behind

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.800
and see if this is as bad as it sounds.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:50.800
All right, you rolled it with bonuses at 25.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.800
So you're real stealthing right now.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.800
So you're sneaking up.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.800
I forgot the other.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.800
What are you trying to do once you're snuck up?

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.800
I would like to detect...

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.800
I don't know all the things...

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.800
Oh, yeah, okay.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.800
I want to find out if this is really shittier or cool.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.800
Yeah, you detect some magic

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.800
and it seems like serious demon gate opening magic.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.800
Okay.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.800
The kind that makes demons come to Earth.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.800
Yeah, I don't want to say

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.800
that I don't have any spells out loud,

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.800
but I think you already remembered that.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.800
So at this point, I was looking...

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.800
Oh, precursor, I was looking back

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.800
at Carlos the Unimaginative saying...

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.800
Yeah, we were just bonding about

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800
how we don't have any spells left.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.800
So you don't either?

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.800
And so the guys that might have something

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.800
are just doing jumping jacks and hanging out with cultists.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.800
I like your style.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.800
Yeah.

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.800
By the way, culty town.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.800
Yeah.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.800
Culty world.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.800
It seems like it.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.800
Nope.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.800
Look, hey.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.800
Get over here.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.800
We're holding candles.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.800
What are you even trying to...

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.800
These guys are trying to open a gate to hell.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.800
We need to rest

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.800
and we need to get on with our mission.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.800
What are you doing? Do you even know what you're doing?

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.800
We're trying to find some leads.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.800
We're getting some sick clothes, bro.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.800
You don't even know what you're doing.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.800
You're playing...

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.800
It's like Stardew Valley.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.800
You just run into people

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.800
and you just fucking interact with them.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.800
All right, fine, fine.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.800
I go up to the guy who gave me the candle

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.800
and I give it back and I said,

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.800
I'm really sorry, man. It's like Stardew Valley here.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.800
And it's not what I signed up for.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.800
I hope I don't...

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.800
I didn't light it yet,

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.800
but it's the Stardew Valley

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.800
shit that's really

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.800
bumming us out.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.800
So we're going to just take off.

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.800
Okay.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.800
But good luck with whatever you're doing here.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.800
It seems cool. It's just not our thing.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.800
You see a blot of shadow

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.800
widen at the center of the circle in the ground

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.800
and forms a scar

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.800
or a rip in the earth

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.800
out of which a massive clawed hand

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.800
thrusts itself.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.800
Like I said, we got to get out of here.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.800
Cliffhanger!

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.800
That's it for the show.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.800
Thanks for joining us.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.800
All right.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.800
Kailin Chase.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.800
Thank you so much.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.800
Somebody make sure...

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.800
I want you escorted.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800
Yeah, well, no.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.800
Maybe...

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.800
Somebody get Kailin down

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.800
with a little tape.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.800
Hey, can we put a link to the

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.800
John Schnep GoFundMe page

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.800
up on the hometown

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.800
tweet or whatever

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.800
because like there's

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.800
even the

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.800
tremendous amount of bills that

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.800
also what Lorraine is saying is that

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.800
John Schnep's wife who

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.800
like her mom recently

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.800
died stuff too. So I assume there's a GoFundMe

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.800
that like to help her out.

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.800
There's a GoFundMe that I'll link to.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.800
It's already linked but I'll link it again.

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.800
Yeah, we'll link to it again right now.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.800
That's a good reminder.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.800
Can I help there?

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.800
The insurance is not covered.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.800
Yeah, we miss you John.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.800
Yeah.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800
Sorry.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.800
Sorry.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.800
Sorry.

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.800
I don't know how to cope with death.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.800
Sorry.

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.800
He's a good guy and I'll miss him.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.800
And we could go at any time.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.800
And there's no shame in that.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.800
It should actually be an invitation.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.800
Wait for it.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.800
It builds to an amazing ending.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.800
We could die at any

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.800
time.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.800
Do we usually do stuff?

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.800
I don't know what we do.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.800
350 shows.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.800
We've never ended a single one.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.800
All right.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:06.800
Thanks everybody.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.800
Thank you all for coming out.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.800
We'll see you next week.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.800
Thank you very much for coming out tonight.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.800
We want to thank Zach, Nolan, Chris,

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:34.800
Sarah, Kevin, Spencer.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.800
Did you get any of that?

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:46.800
It's a good show.
