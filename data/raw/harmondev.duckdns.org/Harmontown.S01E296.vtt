{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.000\nOh, yeah! You know what this means? This means that I'm controlling tonight.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:31.000\nLet me hear you say, oh, shit! Oh, shit! Let me hear you say, chelps!\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:39.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session! Freak out!\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:50.000\nThank you so much for coming down to tonight's show. Let's give it up for our resident Dungeon Manster, Spencer Crittenden!\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:53.000\nYes!\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:00.000\nLook at him! Look at him sit down with his bag of holding.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:02.000\nI got stuff.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:04.000\nYou got stuff.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:05.000\nI got gifts.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:06.000\nYou got gifts.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:07.000\nJust my presents.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:12.000\nChips? No, no, no. Animated gifts.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:13.000\nAnimated gifts.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:14.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nWell, you guys are in for a treat tonight.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:24.000\nSo, without any further ado, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown. You know him. I love him, Mr. Dan Harmon Man!\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nThank you.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:33.000\nYes!\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:42.000\nThat was a smooth groove we have.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:45.000\nThank you so much.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nWhat an improvement from last week. We filled in some seats. That's nice.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:55.000\nOh, Dan, you didn't have a lot of seats filled last week?\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:56.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nWho wasn't there?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:02.000\nOh, wow.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nYou know, Jeff's been out with his vocal surgery?\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nRight, right. So they didn't come because Jeff wasn't here or somebody else.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.000\nA lot of our audience is racist. Brandon was controlling. So that always takes us to get the racist.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:24.000\nYeah, but I've been here when the place has been packed and Brandon's here. So, I mean, I don't know. I just, what else was missing?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nAlright, maybe, I guess maybe people like you.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:28.000\nReally?\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nI have no problem with people liking you.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:42.000\nI have a problem with people not liking me, which really is counterintuitive being me.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:49.000\nLike, so, I'm going to start to warm up to people liking you. You can come around whenever you want.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nThank you for guest comptrolling. We have some interesting guests to talk to.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nYou were just talking to me right now.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:55.000\nYeah.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.000\nYou said you were warming up to me.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nYeah.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nI've known you since you were 19.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:15.000\nYou're warming up to me. I can come around at any time. What kind of weird kind of talk is that to somebody who's your best man at your wedding?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nWhat are you talking about? Like, you're acting like, oh, yeah.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nIt's a compliment. He said he's warming up to you.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nI don't help him.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:32.000\nDo you guys, are you supposed to suck your gut in all the time?\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.000\nYeah.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:41.000\nBecause it feels like that's a lie, but then people tell you, like fitness people tell you suck it in because that's like helping, but it's like...\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:52.000\nI heard that long-term sucking in your gut can cause problems because it's like, it's stretching it for way too long, but realistically, you probably won't keep it held for that long.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nRight, you'll forget.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:58.000\nWell, this is bad. What you're doing right there is bad for breathing. You're supposed to breathe from your stomach, not from your chest.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nIf your shoulders go up, that means you're breathing wrong.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:05.000\nYour belly's supposed to inflate like a balloon. That's good. That's good. Right there.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:06.000\nRight here.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nYeah.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:14.000\nI went down a weird YouTube spiral. It was like a kind of a red-pillish spiral where I was...\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nI can't remember how I ended up there, but I started learning about posture.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:25.000\nThere were all these guys that were talking about nerd neck. They're demonstrating and I'm like...\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nLet's see it.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:32.000\nWell, like, you know, nerd neck, I definitely have it. It's like when the 45 degree, it has to do...\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nIt starts with your shoulders moving forward, and then it has something to do with your head.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nIt's like heavy, so then things like compensate, and then you get nerd neck.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nNerd neck.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nNerd neck.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nNerd neck.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nNerd neck.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:50.000\nSo I guess if you just start moving your shoulders back and sticking your chest out.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nYeah.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:58.000\nI was watching all these videos that were about like alpha posture and how you're supposed to send a signal.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:05.000\nIt's all about fooling women. I guess not fooling them because no one's attacking us.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:10.000\nSo I guess it's not a lie if you're like, I'm confident because you might as well be.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:19.000\nBut the idea is to expose more of your ventral surface to injury, which proves to the woman unconsciously\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nthat you don't have anything to worry about.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd that in turn means maybe you have more fiefdoms or something, like biologically.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nYou know these guys.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nYeah, we know.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:36.000\nThat's why the most popular guys are giant fat guys with targets painted on their bellies.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:42.000\nLike that guy in the stock footage that gets shot with the cannonball.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nRight, exactly. Everyone loves him.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:50.000\nThat guy. You know how that guy died? Drowned in pussy.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nYou were going to say cannonball shot wound.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nCannonball wound.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nThat's what you call it.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nCannon shot wound.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.000\nSure.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:10.000\nDo you think he cried after the footage cut?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nAnd people would look at him like, man, get over yourself.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou got to get shot with a cannon and the guy could cry a little.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:18.000\nI do want to know.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nRight?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nThose people are being really unreasonable to judge him for that.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:29.000\nThat stock footage also is a high speed camera.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:34.000\nBecause you see his belly go like, and it doesn't look, I mean he looks like a large man,\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:41.000\nbut does he really look like someone whose wheelhouse is getting shot?\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nI wonder if they're just like, it was basically just like a, you know,\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.000\nthey put a little bit of explosive behind a cannonball because they were really excited about the camera.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nYeah.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nLike it was like a myth busters thing.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nLike I wouldn't want your belly jiggle.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:59.000\nI heard that he's actually laying on a table and they dropped the bowling ball on his stomach.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nIt was the first use of green screen.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nYeah.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nHow do you practice for that?\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nHow do you warm up?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:10.000\nDo you think they just started with like a small cannonball and just worked their way up?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nHow do you practice?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nHow do you do something?\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nHere's a wacky idea.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nLook at that cannon.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nHow about you?\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nLet me take my shirt off first.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nHe took his shirt off.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nWhy are you taking his shirt off?\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nLook, we're going to go.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nYou probably got some cardboard underneath there.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nWhat was I thinking about?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:31.000\nSomething that I was watching and I was like, how do you practice this without dying?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nI can't remember what it was.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nTie your rope walking.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nYou get the net underneath you.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nYeah, that's a good point.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nSo if you fall off, you don't die.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nTrain eating.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nYou can probably use a thicker rope.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nIt probably starts as like, like the rope is like as thick as like a barrel.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nHere's it.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nHere's it.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nTwo ropes.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nTwo ropes.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nThey probably start you on two ropes.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nYeah.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nRemember that guy that was that French guy that walked between the World Trade Center?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nYeah.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nJust went up there and just did it.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nYeah.\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nAfter he stepped on a nail.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nHow the fuck does this.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nI don't understand if the wind blows, you're just dead.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nYeah.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nI don't get that.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nIt just seems like white bother.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nIt wasn't a windy day.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd then they use it.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:13.000\nAnd then there's there's solution to that as they bring out a giant stick.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nThat's like, it's like, isn't this just making problems to solve?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nLike, like, like, like, like, like if you lose the stick because because like, what are you\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\ndoing with the stick?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nOh, well, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nLike, like, like, well, I would lose the stick.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nBut I guess that's why, you know, I'm not a tightrope walker.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nNo.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nI'm just a fucking thin.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nYeah.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:38.000\nAlpha Nect Death Valley t-shirt.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nBoo's Swillin Cowboy.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nYeah.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:47.000\nSpencer, what, what, what have you been doing lately?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nDoing any, um, doing anything lately?\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nI was at Comic Con.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nDid you get recognized?\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nYay.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nI got recognized.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nIt's weird.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:02.000\nI clocked how many times I got recognized and how many times I just got like a, hey, how\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nlong you've been growing that beard?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd it was like about the same, which was interesting.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nHow many times of each?\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nAbout six on the highest.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nLike you're like a human beard.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nYeah.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nPeople, you're interchangeable with your beard.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou, you're, yeah.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nIt's so strange.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nLike people really just go, oh yeah, a beard.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nThat's something I'm allowed to like talk to you about.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nExcept can I give you a little cynical fame 101?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nOh, God.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nStraight from the cynical heartline.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:36.000\nAbout 30% of those people that are talking to you about your beard, they know what's up.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nThey know what's up.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nThey're playing it stealth because they're like, oh, I don't want to be a fan.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nI would like, I would.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nThat would be interesting.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nThey'll, they'll buy you a drink and then they'll talk to you about the economy.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nAnd then on their way out, they'll be like, by the way, big fan.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nWhat?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nYou fucker.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nYeah.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nI thought you were a nice person.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nYeah.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou know how like Patton Oswalt and, and like Brian Cranston, like they wear the mask and\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nthey walk through so they could be with the people in the comic con?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:07.000\nI thought there's the Spencer put on just a mask with the beard and not change anything\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:08.000\nelse.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nI think you would still be recognizable.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nLike if you'd dressed like a ghost writer.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nMark Hamill dressed as a stormtrooper and I thought that was cute.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nNo, I didn't see that.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nIt's funny because he, and he referenced like, you know, he's like, I know I'm a little short\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nfor this costume.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nIt's cute.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nHe referenced that.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nHe referenced.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nHe referenced that.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:31.000\nHe referenced the line from Star Wars where he enters Princess Leia.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nHe just kept saying that over and over again.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nNo, he's in his, in his Instagram caption.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nI mean, that's asking to be going, you're out.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nI like Mark Hamill.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nI don't know if I ever mentioned this on this podcast, but I, like when we were, I think\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nI must have, when we were doing a community and we were picking, like, you know, we ended\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:53.000\nup with Louise Guzman as the statue in the courtyard and we were going through people\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nlike, well, there should be a statue of someone in the courtyard.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nI must have talked about this.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nI don't remember.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nOne of the, one of the people was with the proposals was what about Mark Hamill?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nCause he's like, it's like, he's Luke Skywalker, but he's Mark Hamill.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:10.000\nAnd like, what if he was like the statue, he was the most famous alumnus of the, of,\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nof Greendale.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd I, and I sent him an email or, I think, I don't think I sent him an email.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:20.800\nI think the charming thing was that I got a, like a hand typed letter from him in response\n\n11:20.800 --> 11:22.920\nto a casting director reaching out to him.\n\n11:22.920 --> 11:30.000\nSo I was the schmock, the, the, the cigar chomping, get me Mark Hamill.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:35.000\nAnd, and, and, and got this like lovingly crafted letter from Mark Hamill that was like,\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\ndear Dan Harmon, pleased to meet you.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nI'm Mark Hamill.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nAnd I shit my pants and keep reading the letter.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nAnd he's like, I'm so flattered.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nI got the script.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nIt's very funny.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:51.000\nAnd, and, but, you know, I think we both know the jokes on me a little bit.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nLike he, he wasn't defensive about it.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nIt wasn't like Gene Simmons' interview with Terry Gross.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nIt was like, it was like Mark Hamill.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nLike he got, he kind of called us on it.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nHe was sort of like, yeah, the joke is kind of like, I'm a schnook, you know, like, and,\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nand it's, I do agree.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:10.000\nIt's funny, but also like, I kind of like, I'm not ready to just be like that yet or\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nsomething like that.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:15.000\nHe just explained it very concisely and very, very politely and empathically.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nAnd then it was like, also I'm a director.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.000\nSo if you want to give me a serious job, fucking asshole.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd I was, I was, I was, I actually, this is Mark Hamill wrote me a letter.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nDid you save it?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:30.000\nYeah, come on.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou know, you move, you move, you meet people, you say hello, you say goodbye, yada, yada.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nYou know, our first guest is just sort of a surprise.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:46.000\nI found this, this, this kid like out in the alley, like, like LA is like, it's a wasteland\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nof talent.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nLike there are too much people, people come here.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.000\nThey come here on a carpet of dreams.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nThey, they sell the carpet.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nThey sell shoes.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nThey got some dreams, dream shakens left over.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:03.000\nThey sell watermelon on the side of the road, fruits and vegetables.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nYou've seen these people.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nYeah.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nYou've seen these people selling things.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:11.000\nLet's, let's, let's bring out this poor kid.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:12.000\nJeff Davis.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:13.000\nJeff Davis.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:42.800\nSo Jeff, I heard his terrible story out in the alley, like he's just had a vocal\n\n13:42.800 --> 13:43.800\nsurgery.\n\n13:43.800 --> 13:48.800\nSo he's drinking hot tea and he can't talk that much yet.\n\n13:48.800 --> 13:53.800\nSo that's why he's not, normally I just make a kid from the alley, a comptroller.\n\n13:53.800 --> 13:56.800\nYou did.\n\n13:56.800 --> 14:00.800\nI'm just here to listen tonight, Dan.\n\n14:00.800 --> 14:01.800\nOkay.\n\n14:01.800 --> 14:05.800\nYou gotta eat that mic.\n\n14:05.800 --> 14:06.800\nYeah.\n\n14:06.800 --> 14:13.800\nI'm, I'm already paying for myself, Dan.\n\n14:13.800 --> 14:16.800\nCan we hear a little bit about, I've never known a human being.\n\n14:16.800 --> 14:17.800\nSo Jeff, Jeff.\n\n14:17.800 --> 14:20.800\nI've never known a human being.\n\n14:20.800 --> 14:24.800\nI've known they know lizards and crustaceans.\n\n14:24.800 --> 14:27.800\nI only know ghosts and minotaurs.\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:29.800\nI've never known a human being.\n\n14:29.800 --> 14:34.800\nYou, sir, will be his first human being.\n\n14:34.800 --> 14:38.800\nMake it good.\n\n14:38.800 --> 14:42.800\nWhat is it like to not be able to talk for two weeks, three weeks?\n\n14:42.800 --> 14:45.800\nIt was two weeks of total vocal silence.\n\n14:45.800 --> 14:47.800\nBecause of what you, what did you have?\n\n14:47.800 --> 14:54.800\nI had a polyp on one of my, I think my left vocal fold and there's a tiny little pea,\n\n14:54.800 --> 14:59.800\nlike not even a pea shape, like, like if a pea grew peas, that's what the pea would look\n\n14:59.800 --> 15:00.800\nlike.\n\n15:00.800 --> 15:03.800\nAnd it was a very tiny little thing and I had some doctors go down in my throat and they\n\n15:03.800 --> 15:06.800\nwere very good and it was like a sleep for like an hour and a half and they,\n\n15:06.800 --> 15:12.800\nDid you wake up during, during the, and see if they were talking shit about you?\n\n15:12.800 --> 15:15.800\nI woke up and I was just covered in dicks and balls drawings.\n\n15:15.800 --> 15:16.800\nOh yeah.\n\n15:16.800 --> 15:17.800\nYeah.\n\n15:17.800 --> 15:19.800\nRob woke up during his colonoscopy.\n\n15:19.800 --> 15:21.800\nHow did you pronounce that?\n\n15:21.800 --> 15:24.800\nHey, Colin.\n\n15:24.800 --> 15:26.800\nWould he cut open your colon?\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:29.800\nDidn't you go in with Colin Hanks and get an endoscopy?\n\n15:29.800 --> 15:30.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n15:30.800 --> 15:32.800\nThat's a colonoscopy when they start with him.\n\n15:32.800 --> 15:34.800\nEven though it's his throat, it's a colonoscopy.\n\n15:34.800 --> 15:38.800\nI don't think my insurance is going to cover this.\n\n15:38.800 --> 15:40.800\nYou kind of sounded like Colin Hanks when he said that.\n\n15:40.800 --> 15:41.800\nI sounded who?\n\n15:41.800 --> 15:42.800\nI don't think there's insurance.\n\n15:42.800 --> 15:44.800\nYou kind of sounded like Colin Hanks.\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:45.800\nI wasn't trying to.\n\n15:45.800 --> 15:46.800\nNo, that's good.\n\n15:46.800 --> 15:47.800\nOh no, I'm sorry.\n\n15:47.800 --> 15:48.800\nI'm doing a terrible job.\n\n15:48.800 --> 15:51.800\nYeah, Rob woke up during his colonoscopy.\n\n15:51.800 --> 15:52.800\nWe've already told this.\n\n15:52.800 --> 15:53.800\nAll right.\n\n15:53.800 --> 15:55.800\nWell, yeah, we told every story all the time.\n\n15:55.800 --> 15:58.800\nWe got, we got a couple things that are, that we haven't talked about.\n\n15:58.800 --> 15:59.800\nKeep talking.\n\n15:59.800 --> 16:01.800\nOne is a shooting and the other is a,\n\n16:01.800 --> 16:02.800\ndo your friend that departed?\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:03.800\nSince I couldn't talk.\n\n16:03.800 --> 16:04.800\nI threw up on my groceries.\n\n16:04.800 --> 16:05.800\nGo ahead.\n\n16:05.800 --> 16:13.800\nI'm not going to be able to butt in tonight, you guys.\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:16.800\nYou guys, you guys do all the talking.\n\n16:16.800 --> 16:19.800\nI was just going to say that since I was able to talk,\n\n16:19.800 --> 16:23.800\nthis amazing story happened to me, which I cannot tell you,\n\n16:23.800 --> 16:27.800\nbecause I am on vocal arrest.\n\n16:27.800 --> 16:31.800\nI really hope it doesn't get church in trouble,\n\n16:31.800 --> 16:36.800\nbecause I heard, because it's such a funny joke that,\n\n16:36.800 --> 16:39.800\nI think he got to Dino and then Dino told it to me.\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:43.800\nDino said, church says that even though Jeff can't talk at all,\n\n16:43.800 --> 16:47.800\nhe still figures out ways to interrupt her.\n\n16:47.800 --> 16:52.800\nIt's because I'm a showman.\n\n16:52.800 --> 17:00.800\nSpeaking of the glass ceiling and alpha neck,\n\n17:00.800 --> 17:01.800\nyou get that?\n\n17:01.800 --> 17:03.800\nIs that the glass ceiling?\n\n17:03.800 --> 17:04.800\nPut it on.\n\n17:04.800 --> 17:06.800\nIt looks so practical.\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:09.800\nI always imagine it being more oppressive.\n\n17:09.800 --> 17:11.800\nOh, it's like, you can wear it like a helmet.\n\n17:11.800 --> 17:16.800\nBad will happen.\n\n17:16.800 --> 17:18.800\nHello, Mr. Bob.\n\n17:18.800 --> 17:19.800\nThanks.\n\n17:19.800 --> 17:21.800\nExpect you to die.\n\n17:21.800 --> 17:23.800\nDoes it sound as cool as it sounds?\n\n17:23.800 --> 17:28.800\nYeah, it sounds awesome.\n\n17:28.800 --> 17:34.800\nRob's holding a plexiglass container on his head.\n\n17:34.800 --> 17:35.800\nI was going to say, speaking of...\n\n17:35.800 --> 17:37.800\nOh, it's a trash can.\n\n17:37.800 --> 17:40.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n17:40.800 --> 17:42.800\nI was going to say, but why don't I just bring her out,\n\n17:42.800 --> 17:44.800\nand I want to bring her out.\n\n17:44.800 --> 17:47.800\nIt's my chance to do my Don Pardo impression.\n\n17:47.800 --> 17:50.800\nHe was an announcer in the 70s on SNL.\n\n17:50.800 --> 17:53.800\nPlease welcome Lorraine Newman.\n\n17:53.800 --> 18:05.800\nThank you.\n\n18:05.800 --> 18:07.800\nThanks for coming.\n\n18:07.800 --> 18:09.800\nThank you.\n\n18:09.800 --> 18:10.800\nIt's been a rough week.\n\n18:10.800 --> 18:12.800\nIt has, yeah.\n\n18:12.800 --> 18:14.800\nWe were talking backstage about it.\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:17.800\nI hazarded a guess, but without realizing that, of course,\n\n18:17.800 --> 18:20.800\nyou knew him because you were on Metalocalypse\n\n18:20.800 --> 18:22.800\nthat we lost our friend, John Schnep.\n\n18:22.800 --> 18:24.800\nI don't know how many of you are familiar with him.\n\n18:24.800 --> 18:26.800\nWe're in L.A.\n\n18:26.800 --> 18:28.800\nIt's just...\n\n18:28.800 --> 18:31.800\nWhat kind of host brings you out\n\n18:31.800 --> 18:32.800\nand then just drops that on you?\n\n18:32.800 --> 18:33.800\nI don't know.\n\n18:33.800 --> 18:34.800\nHow are you doing?\n\n18:34.800 --> 18:35.800\nHappy days.\n\n18:35.800 --> 18:37.800\nI'm doing great.\n\n18:37.800 --> 18:39.800\nOkay, so let's talk about our dead friend.\n\n18:39.800 --> 18:41.800\nOkay, no.\n\n18:41.800 --> 18:43.800\nI just like...\n\n18:43.800 --> 18:45.800\nI wanted to eulogize him a little bit because I haven't...\n\n18:45.800 --> 18:48.800\nI always feel sociopathic when...\n\n18:48.800 --> 18:51.800\nI don't know.\n\n18:51.800 --> 18:54.800\nI remember the color of the floor\n\n18:54.800 --> 18:57.800\nwhen I found out that he had just...\n\n18:57.800 --> 18:59.800\nboom, like crazy stroke.\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:02.800\nIt does feel like life turns on a dime\n\n19:02.800 --> 19:04.800\nbecause I was just saying that I saw hereditary with him\n\n19:04.800 --> 19:06.800\nthree weeks ago.\n\n19:06.800 --> 19:08.800\nAnd then there's this tremendous guilt.\n\n19:08.800 --> 19:12.800\nNow you're talking about someone in the past tense.\n\n19:12.800 --> 19:15.800\nBut I think it's just...\n\n19:15.800 --> 19:17.800\nEverything about it feels awful.\n\n19:17.800 --> 19:19.800\nSo I don't know what I thought that was podcasting dynamite,\n\n19:19.800 --> 19:22.800\nbut I also don't know what my job is.\n\n19:22.800 --> 19:25.800\nBut just because...\n\n19:25.800 --> 19:27.800\nI see people's Instagrams and stuff,\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:30.800\nand I just wanted to lend our voice to his eulogy.\n\n19:30.800 --> 19:32.800\nI think that there are some people when they die,\n\n19:32.800 --> 19:33.800\nit's like, yeah.\n\n19:33.800 --> 19:35.800\nBut with him, you can't believe that.\n\n19:35.800 --> 19:37.800\nI think that's important to acknowledge.\n\n19:37.800 --> 19:38.800\nYou can't believe that.\n\n19:38.800 --> 19:40.800\nI can't believe that he passed away.\n\n19:40.800 --> 19:43.800\nHe was so just vibrant.\n\n19:43.800 --> 19:46.800\nSo that's, I think, the difference.\n\n19:46.800 --> 19:47.800\nHe was such a...\n\n19:47.800 --> 19:50.800\nI think he epitomized workaholism, right?\n\n19:50.800 --> 19:53.800\nI mean, this is a city driven by workaholics,\n\n19:53.800 --> 19:55.800\nand I'm trying to get over that therapy,\n\n19:55.800 --> 20:01.800\nbut John was both cautionary tale and role model.\n\n20:01.800 --> 20:05.800\nI mean, he just kept working and working,\n\n20:05.800 --> 20:07.800\nand he just loved sitting in front of his avid\n\n20:07.800 --> 20:09.800\nand making crazy shit.\n\n20:09.800 --> 20:15.800\nAnd every anecdote about him, from adult swim to...\n\n20:15.800 --> 20:18.800\neverywhere else he's worked, it's like an editor.\n\n20:18.800 --> 20:22.800\nEvery anecdote is about coming into the office at 9 a.m.,\n\n20:22.800 --> 20:23.800\nand he's been there all night,\n\n20:23.800 --> 20:26.800\nand he's created some ridiculous, elaborate thing\n\n20:26.800 --> 20:28.800\nthat they can't even use in the show.\n\n20:28.800 --> 20:30.800\nHe's a consummate artist.\n\n20:30.800 --> 20:33.800\nI mean, really, he really lived to create art.\n\n20:33.800 --> 20:35.800\nSo yeah, we love you, John.\n\n20:35.800 --> 20:36.800\nI hope you're listening.\n\n20:36.800 --> 20:38.800\nI hope that's how the universe works.\n\n20:38.800 --> 20:41.800\nUnless that's all it is, unless you're just vapor,\n\n20:41.800 --> 20:42.800\nand you have to listen.\n\n20:42.800 --> 20:43.800\nYou have to have people listening to podcasts.\n\n20:43.800 --> 20:44.800\nThat's awful.\n\n20:44.800 --> 20:47.800\nThen sign me up for atheism.\n\n20:47.800 --> 20:52.800\nIf it's just listening to shit in your local area forever.\n\n20:52.800 --> 20:54.800\nAnd then the whole planet goes away,\n\n20:54.800 --> 20:56.800\nand you're just like, hello!\n\n20:56.800 --> 20:58.800\nAnd you can't even hear the other people.\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:00.800\nYou can't even look forward to your friends.\n\n21:00.800 --> 21:03.800\nOr you only just get the intros to the podcast.\n\n21:03.800 --> 21:05.800\nJust the intros where people vamp for 20 minutes,\n\n21:05.800 --> 21:09.800\nand you want to kill yourself.\n\n21:09.800 --> 21:14.800\nWe don't know what that's like at all.\n\n21:14.800 --> 21:17.800\nYeah, on the off chance that you're listening, John,\n\n21:17.800 --> 21:21.800\nI'm part and parcel of it.\n\n21:21.800

to...\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:33.800\nYeah.\n\n23:33.800 --> 23:35.800\nBut I think any chance to acknowledge people\n\n23:35.800 --> 23:37.800\nand your appreciation of their work\n\n23:37.800 --> 23:39.800\nis not wasted.\n\n23:39.800 --> 23:41.800\nAnd it's not about you.\n\n23:41.800 --> 23:43.800\nYou don't look foolish.\n\n23:43.800 --> 23:45.800\nYou don't look...\n\n23:45.800 -->

37:15.800\nOh, well, here's another reference nobody will know.\n\n37:15.800 --> 37:17.800\nDoes anybody know who Lucille Ball was?\n\n37:17.800 --> 37:19.800\nYeah.\n\n37:19.800 --> 37:21.800\nWell, her hometown is Jamestown,\n\n37:21.800 --> 37:23.800\nupstate New York, Buffalo.\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:25.800\nAnd they approached her when she was still\n\n37:25.800 --> 37:27.800\nliving, obviously, and said,\n\n37:27.800 --> 37:29.800\nwe want to do a museum dedicated to you.\n\n37:29.800 --> 37:31.800\nAnd she said,\n\n37:31.800 --> 37:33.800\nI would much prefer\n\n37:33.800 --> 37:35.800\nif you do a museum celebrating comedy.\n\n37:35.800 --> 37:37.800\nWow.\n\n37:37.800 --> 37:39.800\nSo the National\n\n37:39.800 --> 37:41.800\nComedy Center was built.\n\n37:41.800 --> 37:43.800\nThey started on it eight years ago,\n\n37:43.800 --> 37:45.800\nand I took a tour\n\n37:45.800 --> 37:47.800\na week ago, and it is\n\n37:47.800 --> 37:49.800\nmind-blowing.\n\n37:49.800 --> 37:51.800\nIf anybody's a comedy nerd, you will weep.\n\n37:51.800 --> 37:53.800\nIt's absolutely mecca.\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:55.800\nWhat\n\n37:55.800 --> 37:57.800\ntown in New York is that,\n\n37:57.800 --> 37:59.800\nlike a bigger town, is the Jamestown near?\n\n37:59.800 --> 38:01.800\nI don't know,\n\n38:01.800 --> 38:03.800\nbecause I am from the West Coast,\n\n38:03.800 --> 38:05.800\nand I do not know my way around there.\n\n38:05.800 --> 38:07.800\nI'm going to be up there not too long.\n\n38:07.800 --> 38:09.800\nBuffalo is the biggest.\n\n38:09.800 --> 38:11.800\nOh, you've got to check it out.\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:13.800\nYeah, and there's a big opening.\n\n38:13.800 --> 38:15.800\nIt's funny, Harmontown was never asked to...\n\n38:15.800 --> 38:17.800\nPardon me?\n\n38:17.800 --> 38:19.800\nTo contribute?\n\n38:19.800 --> 38:21.800\nWe still haven't been inducted.\n\n38:21.800 --> 38:23.800\nWe don't have a chair alone.\n\n38:23.800 --> 38:25.800\nI got a Harmontown question,\n\n38:25.800 --> 38:27.800\nas I normally sort of...\n\n38:27.800 --> 38:29.800\nThese still suck.\n\n38:29.800 --> 38:31.800\nYeah, they're the worst.\n\n38:31.800 --> 38:33.800\nThey're so uncomfortable.\n\n38:33.800 --> 38:35.800\nI've been saying it for years, and they're still here.\n\n38:35.800 --> 38:37.800\nWe're guests here.\n\n38:37.800 --> 38:39.800\nIt's a fine theater.\n\n38:39.800 --> 38:41.800\nYou want us to start asking for...\n\n38:41.800 --> 38:43.800\nWe'd have to provide our own.\n\n38:43.800 --> 38:45.800\nI feel like we brought these chairs.\n\n38:45.800 --> 38:47.800\nYes, because they were at the castle.\n\n38:47.800 --> 38:49.800\nYou cut to just these really comfortable chairs\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:51.800\nthroughout.\n\n38:51.800 --> 38:53.800\nThat's awesome.\n\n38:53.800 --> 38:55.800\nLorraine Newman.\n\n38:55.800 --> 38:57.800\nConehead Stories, go.\n\n38:57.800 --> 38:59.800\nConehead Stories, go.\n\n38:59.800 --> 39:01.800\nOkay.\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:03.800\nAll right.\n\n39:03.800 --> 39:05.800\nThis one's called Conehead Stories.\n\n39:05.800 --> 39:07.800\nTake it away.\n\n39:07.800 --> 39:09.800\nOkay, well, one time,\n\n39:09.800 --> 39:11.800\nwe wanted to kill off the Coneheads\n\n39:11.800 --> 39:13.800\nand send them back to Remulax,\n\n39:13.800 --> 39:15.800\nso we did some actual outside filming\n\n39:15.800 --> 39:17.800\nwhere Dan Acroy, Jane Curtin,\n\n39:17.800 --> 39:19.800\nwe were just driving around,\n\n39:19.800 --> 39:21.800\nI think New Jersey or something.\n\n39:21.800 --> 39:23.800\nAnd the thing that they attached\n\n39:23.800 --> 39:25.800\nthe cone with\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:27.800\nwas something that's not used anymore\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:29.800\ncalled spirit gum.\n\n39:29.800 --> 39:31.800\nAnd we'd only been at it\n\n39:31.800 --> 39:33.800\nfor like five minutes when we did a sketch,\n\n39:33.800 --> 39:35.800\nbut this was like several hours\n\n39:35.800 --> 39:37.800\nand it started to burn like fuck.\n\n39:37.800 --> 39:39.800\nYou know?\n\n39:39.800 --> 39:41.800\nAnd I don't know,\n\n39:41.800 --> 39:43.800\nI think I'm not speaking out of school\n\n39:43.800 --> 39:45.800\nwhen I say that Danny and Jane\n\n39:45.800 --> 39:47.800\nsmoked weed to deal with the pain.\n\n39:47.800 --> 39:49.800\nThey can take the hit.\n\n39:49.800 --> 39:51.800\nTheir careers can take it.\n\n39:51.800 --> 39:53.800\nI think TMZ is here tonight.\n\n39:53.800 --> 39:55.800\nThat's probably whose phone rang.\n\n39:55.800 --> 39:57.800\nOh, dear God.\n\n39:57.800 --> 39:59.800\nBut Danny and Jane can take it.\n\n39:59.800 --> 40:01.800\nYeah, I mean, Jane is still waters.\n\n40:01.800 --> 40:03.800\nI heard he called her an ignorant slut once.\n\n40:03.800 --> 40:05.800\nHe did.\n\n40:05.800 --> 40:07.800\nBut I mean, when the Stones...\n\n40:07.800 --> 40:09.800\nTMZ, out to the street.\n\n40:09.800 --> 40:11.800\nWhen the Rolling Stones hosted our show,\n\n40:11.800 --> 40:13.800\nJane Curtin's dressing room was next to mine\n\n40:13.800 --> 40:15.800\nand I remember opening the door\n\n40:15.800 --> 40:17.800\nand Jane was in a bathrobe and curlers\n\n40:17.800 --> 40:19.800\nsmoking and Mick Jagger was there.\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:21.800\nJust the two of them.\n\n40:21.800 --> 40:23.800\nIt's like this...\n\n40:23.800 --> 40:25.800\nhe should be in my dressing room.\n\n40:25.800 --> 40:27.800\nWhy is he...\n\n40:27.800 --> 40:29.800\nShe hasn't sunk in for me that it's just legal now.\n\n40:29.800 --> 40:31.800\nIsn't it just legal?\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:33.800\nIt's sort of like in this whole fracas...\n\n40:33.800 --> 40:35.800\nI mean, I had a medical card\n\n40:35.800 --> 40:37.800\nand I would go talk to the guy with the ponytail\n\n40:37.800 --> 40:39.800\non the stethoscope and like pretend\n\n40:39.800 --> 40:41.800\nI had sleep apnea.\n\n40:41.800 --> 40:43.800\nIt's not legal in New York.\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:45.800\nBecause my older child\n\n40:45.800 --> 40:47.800\nwas complaining.\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:49.800\nShe wanted some edibles.\n\n40:49.800 --> 40:51.800\nShe was freaking out because she had bed bugs.\n\n40:51.800 --> 40:53.800\nAnd she was sure\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:55.800\nthat she was finding them all over the house.\n\n40:55.800 --> 40:57.800\nIt was kind of like Coke bugs.\n\n40:57.800 --> 40:59.800\nBut she said, God, I could use some edibles.\n\n40:59.800 --> 41:01.800\nI said, go out and get some.\n\n41:01.800 --> 41:03.800\nIt's illegal in New York and I had no idea.\n\n41:03.800 --> 41:05.800\nHuh.\n\n41:05.800 --> 41:07.800\nBecause you're like it always seemed legal\n\n41:07.800 --> 41:09.800\nwhen I was here.\n\n41:09.800 --> 41:11.800\nWhat's the problem?\n\n41:11.800 --> 41:13.800\nI think we got a little\n\n41:13.800 --> 41:15.800\nsidetracked from the conehead story.\n\n41:15.800 --> 41:17.800\nDid you ever keep\n\n41:17.800 --> 41:19.800\nshit? Is the cone\n\n41:19.800 --> 41:21.800\nhollow? Is the conehead...\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:23.800\nWell, it's not\n\n41:23.800 --> 41:25.800\nhollow, but it is firm and...\n\n41:25.800 --> 41:27.800\nWell, I...\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:29.800\nI've officially become Regis Philbin, by the way.\n\n41:29.800 --> 41:31.800\nI don't remember.\n\n41:31.800 --> 41:33.800\nWhat do you put in there?\n\n41:33.800 --> 41:35.800\nIt's the cone hollow. You put things in there.\n\n41:35.800 --> 41:37.800\nI put an omelet.\n\n41:37.800 --> 41:39.800\nWas there like another act to the spirit gum\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:41.800\nstory when you were all burning to death?\n\n41:41.800 --> 41:43.800\nThat was it. You know, we did need to\n\n41:43.800 --> 41:45.800\npump gas at one point, which\n\n41:45.800 --> 41:47.800\nwas fun. Do you remember\n\n41:47.800 --> 41:49.800\nback when the conehead\n\n41:49.800 --> 41:51.800\nmovie was coming out and we\n\n41:51.800 --> 41:53.800\nat Comedy Spores\n\n41:53.800 --> 41:55.800\nhad to wear coneheads and we played\n\n41:55.800 --> 41:57.800\nthe game Doctor Conehead because\n\n41:57.800 --> 41:59.800\nwe were... That's right.\n\n41:59.800 --> 42:01.800\nComedy Spores was hoping we would get on a local commercial.\n\n42:01.800 --> 42:03.800\nOh, my God.\n\n42:03.800 --> 42:05.800\nThat was so sad. Tell that story.\n\n42:05.800 --> 42:07.800\nYeah, like Paramount\n\n42:07.800 --> 42:09.800\ndid the coneheads movie\n\n42:09.800 --> 42:11.800\nand, yeah, the part\n\n42:11.800 --> 42:13.800\nof the promotion was that they sent coneheads.\n\n42:13.800 --> 42:15.800\nI mean, I'm kind of just repeating what you said, but we\n\n42:15.800 --> 42:17.800\nworked at Comedy Spores. Well, you know, like back in the\n\n42:17.800 --> 42:19.800\nthe commercials\n\n42:19.800 --> 42:21.800\nwhere they go, we loved it.\n\n42:21.800 --> 42:23.800\nYeah, they were wearing a conehead\n\n42:23.800 --> 42:25.800\nor something, and so our comedy\n\n42:25.800 --> 42:27.800\nclub took it, they were like,\n\n42:27.800 --> 42:29.800\noh, that means that we could get\n\n42:29.800 --> 42:31.800\nsome promotion.\n\n42:31.800 --> 42:33.800\nLike, no, they're not...\n\n42:33.800 --> 42:35.800\nIt was so sad that we like\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:37.800\nperverted our show to like instead of\n\n42:37.800 --> 42:39.800\nwe used to play Doctor Know-It-All, you know, that theater\n\n42:39.800 --> 42:41.800\nsports game or Mr. Know-It-All, where you do\n\n42:41.800 --> 42:43.800\nthree people and then you answer one word at a time.\n\n42:43.800 --> 42:45.800\nLet's do a round. Hey, somebody ask\n\n42:45.800 --> 42:47.800\na question.\n\n42:47.800 --> 42:49.800\nI heard, why is the sky blue? You fucking\n\n42:49.800 --> 42:51.800\nslow pokes.\n\n42:51.800 --> 42:53.800\nHere's the thing, it doesn't matter what the fucking question\n\n42:53.800 --> 42:55.800\nis.\n\n42:55.800 --> 42:57.800\nThe...\n\n42:57.800 --> 42:59.800\nSky is blue.\n\n42:59.800 --> 43:01.800\nOh, shit.

You go.\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:19.800\nI was thinking of you as the referee.\n\n43:21.800 --> 43:23.800\nHe's going to get the suggestions from the audience.\n\n43:23.800 --> 43:25.800\nAnyways, so our little\n\n43:25.800 --> 43:27.800\nimprov troupe, they changed\n\n43:27.800 --> 43:29.800\nthe name for that\n\n43:29.800 --> 43:31.800\nsix-month period\n\n43:31.800 --> 43:33.800\nto Doctor Conehead, so we all\n\n43:33.800 --> 43:35.800\nhad to wear Coneheads, because the idea was\n\n43:35.800 --> 43:37.800\nthat we could send\n\n43:37.800 --> 43:39.800\nthe tapes that they religiously taped every\n\n43:39.800 --> 43:41.800\nshow from the back of the soundboard.

Where was this done?\n\n43:45.800 --> 43:47.800\nMilwaukee. Oh.\n\n43:47.800 --> 43:49.800\nAnd we hated it, and so we would go\n\n43:49.800 --> 43:51.800\nout of our way to screw it up, so\n\n43:51.800 --> 43:53.800\nthe footage would be unusable.\n\n43:53.800 --> 43:55.800\nYeah.\n\n43:55.800 --> 43:57.800\nDiabolical. I can't remember what we did.\n\n43:57.800 --> 43:59.800\nDo you wear the coat on? I don't know.\n\n43:59.800 --> 44:01.800\nI think it was just like\n\n44:03.800 --> 44:05.800\njust doing terrible.\n\n44:05.800 --> 44:07.800\nI mean, soon after that, you and I were not\n\n44:07.800 --> 44:09.800\nallowed on stage together.\n\n44:09.800 --> 44:11.800\nYeah.\n\n44:11.800 --> 44:13.800\nRob and I were forbidden to be on stage\n\n44:13.800 --> 44:15.800\ntogether.\n\n44:15.800 --> 44:17.800\nIt's kind of a\n\n44:17.800 --> 44:19.800\nfun part of our friendship.\n\n44:19.800 --> 44:21.800\nI guess we were too powerful\n\n44:21.800 --> 44:23.800\ncomedically. That's how we\n\n44:23.800 --> 44:25.800\nchose to look at it.\n\n44:25.800 --> 44:27.800\nSomebody might burst into flames.\n\n44:27.800 --> 44:29.800\nYeah.\n\n44:29.800 --> 44:31.800\nComedy fire, yeah.\n\n44:31.800 --> 44:33.800\nWhen you were doing\n\n44:33.800 --> 44:35.800\nimprov,\n\n44:35.800 --> 44:37.800\nwhat stuff were you doing\n\n44:37.800 --> 44:39.800\nbefore SNL?

people, but a lot of them turned out\n\n45:25.800 --> 45:27.800\nto be showrunners in the 80s\n\n45:27.800 --> 45:29.800\nand 90s.\n\n45:29.800 --> 45:31.800\nYeah.\n\n45:31.800 --> 45:33.800\nAnd Lauren kind of came and saw you\n\n45:33.800 --> 45:35.800\nand scooped you up, or what happened?\n\n45:35.800 --> 45:37.800\nYeah, he saw me.\n\n45:37.800 --> 45:39.800\nI was doing characters,\n\n45:39.800 --> 45:41.800\nand he came with Lily Tomlin.\n\n45:41.800 --> 45:43.800\nHe was producing her special.\n\n45:43.800 --> 45:45.800\nThey hired me for that.\n\n45:45.800 --> 45:47.800\nAnd then later, Lauren came\n\n45:47.800 --> 45:49.800\nback and saw me doing new characters\n\n45:49.800 --> 45:51.800\nand hired me for SNL.\n\n45:51.800 --> 45:53.800\nWhat characters were you doing?\n\n45:53.800 --> 45:55.800\nAnd let's see one of them.\n\n45:55.800 --> 45:57.800\nWas there anything that we might\n\n45:57.800 --> 45:59.800\nrecognize, or was it all news stuff?\n\n45:59.800 --> 46:01.800\nI was doing The Valley Girl,\n\n46:01.800 --> 46:03.800\nand Sherry the Stewardess,\n\n46:03.800 --> 46:05.800\nand the Swedish Kyke Lady\n\n46:05.800 --> 46:07.800\nwho did one\n\n46:07.800 --> 46:09.800\nappearance on SNL.\n\n46:09.800 --> 46:11.800\nAn angry Jewish poet,\n\n46:11.800 --> 46:13.800\nhis name's Sarah Lynn, who had\n\n46:13.800 --> 46:15.800\none appearance on SNL.\n\n46:15.800 --> 46:17.800\nAlice,\n\n46:17.800 --> 46:19.800\nwho, you know, her mundane existence,\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:21.800\nshe thought was really weird.\n\n46:21.800 --> 46:23.800\nOne\n\n46:23.800 --> 46:25.800\nappearance on SNL.\n\n46:25.800 --> 46:27.800\nAnd then Emily Cohnhead,\n\n46:27.800 --> 46:29.800\n37.\n\n46:29.800 --> 46:31.800\nYeah.\n\n46:31.800 --> 46:33.800\nI got a million of them.\n\n46:33.800 --> 46:35.800\nThat's amazing.\n\n46:35.800 --> 46:37.800\nHow was Lily Tomlin?\n\n46:37.800 --> 46:39.800\nShe was great.\n\n46:39.800 --> 46:41.800\nThis was in the 70s, and tapings\n\n46:41.800 --> 46:43.800\ncan go on forever.\n\n46:43.800 --> 46:45.800\nShe was at level three in the morning,\n\n46:45.800 --> 46:47.800\nand she was out there doing stand-up\n\n46:47.800 --> 46:49.800\nto keep the audience going.\n\n46:49.800 --> 46:51.800\nI really admired that so much.\n\n46:51.800 --> 46:53.800\nI'm confused about that.\n\n46:53.800 --> 46:55.800\nYou're talking about SNL?\n\n46:55.800 --> 46:57.800\nNo, this was a Lily Tomlin special.\n\n46:57.800 --> 46:59.800\nOkay.\n\n46:59.800 --> 47:01.800\nLauren came and scouted you from the ground links\n\n47:01.800 --> 47:03.800\nto do the Lily Tomlin special.\n\n47:03.800 --> 47:05.800\nThey actually were looking for men,\n\n47:05.800 --> 47:07.800\nbut they hired me.\n\n47:07.800 --> 47:09.800\nThat is a double achievement,\n\n47:09.800 --> 47:11.800\nas all you ladies know.\n\n47:11.800 --> 47:13.800\nThe ground links that we might know.\n\n47:13.800 --> 47:15.800\nArchie Hahn?\n\n47:15.800 --> 47:17.800\nYeah, I know the name, but not now.\n\n47:17.800 --> 47:19.800\nI don't think you'd know any of them,\n\n47:19.800 --> 47:21.800\nexcept for the people I mentioned.\n\n47:21.800 --> 47:23.800\nMy very first play was four years old.\n\n47:23.800 --> 47:25.800\nI was at the Ground Links Theatre.\n\n47:25.800 --> 47:27.800\nYou're kidding.\n\n47:27.800 --> 47:29.800\nAnd Paul Rubens was doing a show,\n\n47:29.800 --> 47:31.800\nand one of his characters was Pee Wee.\n\n47:31.800 --> 47:33.800\nOh, my God.\n\n47:33.800 --> 47:35.800\nAnd we weren't allowed to see it,\n\n47:35.800 --> 47:37.800\nbecause apparently it was not for kids.\n\n47:37.800 --> 47:39.800\nIt wasn't.\n\n47:39.800 --> 47:41.800\nHe was an architecture student.\n\n47:41.800 --> 47:43.800\nHis hair was this long,\n\n47:43.800 --> 47:45.800\nring-less,\n\n47:45.800 --> 47:47.800\nand we did an improv show there.\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:49.800\nAnd then I left\n\n47:49.800 --> 47:51.800\nto join this improv group\n\n47:51.800 --> 47:53.800\nthat became the Ground Links,\n\n47:53.800 --> 47:55.800\nand then when I got SNL, Paul asked me\n\n47:55.800 --> 47:57.800\nif he should go to the Ground Links,\n\n47:57.800 --> 47:59.800\nand I said, yes.\n\n47:59.800 --> 48:01.800\nDo you still actively do improv?\n\n48:01.800 --> 48:03.800\nEvery once in a while,\n\n48:03.800 --> 48:05.800\nthe alumni shows at the Ground Links.\n\n48:05.800 --> 48:07.800\nBut I also do improv classes\n\n48:07.800 --> 48:09.800\ntaught by this guy, Bill Steinkelner,\n\n48:09.800 --> 48:11.800\nwho is a showrunner for Cheers\n\n48:11.800 --> 48:13.800\nand lots of other sitcoms.\n\n48:13.800 --> 48:15.800\nYou're taking them as a student?\n\n48:15.800 --> 48:17.800\nYeah, it's just for fun.\n\n48:17.800 --> 48:19.800\nIt's all Ground Links alumni.\n\n48:19.800 --> 48:21.800\nThat is actually the most fun I can recall\n\n48:21.800 --> 48:23.800\nis when we were doing workshops\n\n48:23.800 --> 48:25.800\nat Comedy Sports,\n\n48:25.800 --> 48:27.800\nbecause you just do these crazy scenes.\n\n48:27.800 --> 48:29.800\nIf you had a cool teacher,\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:31.800\nyou would just do these in the middle,\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:33.800\nin the back room of a bar\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:35.800\nat three in the afternoon,\n\n48:35.800 --> 48:37.800\nfor 90 minutes,\n\n48:37.800 --> 48:39.800\nand it's the best audience in the world,\n\n48:39.800 --> 48:41.800\nwhich a bunch of other drunk people\n\n48:41.800 --> 48:43.800\nthat are like, this is amazing\n\n48:43.800 --> 48:45.800\nthat we do this.\n\n48:45.800 --> 48:47.800\nPeople are all very, very old,\n\n48:47.800 --> 48:49.800\nand so it's like, well, George couldn't make it.\n\n48:49.800 --> 48:51.800\nHe had knee replacement.\n\n48:53.800 --> 48:55.800\nThat feeling, especially when\n\n48:55.800 --> 48:57.800\nthere's nothing to lose anymore,\n\n48:57.800 --> 48:59.800\nwhen it's not like, oh, I hope I get into the AAA.\n\n48:59.800 --> 49:01.800\nYeah, but the games\n\n49:01.800 --> 49:03.800\nthat Bill has created\n\n49:03.800 --> 49:05.800\nare so sophisticated\n\n49:05.800 --> 49:07.800\nand wonderful and so fun,\n\n49:07.800 --> 49:09.800\nand nothing like\n\n49:09.800 --> 49:11.800\nthe Violas Bowling games.\n\n49:11.800 --> 49:13.800\nHe's just grown it to a...\n\n49:13.800 --> 49:15.800\nI hate using that word exponential.\n\n49:15.800 --> 49:17.800\nDo you find yourself going through,\n\n49:17.800 --> 49:19.800\nwhen you do improv and you enter a scene,\n\n49:19.800 --> 49:21.800\ndo you black out?\n\n49:21.800 --> 49:23.800\nDo you...\n\n49:23.800 --> 49:25.800\nRob and I have talked about this\n\n49:25.800 --> 49:27.800\nas bad as we are at improv.\n\n49:27.800 --> 49:29.800\nWe're not like\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:31.800\nguys that you would compare\n\n49:31.800 --> 49:33.800\nto good, long-form people\n\n49:33.800 --> 49:35.800\nthat we see who are such great listeners\n\n49:35.800 --> 49:37.800\nand maybe disciplined and all this stuff,\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:39.800\nbut I don't...\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:41.800\nIs there this thing where you kind of like...\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:43.800\nDo I black out? Yeah, absolutely.\n\n49:43.800 --> 49:45.800\nI'm a shitty improviser. I was never good.\n\n49:45.800 --> 49:47.800\nI always did character monologues at the ground links.\n\n49:47.800 --> 49:49.800\nI was never a good improviser.\n\n49:49.800 --> 49:51.800\nDo you think it's because you're a bad listener\n\n49:51.800 --> 49:53.800\nor bad holding tasker?\n\n49:53.800 --> 49:55.800\nYou need to process and everybody else\n\n49:55.800 --> 49:57.800\nis all over. I'm a slow processor.\n\n49:57.800 --> 49:59.800\nI watch the Ascat things.\n\n49:59.800 --> 50:01.800\nAnd I'm watching these guys and I'm like,\n\n50:01.800 --> 50:03.800\nhow on earth did they split the difference\n\n50:03.800 --> 50:05.800\nbetween this much crowd-pleasing\n\n50:05.800 --> 50:07.800\nand this much actual discipline?\n\n50:07.800 --> 50:09.800\nI don't even know, because also they're denying\n\n50:09.800 --> 50:11.800\nall this shit that I learned as rules.\n\n50:11.800 --> 50:13.800\nIt's like, oh, the only way through a scene\n\n50:13.800 --> 50:15.800\nis if you apply all these fucking rules\n\n50:15.800 --> 50:17.800\nand then maybe something good will come out of it.\n\n50:17.800 --> 50:19.800\nBut UCB,\n\n50:19.800 --> 50:21.800\nthey teach just this crazy...\n\n50:21.800 --> 50:23.800\nNo, this is how you do a sketch\n\n50:23.800 --> 50:25.800\nin three minutes,\n\n50:25.800 --> 50:27.800\nwhich I guess is how they kind of rose to the...\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:29.800\nThat's nice for them.\n\n50:31.800 --> 50:33.800\nThey do really hard shows.\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:35.800\nThey have a show called The Crazy Uncle Joe show.\n\n50:35.800 --> 50:37.800\nAnd it's all suggestions\n\n50:37.800 --> 50:39.800\nfrom the audience.\n\n50:39.800 --> 50:41.800\nAnd what they do is they do like short little scenes\n\n50:41.800 --> 50:43.800\nand they go back and forth in time\n\n50:43.800 --> 50:45.800\nso they have to remember what they established\n\n50:45.800 --> 50:47.800\nand the characters they established\n\n50:47.800 --> 50:49.800\nin each scene.\n\n50:49.800 --> 50:51.800\nThat's hard.\n\n50:51.800 --> 50:53.800\nThat is really hard.\n\n50:53.800 --> 50:55.800\nI find watching improv...\n\n50:55.800 --> 50:57.800\nI do a lot of improv, it's mostly short stuff,\n\n50:57.800 --> 50:59.800\nlike gamey stuff.\n\n50:59.800 --> 51:01.800\nWatching other people do improv\n\n51:01.800 --> 51:03.800\nscares the shit out of me.\n\n51:03.800 --> 51:05.800\nDoing improv doesn't scare me at all.\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:07.800\nBeing in the audience, I'm sweating.\n\n51:07.800 --> 51:09.800\nI'm nervous.\n\n51:09.800 --> 51:11.800\nYou project yourself up on stage,\n\n51:11.800 --> 51:13.800\nyou're like, I wouldn't have thought of that.\n\n51:13.800 --> 51:15.800\nI wouldn't have done that.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:17.800\nI'd be fucked up there. I wouldn't be able to make it.\n\n51:17.800 --> 51:19.800\nBut when you're up on stage,\n\n51:19.800 --> 51:21.800\nyou go into that blackout, you roll your eyes back\n\n51:21.800 --> 51:23.800\nand just bite like a shark.\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:25.800\nMy big limitation is\n\n51:25.800 --> 51:27.800\nI was always like a bad listener.\n\n51:27.800 --> 51:29.800\nYou bite like a shark, you guys.\n\n51:29.800 --> 51:31.800\nI don't know if you should be biting.\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:33.800\nThis is real improv talk, you guys.\n\n51:35.800 --> 51:37.800\nI would just wait off stage and see a scene\n\n51:37.800 --> 51:39.800\nand go, okay, I think I'll be the plumber.\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:41.800\nThey clearly need a plumber here.\n\n51:41.800 --> 51:43.800\nAnd then I got this great idea\n\n51:43.800 --> 51:45.800\nand I come in and I don't fucking...\n\n51:45.800 --> 51:47.800\nYou hold on to the idea.\n\n51:47.800 --> 51:49.800\nI watch other people doing it better\n\n51:49.800 --> 51:51.800\neven though they're talking, they're still listening.\n\n51:51.800 --> 51:53.800\nAnd they're able to.\n\n51:53.800 --> 51:55.800\nBut I think Schrab and I are in the same category.\n\n51:55.800 --> 51:57.800\nIt's like, you come in as a plumber,\n\n51:57.800 --> 51:59.800\nyou already decided that you're a plumber\n\n51:59.800 --> 52:01.800\nand that the reason you're a plumber is because Voltron's parked outside\n\n52:01.800 --> 52:03.800\nand if somebody's like, hold on, I need Ben Franklin,\n\n52:03.800 --> 52:05.800\nyou're like, Ben Franklin doesn't exist.\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:07.800\nThere's a Voltron outside.\n\n52:07.800 --> 52:09.800\nYou're like, fuck everybody.\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:11.800\nI have an idea.

01:12:52.800\nwith the people that you watched\n\n01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800\non the Magic Box.\n\n01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.800\nSo fun.\n\n01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.800\nThen after a

impression.\n\n01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.800\nI do that impression.\n\n01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.800\nSometimes you go into the\n\n01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.800\nlater years.\n\n01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.800\nSpence, you want to hit us?\n\n01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.800\nZach, you got that D&D music queued up?\n\n01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800\nOh, hell yeah.\n\n01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.800\nSpence, hit us with a recap, bro.\n\n01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.800\nI think this would be your music.\n\n01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.800\nYeah, I was going to say that,\n\n01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.800\nbut that seemed too on the nose.\n\n01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.800\nThis is his day, Matthew.\n\n01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800\nRight.\n\n01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.800\nLast time on Harmon Time,\n\n01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.800\nour heroes were escaping from town.\n\n01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.800\nAfter they\n\n01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800\ntried to kidnap Shrove,\n\n01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.800\nand Shrove got away.\n\n01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.800\nThey gave up and left the town,\n\n01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.800\nbut DJ went back to the town and got kidnapped.\n\n01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.800\nSo the gang had to rescue them,\n\n01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.800\nand they did, and then they got in a fight\n\n01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.800\nwhere they found some clues\n\n01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.800\nthat led them to find Patchen's Jeff.\n\n01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.800\nAfter killing\n\n01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800\nsome vampires,\n\n01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.800\nthey went to go help with a fire.\n\n01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.800\nAnd then when they were helping with the fire,\n\n01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.800\nthey caused more fire or something.\n\n01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.800\nI think they put out the fire,\n\n01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.800\nand then restarted the fire.\n\n01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.800\nThat sounds right.\n\n01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.800\nAnd then they made a hasty retreat,\n\n01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.800\nbut they were followed by a couple farmers,\n\n01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.800\nand as they escaped,\n\n01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.800\nthe farmers pursued them,\n\n01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.800\nand then they started cutting the farmers down to sides.\n\n01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.800\nIt was pretty much overkill,\n\n01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.800\nbecause they were just farmers,\n\n01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.800\nand they were poorly armed.\n\n01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.800\nAnd so then they just kind of,\n\n01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800\nI think you guys convinced them to just go away,\n\n01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.800\nand you're like, we're just going to leave,\n\n01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.800\nand you've got a raven\n\n01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800\ntelling you to go on a new mission,\n\n01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.800\nwhich you were going to do,\n\n01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.800\nand then you were going towards the new mission place,\n\n01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.800\nand then you saw a colt,\n\n01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.800\nand it sounded like you were going to attack the colt.\n\n01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.800\nNow...\n\n01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.800\nFarmer's down.\n\n01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.800\nWhat are you eating?\n\n01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800\nEither I forgot to take my Adderall this morning,\n\n01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.800\nor this shit's going to get cray cray.\n\n01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.800\nBut you know what?\n\n01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.800\nIt tastes like attention.\n\n01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.800\nThat's why I love it.\n\n01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.800\nYou're not going to go to bed until four tonight.\n\n01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.800\nWell, it depends.\n\n01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.800\nDid I take somewhere earlier?\n\n01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.800\nI can't remember.\n\n01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.800\nMaybe I'll learn some new software.\n\n01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800\nSpence, last thing that happened,\n\n01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.800\nwas Chad attacking the people?\n\n01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.800\nYeah, but Chad...\n\n01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.800\nHe's...\n\n01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.800\nNo one's playing him right now, right?\n\n01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.800\nOr do you want to play Chad instead of...\n\n01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.800\nInstead of the shambling mouth?\n\n01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.800\nGary? No.\n\n01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.800\nOkay.\n\n01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.800\nWhat about our friend Michael Waldron?\n\n01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.800\nOh, yeah, Waldron's here.\n\n01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.800\nHe's white.\n\n01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800\nHe just gave a look like...\n\n01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800\nI'll come up.\n\n01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.800\nOkay, we've got a lot of volunteers.\n\n01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.800\nAll right.\n\n01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.800\nWait, how do we do this fairly?\n\n01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.800\nDon't play on my sense of fairness.\n\n01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.800\nHe's blind.\n\n01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.800\nWait a minute.\n\n01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.800\nI'm hearing podcast dynamite.\n\n01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.800\nHow blind are you?\n\n01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.800\nHe's blind. I legally blind.\n\n01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.800\nThat's fair. Let's still count.\n\n01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.800\nMake my way up there.\n\n01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.800\nIs that part of the albinism?\n\n01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.800\nIs that...\n\n01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.800\nYou're living with albinism?\n\n01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.800\nAll right, get up here.\n\n01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.800\nAnd someone help him.\n\n01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.800\nI think the stairs are on the other side.\n\n01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.800\nOh, there are stairs.\n\n01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.800\nGeez, what a hero.\n\n01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.800\nLike,

01:17:28.800\nThere's too many groups getting pissed about us playing villains,\n\n01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.800\nand we're actually all villains.\n\n01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.800\nRight?\n\n01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.800\nI have a friend, Victor Varnado.\n\n01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800\nHe was channel 101 guy,\n\n01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.800\nand he cast his villains\n\n01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.800\nlike angels\n\n01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.800\nthat are fallen angels.\n\n01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.800\nAngels or pedophiles\n\n01:17:44.800 -->
