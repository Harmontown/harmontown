00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Zero audio.

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
She turned the night light on a blue kiss.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
He's there back through his dream, play all the eyes.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Hello.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome once again to Meltdown Comics and the NerdMelt Theater.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Guess what everybody?

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
Let's welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you. What a lovely, lovely group of people.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
You seem to be on first impression, at least.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I got my notes.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I got some notes.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Well, of course, we lost a legend today, Philip Seymour Hoffman Tide.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Let's start with that. You should always go with a high-energy opener.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Were you connected to that when you heard the news?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
No, I did, and that's a testament to the fact that how much respect,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I think, that Kai really is worthy of it.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Famous people die, and it's like, we only have a relationship to their fame,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
and they're like, well, he was famous.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Hey, the guy that played Klinger on M.A.S.H. died today,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
and you're like, aw, you automatically go aw, because death is bad.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Jimmy Farr died too?

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
No, no. I didn't mean to upset you, no.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
But I'm saying, I was picking like a random person that's like,

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
well, I mean, the only, at this point, he's just a famous name.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
He's just a name you know.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And then there's people that pass that you go, oh, shit, holy fuck,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
that's terrible that they're gone.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
And yes, I have equated that against the fact that millions of us die every day.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Philip Seymour Hoffman was worth a couple hundred thousand normal people, at least.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
He was a good fucking actor.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm bummed he's dead, even though we all die every day.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I watched a bunch of the footage, the coverage of it,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
and I was, you know, I was bummed out, not that I was ever like, very close to him,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
and I couldn't separate the idea that, are they covering this so much

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
because he won an Oscar, because he's great, because he's a good theater actor,

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
or what, but I was surprised the level of coverage that got.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, I think truly, I mean, this is, no, well, here's my answer to that.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
He won an Oscar because he's great, there's coverage because he won an Oscar,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
he won an Oscar because he's great, he was a theater actor,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
he was a good fucking actor, he was really, really good.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
I watched Capote today, I don't know, I picked a PSH movie to watch to mourn him.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
We rolled into Boogie Nights, but I had to come here,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
but every movie he's in, he makes better.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
He's never been bad, he's just a good actor.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
He's one of those rare actors who doesn't just inhabit characters

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and like, oh, that's amazing, he really seems Russian.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That's a good, that's a type of good acting.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
There's another type of good acting that's like, wow, Woody Allen's really good at being himself,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
even though he's just a writer on screen, like, talking about his feelings.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
That's another type of good acting.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
But, but, but, but Philip Seymour Hoffman puts him, put himself into people who were nothing like him.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
And Capote was one of those amazing, amazing examples.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
You really don't know what you're watching.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
If you, if you see footage of Truman Capote and then you see footage of Philip Seymour Hoffman

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
and then you watch that movie, you really are watching like a miracle happen.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
In my opinion, it's like, he's not, he's not doing a rich little impression of Truman Capote,

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
but he's certainly like talking funny the way Truman Capote did, which I have no idea how you could possibly do that

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
and still emote and there are scenes in that movie and that movie is riveting.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Even if, even if there was a bad actor in that role, I think that would be one of my favorite stories.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
But the camera pushes on him and it's just fucking, only thing that's for sale is him just bursting into tears.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
And it's, it is, it is as amazing as watching a fireworks display.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Now he died, we can, I think, assume from the reports that we have already that it was heroin overdose.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
That wasn't big news. Like Justin Bieber egged some houses. That's giant news.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
This guy was a heroin addict and has kids and is cool.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
No, it wasn't. Well, he was struggling with it. It was like Robert Downey Jr. You know, it was like, we were in his corner.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
He was, he was struggling with it for a long time and that's the, that's the crazy thing about our point of view on drugs in the society.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
You know, it, I find it very strange. He was, Hoffman was, was straight for 11 years or something.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
He battled and battled and battled with it. And we all have to accept at this point.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm not asking the truck drivers listening to feel sorry to shed a tear for the famous actors of the world.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
But we have to accept at this point with Heath Ledger and Robert Downey Jr.

05:15.000 --> 05:23.000
And we have to accept that, that if you're really good, if you're really capable of genuine charisma on camera, and not a lot of us can fill that job,

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
that there's something, there's some overlap between that. And, you know, there's a challenge with, with the stuff.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
And we, so, and we go back and forth between treating it as a challenge and as an indulgence.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
And I, I, I do want to give a special wag of the, wag of the dick to Val Kilmer for his terrible.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Like, I was looking at all the celebrity tweets, you know, is there a new segment?

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Dan Harmon's Wag of the Dick at Val Kilmer. Because every week you're going to wag your dick at Val Kilmer.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm on his case now. I'm got a week after a week, I'm going to find, I'm going to, I'm going to call out Val Kilmer and something.

05:57.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm going to watch him now because, because I was surprised at the amount of class and restraint and genuine,

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
sincere, emotional mourning going on on Twitter by famous people who aren't exactly famous all the time for their tact,

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
their, I don't know, their, their grace. Sometimes if you're famous for being a really good actor,

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
maybe you're a bit of a jackass on Twitter. Sometimes you can be famous for being a jackass on Twitter and do a show at Meltdown,

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
pulling like a hundred people. But the, I was amazed because I was, I scanned down the list,

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
they always do that aggregate story. Hollywood reacts on Twitter to, to screen legends death.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
And I was like, where's the, where's the bad guy? Where is he? Val Kilmer.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
I got, does anybody have his tweet pulled up? I get, it was, it was, he kind of, he did a lot of Prince-like abbreviation.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
Like he, he would, he would, he would spell blue B-L-U. He didn't have time to blue day for the thing.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
It was like, like the idea that, that a, that a good guy had died was about 10% of his 140 characters.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And on the rest of it was crammed in with abbreviations about how drugs are bad things.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Sometimes people feel like they need to escape through them, but you don't need to do that, man.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
You got to keep, you got to keep, keep your strength up. You know, it's like, wow, a little, a little,

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
that's a good time to pontificate about your view on things in the middle of a eulogy.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Pull up, pull up a Val Kilmer tweet right now.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay, thank you.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Tyler in the front row has one for us.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
This is Val Kilmer's tweet. This is a, this is my, my new segment called Tisk, Tisk, Val Kilmer.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Should we get theme music for that?

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Blue Day Spelled Like Blue Ray.

07:42.000 --> 07:59.000
Tisk, Tisk, Val Kilmer, you did something naughty. I'm watching you, you've acted rather hearty.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Why you carry yourself that way?

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Online.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Thank you.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
Blue Day Spelled Like Blue Ray. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. That's auto correct, right?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
He's using a Sony phone.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
You want a blue ray?

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
The phone says, no, it's a blue day, Sam, Sam, Sony 2000.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So it's, it's sick blue ray?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
No, no, no, no.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Val Kilmer says, starts his tweet, blue day.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
But he spells the word blue the way you spell blue and blue ray.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
B-L-U.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
Okay. Or, or, or, yeah, or he's from, uh, uh, Bellevue De Vaux.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Yes.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Jeff was like,

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know, tips and toe, she broke a needle and she can't soap.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm not going to shock anyone with this news. It's Super Bowl Sunday. Jeff came here directly from the drying room.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's been a, it's been a long day.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm drunk.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
You made a face like you were about to not, you were about to say, I'm sober.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Are you sober?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Probably not.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
If I know me.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
But this is a rare day where I'm, I'm relative to you. I'm like, hey, whoa.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah. I'm not, I'm not complaining. I'm not complaining.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Okay.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
You're about to.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
No, no, no, I'm not complaining. I would never complain.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
That would be instant karma so fast. I'm going to be as drunk as you in the next 20 minutes.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm just, I'm just tired.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
All right. All right. This is, this segment's gone way too long.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Read it, read the tweet.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
Okay. Let's, let's start from the top though. This, this segment's called, Tiss Tiss Val Kilmer.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
Naughty, naughty. Where's the Batman?

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
You know it. Not his fault. Just bad casting. That's weird casting.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
And that's a George Clooney's been Batman and even that was swallowable. Val Kilmer?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Michael Keaton?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Michael Keaton.

10:21.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, that's an interesting little groundswell of,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
what was it about Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman that's defensible?

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
His heart was in it. I don't know. He, he, he, he was, he was, he was the size of an actual bat, but he,

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
but he, you felt like he was like, yeah, fuck you, Michael Keaton has Batman.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And like, you, I don't know. I felt like he,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
He's the first guy to whisper in Batman. And you, and you liked it.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Cause he like, he whispered it like it was good.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And he's arguably the best thing about that movie.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
That was, that was in a rare time when Michael Keaton had a license to print money.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
He was in everything. He was Mr. Mom. He was a gung-ho. He was in every goddamn thing.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, let's travel back in time to that day. Like, not, not to the point where,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
where you don't have to give him as much credit as we have to give him.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Like, like he, like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, he was, he was, he was,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Michael Keaton was, he wasn't coming off of Mr. Mom.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
It was, it was, it was weird when they announced that Michael Keaton was going to be in a Batman suit.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
It was weird for everybody, but, but, but, but all the Frank Miller like, like Die Hards kind of went,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
whatever Tim Burton wants, like, like this is, they're making a Batman suit.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Was that his first choice? Did someone say no before Michael Keaton?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Somebody must have, right?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It was Elizabeth Mastrantonio.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
For real? For real?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, a woman.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Uh.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
This won't be one of our more popular segments, but it will be.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It'll have the best mileage.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
It's becoming my favorite already.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's see if this guy's iPhone went to sleep already.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
Now you gotta, Tyler's going to put his biometrics back into it to start it up.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Thank you.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Uh, all right. So here we go.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Blue Day, Philip Seymour Hoffman, ODD.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Not died, ODD.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
O-D, apostrophe D?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
That's correct.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
All right.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
Addiction comes from, that's an abbreviation of from.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
Addiction comes from trying to escape the pain of living.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
We all struggle with this, but drugs, capital D on drugs, never help.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
So that's a good 5% spent on the eternal soul of the man you supposedly respect.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
And, you know, you know, 95% what you've got to say about some fucking bullshit.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
And I just find that within the span of the same tweet, Val Kilmer, I'm just telling you,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
there's no rule book for it, but let me start to write it.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Your chapter one, that's tacky.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
All right. So here we go.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh, thank you for your...

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
That was Val Kilmer.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
And hey, you can redeem yourself, Mr. Kilmer.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
By coming on our show.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
You can come down through the skylight if you like.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And fight me with your sharp little wing-weapon.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
What's your beef with his Batman?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
No, no, no, I don't really have one.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Honestly, I swear, he gave it his all too.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
He was a handsome man at that time.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't know.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I mean, that movie was just a...

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
That was a bad, bad experience for anyone to have to have if you were alive back then.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It was just a bad thing to happen.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I'm pretty sure everybody here was.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, and it was just, you know...

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Nobody here is 12.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
All right, so let's move on.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
We got over that tragedy, but yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Oh, I was... Yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I don't know. Guy was a good actor.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Well-deserving of public mourning and our respect.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And I'm telling you, I mean, that guy is gonna...

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Now, because we take these people for granted.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
National treasures, I would call them.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Go back and watch every movie that has Philip Seymour Hoffman in it.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And now even...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's not like we didn't recognize in fact he was a good actor, but holy shit.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
He's gonna be like a legend.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And it's a shame because he would have been so fucking good for the next 30 years.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's terrible. He was 46 years old.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Terrible, terrible.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Steve Martin tweeted today that he saw him do Willie Lohman.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
And said that it was the best Willie Lohman that he'd ever seen.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
He was that good.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
He was a hell of a theater actor.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I can't even begin to imagine seeing him live on stage.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
You know what I can't begin to imagine, Dan?

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Is a sports corner.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Today is Super Bowl Sunday.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Dan, I know that you saw the big game

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
because you're a big lover of games, big and small.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah, yeah, I need to keep up on all the sports

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
with my seven plasma screens and my sports bar.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Sports Corner!

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Sports Corner, get up, you're sports.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Throw up your hands, make it sports worse.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Gotta get the ball outside.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Gotta put it in the bounds wide.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Sports Corner, gotta do what you see.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Gotta talk about sports, know what I mean.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I got injuries, got athletic yardage,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
got all kinds of things into Sports Corner.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Dan?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Super Bowl just ended probably at like...

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
What a game.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
What a game.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Who did you have favored going into the game

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
before we talk about the result?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, I think that all of us were rooting.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
We thought whether we were rooting for them or not,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
we thought this was a distinct situation

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
of the home team having an advantage.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Well...

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
But they played in a neutral field in New York.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Well, and who's more neutral than you know who?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Then...

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Okay, well, I mean, Dan, I don't have to tell you

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
that it was the Seattle Seahawks versus the Denver Broncos.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, I don't even know.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We'll have to edit that out, it's so redundant.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, exactly.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
But going in, were you a Seahawks guy or a Broncos guy?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I mean, we all thought for...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Look, as a betting man?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Yes.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
As a sportsologist?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Just by the numbers.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Strictly by the numbers.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
As a blueprint sportsman

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
over my toast and jam,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
getting gearing up for the day,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
no matter what I'm hearing about...

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Real quick, just tell me who the teams were again.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
It was the Seahawks and the Broncos.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Okay, yeah, okay.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And where are they from?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Seattle and Denver.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Okay, shit, I feel terrible for even asking.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah, I mean, again, just edit it out.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
It doesn't matter.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Everyone knows what I'm telling you.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
So, yeah, we all felt going in,

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
because the robot part of us felt like

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
it was going to be a Seahawk game, right?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah, because...

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, just because of the boring statistics, Jeff,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
the technical things,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
the things that don't have to do with the human heart.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Yardage, for instance, like the Seahawks...

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
He came into this game with a superior yardage

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and just more completions.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
There's just more completions

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
as seams on paper like butter football.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
If you're a robot.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
But if you look at it from a standpoint of injuries

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
and recoveries of those injuries

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
and March Madness,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
which is a factor that nobody ever...

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
like, because, oh, that's months off.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
March Madness isn't going to matter.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
People forget to put March Madness into the Super Bowl equation.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
So that's, you know...

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
So what we saw today was a fucking clash

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
of the fucking Titans.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Pardon my French.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Were you surprised by the result?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I think we all were.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Were you?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Of course I was, yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
In what way?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Well, I never thought I'd see so much steam

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
coming off of the field.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I was surprised, frankly,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
by the lack of leadership on the Broncos part.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That was a heartbreaker

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
because this is a team that's renowned

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
for its quarterbackery.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Everyone knows that the Seahawks,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
they're like a team of rogues, okay?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
They move as one unit.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
They advance the ball, okay?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You're actually kind of getting close

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
to being accurate, which is amazing.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
The Broncos have always been,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
it's always been about one guy, their quarterback.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Who is?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Stop interrupting me!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And that guy...

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Peyton Manning, you're talking about.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I didn't see the same arm on Manning today.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
What did you see the difference?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I felt like something was wrong at home.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
This is a guy who's usually very strategic.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
He sees a pocket and he delivers to it

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
with no thought about the larger yardage.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
This was a person who was...

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
he was about the amount of downs.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Like, he knew that this was a game of downs.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
The more downs you get, the more yardage you're gonna get.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You're gonna get more downs.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
You thought there were too many thought pockets?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
He's just thinking too much about yardage.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Like, I'm gonna make a big yardage pass.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Instead of like, who'd the old Manning's Peyton's?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Like, he was a guy who would just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
break into the little pockets right in front of him.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Okay, that's a third down. Congratulations.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Now you got more downs.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
You can trade those in for more points in the kickoff.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
That's how you win Super Bowls.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Sports Corner!

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
The Seahawks knew that.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
They learned that, and they knew it.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
They saw the weakness, and they took advantage of it.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Right on the 50-yard line, you can see it.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Did you make a bet in the game? Did you have any money on that?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I put it all on the Hawks.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
What was the wage here?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Did you take the points or the money line?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
A gentleman doesn't say.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
But I will say the spread was two to three.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Took a two to three spread.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
If you bet a lot on sports, you know it's about the spread.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Now, Dan, you're a big football guy.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
So now that the football season is officially over...

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, but now March Madness starts.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Now you're Mr. March Madness. Who do you like in the brackets?

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
I think I'm going to keep an eye on every bracket.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
I think South Division is always the...

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
We make the romantic notion it's going to be about South Division,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
but look at Northwest. Look what they did.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Among the top ten teams...

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Look at the Eastern Seaboard. Among the top ten teams.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Top ten teams, who do you like?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Brackets, Jeff. It's not about teams, it's about brackets and teams.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
But teams exist with East Western.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
North. East Western.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Eastern Seaboard. East Western.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
East Western Division is, you laugh, but after the wild card rule

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
was removed from the brackets,

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
now East Western is going to be one of the big powerhouses coming out.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
You guys laughed about Fox becoming a major network,

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
but East Western Division is going to fucking tear up the Astro.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
While we're on it.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Who do you like in the Oscars? Best picture noms?

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh, you know, best picture, well, you know, people follow their hearts.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm going to go Skippy's problem.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Skippy's problem.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Because, you know, I mean, it's...

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
I don't want to be crass. I'm going to get in trouble for this tomorrow in the press.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
But he's an alien with AIDS.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
People are going to go for that.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
That's going to bring in all the Transformers people and all the AIDS people.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
And when you see, when you see Harrelson's performance, you're going to go,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
like, okay, just get an Oscar.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Why is Harrelson...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Look, I love Harrelson as much as anybody.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Why is he in every movie now?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
He's high.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
He loves getting high and making movies.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
He can do whatever he wants. What would you do?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Did you see 12 Years a Slave? What do you think about that?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah, I love...

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
I thought about the concept of riffing on that,

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
the joke being that I had seen it, and then...

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I don't know, I saw low dividends.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
But she haven't seen it.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
I haven't seen anything. I saw her. I saw her.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I liked her.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Her was good.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
That's one for the ages, yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I love that movie.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
I was not a big Joaquin Phoenix fan. I liked that movie.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I thought it was quite good.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I think he's great.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
What I love about her is that, like, Eternal Sunshine,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
it's these movies where you deconstruct love,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
where you actually get to the heart of it.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
It's like these movies where fucking, you know...

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
19 pairs of shoes and three raisins to do it.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Like, they can be cute sometimes.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Sometimes they can be good, but they're never good.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
What was the log line on 19 pairs of shoes

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
and the three raisins to do it?

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Sometimes Mr. Right can be right here.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
But those movies are...

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
but they are those movies.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
And those movies never have anything to do with actual love,

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
because they formalize love in an attempt to get their story done

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
in a way that people, because they devalue the audience,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
they don't think that the audience understands what love is.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
And it's these movies where somebody that's very lonely

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
and very creative, like, says, yeah, but fuck love.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Fuck love the way it is in these movies

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
and kind of deconstructs it that the surface seems cynical,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
but those are the movies where you actually learn things

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
about love while you're watching.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I mean, I felt myself feeling things,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
watching a movie about Joaquin Phoenix

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
jerking off to his computer.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
It was profound, the things that they illustrated

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
about the nature of relationships

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
and the definition of true love.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And also, yeah, it's nice.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
They removed the human body from the equation,

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
which is an important thing to do

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
if you're gonna get to the bottom of real love.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Because some of you people got no legs.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I've read about you.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Stand up!

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Stop!

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Hey, Jeff, can I tell you something

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I've always wanted to say up on this stage?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
You love cocking your mouth?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Real nice.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I do not have that honor.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Of being able to say that?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Of having a cock in my mouth.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
I could if I wanted.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
You could.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It's certainly within your bailiwick

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
as mayor of Ironman 10.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
All right.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
All right, so...

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
This segment is called...

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Before you tell me,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
excuse me for a musical theme.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
It doesn't matter.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I was all like, you can pick one.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
The segment is called...

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
Seemingly unrelated paragraphs

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
that I say into the microphone

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
in a confusing tense

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
that make you think that I'm not

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
here in the moment in this show.

25:48.000 --> 25:58.000
I'm sorry, say it again.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Say it again.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I think I had the theme for it.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I'm simultaneously trying to

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
memorize the...

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You just say play.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I think I got it.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
All right, you ready?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Okay.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So the segment is called

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Seemingly unrelated paragraphs

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
that I've memorized

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
and I'm going to recite

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
as if I'm making them up.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Well, Jeff,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
the thing about writing is...

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
The thing about writing is

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
it's a life spent throwing messages

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
and bottles out into this darkness

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
and you can see online

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
or through Nielsen numbers

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
that people are watching.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
You can see in forums

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
that people are respecting it

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
but what I'd like to do,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I guess on this tour now that I have

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
no job is get out there

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
and see if any of these people are real

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
and look into their eyes

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
and find out if I've been having any impact.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Did you get that?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
That's a wrap on principle photography

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
for the Harmontown documentary.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
We're liars.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Sometimes we lie.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Dana, finish your movie.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Dana, I don't...

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
I said that on January 2nd, 2012.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I'd like to try it one more time

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
and do it more honest.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Go ahead.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
What?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Say it.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
We didn't get it.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Try it again.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Okay.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
More honest?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's all alive.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
More in the moment.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Oh, more in the moment.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Okay.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
All right.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I mean, all right.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
How do we get you in the moment?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Well, ask me about this topic

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
but we have to change tenses.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
That's the confusing thing.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
We haven't gone on a tour yet.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Do it in the Plue Perfect.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Is that Val Kilmer's Plue Perfect?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Plue.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Dash Perfect.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Just go with it.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Go with it.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I wasn't asking for a suggestion

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
like an improv show for tents.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I was joking and saying,

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
doing it again,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I thought you did it perfectly first.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Okay.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Well, I mean, the thing is,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
the reason we write is because

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
we want to connect with people.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So you sit and you put messages in bottles.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
You throw them into darkness

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
at people that you don't know.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
And then you see that they like it,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
but you see that in the form of numbers

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
or on the internet.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I just want it now that I'm between jobs.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I thought we could go out there

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
and go see if any of these people were real.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
Did I have, was there an impact there?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
God, it just seems so fucking fake.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
That's not why I went out there.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Neil, now I want you to get behind Dan

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and film an audience while Dan says it again.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
But I want the audience to lie too,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
pretend they haven't seen this before.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Because now, if we're going to use this,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
it's going to be in the documentary.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
At least they all get to go,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
oh, we were in that scene

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
when we were talking about bullshit.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
We wrote that together.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
That's all right.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
But I want you guys to look either bummed out

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
or blown away or whatever.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
But now Dan,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
you have to bring the thunder now.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
All right.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
It's like,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
when you're a writer,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
the goal is to be racist.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
And...

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
But I've never met a person that wasn't white.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
So I think the purpose of this tour

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
is to get out there

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
on a team of horses

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
and just find and touch

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
and possibly interrogate

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
non-Caucasians.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Wow.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Wow.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
There's no end to the fallacy.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Neil thinks I'm making fun of the process,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
but I'm not.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I mean, it's a...

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
If you try to make a documentary

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
about me going on the road,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I don't know why I'm going on the road.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
That was like a little chunk

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
that we thought maybe we could use.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Did you get it, Neil?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Got it.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
You got it.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
See you in Austin.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, Berkeley.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Yeah, see you at South by Southwest.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
That's how you make documentaries?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Wait, our documentary's already in the...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
We're already in South by Southwest.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah, yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
He's still shooting it.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
We've been selected.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That means that in the trailer

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
there will be like,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Laurel Leaves around a thing

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
that says selected.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
On our little logo,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
there's Laurel Leaves,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
but doesn't ours already have

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Laurel Leaves around it?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Those are other...

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Not that one,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
but our Harmontown logo

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
has Laurels around it.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Double Laurels.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Double Laurels.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
We're resting on other Laurels.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Interesting.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Anyways, yeah.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I mean, he probably won't use that

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
because you can see

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
when I'm being insincere

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
and I can't do it,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
but I said it on the couch in there.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Said what?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Said the thing about going on the road

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
to touch people.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Say it again.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Say it again,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
but really well while the camera's not here,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
because I'm going on the road

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
to touch people.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
I'm going to get into a tour bus

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
because I'm between jobs

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
and I just want to go out there, Jeff,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
and I want to see if there's faces behind

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
the low Nielsen's

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
and the affectionate Tumblr blogs

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
that I can touch,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
provided their age is above a certain limit.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
And make eye contact with it and say,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
am I a good person even though I'm fired?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
It's a terrible reason to go on a tour

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and I don't think it's accurate.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Was there ever a reason?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Do you know the reason for real?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
No.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
It could be.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
It was just for fun, right?

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Well, I think the reason for the tour

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
is was, it's not usable,

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
but the reason for the tour was...

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Niel, get out of here.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
The reason for the tour was to,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
it had something to do with me, the performer,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
because I had just been fired as the writer,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
so I was just kind of going like,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
well, I don't know,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I just wanted to dive into something that was different,

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
you know, that's all.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't know what beyond that.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
The documentary does a pretty good job of revealing

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
what a gross, weird balloon animal of a person I am.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
I feel like at a real simple level,

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
the idea was that you'd left the comfort zone of this room

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
and wondered if you could find this kind of comfort level

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
in Phoenix and Brooklyn, whatever,

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
and strangely, we found it,

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
because the audience is not any different wherever you go.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Yup.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
And did it make you happier at the end?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Did it change you in any way?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Nope.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Not at all.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
It made you happy.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Yeah, it made me happy.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Donuts make me happy.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I don't know if they're good for me or not.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I don't know if I should deny myself them

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
or devour them for breakfast.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, it made me happy going on tour.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
I think that I am a...

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
I think that I am a...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I will always be an incomplete person.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I hope so, because if you die a complete person,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
then that means you wasted some seconds of your life.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
It would be nice to bring it right into the station.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Complete.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Die.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
But other than that, your life should be spent kind of completing yourself.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I...

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
So I did not get completed by the tour.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I didn't turn into somebody else.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
I didn't suddenly realize halfway through that I should be a vegetarian

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
or that I should quit drinking or that I should value the sunset.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
I think I overcame my stage fright

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
maybe by orders of 5-10% more.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
And I think I also realized that it's too late for me in terms of character arc.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
As a character, that's why guys my age aren't characters on TV.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
They're usually detectives or surgeons.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
They're supposed to have their shit figured out.

34:17.000 --> 34:24.000
And so that's why it was nice to go on the road with Spencer,

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
who still is young enough to be affected by old people.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
It was nice getting to know him and hearing a little bit of him and me

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
and putting a little bit of me into him.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And coming back with him...

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Can you elaborate on that?

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
And coming back with him, I hired Spencer as my assistant

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
and I started that animated show with Spencer

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
and I'm not shoving Spencer into the system,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
but I'm putting him out there.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
We ended up writing a character for him on community

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
and everything continues to be unflappable to him.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Does he deserve it? Will it make him a good person? Who cares?

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
But he's a person too that now can be out there.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I take pleasure in that.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
And I don't get to change.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Fucking old, dude.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
But there was a moment when you got back on community,

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
when they rehired you, you came back here and you had your arms crossed

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
and you sat down and you seemed very poised and vindicated.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
You did change in that moment.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
There was a vindication there and wouldn't that be a change?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But then that's short-lived, right?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Then all of a sudden you're back at the dirty work of...

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Yeah, the same companies that will fire you because they don't give a shit about you

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
will also rehire you because they don't give a shit about you.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
You shouldn't take it as seriously as you do.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
But I'm going to keep doing it.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Could you answer honestly?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I mean, could you even know the answer to this question?

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Would you rather there was another season of community

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
or would you rather there not be one?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
A sixth season?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
No, I can't answer that question because I have to actively...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I think we've already talked about this.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
This is a very strange thing for me.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.000
I have to actively hope for a sixth season otherwise I wouldn't be able to go to work there.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
If you knew there was going to be a sixth season, would that instantly make you happy

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
or would that make you bummed out or worried?

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
It's more complex than that.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
It's like knowing that you have a baby on the way.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
I mean, there's different parts of you that would be like,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
fuck, am I ready for this?

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
Shit, I could have used that trip to the Everglades.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Come on, we've all been there.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
It's just that fantasy of having a kid,

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
but you also want to go on one of those fan boats.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
And what could be more mutually exclusive?

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Knowing you for a long time.

37:04.000 --> 37:10.000
So you say gators is sex is determined by the temperature?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
That's right.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
Keep your babies blanket out of the fan, please.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
You never see that. It's dangerous.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Either pro-creator or explorer America's swamp lands.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Do not try both.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
Knowing you for a long time, it's hard to say whether you're a happy version of you or a sad version.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
You always come off like you're incomplete, there's a sadness to you,

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
but I would say right now knowing you that you're probably as happy as you've been since I've known you.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Definitely, yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
But you don't wear a smile. You're not a smile.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
You don't do bell kicks down the road.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
My whole life is a smile.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
He said frowningly.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
The part you get to look at is the little center part of the smile that's the little kissy part.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
The fucking corners of my life are up by my, up by God's ears.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
I'm part of God. I'm God's mouth.

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
I am God's mouth and I am smiling.

38:15.000 --> 38:22.000
But the part you get to see for 40 years is a wrinkly little snot gutter

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
with gross mustache hair on it.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
You can never tell if it's smiling.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
But yeah, I like that metaphor. I'm going to refine it and blog about it.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
But yeah, definitely.

38:35.000 --> 38:45.000
Yeah, no, because I've got a lot of stuff. I'm always way happier if there's stuff out there that people are experiencing

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
that can somehow, I can convince myself, reflect on my value as a person.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Well, simultaneously knowing that it doesn't.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
But I'm way happier having something on the air than not having something on the air.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
If they were to say, hey, we need to succeed as a community,

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
I'm going to be just as happy as if they say communities canceled, exactly as happy for totally different reasons.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
It's a completely, I'm fulfilled. I get to do whatever I want.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
I get to, I have a fucking giant baby.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
Just like a big pacifier in my mouth and now I'm getting married to somebody who's heard me fart

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
and I got a dog and it's all, it does it like, I'm not tap dancing every day.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
I still got a lot of shit to do, but yeah, you're right. I'm happy.

39:30.000 --> 39:38.000
Why are you applauding happiness?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
That's the one thing that doesn't need, applaud world hunger.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Oh, wait, don't do that. No, don't do that.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
Wait, that's bad. Okay, I know, I know, I retract my question.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
That's why you're applauding it.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
You want to reward it because you want more happiness.

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
They're applauding happiness, but it's so funny when you say you're happy, you make an excruciating face.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I was thinking about their applause.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It was like, why do we applaud people saying they're happy?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
But you frown before the applause.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
You were saying, I frown when I talk. I'm a thoughtful person.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
No, but you don't frown all the time.

40:06.000 --> 40:14.000
You frown more tonight when you said that you're happy and content.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Because it's not a natural state.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
A happy person's natural state is not talking about how happy they are, why they're happy.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
That's not a natural state. So it takes me out of the happy moment to count the reasons why I'm happy.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
That's something that dishonest people do.

40:28.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh, I love Todd so much. He and I, he did the most sweet thing the other day.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
He and I, we went rock climbing because that's how we met.

40:37.000 --> 40:44.000
And he pulled out a tiny rock, the same shape as, and just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
press release about how complete you are as a couple, fuck off.

40:47.000 --> 40:53.000
I'm so amazed. I went to Griffith Park today and I went jogging.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
I just fucking blew out my quads and my delts and I feel fucking good.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
I feel so good. I'm really at a complete place in my life. I don't believe you.

41:02.000 --> 41:09.000
I'm frowning when I talk about whether I'm happy or not because who the fuck talks about that?

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Well, that sounds like you don't, yeah, you're right about that.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
But I feel like part of you is that you don't feel like you're allowed to be happy.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Like you're getting away with something that you're...

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I don't think I'm allowed to say it.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
I think that frowning and scowling and...

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
But if somebody asks you, are you happy, you're allowed to say yes.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Secretly. It's privately. A little more privately then.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I don't think it makes for a good speech.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Like Hitler didn't say, I'm happy.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
He wasn't happy!

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
But he got so much done.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
Oh boy.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
We may actually have to edit that out.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
That just came together wrong.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
I'm so used to using Hitler as a way to make a point.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
I accidentally used him to make a point about happiness.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
Because I don't normally talk about how to be happy.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
Usually grabbing the Hitler tool out of the toolbox works but I was feeding a baby.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I grabbed that Hitler.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Oh no, I'm feeding a baby with a Hitler.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
But now you're smiling more tight about Hitler than you did about your own happiness.

42:23.000 --> 42:29.000
Look at the smile on your face. This guy loves Hitler.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
You hate yourself.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
I'm smiling because it's fun to make mistakes.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Their reaction is fun. We're laughing together.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
And then the odd thing is, there's so many things that we've talked about on this stage.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
Where everybody's been smiling and happy and feeling free and like nothing's wrong.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
And then there's the context issue.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
Here's a recording, here's a transcript of Dan Harmon talking about his feelings about work.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
And it's like, it's all fun. Otherwise I wouldn't say it up here.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I'm trying to make people laugh. I'm trying to make people think.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
I'm trying to make people happy that they spent $10 on something.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I'm not going to...

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
And then it's like, I tend to go to the places where these people are happy.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
And everyone's smiling and interested or whatever.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
But then there's a global context now. It's also fucked up and stupid.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah, but fuck that shit. You're allowed to shoot from the hip still.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
You're never going to stop doing that.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
I'm always going to do that, but I don't want to talk about it that anymore.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
And I also don't want to talk about whether or not I'm happy.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Like it's some kind of press release.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
I understand, but that's a silly thing.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Like Catherine Hepburn was in some interview.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
I want to say it was Dick Cavett. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
And there was a leading question.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Kind of like, do you like Hollywood? Do you like Hollywood people?

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
And she says like, the best people I've ever known lived in Hollywood.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
Like, I love being an actress. I love like, I know you want me to say that I like,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
like fuck Hollywood and their phonies.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It's like the greatest people in the world live in this town.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Like, I'm surrounded by creative people.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
And she can say that, but she knows when she says that, that you sound like...

44:01.000 --> 44:09.000
That's a very unidentifiable thing to say out loud as he just scatters the stage with ice.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
You're allowed to be happy. You're allowed to brag about it.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
But you're never going to boast about your happiness,

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
but you're allowed to, you know, kind of smile and chuckle at your own well-being right now.

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
Well, I think that when you're... I don't know about you.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Well, I do know about you. You're weird.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
But I know that Dino and I, because I've talked to him about this,

44:31.000 --> 44:40.000
when we're really happy, we get in our car and we play like really fucked up melancholy music.

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
Like, if I find out that I've been nominated for an Emmy, and I have...

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
No, not recently. Sorry. That wasn't an announcement.

44:51.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm saying, I know, I'm saying like these experiences where it's like in a biopic, you're supposed to simply just go like,

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
huh, like it's more when it happens in real life when you go like,

45:03.000 --> 45:09.000
I just won this thing or I just achieved this thing or that thing I was working on really hard,

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
it's getting picked up and it's going to go and it's going to...

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
I tend to just like, I seek isolation in those moments and melancholy.

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
And something to do with like the same fact that the way we appreciate food is we destroy it, we'd shit it out.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.000
Our saliva has enzymes in it that break a thing down so that we can use it in a real way.

45:30.000 --> 45:36.000
And I love nothing more if I'm having a really good professional time.

45:36.000 --> 45:45.000
Like, I love to celebrate it quietly but with a drink staring out a window at a Michael Mann Los Angeles skyline

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
and play something really synthy and sad and heroin sounding and kind of like,

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
and definitely not smile if a camera panned around me, the director might go,

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
come on, give me a little, you just got nominated for an Emmy.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
No, this is what it looks like. It looks like fucking like, yeah, whoever would have thought.

46:04.000 --> 46:11.000
You know, you just sort of like slump into it. I'm happy so much that I'm always just doing that.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
That's good to hear. Cause if I was like, if I was waiting tables, if I was lifting crates and stuff and I've had those jobs,

46:16.000 --> 46:25.000
not crates, but like, yeah, you come home and then you go right for the, you grab a beer and you chug it down

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
and you call a friend and you're like, well, let's have some fun. That might be age too.

46:30.000 --> 46:37.000
Like, I haven't done that stuff since that age, but I have a feeling that working a 12 hour shift at an emergency room

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
makes you want to go out and smile a lot. Excuse me.

46:41.000 --> 46:53.000
But like, if you, if you, if you get paid to be in your pajamas for four months of the year

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
and then, and then drink Starbucks and talk about how to make people laugh for the other part of the year,

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
like, and then if also people tell you that you're doing it well, I don't know.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
I don't know how often you'd smile because what's the point?

47:10.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, I think of the times when I felt like when I was really at my lowest and like, when I was really broke

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
and being evicted and like, like things started finally happening for me like with work.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
Like you don't, you don't run out and smile and like call your friends and celebrate you.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
You sit in the corner in the dark and cry like that.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
Some of the happiest moments I've ever had was being completely alone and just like crumpled into a heap.

47:35.000 --> 47:42.000
But you just said back in those days when both you and I were broke, you were being evicted and all that stuff.

47:42.000 --> 47:50.000
We, to correct you on that or, or clarify, we, when we would go out, we were, we were laughing all the time.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah.

47:51.000 --> 47:59.000
I'm saying that the first moment when the moment, the first moment of safety when, when the phone call came in that a job came in,

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
when you were going to be on a show or like work came in, you don't go like, woo-hoo.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
Like, like, like, it's a new way that you use it.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Yeah.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
My knees gave out a couple of times and you just lay on the floor.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Oh yeah.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
And you talk about those moments.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
And you put on sad music and later on when you recover, I called up you and you and I would go out there

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
and then we would sit there and giggle at our fortune because you and I were paying each other's bills for, for a couple of years.

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
Like, we were surviving off of each other's alternate good fortune.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
There, there were times when you and I, I've never seen you or I laugh as much.

48:35.000 --> 48:42.000
But I agree with you in those moments when, when like, when you're really like happy alone, it's not, you're not Jean Kelly,

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
you know, dancing on the street.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
You're, you're in the corner or in your car, you know, like being wishful and melancholy.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Yeah.

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah. And who's crankier than, I don't know, rich people getting what they want.

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
Like, like, they're not, because they're not really experiencing like genuine reasons to be happy.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
Like, I, I, like getting a candy bar when you're starving, that's like a big deal.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
Getting, getting, getting a really good Kobe steak when you can have anything you want to eat.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
Like people tend to go like, Oh, it was a little, it was a little undercooked.

49:17.000 --> 49:24.000
Like you, you still, you enjoy the steak, but the way you express it is with a foodie blog where you complain,

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
you nitpick, whereas the person who is starving and you hand them a fucking Snickers bar,

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
they would like kiss it and like break into tongues.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
Snickers bar! So fucking hungry.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
I've been, I've been lost in the snow. Wolves are eating me and I found toothpaste.

49:42.000 --> 49:50.000
I'm going to eat it. Happiness is like, it's not always an expression of, of, of like satisfaction.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
It's an expression of like going from one extreme to the other.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
It's like that portamento. Is that what they call it?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Slide whistle.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
You know, going sliding from one thing to the other where your, where your fingers are on the frets.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
All right. That's our music segment.

50:05.000 --> 50:12.000
Let's bring out relationship expert, Aaron McAvoy!

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Hello, Aaron.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Hi, how are you?

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah, how's it going?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Good.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Fun show.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah, it's all right. It's headed moments.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
It's headed ups and a lot of downs.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I'm enjoying it a lot.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
I feel very happy.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Well, there's something wrong with you.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
That's how I receive compliments.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
It's called deflection. It's one, it's a, it's a new gateway.

51:00.000 --> 51:08.000
It's like a new Oprah book, like a guy selling a book, like, did you know about deflection?

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Deflect compliments, deflect insults.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
Just repeat to yourself the following phrase.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
I'm rubber.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
Don't worry what they're made out of.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
You're rubber. I'm rubber.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Whatever you say about me bounces off.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
That's it.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Nice haircut. Fuck off.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
Dan, that sounded racist. You parked wrong. You scratched my car.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I don't care.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Have you lost weight?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
I'm rubber.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Have you lost some weight?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Uh, yeah.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
Thank you.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
You're not rubber. You piece of shit.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
Not when I want something to be true.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
What's life like now that you guys are engaged, like around the house?

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Like, does it change any interactions?

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
Well, I have to wash the veil every day.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
I wear a veil every day.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
And you get so dirty, you have to wash it every day.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
You've seen our house and you get a little cluttered.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
What are you doing to dirty your veil all the time?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Well, we're Methodist.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Ah, you do the math.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
Yeah, every morning Dan, every morning Dan baptizes me.

52:24.000 --> 52:30.000
We fill up the bathtub and we write our vows on rose petals.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
But they come from the garden and we don't clean them off.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
And I'm wearing the veil. Baptism gets dirty.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Yeah.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
These are just traditions.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
The garden has our neighbor's dogs buried in it.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
That's the Methodist part.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Yeah.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Did you guys kill the dogs?

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
If they don't die on schedule,

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
that's God asking you to...

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
It's called dog death schedule.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
You know, Methodist.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
The old saying, kill a dog with a knife.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
Be happily married for the rest of your life.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
We're just doing that as many times as we can.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
And we don't want to kill our own dog because we like our dog.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Kill a dog every Wednesday.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
That's the special spiritual friend's way.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
Which is the name of our denomination of Methodist special spiritual friends.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
If anyone's interested, we'll be...

53:28.000 --> 53:34.000
Kill a dog on Sunday night, Monday morning, fuck or fight.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
So that's more of the Appalachian...

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Fuck or fight a dog or another person.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Each other, each other.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
So if you kill a dog on Wednesday night?

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
Kill a dog every Wednesday.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
That's spiritual friends.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Sunday night, fuck or fight.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
If you have a question, there's a pamphlet under your seat.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
If you don't have any questions but just want to leave,

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
there are armed guards at every door.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Welcome to Methodology, we call it.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
You're now Methodists.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Are you guys excited to be married?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Yeah.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I'm excited.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
I would do it tomorrow, but I want the wedding to be...

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Oh, that's nice.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Well, yeah, I guess I would hope.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I mean, it would be bad if you prefer.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Well, hopefully in six months, I'll want this.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I want to make sure the ceremony's good.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
But I also want to...

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Well, spoilers.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Spoilers.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I want it to be...

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I'm going to do a concept wedding.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Who is going to be the...

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Can you say who the officiant is going to be?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
We haven't decided on that yet.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
And we can't talk about that any further.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Yeah.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
There'll be a lot of blood.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
No chomsky.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
No chomsky.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Do you take this woman?

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
So first, let me talk to you about advertiser.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
For indoctrinated or unindoctrinated,

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
to be confined to margins of ideology

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
that are predetermined by an industrial military complex.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Jeff, if you were to officiate our wedding,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
what would be your style?

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Um...

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Jazz.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
You get it.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I would do it in blackface, of course.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Are you asking me to officiate your wedding?

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Is that what's going on?

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
No, I know I am not.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
I'll tell you, my style would be to say no if you asked me.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
But if I were pressed, I would...

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I would do it...

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Fast and...

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Fast and jazzy.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Fast and jazzy.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Lots of tapping.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Oh, well, that would be kind of fun.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
If you came out on, like, a grand piano,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
just started tapping,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
maybe a little spotlight on your toe,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Ben Vereen from all that jazz and a white tuxedo,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
and I would come...

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
And you would forget to actually marry us.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Like, you would do the whole show and then leave,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and then you would go to the parties at the drawing room.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
He just did the last three songs from Cats,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
but he never married anybody.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I do need you to be a groom'sman,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
if you would do me the honor.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
For real?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Well, you saw that coming.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
There's seven bridesmaids and I have three friends.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I would be honored and be quite happy to.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Thank you.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
What are we going to wear?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Spoilers.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't know.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Something blood-proof.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
We're really into Game of Thrones.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
We're Methodists.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Our weddings are different.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
You're doing a red wedding?

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Spoilers.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Someone said nice.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Yeah, I don't...

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I wonder if anybody has...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
For sure, there's been a red wedding.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Like, two huge Game of Thrones fans

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
have fallen in love

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
and gotten married

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
and have had, like,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
a lot of fun.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
They've gotten married

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
and have had, like, at least on some scale.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Sure.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
They've had some kind of red wedding, like, gag.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
And there's some...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
There's Hilda at the wedding

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
who, like, has to be splashed by blood,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
but needs to be a good sport.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Everyone's given a...

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I don't really want to talk about blood so badly.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Without spoiling the wedding,

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
are you guys doing high-concept shit?

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Well, Aaron, when you throw parties,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
they tend towards the high-concept spectrum.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
But I...

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
But I will...

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I...

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I would like my wedding

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
to be, as a good ceremony should.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
It will be a narrative event.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
There will be a story told.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
You will...

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
You will feel like you're a part of something

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
that's more than just the standard story

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
of, let's get dressed up,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
let's go to the wedding, okay, that was a wedding.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Zero...

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It will be a...

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
It will be a high-concept in that regard.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
What will the call to adventure be?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
However...

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Well, none of that.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I can't... I'm not gonna...

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I mean, they're talking about a thing

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
that happens a year from now.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But I...

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
But also, in keeping with my personal

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
philosophies of entertainment,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
the people that come to the wedding,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
they have to not be put upon by the concept.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
They have to just be, like, swept up in it.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
And they can just have a good time

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
with it.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I will be marrying

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
the idea of Dan, and then he'll be marrying

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
the idea of me.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
We'll tell each other about it afterwards.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Mine will be in a pool of blood.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Yeah, it's gonna be great. There's gonna be a good story.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
We're writing the story together. It's a lot of fun.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Yeah.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I like it. We're good collaborators.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
We don't get on each other.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
We like doing stuff together.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I still really want us to write a

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
sci-fi rom-com.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
For the wedding? Or just, like, for a thing?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Just in general, because Dan and I

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
have had several, like, joke

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
arguments about the two

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
genres

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and combining the two. That's all.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Yeah. It's not a fruitful

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
pathway to go down.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
The big bummer about our relationship is that

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
our shared love is

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
getting and eating and watching

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
movies.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
But

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
there's a distinct

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
breakdown in the types of movies we would

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
like to watch.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
And I really...

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I really liked Clueless.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I did.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I thought it was uplifting and interesting

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
and I really... I liked 27 dresses.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I really did.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
27 dresses?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I thought it was charming and sweet.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And we both liked her

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
because that's a sci-fi

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
romantic comedy.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But other than that, we're fucked.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And it's just like

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
we really say mean things.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Not about each other, but just like

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
we just get mean. I just go like

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
okay, yeah, why don't you just type in

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
you know, Paul Rudd

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
gets his groove back

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and I'll just focus

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
on my farming game on my iPad.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And then she's like, well, what if Paul Rudd explodes

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and someone has to jump away

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
in slow motion and then we...

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
we get...

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
like Aaron's

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
thing is that

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
she observed the fact that I honestly

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
do not care if the acting

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
the directing

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
even the writing, if it's kind of bad

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
as long as the things that are

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
happening in the movie

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
have something to do with

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
robots,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
dinosaurs, zombies, explosions,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
spaceships, something... anything

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
really though, like

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
something like happening

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I need a threshold to be

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
crossed. Other than like

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
oh my god, I have to

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
help my boss

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
meet my sister

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
like that should be happening

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
in the background of a real story

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
where

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
where someone's coffee cup has a

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
snake in it, you know, that like

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
if it gets into your brain it knows

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
what you think

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and can tell your friend

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
what you think

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and then snakes

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
start spreading

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
throughout. What's that movie called?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Decaf Cobra.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
No.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Snakes on a Brain.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Snakes on a Brain.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Fuck you Adam.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You've been undone.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
What if there's a movie

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
about two

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
murderous

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
androids? I'm in.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I don't care what you say next, I'm in.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
That's how easy I am.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But what if there is less violence

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
but the two androids

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
are approaching each other

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
in the

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
station

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
just the station

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
but they're holding

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
a bunch of cogs and

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
bolts and stuff and they run into each other

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and they're like, oh no, that's mine.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Come on.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And then they have this like...

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
If Spike Jonze directs it, I'm

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
down.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I'll watch it.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I know you're trying

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
to trick me, I thought what you were

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
trying to do anyway was that you were going to go

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
what if there was a movie about

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
androids that were so lifelike

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
that the whole movie was just them running

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
into each other

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and this takes place

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
in the future when androids

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
have totally taken over so everyone's an android

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and these two androids like

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
one of them has 27 bridesmaid's dresses

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and the other one is...

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That's what she said, she said

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
it's murderous androids but it's not really about

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
violence, it's more about them just

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
workplace drama. But what I will do now

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
because frequently Dan will fall asleep

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and then that's the time when I'll put on

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
these shitty movies and he'll wake up

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and respond to something that's said in the

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
movie and it won't make any sense and he'll be angry

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
when he's watching the movie. When you do that

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
the next time I'm going to tell you that

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Ashton Kutcher is an alien or so fun

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
or a murderous robot and then

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
you'll enjoy it and it will probably make more

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
sense. Because my girlfriend

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
she likes dramas like One Hours

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and we watch Nashville together

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
can we all come into my place and watch

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
fucking Nashville? This show is fucking nuts

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
does anybody watch Nashville?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I'm sad that anybody here has

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
that's the fucking worst

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
my very good friend Chip is on it

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
this show

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
wow

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
nothing is beneath this show

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and yet I have fallen in love with it

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
also we have to watch The Baby, we watched The Baby

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
1973 a film called The Baby

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
anybody?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
no, fucking dig it

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
it's a cult movie

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
we watched it at Schrab's place the other night

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
we should all watch this movie and then

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
come in and talk about it

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
the less said about it beforehand

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
the better but fucking 1973

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The Baby

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
a welfare worker

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
goes to a family that has raised

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
a fully grown

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
man as an infant

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
and so these hot kind of fetishy chicks

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
are changing his diaper

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and he's 25

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
but he's a baby

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and they take his diaper off and then they fuck

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
him at night and they chase him around

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
with a cattle prod

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and it's a very good movie

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I just have this

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I conjured like this

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
childhood

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
memory I have

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
of

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
going to my sister's hospital

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
my sister

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
had a ret syndrome at birth

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and she was at this hospital

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
and

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
there was a lot of

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
retarded people in the hospital

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and I remember

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
uh

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
visiting her as a kid

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and not knowing she was my sister

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
but like we were going to visit her

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and then I just I always have this like

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I remember the smell you know I smell like

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
like if you like it's that

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
diaper smell like every time I smell it

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
kind of like I really get placed there

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
and I remember walking on this linoleum

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and these fluorescent lights and kind of wandering

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
off well people took

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
pictures with my sister

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and uh wandering down this linoleum

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
all way and following the sound of this

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
this weird sound of this

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
person going

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
moo moo

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and uh and then I

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
walked into this room and there was this crib

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
and there was a there was rows

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
of cribs

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and there were adults in all of them

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and I looked into there was a team

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
of like nurses around

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the one there was a sound was coming from

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and it was this guy

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
he didn't have Down syndrome he was just

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
you know there's a lot of ways to be

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
uh developmentally

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
disabled and uh this guy

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
just looked like

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
a porn star he just looked like a guy

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
he just looked like he looked like a

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
porn star because he was naked he looked like

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
he looked like he had a mustache

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
a finely groomed 70s mustache and he had

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
like a hot comb

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
side parted haircut like it just like

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
he would just be a guy that worked where my dad

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
worked but he was in a diaper

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and uh and he was going

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
moo moo moo moo

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
and then they finally gave him

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
his moo moo which was like this squeaky

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
cow cow toy

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and I was just this kid I could

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
just was just wandering in and seeing this

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
it was I don't know if it was

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
traumatizing

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
because I don't when I when I think about it

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
it was

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I'm upset because you just spoiled the plot

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
of our wedding

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
uh all the groomsmen were going to be

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
in the little cribs

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and it definitely stuck with me

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I mean I think I was kind of a sandbaggy

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
way to expose a kid to

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
uh institutionalized mental health

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
like that was not what I

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
maybe needed to see if I was going to

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
grow up to believe in therapy

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I don't know

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm not going to blame

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
blame that on

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I don't know I think therapists are also stupid

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
we should not we should not forget that

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
but also

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I just think of this guy

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
this diaper

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I was like

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
like I don't know I felt like I was like

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
what that guy looks like my dad

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
like why is he why does he want his moomoo

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and and why are they treating him

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
like a baby I mean he's well he can't

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
he's like in a crib it's weird

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
he was like 35

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
so how soon do you want to watch this movie

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
this baby movie

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I don't know

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
uh if you

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
if you had a memory

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I haven't but I haven't

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
consumed it with my ego driven

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
uh mythologization

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
of memories you know the way we do that

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
then my mom said this and then I said that

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and that's why I'm so into

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
purple you know

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and then and then once you've decided

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
that like you kind of like you then you

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
refine it and you're like oh well let's shore

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
up these edges that kind of contradict

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
the fact that this is why I like purple

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
let's make my mom really into red

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and uh that memory

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
is so distinct but I haven't co-opted

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
it in any way that I know of

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
because I don't know how to feel about it

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
it's just so distinct

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
it's like I could I could

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I could draw every tile

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
of that linoleum floor I could

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I could create every

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
every smell if I

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
knew how to create smells

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I know you I know what you're gonna say

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
we both know there's no need to say it

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
if you had a moomoo

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
like if you let's say

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
like something something happened

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
where you you witnessed

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
something really tragic all of a sudden

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and you had a psychotic break

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and you were sent to a place like this

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and you you reverted back

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
to infancy infancy what would

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
be your moomoo what would be the thing that you were

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
calling for all the time

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
vodka

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
but that's different that's not the same

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
but it's not like he cradles a vodka

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
bottle at night

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
the sad thing is it would just be like

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
iphone

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
fofo

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
ring ring ring ring

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I don't know it'd be a picture of you I'm sure

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
let's get Spencer out shall we Spencer

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
hey guys

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I think probably everyone has already

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
forgot this but uh

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
when I was on the academic

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
athlon team in high school

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I wanted to make the name of our team

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
snakes on a brain

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
for real

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
that's how

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
recently you were in high school

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
yes

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
snakes on a plane was in theaters

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I think it just came out yeah

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
that's fucking shocking

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
everyone shut up

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
how old are you Spencer

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I'm 24

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
24

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
what are you trying to

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
nah I'm just casting my mind

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
back to 24

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I think I worked I was

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
dressing I was a drag

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
character at Disneyland at a sketch show

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I was dressing up as a woman

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
for Disney

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
yeah

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
yeah we were at the sketches for Disneyland

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I think they still do them in Frontierland

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and uh yeah I had to

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I was Sally May the ugly

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
ugly daughter of the mayor of Frontierland

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
aww that wasn't fair

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'm sure you were very fair

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I played the mayor and the sheriff too

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
but I frequently would dress up

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
in a big gingham dress and a big

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
curly cue wig

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
and we only

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
the only character is allowed to have

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
men that could have facial hair like stubble

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
because if we were

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
unshaven it was funnier because

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
if we were women and the joke was that

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
we were ugly

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
we had to be really ugly

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
and when women played that character

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
not cool because the joke was that she was ugly

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
so it was funnier if

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
like six foot four guys with stubble

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
played the gal

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I was in a melodrama play

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
like a um

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
the uh gosh what's the

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Dudley Durey type production when I like

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
her collar like in this

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
in Poway California which has kind of a western

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
western history

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
are you from Poway? Oh

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
cool

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
sorry I just have a lot of feelings about

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Poway so I was in this production

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and I was like

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
the female lead

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and I had like a big blonde

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
wig and a ton of makeup

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and that like a gingham dress

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and all that and I thought I looked really

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
pretty and I have a bunch of pictures

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
like I took way too many pictures of myself during this time

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
and the male lead was my boyfriend

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
at the time and I thought it was the best thing ever

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
invited everyone I knew to it even there was the

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
shittiest thing in the world and

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
opening night one of the things I had to do

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
was like go into the front row and like

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
sit on the lap of some man and

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
it would make the Dudley Durey character

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
jealous and I sat on the lap

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
of a man and I heard him say to his friend

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
like get this guy off me

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
because I thought they thought I was

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I was wearing so much makeup

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
that they thought I was

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
in drag which I basically was

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I was in drag I was like

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
looking was trying to look like

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
a really va va va boom

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
woman but boy was that a

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
bummer

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
what kind of dammit

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
why does he need his friend to help him get a guy off

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
of him

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I can't imagine myself ever saying that

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Jeff get this guy off me

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
maybe he was worried his friend thought he was gay

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
and that he was

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
in the closet and he was subconscious

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
no that's actually that's really interesting

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
yeah in the moment he was like

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
that's what he wanted because he knew

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
the words that came out of his mouth couldn't be

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I'm not into this to his friend

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
and if he would have thought I was a woman he would have said

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I'm gonna fuck her later

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
she just sat on me because she wants it

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
yeah and I wanted to I wanted so bad

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I really do I promise I'm gonna get it in her

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
so far in

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
the front not the back

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
and then I'm gonna build a bridge

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'm gonna build a bridge

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
did I tell you the story about

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
this is probably a story I shouldn't tell

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
because I've had a few

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Disneyland Frontierland

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
we would get our costumes

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I think I told this story before

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
we would get our costumes at Disneyland

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
where all the princesses would get their costumes

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
you'd walk in the morning and I was a cowboy

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
or I was a mayor or I was a bandit

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
or I was this Sally May character

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Snow White or Cinderella

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
or Ariel or Esmeralda

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
all the Disney princesses would be in their underwear

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
walking about with their hair and makeup

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
but in their bras

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
and panties on it was just fucking fantastic

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
it was really good

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
and like Ariel's they had a little rack of clams

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
they had a cold clamshell bras

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and like that's like one set of

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
clams is way bigger than the other ones

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and her name was Stephanie I remember

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I was like

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
whose clams are those?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
she's new she's Stephanie

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
she has giant clams

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
she hasn't figured out how to use the clams

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
it's like demolition man

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
wow

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
it's a deep cut

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
so

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
you derailed me

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
you had sex with one of the princesses

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and you wanted to

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
thank you

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
and then Roy Disney

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
he goes from here to here

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
thank you

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
no one's ever fucked a princess like this

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
how did you do that

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I just

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
hey man I'm just doing what I do

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
well you get out here

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
we're giving you the Dumbo Award

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
for elephant trunk dick

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
having

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
for making us believe

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
that a man can fly

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
with his penis

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
we at Disneyland would like to honor you

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Jeffrey Brian Davis

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
please insert this feather

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
here's your free ostrich leg

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
so anyway

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
there was a gal that played Pocahontas

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
for a while at Disneyland

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and she was

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
let's just say the hottest thing on the planet earth

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
more dads took photos with this

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Pocahontas than children

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
she was just like

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
cabalano

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
as Warren Thomas would say

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
she came from the planet Poonani

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and she was just like wow wee

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and the Pocahontas outfit

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
is a bit scant

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
it's revealing

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and she was very sweet

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and young

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
and she came into our dressing room

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
my dressing room was me and two other guys

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
that were in the sketch comedy troupe

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and one of us alternately would be the mayor

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
the sheriff or Sally May

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
the ugly daughter of the mayor of Frontierland

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
so we would be in there and it's always hot

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
because it's summertime in California

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and Pocahontas came in

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
just to say hi and she left

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and my friend Joe

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
was in the cast and he's gay

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and he's very sweet

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Pocahontas left and he just went into song

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and I'll never fucking forget this

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
and this is really bad but I repeat this for

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
no reason

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
the song was

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
because she just left

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and we kind of just left in her wake

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and he went

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
there once was an Indian maid

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
who said she wasn't afraid

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
to lie on her back in the old bear shack

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and let the cowboys tickle her crack

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
but one day to her surprise

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
her belly began to rise

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and up from her country a little red

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
runt with his ass between his eyes

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Disneyland

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
you know that song would have made the

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
the gender issues

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
episode so much more fun

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
why was the child deformed

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
with

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
fuck

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
we can start the questions right now

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I have 30

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I don't know why

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I would say it's the most

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
inflammatory racist thing I've ever

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
heard in my life and it was

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
the fact that it was sung

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
backstage at a Disneyland

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
dressing room made it all the more sweet

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
something to do with the fact that

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
she made love by letting them tickle her crack

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
so he had an ass between

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
his eyes because that was his identity

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
she said she wasn't afraid to lie

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
on her back in the old bear shack

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
my question is what's the bear shack

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I figure that's just where you cure

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
your pelts

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and it's where you it's a place that

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
you think is bill knows what I'm talking about

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
or a beef beef I'm sorry beef

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
beef beef god beef steak beef god

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
just bill oh he's a beef god

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
well you know he's he's

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
graduated he took his abuse one day

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
just be bill he's galvatron now

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
but no you're a

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
you're a woodsman in a

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
you have to cure

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you have to cure

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you gotta cure hides and stuff

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
what would you say a bear shack was

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
would you

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
if you were an Indian made be afraid

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
to lie on your back in the old bear shack

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and let the cowboys tickle your crack

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
or if you thought that they were gonna kill you

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
if you didn't let them do it

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
yeah okay

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I'm just kidding but I like

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
the reaction I got

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
the song has troubled me for a long time

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I'll

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I'll reverse the sexism when I was

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
when I was in college me and my

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
me and a friend of mine would go to

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
the local mall and

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
walk outside of the Amber

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Crombie and Fitz where the male models were

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
and just laugh

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
did you sing a song about them?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
there once was a guy named Todd

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
who had a giant rod

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
he took off his shirt and

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
sat in the dirt and got a job

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
at Amber Crombie and Fitz

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
it wasn't a popular song

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
that's the first time it's ever been sung

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
so are you two a rhymes game?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
yeah yeah yeah

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
it's a

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
it's A-B-A-B-C-4

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Spencer do you know any rippled nursery rhymes

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
or tunes? that's a weird

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
line to bring me in on

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
there's a lot of rhymes about you

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
because when you were born isn't it true

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
that your balls were bigger than an

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
adult? yeah but the problem with that

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
is uh okay so it's like

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Spencer was born

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
his balls as big as oranges

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
then you stop you can't go any further

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
nothing rhymes

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
didn't you see your balls as big as a human

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
heart or something like that before?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I'm sure yeah that's I think my dad said

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
that

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
to a more regular size of that

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
are your balls still as big as oranges?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
well I mean most of the time

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
they're down there just normal size

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
but they can occasionally

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
assume orange

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
yeah they get they engorge

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and grow fur

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
really? yeah really

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
on the full moon

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
he has

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
like can throw

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
in this

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
testicles

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I was close

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I'm just trying to think

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
where wolf is where the

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
where part is actually the man part

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
but we often make the mistake of going

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
oh I'm like a where soda I turn into

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
a soda no that's

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
no that would be right

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
yeah right?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
if you said I was a

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
soda wolf that'd be more suspect

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
right

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
where soda

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I mean nothing bad happens

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
but it's dangerous depending on where I am

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
remember Conner

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
remember Conner's conundrums

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
shit wow whatever happened to that kid

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
you think he like went basketball diaries on us

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
after we stopped using his

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
conundrums? someone tried to rob him and he said

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
would you rather

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
keep robbing me

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
or have

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
a wing on your butt

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
and the person was like

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
that's a terrible conundrum and he's like

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
that's what harm it don't say

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
he just ran off into the night

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
now he's under a bridge

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
warming his hands over a coffee can

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
next to some guy named Duke

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
a nice guy, a guy who's seen the

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
ropes under that bridge

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
telling him about all the other people

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
that over there is rosy

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
you don't want to talk to her about her baby

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
he doesn't know the ropes but he's seen them

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
he doesn't know the ropes of

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
non homelessness is that what you mean

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
he said he's the guy that lives under the bridge

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and he's seen the ropes

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
it's a rope bridge

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I told you I'd get his drug as you before though

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
alright

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
so let's uh yeah

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
what do you think about Dungeons & Dragons

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
or do you hate it

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I enjoy it

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I like playing magic the gathering a bit more

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
that's a surprising reaction

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I've never played that briefly described to me

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
okay so

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
you know how in D&D you fight but most of the time

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
you fight with swords like if you're a wizard

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
you'd be fighting with spells

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
so the point is your wizards

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
that are using spells to kill each other

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
and the spells might be oh I summon a goat

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
or it might be I shoot fire at your face

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
so basically that

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
you get strategy based

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
they're just the two

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
just goats and lightning bolts

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I don't like it you know what I like about D&D

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I don't know if you've noticed is the yelling

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I like getting in

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
verbal fights

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
you like getting inflamed for no reason

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
yeah

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
no reason

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
yeah sure so sometimes

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I'll fly on the handle if someone suggests

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
that the definition of friendship is not eating

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
my face

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
god damn it

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
anyways I was not here for the mature

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I heard it was quite funny

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
and I did not hear the D&D

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
what briefly went down

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
let's see

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
he attacks and then you guys

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
attacked him back and

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
what's with this informal bullshit

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
should we start it up properly

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
real quick before you do that

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
hey have you heard of starbound

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
yeah it's you know

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
yeah

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
can I get it already

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
or is it like not out yet

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
oh shit really

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
is it like minecraft where you get it

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
let's just cut the show off now

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
it's all run and play

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
yeah no it's made by the creators of terraria

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
except it's more space based

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
there's more world exploration

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
is it 2D like terraria

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
yeah yeah bits and blocks

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
that's what they call those games

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I mean I like the immersiveness of a 3D environment

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Spencer

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
there's subtleties of sprite based art

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
but you know

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
one person does

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
but I can play it on a Mac

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
yeee

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I don't know

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
there you go

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
let's bring that guy up

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
nope

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
one more question

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
about starbound

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
uh huh

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
can I pay for it

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
without having to get a paypal

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
because it's on jagoff account

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I mean probably who cares man

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
steam

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
see there's a lot of these credit cards

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
well I don't

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
alright I'll deal with it at home

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
also should I clean up my garage

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
it's fine

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
it's pretty bad

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
wait how do you know about the spiders

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
how do you

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
how do you think they got there

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Adam Goldberg just mentioned the spiders

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
and suddenly I freaked out

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
the garages have spiders

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
oh well we have a

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
oh I've talked about it I'm sorry

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
you should genuinely panic that Adam Goldberg

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
had been in our garage

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
so note that

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Adam

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I love that I'm really through you

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
you're like wait a minute Adam's been in our garage

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
like he's just down there just hanging out

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I like that

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
we have a lot of spiders

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
but anyway

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
what

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
oh shit

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
last time on Harmontown

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
our heroes had journeyed down an

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
ice hole and found a hissing skeleton

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
named Lenev

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
they had complex and disturbing interactions

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
with the skeleton setting him off

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
on a path of violence

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Lenev choked Sharpie but

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Sharpie shot back with a burst of electricity

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
staggering the dead man

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Mulraine caught fire

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
with her amulet of summer

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and grabbed Lenev's arm

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
while Quark cut said arm off

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
the wounded skeleton

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
began to transform

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
growing two new arms

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
and attacking Sharpie with his new limbs

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
the party changed tack

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Mulraine reattached Lenev's arm

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
while Christopher rubbed meat on it

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
together they fashioned a paper hairpiece

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
for Lenev's skull

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
which stopped him dead in his tracks

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
they quit fighting

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and joined hands and strolled off

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
down the path towards Tormod

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
the city of Unshackled Dead

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
that's pretty much it

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
so we made friends with him

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
which I think is pretty admirable

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
you made friends with Lenev

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
yeah

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
and you reattached an arm and gave him a toupee

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
that was just sort of a gesture

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
some of those guys, yeah

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
we had cut off his arm and then we reattached it

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
we had some meat that we rubbed around it

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
because we thought that what a skeleton

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
enjoys having meat on his arm

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
made sense to me at the time

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
but more importantly

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
this was the thing that sealed the deal

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
we started making him construction paper hair

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
because I think

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
that even when he wasn't a skeleton

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
he maybe was bald and was insecure about it

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that's a speculation

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
that's not canon

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
but we are now his friend again

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
and

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
you re welcome

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
did we find the

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Teregon of Virtue

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
what the fuck was it called?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
no, we re off to the Terra Tor

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
to Tormod of Tor

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
so now we have Lenev

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
with us as a

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
because Christopher is possessed

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
and we want to cure him

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
wherever he is

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Lenev, how far off is Tormod of Tor?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
oh, it's like a couple minutes

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
we re just, yeah

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
what do you mean wherever Christopher is?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
is he here?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
there's a character she's on the table in front of you

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
oh shit, I just got told

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I guess he is here

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
okay, Christopher is here

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
he's still tied up by that muzzle

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
yeah, three minutes off is what I answered your question with

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
time passes

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
oh yeah, it does

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
as time passes you pass by broken gray pillars

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and piles of glittering black glass

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
shattered razor sharp fragments

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
that are strewn about the dusty ground

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Lenev speaks

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
he says, as I was trying to say before

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
all that happened

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
the unshackled are generally peaceful

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
but down here there's more crawling around

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
than just Tormod of Tor's own

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
you know, citizens

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
the chained ones still shamble around

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
their mindless horrors that seek not

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
but to snuff out the life

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
of anyone

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
be on your guard because the chained ones

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
hear no reason like me

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
so there was no route

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
that took us around to this area?

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
no, they were...

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
yeah, they're all around everywhere

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
they're everywhere, there isn't a big circle

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
around where we're going

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
they don't just...

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
this is going nowhere

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
they go wherever life is

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and you guys are full of it

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
oh, you meant...

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
are we close to Tormod of Tor?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
yeah, couple of minutes

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
okay, Jesus

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I say we keep running

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
and avoid these chained ones, you guys

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
let's pick it up

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
gentlemen, gentlemen

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
as we're running, may I ask you

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
how are you guys feeling

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
about this whole quest in general

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and emotionally

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
how are we doing

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
are we...

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
how are we feeling?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I feel pretty good

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
72 HP

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
no, but how many...

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
is that hit points or heart points?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
really? 72

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
holy shit

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I'm fit as a fucking fiddle

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I take my knife and stab him in the thigh

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
what the fuck?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
look, I just want to talk

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I defend myself in a violent way

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and I take out my mighty greatsword, period

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
oh, shit

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
look, you just attacked me with a knife, Jack

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I'm all right

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
sorry, look, I...

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I acted impulsively

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I know, now where the fucking daggers are drawn, motherfucker

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
look, at the end of the day, what matters is...

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
what matters right now is you fucking

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
pulled a knife on me and tried to stab me

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
that's what matters to me right in the moment

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
spit in his face

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
talk to me

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I was talking until you fucking

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
pulled a weapon on me

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I'm a barbarian, I'll fucking bleed you

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
real slow

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I thought today would make you weak

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
we got more than five feet

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
we were about to until she fucking

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
tried to stab me

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
we're running, we're running

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
now we're fucking fighting, what are you doing?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
all right, I'm sorry

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
so you don't stab me?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I won't stab you, I take my eyelashes

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and I flutter them over his wound

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
or where it would be, because I didn't stab him

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
all right, let's go

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
make her walk in front of me and I have my

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
great sword drawn just in case she gets

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
fucking weird again

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
is homicide contagious around you people?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
you don't do things that make

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
sense

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I didn't provoke that in any way

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
you're boasting about your hit points

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
so you stab a person?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I'm not justifying anybody

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I feel really good, I'll kill you

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
come on guys, let's get to Toll House

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
as long as we're giving notes

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
as long as we're giving notes

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
if there's a place and then outside

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
the place is there's a place where there's a

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
bunch of monsters, unless they exist

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
in a fucking circle around

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
the place, there's got to be a way

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
around

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
you've taken us through the unshackled

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
telling us they're

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
monsters

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
it's a dangerous world, man

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I don't know what you want me to do

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I'm not worried about anything except for

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
possibly more rain because she's

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
schizophrenic

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
it's true

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
let's go, but if there's an encounter

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
it's on you

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
okay

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I've got 72 hit points

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I get a little twitchy

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
but I calm myself

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
okay, so you continue down

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
the path, you see

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
a destroyed, blown out

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
kind of hut, you see the roof

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
of the hut and then the walls are kind of

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
just falling onto the floor

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
its top just collapsed

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
then you go by a broken fence

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
it's just like a fence, but it's all broken

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
it doesn't work

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
to keep stuff out of places

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
should we check out the hut

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
yes

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
let's check out this hut

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
if you want to check out that hut, you better be on your guard

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
because those unchained ones

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
they go in huts sometimes

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I use my stealth

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
and I creep

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
towards the hut

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I vote for no hut

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
but

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
if you're a hut lover

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I think I may be a hut lover

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
do you have stealth or are you a stealthy person

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
yeah, I have stealth, yeah

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
anyone can be kind of stealthy even if they don't have

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
you don't have to take that away from me

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
will you come back if you see anything hazardous

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
no

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
yeah, you know, if there's something hazardous

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I will

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
use my boots

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
of spry springing

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and I will sing a special song

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
and you'll know it when you hear it

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
there once was an indian man

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
alright

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
try not to judge me for singing it

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
so you creep towards the hut

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and you hear the sound of

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
maybe like chomping

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
and gobbling probably

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
those sounds

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
you don't see anything

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
but you

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
now you do see something

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
you see the roof of the hut kind of shaken

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
shimmy

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I don't know what huts do

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
they don't dance

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I guess not

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
it's definitely shaken though

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
scoops

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
there once was an indian man

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
okay, let's go

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
let's keep going

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
who had a crack

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
it was very

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
we should just keep going

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
okay, they walk on ahead

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
but I walk around the back of that shack

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and I put my ear up to the wall and listen to the chomping

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
it's louder now

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
because your ear is closer

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
can I see through? nope, it's just the roof

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
there's not even any way to like get in

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I kick in the back wall of the hut

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
what in the fucking Harmon

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
he gets 72

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
you kick in the back wall of the hut

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
and it just kind of crumbles to pieces

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
as if it were like wet rotting wood

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
which it's not

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
it's like some sort of sheet metal

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
that's weird

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
anyway, you see it's a zombie

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
it's a zombie naked

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
and full of flesh

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
his mouth is just gaping open

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
full of flesh, he's trying to chomp on it

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
but his mouth's broken

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
he's like got a broken jar or something

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
flesh

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I take my great sword and slash at his neck

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
okay

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
you sure do

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
you cut it clean off

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
he's not too

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
yeah, he's dead

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I wipe my sword on the ground

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I look around

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
you cut to me

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
and Lenev just hanging out in the snow

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
oh

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
and I go

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
so uh

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
is there a Mrs. Lenev

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
no

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
alright now you can come back to Jeff

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I examine the hut

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
it's just like you see

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
two corpses now there was

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
what corpse in a zombie but now there's two corpses

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
one's half eaten

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
there's nothing else in the hut?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
no, it's just a roof really

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
it's just a roof on the ground

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
alright, I fuck both of the corpses and I run back to the

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I run back to our campaign

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
and let them know what happened

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
do you fuck them like till you finish?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
no

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
now it's just kind of cursory

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
it's just kind of like

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
it's like what the cursory thing that I do

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
well the kids have a thing called teabagging

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
on the multiplayer games

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
they teabag each other

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
multiplayer shooters

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
you crouch over the face

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
of your victim

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and it's symbolic that you're teabagging them

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
no, I actually

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
fuck them

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
no, I'm just saying like you just

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
you're doing a thing that it's not a sexual act

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
it's an act of anger

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I generally enter any combat situation with a mild

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
direction and so I

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I'm like the Comanche of old

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
where I enter war

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
with a certain amount of chimescence

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
and I look

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I'm not saying I'm a good person

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
that if it ain't broke don't fix it

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
so I fuck most of my

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
most of my

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
thwarted foes

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
do you have any more questions?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
how are you feeling?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I feel great until you tried to stab me earlier

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I have 72 hit points

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I run back up to the group

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I go kill the zombies, I fuck a couple people

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
but everything seems to be cool

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
oh did you meet Jerry?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
no, I run back to the hut

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
you see a half

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
eaten corpse and another corpse without a head

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
are you called Jerry?

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
you get no response

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I run back I go no, I didn't meet Jerry

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
no, I might have

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
fucked Jerry, but he didn't have

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
a lot to add

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
whatever

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
who's Jerry?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
he's just a friend of mine

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
did he look like a guy and I describe the corpse

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
uh

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
no

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
who's Jerry?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
you just ran off for about two minutes

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
to go fuck something?

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
no, I heard some rumbling

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I thought there might be some bad things going on

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
there was, I killed a zombie, I fucked them both

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
as a skeleton, are you friends with zombies?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
yeah, yeah

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
is Jerry a zombie?

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
yeah

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
okay, full disclosure

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I might have killed Jerry and fucked him

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
well

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
you describe Jerry

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I mean, you describe someone that's different from Jerry

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
okay, I describe the zombie that I killed

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
you already described that

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
or I thought describing the corpse he was chomping on

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
either way, not Jerry

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
sorry, sorry everybody

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
that's good to know, so in the future, if I see a zombie

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
these might be your pals

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I guess

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
alright, that's good to know

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
if I see any humans, are they your pals?

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Sharpie?

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Sharpie, leave it

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
leave it

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I was certain you were going to hear that, it's a weird

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
passive aggressive threat

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
no, it's not a

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I'm not insane, that's just a

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
that's a poignant observation

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I start running towards Timberland

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
termite of torque

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
you run down the path

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
and it's pretty dark, but as a health elf

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
you can see a little bit

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
you see a crumbling gray wall

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
it's massive and imperious

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
except it's

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
cracked in many places and you see

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
it's attempted to be plastered a bunch of times

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
there's all sorts of plaster patches

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
in the middle there's a big

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
giant wooden gate but it

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
looks all

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
rotted

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
rotted gate

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
rotted but intact?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
yeah, it's definitely still standing

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I go up and I kick the gate

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I'm going to kick and moot

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
you kick the gate and

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
your foot just sinks right through

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
it's not even satisfying, you just get

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
your leg kind of stuck in the wood

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
before you extricate it

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
either they don't understand architecture

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
around here, something bad has happened

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
it looks like they live in

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
a neighborhood of zombies

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
so

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I think this is a community

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
besieged by the undead

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
yeah

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
and I light a cigarette

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I get really close to you

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
and I suck in the smoke and then blow it back

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
in your face

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I think we established 10 minutes ago

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
that I'm schizophrenic so this is my new thing

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I take a cigarette out of his mouth, I blow a smoke ring

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
and I fuck the smoke ring

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
but while I do it, I make eye contact

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
with both of them and it's sort of a

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
weird warning

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
hey Lenev, is there any danger if we call

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
out?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
no, no, in fact I will

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
open up, you there

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
my idea to call out

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
hey everybody

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
open up

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
just me out here with the idea to call out

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
my idea first

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
call it out

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
bothered to get a quorum about it

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
was punished for it

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
yeah

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
it's just that

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I usually say that

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
well

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
there's a new skeleton in town

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and it's under my body

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
a Lenev

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
he pounds on the door a bit lightly with his

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
glowing hand

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I pound on it the same time

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
open up, open up

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
for Lenev, saying it louder

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
he takes two or three steps back

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and slowly the gate

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
doors start to grind open

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
open sesame

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
but as the gate

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
is open, you see

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
the top hinge of the right door

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
it buckles and cracks

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
and you see the door start to crumble and fall

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
on to you guys

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
towards it

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
it's falling on you

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
backward summer stop

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
okay

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
you're all taking reflex

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
saves

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
backward handspring

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I start clapping

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
wait

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
instead of dodging out of the way

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
she's lost her mind

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I start clapping but in my head

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I'm clapping so hard that the air is gonna

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
push away

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
the door

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
while I'm doing my reflex save

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
backward handspring, are you having a stroke

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
no

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I'm not, I'm saving us

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
alright

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
okay so

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
the two of you dodge out of the way

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
and Mulraine as well as Lenev

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
get hit by this door

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
so you're saying standing there

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
and clapping didn't work

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I guess not

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
but you're saying Lenev being a big know-it-all

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
didn't work

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and what

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
well he still got crushed by a door

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
even though he was a guy who knows when to shout

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
and when to knock

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
you're so defensive

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
so anyway the two of you

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
the two of you guys that I mentioned getting hurt

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
get hurt, you take 23 damages

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
huge portions of wood

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
just smash onto the floor

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
you're kinda pinned, you're both kinda pinned

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Jesus Christ

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
alright I start

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
doing this

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I start moving like a word

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I try to roll

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I try to roll out of it

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
hold on

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
you might go into shock

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
eat snow

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
and save your urine

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I open the door fellas

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
you can pull me out

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I run back up to them and I take the wood

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
from off of them to

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
save them from the pile of debris

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
alright that happens

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Lenev looks kinda banged up

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
but he pulls himself up

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
you alright buddy? you look

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
like a skeleton

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
that's normal

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
alright well

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
there have to be some sacrifices for us to win this fight

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I vote for Lenev

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
just kidding buddy

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
what do we see before us in this doorway

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
the doorway opens up

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and inside you can see

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
smaller gray huts

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
like the one you saw but less destroyed

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I guess some of them are destroyed

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
you see tons of undead creatures

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
just kinda hobbling about

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
like zombies on a hunk of meat

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
but they're moving around into frenzy

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
on a hunk of meat butt?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
like a hunk of butt meat

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I'm sorry

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
but they start thronging about

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
moving their hands and their feet

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
and all of their bodies really

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and they start erecting a large

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
a large stone statue

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
of a, it looks like a knight with a skeleton head

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
but it's about 40 feet tall

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
they pull it up to the

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
pull it up to erection

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
they just build it in front of us?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
while we're standing there

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
do they do it in fast motion?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
no there's a couple larger chunks

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
it's impressive how fast they are

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
don't get me wrong

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
don't let me underplay that

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I say to Lenev, is one of these guys Jerry?

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
are these guys your friends?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
yeah these are the people

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I mean not my friends

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
they're just citizens

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
how should we approach them?

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I mean like you would any other regular person

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
perfect I've made these bracelets

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
that's impressive

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I'm impressed by those bracelets

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
thank you so much

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I'll follow your lead

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I do one of those road warrior whistles

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
the two fingers

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I can't do it in real life

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
yeah

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
you know like while they're

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
while they're assembling their statue

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
you hear off camera

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
and then they, I would hope that they would

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
all look over and you would whip pan over to me

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
and I would go

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I don't know something Pixar-ish like a little help

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
or

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
got milk

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I mean a whip pan?

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
a whip pan, like the camera

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I don't make that choice

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
oh you don't want it to feel like

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I like the tension building

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
of a slow pan maybe

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
well at any rate I whistle to get their attention

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
and I say like

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
we have a cursed friend here

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
possessed friend

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
we were hoping to get some aid

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
we need the tarragon of virtue

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
a couple people look over but

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
they go back to their stuff

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
he's like yeah they're working

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
they're building stuff

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
regular folk they don't know weird stuff

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
about tarragons or virtues

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
we're gleaning all this

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
from their behavior no this is what Lenev is telling

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
you guys you're saying those things

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I say to my friends look fellas

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
let me take care of this

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I undo my hair

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I whip it around

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I take out an arrow

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
and I take the feathers from the arrow

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
and I stuff them in my mouth

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I walk up to the

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
zombies that have erected the statue

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
okay

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
hello

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
they're not

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
cats

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
hey guys

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
me and my friends

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
are looking for a little something

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
called the tarragon

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
of virtue

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
and I take my finger

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
and I rub it from the top of my

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
forehead all the way down

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
to

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
my shoulder

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I do a camera take

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
those things happen

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
yeah

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
so you say those things

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
and the zombie just kind of looks back at you

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
and hisses

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
alright I go back to the group they don't know where it is guys

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
alright Lenev

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
is this some kind of healer

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
or cleric kind of zombie

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
in this town

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
no we don't need much healing to be honest

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
we just kind of

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
our bodies knit themselves back together

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
yeah I got a lot of hit points

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I think

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
don't say that she'll try to kill you

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
oh I think the undead are

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
metaphor for Canadians

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I look around

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I look around the room are there any doors

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
in this room

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
you're outside

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
well in the walls

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
you came in there's a bunch of these

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
dwellings these small dwellings

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
but you're not really seen anything sizable

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
really

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
but Lenev's like you know

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I brought you here to see the bone sages

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
let's go there

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
do you really want to talk to these guys

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
definitely okay to do it

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
so

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
he brings you through

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
some places he winds you down

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
to path turns left to the hut

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
turns right to the hut he gets you to

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
it looks kind of like a church

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I guess it's yeah it's just a church

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
he brings you to a church

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
there's large stone steps

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and he leads you up the steps

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
and inside you see

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
three tall skeletal figures

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
they're draped in a gauzy

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
robes that are all sorts of weird colors

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and they're standing in front of

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
a bunch of broken piles

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
of golden bones they're just

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
standing in front of them

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
there's three of them there they're just

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
standing at you

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Lenev goes in and starts

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
gesturing and hissing

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
and saying all sorts of stuff

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
you don't really get it

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
he's talking in skeleton talk

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
yeah

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
he's doing that for a bit

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
he's singing to these guys

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
yeah he's talking to them

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I yell out

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
are you the bone sages

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
they all look at you and he stops

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
hissing and the three of them look at you

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
we are the three sages

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
of tormod tor

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
yes

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
we come in search of the tarragon of virtue

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
to save our friend oh that's impressive

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
well thank you thanks

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I'm

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
mullerine sedona

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
she's going through a lot of

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
emotional stuff right now

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I'm sharpie Buttsalot

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
from the Buttsalot tribe

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I'm a sorcerer level 6

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
if that means anything to you

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
nope

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
the three introduced themselves

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
they say we are the sages

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
the first one on the left

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
he goes I am tor

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
and the second one goes I am mod

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
and the third one goes

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I am also tor

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
which one's the bad boy

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
probably the second tor

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
he's the one that's going to trash

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
the hotel room you know when they're on tour

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
right he's got something to prove

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
yeah he wants out

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
we need the tarragon of virtue

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
we'll pay any price

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
within reason

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I take my finger from my forehead and my shoulder

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
and I say any price

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
wait say that again

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
okay

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
great I'm glad I get to say that again

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I take my finger

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
from my forehead to my shoulder

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
and I say any price

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
what is the forehead to the shoulder thing

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
it's a call back

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I didn't get it the first time

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
what does it mean when you rape things

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
it means I have a lot of issues

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
right right right my thing probably

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
means the same thing

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
more arbitrary

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
my metric for what's sexy

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
has gotten messed up somehow

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Mulraines

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Mcathies is on point

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
so the sages

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
they look at you saying those stuff

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
and then to answer your question

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
that was posed

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
the tarragon of virtue is a rare and magical herb

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
and only grows

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
in the unfiltered sunlight

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
on the floating isle

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
of paradise where mortals

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
dare to tread

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I'm sure they do dare to tread there

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
it's called the isle of paradise

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
where is this island

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
ever since the dawn of time

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
paradise has drifted high over the earth

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
shedding radiance and life

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
onto the ground so that

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
all life could flourish and grow

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
there it lied to this day

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
it's heaven you guys

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
I mean no

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
that's a different plane of existence

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
can you can you ferry us there

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
no

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
oh whoa

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
for a guy that's got nothing but

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
information you sure are touchy about

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
requests for assistance

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
the undead can't go into unfiltered

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
sunlight on paradise are you

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
kidding man

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I don't work here

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm sorry

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Leviathan is the paradise island

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
is it on the same

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
plane that we're on

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
right now or is it

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I missed that did you say it was on a different plane

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
or it's just above us

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
they look at each other for a bit and one of them

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
goes

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
yeah it's a floating island

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
it's up in the sky

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
okay thank you

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
alright obviously we're idiots

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
is there a way we

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
we're not afraid of unfiltered sunlight

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
you knuckleheads how do we get there

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I don't know

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
are there any are there any

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
do you have a map

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
do you know if anyone with a ship

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
with air power

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
no

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
do you have a really tall ladder

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
yeah

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
oh oh

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
is it tall enough to reach the isle of paradise

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
no that would be ridiculous

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
has anybody ever been

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
to the isle of paradise

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
not us

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
again we can't go there

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
that's the only place that the

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
terragon of virtue exists

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
the only place that we know

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
can we leave you with a singer

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
songwriter who's been possessed

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
by demons

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
no no no

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
lenev's yelling and spitting

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
he's all angry

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
he's like what is this bullshit

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
you're just gonna tell him

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
tell him everything he wants

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
they tried to kill me

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
and I

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I demand a shackling

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
lenev lenev lenev I take my finger from my forehead

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
to my shoulder and I do it over

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
and over again wait what the fuck is going on

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
what are you talking about

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
what do you think I'm just gonna forget you cut off my arm

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
you just glued paper to my head

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
that doesn't erase anything

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
what the fuck you let you let us here

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
so you could finish our dispute

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
we were finishing it in the snow

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
what yeah the glued paper

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
to your head was our consolation

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
like we were saying we stopped

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
the fight and said let's be friends

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
so you're gonna punish us for that

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
no I'm gonna punish you for cutting off my arm

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
we reattached it

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
again yeah

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
we put meat on it

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
after all of that

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
we were fighting you in the snow

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
we stopped fighting you

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
then you took us here now you want to start fighting again

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
yeah that was my whole plan

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
lame

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
your lame skeleton

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I wouldn't

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
oh yeah you admit it

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
you admit your lame

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
so he's lame

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
he said it

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Sharpie Sharpie

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Sharpie offer him this

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
and I hand him a bracelet

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
here's a bracelet

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I don't want that

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
I want your souls to be shackled

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
how tall is Linnef

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
five feet tall

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
okay I go up to him

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
and I get him in a headlock and pull my great sword around his neck

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
and say

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
you'll give us what we want or I'll

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
sever your head

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
fuck face alright

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
and you know it won't end there Linnef

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
it won't end

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
there

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
that'll be the least of your trouble

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
so you grab him in your headlock

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
and do those things

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
and Mod goes enough

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
if he demands a shackling

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I'm sorry

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
if he demands a shackling

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
then we have to enact

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
the rights of Telemvarna

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
after the due process

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
of Fumilaga

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
it is

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
do not insult our law

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Telemvarna is the due process

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
yeah well

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Telemvarna

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
they start shouting

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
as chains

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
fire out of the walls

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I dodge all of them

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I dodge every single one

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
into your very souls

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
they shackle our souls

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
they're chaining your souls

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I swing my sword around in a flurry

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
too bad dude

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
souls be shackled

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I give a slow clap

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
and it sounds like a thousand claps

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
I take my finger from my forehead

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
and I don't know what that means

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I look at all of them

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
and I say

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
very well

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
let the shackling begin

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
but once it's over

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
yes

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I'll be unshackled

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
and you'll still be ugly

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
thank you for coming everybody

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
welcome

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
and good night

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
we fucking did it

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I don't know what happened but we were all here for it

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
one more time for Spencer Crichton and Erin McGathy

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I'm Jeff Davis

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
