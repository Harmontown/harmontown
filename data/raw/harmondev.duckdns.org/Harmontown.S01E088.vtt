{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nZero audio.\n\n00:04.000 --> 00:11.000\nShe turned the night light on a blue kiss.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:17.000\nHe's there back through his dream, play all the eyes.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:19.000\nHello.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:24.000\nWelcome once again to Meltdown Comics and the NerdMelt Theater.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:26.000\nGuess what everybody?\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:35.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:46.000\nLet's welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you. What a lovely, lovely group of people.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:57.000\nYou seem to be on first impression, at least.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:02.000\nI got my notes.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nI got some notes.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:11.000\nWell, of course, we lost a legend today, Philip Seymour Hoffman Tide.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:16.000\nLet's start with that. You should always go with a high-energy opener.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nWere you connected to that when you heard the news?\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:23.000\nNo, I did, and that's a testament to the fact that how much respect,\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:26.000\nI think, that Kai really is worthy of it.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nFamous people die, and it's like, we only have a relationship to their fame,\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:31.000\nand they're like, well, he was famous.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.000\nHey, the guy that played Klinger on M.A.S.H. died today,\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nand you're like, aw, you automatically go aw, because death is bad.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:40.000\nJimmy Farr died too?\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:45.000\nNo, no. I didn't mean to upset you, no.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nBut I'm saying, I was picking like a random person that's like,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nwell, I mean, the only, at this point, he's just a famous name.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nHe's just a name you know.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nAnd then there's people that pass that you go, oh, shit, holy fuck,\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nthat's terrible that they're gone.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:07.000\nAnd yes, I have equated that against the fact that millions of us die every day.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:11.000\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman was worth a couple hundred thousand normal people, at least.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nHe was a good fucking actor.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:16.000\nI'm bummed he's dead, even though we all die every day.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nI watched a bunch of the footage, the coverage of it,\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:23.000\nand I was, you know, I was bummed out, not that I was ever like, very close to him,\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nand I couldn't separate the idea that, are they covering this so much\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nbecause he won an Oscar, because he's great, because he's a good theater actor,\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:37.000\nor what, but I was surprised the level of coverage that got.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:42.000\nWell, I think truly, I mean, this is, no, well, here's my answer to that.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:47.000\nHe won an Oscar because he's great, there's coverage because he won an Oscar,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nhe won an Oscar because he's great, he was a theater actor,\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nhe was a good fucking actor, he was really, really good.\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:01.000\nI watched Capote today, I don't know, I picked a PSH movie to watch to mourn him.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nWe rolled into Boogie Nights, but I had to come here,\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nbut every movie he's in, he makes better.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nHe's never been bad, he's just a good actor.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:15.000\nHe's one of those rare actors who doesn't just inhabit characters\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:18.000\nand like, oh, that's amazing, he really seems Russian.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nThat's a good, that's a type of good acting.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:25.000\nThere's another type of good acting that's like, wow, Woody Allen's really good at being himself,\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\neven though he's just a writer on screen, like, talking about his feelings.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:29.000\nThat's another type of good acting.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:37.000\nBut, but, but, but Philip Seymour Hoffman puts him, put himself into people who were nothing like him.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nAnd Capote was one of those amazing, amazing examples.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nYou really don't know what you're watching.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nIf you, if you see footage of Truman Capote and then you see footage of Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nand then you watch that movie, you really are watching like a miracle happen.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:57.000\nIn my opinion, it's like, he's not, he's not doing a rich little impression of Truman Capote,\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:03.000\nbut he's certainly like talking funny the way Truman Capote did, which I have no idea how you could possibly do that\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:08.000\nand still emote and there are scenes in that movie and that movie is riveting.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:12.000\nEven if, even if there was a bad actor in that role, I think that would be one of my favorite stories.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:18.000\nBut the camera pushes on him and it's just fucking, only thing that's for sale is him just bursting into tears.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:24.000\nAnd it's, it is, it is as amazing as watching a fireworks display.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:31.000\nNow he died, we can, I think, assume from the reports that we have already that it was heroin overdose.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:37.000\nThat wasn't big news. Like Justin Bieber egged some houses. That's giant news.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nThis guy was a heroin addict and has kids and is cool.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nNo, it wasn't. Well, he was struggling with it. It was like Robert Downey Jr. You know, it was like, we were in his corner.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:53.000\nHe was, he was struggling with it for a long time and that's the, that's the crazy thing about our point of view on drugs in the society.\n\n04:53.000 --> 05:02.000\nYou know, it, I find it very strange. He was, Hoffman was, was straight for 11 years or something.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:06.000\nHe battled and battled and battled with it. And we all have to accept at this point.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nI'm not asking the truck drivers listening to feel sorry to shed a tear for the famous actors of the world.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nBut we have to accept at this point with Heath Ledger and Robert Downey Jr.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd we have to accept that, that if you're really good, if you're really capable of genuine charisma on camera, and not a lot of us can fill that job,\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:29.000\nthat there's something, there's some overlap between that. And, you know, there's a challenge with, with the stuff.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nAnd we, so, and we go back and forth between treating it as a challenge and as an indulgence.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:41.000\nAnd I, I, I do want to give a special wag of the, wag of the dick to Val Kilmer for his terrible.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nLike, I was looking at all the celebrity tweets, you know, is there a new segment?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:51.000\nDan Harmon's Wag of the Dick at Val Kilmer. Because every week you're going to wag your dick at Val Kilmer.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:57.000\nI'm on his case now. I'm got a week after a week, I'm going to find, I'm going to, I'm going to call out Val Kilmer and something.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:06.000\nI'm going to watch him now because, because I was surprised at the amount of class and restraint and genuine,\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:15.000\nsincere, emotional mourning going on on Twitter by famous people who aren't exactly famous all the time for their tact,\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:21.000\ntheir, I don't know, their, their grace. Sometimes if you're famous for being a really good actor,\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:27.000\nmaybe you're a bit of a jackass on Twitter. Sometimes you can be famous for being a jackass on Twitter and do a show at Meltdown,\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:33.000\npulling like a hundred people. But the, I was amazed because I was, I scanned down the list,\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:39.000\nthey always do that aggregate story. Hollywood reacts on Twitter to, to screen legends death.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:45.000\nAnd I was like, where's the, where's the bad guy? Where is he? Val Kilmer.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:53.000\nI got, does anybody have his tweet pulled up? I get, it was, it was, he kind of, he did a lot of Prince-like abbreviation.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:59.000\nLike he, he would, he would, he would spell blue B-L-U. He didn't have time to blue day for the thing.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:05.000\nIt was like, like the idea that, that a, that a good guy had died was about 10% of his 140 characters.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nAnd on the rest of it was crammed in with abbreviations about how drugs are bad things.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nSometimes people feel like they need to escape through them, but you don't need to do that, man.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nYou got to keep, you got to keep, keep your strength up. You know, it's like, wow, a little, a little,\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:24.000\nthat's a good time to pontificate about your view on things in the middle of a eulogy.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nPull up, pull up a Val Kilmer tweet right now.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nOkay, thank you.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nTyler in the front row has one for us.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:36.000\nThis is Val Kilmer's tweet. This is a, this is my, my new segment called Tisk, Tisk, Val Kilmer.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nShould we get theme music for that?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nBlue Day Spelled Like Blue Ray.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:59.000\nTisk, Tisk, Val Kilmer, you did something naughty. I'm watching you, you've acted rather hearty.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:05.000\nWhy you carry yourself that way?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:10.000\nOnline.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nThank you.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nBlue Day Spelled Like Blue Ray. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. That's auto correct, right?\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nHe's using a Sony phone.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nYou want a blue ray?\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nThe phone says, no, it's a blue day, Sam, Sam, Sony 2000.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nSo it's, it's sick blue ray?\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:38.000\nVal Kilmer says, starts his tweet, blue day.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nBut he spells the word blue the way you spell blue and blue ray.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nB-L-U.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:50.000\nOkay. Or, or, or, yeah, or he's from, uh, uh, Bellevue De Vaux.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:57.000\nYes.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nJeff was like,\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:05.000\nI don't know, tips and toe, she broke a needle and she can't soap.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:10.000\nI'm not going to shock anyone with this news. It's Super Bowl Sunday. Jeff came here directly from the drying room.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nIt's been a, it's been a long day.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nI'm drunk.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:22.000\nYou made a face like you were about to not, you were about to say, I'm sober.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nAre you sober?\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nProbably not.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nIf I know me.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nBut this is a rare day where I'm, I'm relative to you. I'm like, hey, whoa.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:36.000\nYeah. I'm not, I'm not complaining. I'm not complaining.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nOkay.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nYou're about to.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nNo, no, no, I'm not complaining. I would never complain.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:46.000\nThat would be instant karma so fast. I'm going to be as drunk as you in the next 20 minutes.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nI'm just, I'm just tired.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nAll right. All right. This is, this segment's gone way too long.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nRead it, read the tweet.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:01.000\nOkay. Let's, let's start from the top though. This, this segment's called, Tiss Tiss Val Kilmer.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:07.000\nNaughty, naughty. Where's the Batman?\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:13.000\nYou know it. Not his fault. Just bad casting. That's weird casting.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnd that's a George Clooney's been Batman and even that was swallowable. Val Kilmer?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nMichael Keaton?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nMichael Keaton.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:29.000\nOh, that's an interesting little groundswell of,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nwhat was it about Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman that's defensible?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:39.000\nHis heart was in it. I don't know. He, he, he, he was, he was, he was the size of an actual bat, but he,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nbut he, you felt like he was like, yeah, fuck you, Michael Keaton has Batman.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nAnd like, you, I don't know. I felt like he,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nHe's the first guy to whisper in Batman. And you, and you liked it.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nCause he like, he whispered it like it was good.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd he's arguably the best thing about that movie.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nThat was, that was in a rare time when Michael Keaton had a license to print money.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:01.000\nHe was in everything. He was Mr. Mom. He was a gung-ho. He was in every goddamn thing.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:06.000\nWell, let's travel back in time to that day. Like, not, not to the point where,\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nwhere you don't have to give him as much credit as we have to give him.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nLike, like he, like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, he was, he was, he was,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:17.000\nMichael Keaton was, he wasn't coming off of Mr. Mom.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nIt was, it was, it was weird when they announced that Michael Keaton was going to be in a Batman suit.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:27.000\nIt was weird for everybody, but, but, but, but all the Frank Miller like, like Die Hards kind of went,\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nwhatever Tim Burton wants, like, like this is, they're making a Batman suit.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nWas that his first choice? Did someone say no before Michael Keaton?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nSomebody must have, right?\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nIt was Elizabeth Mastrantonio.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nFor real? For real?\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nYeah, a woman.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nUh.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.000\nThis won't be one of our more popular segments, but it will be.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nIt'll have the best mileage.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nIt's becoming my favorite already.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nLet's see if this guy's iPhone went to sleep already.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:04.000\nNow you gotta, Tyler's going to put his biometrics back into it to start it up.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nThank you.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nUh, all right. So here we go.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:14.000\nBlue Day, Philip Seymour Hoffman, ODD.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nNot died, ODD.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nO-D, apostrophe D?\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nThat's correct.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nAll right.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:26.000\nAddiction comes from, that's an abbreviation of from.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:31.000\nAddiction comes from trying to escape the pain of living.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:36.000\nWe all struggle with this, but drugs, capital D on drugs, never help.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:41.000\nSo that's a good 5% spent on the eternal soul of the man you supposedly respect.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd, you know, you know, 95% what you've got to say about some fucking bullshit.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd I just find that within the span of the same tweet, Val Kilmer, I'm just telling you,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nthere's no rule book for it, but let me start to write it.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nYour chapter one, that's tacky.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:02.000\nAll right. So here we go.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nOh, thank you for your...\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nThat was Val Kilmer.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:10.000\nAnd hey, you can redeem yourself, Mr. Kilmer.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nBy coming on our show.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nYou can come down through the skylight if you like.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nAnd fight me with your sharp little wing-weapon.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nWhat's your beef with his Batman?\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nNo, no, no, I don't really have one.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nHonestly, I swear, he gave it his all too.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nHe was a handsome man at that time.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nI mean, that movie was just a...\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:40.000\nThat was a bad, bad experience for anyone to have to have if you were alive back then.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nIt was just a bad thing to happen.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nI'm pretty sure everybody here was.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nYeah, and it was just, you know...\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nNobody here is 12.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nAll right, so let's move on.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nWe got over that tragedy, but yeah.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nOh, I was... Yeah.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nI don't know. Guy was a good actor.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:04.000\nWell-deserving of public mourning and our respect.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nAnd I'm telling you, I mean, that guy is gonna...\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nNow, because we take these people for granted.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nNational treasures, I would call them.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nGo back and watch every movie that has Philip Seymour Hoffman in it.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nAnd now even...\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nIt's not like we didn't recognize in fact he was a good actor, but holy shit.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nHe's gonna be like a legend.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nAnd it's a shame because he would have been so fucking good for the next 30 years.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nIt's terrible. He was 46 years old.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nTerrible, terrible.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nSteve Martin tweeted today that he saw him do Willie Lohman.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nAnd said that it was the best Willie Lohman that he'd ever seen.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nHe was that good.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nHe was a hell of a theater actor.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nI can't even begin to imagine seeing him live on stage.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:45.000\nYou know what I can't begin to imagine, Dan?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nIs a sports corner.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nToday is Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\nDan, I know that you saw the big game\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nbecause you're a big lover of games, big and small.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nYeah, yeah, I need to keep up on all the sports\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nwith my seven plasma screens and my sports bar.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:08.000\nSports Corner!\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nSports Corner, get up, you're sports.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nThrow up your hands, make it sports worse.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nGotta get the ball outside.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nGotta put it in the bounds wide.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nSports Corner, gotta do what you see.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nGotta talk about sports, know what I mean.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nI got injuries, got athletic yardage,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\ngot all kinds of things into Sports Corner.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nDan?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nSuper Bowl just ended probably at like...\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:34.000\nWhat a game.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nWhat a game.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nWho did you have favored going into the game\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nbefore we talk about the result?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nWell, I think that all of us were rooting.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nWe thought whether we were rooting for them or not,\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nwe thought this was a distinct situation\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nof the home team having an advantage.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nWell...\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nBut they played in a neutral field in New York.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nWell, and who's more neutral than you know who?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nThen...\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nOkay, well, I mean, Dan, I don't have to tell you\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nthat it was the Seattle Seahawks versus the Denver Broncos.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nYeah, I don't even know.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nWe'll have to edit that out, it's so redundant.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:09.000\nBut going in, were you a Seahawks guy or a Broncos guy?\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nI mean, we all thought for...\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nLook, as a betting man?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nYes.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nAs a sportsologist?\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nJust by the numbers.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nStrictly by the numbers.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:24.000\nAs a blueprint sportsman\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nover my toast and jam,\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\ngetting gearing up for the day,\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nno matter what I'm hearing about...\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nReal quick, just tell me who the teams were again.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:36.000\nIt was the Seahawks and the Broncos.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:39.000\nOkay, yeah, okay.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nAnd where are they from?\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nSeattle and Denver.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nOkay, shit, I feel terrible for even asking.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nYeah, I mean, again, just edit it out.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nEveryone knows what I'm telling you.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:55.000\nSo, yeah, we all felt going in,\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nbecause the robot part of us felt like\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nit was going to be a Seahawk game, right?\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nYeah, because...\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nWell, just because of the boring statistics, Jeff,\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nthe technical things,\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nthe things that don't have to do with the human heart.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nYardage, for instance, like the Seahawks...\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nHe came into this game with a superior yardage\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nand just more completions.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nThere's just more completions\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nas seams on paper like butter football.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nIf you're a robot.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:25.000\nBut if you look at it from a standpoint of injuries\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:32.000\nand recoveries of those injuries\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:35.000\nand March Madness,\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nwhich is a factor that nobody ever...\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nlike, because, oh, that's months off.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nMarch Madness isn't going to matter.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:47.000\nPeople forget to put March Madness into the Super Bowl equation.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nSo that's, you know...\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nSo what we saw today was a fucking clash\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nof the fucking Titans.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nPardon my French.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nWere you surprised by the result?\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nI think we all were.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nWere you?\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nOf course I was, yeah.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nIn what way?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nWell, I never thought I'd see so much steam\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\ncoming off of the field.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nI was surprised, frankly,\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nby the lack of leadership on the Broncos part.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nThat was a heartbreaker\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nbecause this is a team that's renowned\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nfor its quarterbackery.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nEveryone knows that the Seahawks,\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nthey're like a team of rogues, okay?\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nThey move as one unit.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nThey advance the ball, okay?\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nYou're actually kind of getting close\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nto being accurate, which is amazing.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nThe Broncos have always been,\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nit's always been about one guy, their quarterback.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nWho is?\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nStop interrupting me!\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nAnd that guy...\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nPeyton Manning, you're talking about.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nI didn't see the same arm on Manning today.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nWhat did you see the difference?\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nI felt like something was wrong at home.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nThis is a guy who's usually very strategic.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nHe sees a pocket and he delivers to it\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nwith no thought about the larger yardage.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nThis was a person who was...\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nhe was about the amount of downs.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nLike, he knew that this was a game of downs.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nThe more downs you get, the more yardage you're gonna get.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nYou're gonna get more downs.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nYou thought there were too many thought pockets?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nHe's just thinking too much about yardage.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nLike, I'm gonna make a big yardage pass.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nInstead of like, who'd the old Manning's Peyton's?\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nYeah.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nLike, he was a guy who would just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nbreak into the little pockets right in front of him.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nOkay, that's a third down. Congratulations.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nNow you got more downs.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nYou can trade those in for more points in the kickoff.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nThat's how you win Super Bowls.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nSports Corner!\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nThe Seahawks knew that.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nThey learned that, and they knew it.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nThey saw the weakness, and they took advantage of it.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nRight on the 50-yard line, you can see it.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nDid you make a bet in the game? Did you have any money on that?\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nI put it all on the Hawks.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nWhat was the wage here?\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nDid you take the points or the money line?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nA gentleman doesn't say.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nBut I will say the spread was two to three.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.000\nTook a two to three spread.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nIf you bet a lot on sports, you know it's about the spread.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nNow, Dan, you're a big football guy.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nSo now that the football season is officially over...\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nYeah, but now March Madness starts.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nNow you're Mr. March Madness. Who do you like in the brackets?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:41.000\nI think I'm going to keep an eye on every bracket.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\nI think South Division is always the...\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\nWe make the romantic notion it's going to be about South Division,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:51.000\nbut look at Northwest. Look what they did.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nAmong the top ten teams...\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nLook at the Eastern Seaboard. Among the top ten teams.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nTop ten teams, who do you like?\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:01.000\nBrackets, Jeff. It's not about teams, it's about brackets and teams.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nBut teams exist with East Western.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nNorth. East Western.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nEastern Seaboard. East Western.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nEast Western Division is, you laugh, but after the wild card rule\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:15.000\nwas removed from the brackets,\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:20.000\nnow East Western is going to be one of the big powerhouses coming out.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:24.000\nYou guys laughed about Fox becoming a major network,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:29.000\nbut East Western Division is going to fucking tear up the Astro.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nWhile we're on it.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nWho do you like in the Oscars? Best picture noms?\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:37.000\nOh, you know, best picture, well, you know, people follow their hearts.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nI'm going to go Skippy's problem.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nSkippy's problem.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:44.000\nBecause, you know, I mean, it's...\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:48.000\nI don't want to be crass. I'm going to get in trouble for this tomorrow in the press.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:52.000\nBut he's an alien with AIDS.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nPeople are going to go for that.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:59.000\nThat's going to bring in all the Transformers people and all the AIDS people.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:04.000\nAnd when you see, when you see Harrelson's performance, you're going to go,\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:07.000\nlike, okay, just get an Oscar.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nWhy is Harrelson...\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nLook, I love Harrelson as much as anybody.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nWhy is he in every movie now?\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nHe's high.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nHe loves getting high and making movies.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nHe can do whatever he wants. What would you do?\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nDid you see 12 Years a Slave? What do you think about that?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nYeah, I love...\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:28.000\nNo, I didn't. I didn't see it.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:32.000\nI thought about the concept of riffing on that,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:35.000\nthe joke being that I had seen it, and then...\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\nI don't know, I saw low dividends.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:42.000\nBut she haven't seen it.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:45.000\nI haven't seen anything. I saw her. I saw her.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nI liked her.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nHer was good.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nThat's one for the ages, yeah.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nI love that movie.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nI was not a big Joaquin Phoenix fan. I liked that movie.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nI thought it was quite good.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nI think he's great.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nWhat I love about her is that, like, Eternal Sunshine,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nit's these movies where you deconstruct love,\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nwhere you actually get to the heart of it.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:11.000\nIt's like these movies where fucking, you know...\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:14.000\n19 pairs of shoes and three raisins to do it.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:17.000\nLike, they can be cute sometimes.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:20.000\nSometimes they can be good, but they're never good.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nWhat was the log line on 19 pairs of shoes\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nand the three raisins to do it?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:27.000\nSometimes Mr. Right can be right here.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nBut those movies are...\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nSometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nbut they are those movies.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nAnd those movies never have anything to do with actual love,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:44.000\nbecause they formalize love in an attempt to get their story done\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nin a way that people, because they devalue the audience,\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nthey don't think that the audience understands what love is.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nAnd it's these movies where somebody that's very lonely\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nand very creative, like, says, yeah, but fuck love.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nFuck love the way it is in these movies\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nand kind of deconstructs it that the surface seems cynical,\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nbut those are the movies where you actually learn things\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nabout love while you're watching.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nI mean, I felt myself feeling things,\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nwatching a movie about Joaquin Phoenix\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\njerking off to his computer.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nIt was profound, the things that they illustrated\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nabout the nature of relationships\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nand the definition of true love.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nAnd also, yeah, it's nice.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nThey removed the human body from the equation,\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nwhich is an important thing to do\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nif you're gonna get to the bottom of real love.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:28.000\nBecause some of you people got no legs.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nI've read about you.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nStand up!\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nStop!\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nHey, Jeff, can I tell you something\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nI've always wanted to say up on this stage?\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nYou love cocking your mouth?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nReal nice.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nI do not have that honor.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nOf being able to say that?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nOf having a cock in my mouth.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nI could if I wanted.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nYou could.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nIt's certainly within your bailiwick\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nas mayor of Ironman 10.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nAll right.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nAll right, so...\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:21.000\nThis segment is called...\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nBefore you tell me,\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nexcuse me for a musical theme.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nI was all like, you can pick one.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nThe segment is called...\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:38.000\nSeemingly unrelated paragraphs\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nthat I say into the microphone\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:43.000\nin a confusing tense\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:46.000\nthat make you think that I'm not\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nhere in the moment in this show.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:58.000\nI'm sorry, say it again.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nSay it again.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nI think I had the theme for it.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nI'm simultaneously trying to\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nmemorize the...\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nYou just say play.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nI think I got it.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.000\nAll right, you ready?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nOkay.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nSo the segment is called\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nSeemingly unrelated paragraphs\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nthat I've memorized\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nand I'm going to recite\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nas if I'm making them up.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nWell, Jeff,\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:41.000\nthe thing about writing is...\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nThe thing about writing is\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:47.000\nit's a life spent throwing messages\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nand bottles out into this darkness\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nand you can see online\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nor through Nielsen numbers\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nthat people are watching.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nYou can see in forums\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nthat people are respecting it\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nbut what I'd like to do,\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nI guess on this tour now that I have\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nno job is get out there\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nand see if any of these people are real\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nand look into their eyes\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nand find out if I've been having any impact.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nDid you get that?\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nThat's a wrap on principle photography\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nfor the Harmontown documentary.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nWe're liars.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nSometimes we lie.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nDana, finish your movie.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nDana, I don't...\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:33.000\nI said that on January 2nd, 2012.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nI'd like to try it one more time\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nand do it more honest.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nGo ahead.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nWhat?\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nSay it.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nWe didn't get it.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:41.000\nTry it again.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nOkay.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nMore honest?\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nIt's all alive.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nMore in the moment.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nOh, more in the moment.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nOkay.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nAll right.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nI mean, all right.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nHow do we get you in the moment?\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nWell, ask me about this topic\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nbut we have to change tenses.\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nThat's the confusing thing.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nWe haven't gone on a tour yet.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nDo it in the Plue Perfect.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nIs that Val Kilmer's Plue Perfect?\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nPlue.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nDash Perfect.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nJust go with it.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nGo with it.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nI wasn't asking for a suggestion\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nlike an improv show for tents.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nI was joking and saying,\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\ndoing it again,\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nI thought you did it perfectly first.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nOkay.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.000\nWell, I mean, the thing is,\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nthe reason we write is because\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nwe want to connect with people.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nSo you sit and you put messages in bottles.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nYou throw them into darkness\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nat people that you don't know.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nAnd then you see that they like it,\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nbut you see that in the form of numbers\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nor on the internet.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nI just want it now that I'm between jobs.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nI thought we could go out there\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:52.000\nand go see if any of these people were real.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nDid I have, was there an impact there?\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:58.000\nGod, it just seems so fucking fake.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nThat's not why I went out there.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nNeil, now I want you to get behind Dan\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nand film an audience while Dan says it again.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:07.000\nBut I want the audience to lie too,\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\npretend they haven't seen this before.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nBecause now, if we're going to use this,\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nit's going to be in the documentary.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nAt least they all get to go,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\noh, we were in that scene\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nwhen we were talking about bullshit.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nWe wrote that together.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nThat's all right.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nBut I want you guys to look either bummed out\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:22.000\nor blown away or whatever.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:23.000\nBut now Dan,\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:26.000\nyou have to bring the thunder now.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:27.000\nAll right.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nIt's like,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nwhen you're a writer,\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nthe goal is to be racist.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.000\nAnd...\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nBut I've never met a person that wasn't white.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nSo I think the purpose of this tour\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nis to get out there\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\non a team of horses\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:48.000\nand just find and touch\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.000\nand possibly interrogate\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nnon-Caucasians.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nWow.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nWow.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:04.000\nThere's no end to the fallacy.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nNeil thinks I'm making fun of the process,\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nbut I'm not.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nI mean, it's a...\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nIf you try to make a documentary\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nabout me going on the road,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nI don't know why I'm going on the road.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nThat was like a little chunk\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nthat we thought maybe we could use.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nDid you get it, Neil?\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nGot it.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nYou got it.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nSee you in Austin.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nYeah, Berkeley.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nYeah, see you at South by Southwest.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nThat's how you make documentaries?\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nWait, our documentary's already in the...\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nWe're already in South by Southwest.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nHe's still shooting it.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nWe've been selected.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nThat means that in the trailer\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nthere will be like,\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nLaurel Leaves around a thing\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nthat says selected.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nOn our little logo,\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nthere's Laurel Leaves,\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nbut doesn't ours already have\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:48.000\nLaurel Leaves around it?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nThose are other...\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:50.000\nNot that one,\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nbut our Harmontown logo\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nhas Laurels around it.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:54.000\nDouble Laurels.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nDouble Laurels.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:58.000\nWe're resting on other Laurels.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nInteresting.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nAnyways, yeah.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nI mean, he probably won't use that\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nbecause you can see\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nwhen I'm being insincere\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nand I can't do it,\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:13.000\nbut I said it on the couch in there.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:14.000\nSaid what?\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nSaid the thing about going on the road\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nto touch people.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nSay it again.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nSay it again,\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nbut really well while the camera's not here,\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nbecause I'm going on the road\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nto touch people.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nI'm going to get into a tour bus\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nbecause I'm between jobs\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nand I just want to go out there, Jeff,\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nand I want to see if there's faces behind\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nthe low Nielsen's\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.000\nand the affectionate Tumblr blogs\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nthat I can touch,\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nprovided their age is above a certain limit.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.000\nAnd make eye contact with it and say,\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:51.000\nam I a good person even though I'm fired?\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:54.000\nIt's a terrible reason to go on a tour\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nand I don't think it's accurate.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nWas there ever a reason?\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nDo you know the reason for real?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nNo.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:01.000\nIt could be.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nIt was just for fun, right?\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nWell, I think the reason for the tour\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:09.000\nis was, it's not usable,\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:12.000\nbut the reason for the tour was...\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:15.000\nNiel, get out of here.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nThe reason for the tour was to,\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nit had something to do with me, the performer,\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nbecause I had just been fired as the writer,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nso I was just kind of going like,\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nwell, I don't know,\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nI just wanted to dive into something that was different,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nyou know, that's all.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nI don't know what beyond that.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:35.000\nThe documentary does a pretty good job of revealing\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:39.000\nwhat a gross, weird balloon animal of a person I am.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nI feel like at a real simple level,\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:45.000\nthe idea was that you'd left the comfort zone of this room\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:49.000\nand wondered if you could find this kind of comfort level\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:52.000\nin Phoenix and Brooklyn, whatever,\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:56.000\nand strangely, we found it,\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:01.000\nbecause the audience is not any different wherever you go.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.000\nYup.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nAnd did it make you happier at the end?\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nDid it change you in any way?\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nNope.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nNot at all.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nIt made you happy.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nYeah, it made me happy.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nDonuts make me happy.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nI don't know if they're good for me or not.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nI don't know if I should deny myself them\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nor devour them for breakfast.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nYeah, it made me happy going on tour.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:25.000\nI think that I am a...\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:28.000\nI think that I am a...\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nI will always be an incomplete person.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nI hope so, because if you die a complete person,\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:35.000\nthen that means you wasted some seconds of your life.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nIt would be nice to bring it right into the station.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.000\nComplete.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nDie.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:43.000\nBut other than that, your life should be spent kind of completing yourself.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nI...\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:48.000\nSo I did not get completed by the tour.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nI didn't turn into somebody else.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:53.000\nI didn't suddenly realize halfway through that I should be a vegetarian\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:58.000\nor that I should quit drinking or that I should value the sunset.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:02.000\nI think I overcame my stage fright\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:05.000\nmaybe by orders of 5-10% more.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:09.000\nAnd I think I also realized that it's too late for me in terms of character arc.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.000\nAs a character, that's why guys my age aren't characters on TV.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nThey're usually detectives or surgeons.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nThey're supposed to have their shit figured out.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:24.000\nAnd so that's why it was nice to go on the road with Spencer,\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:30.000\nwho still is young enough to be affected by old people.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:35.000\nIt was nice getting to know him and hearing a little bit of him and me\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:39.000\nand putting a little bit of me into him.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nAnd coming back with him...\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nCan you elaborate on that?\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:48.000\nAnd coming back with him, I hired Spencer as my assistant\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nand I started that animated show with Spencer\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:55.000\nand I'm not shoving Spencer into the system,\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nbut I'm putting him out there.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:00.000\nWe ended up writing a character for him on community\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nand everything continues to be unflappable to him.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:05.000\nDoes he deserve it? Will it make him a good person? Who cares?\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:10.000\nBut he's a person too that now can be out there.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nI take pleasure in that.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:17.000\nAnd I don't get to change.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\nFucking old, dude.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:24.000\nBut there was a moment when you got back on community,\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:28.000\nwhen they rehired you, you came back here and you had your arms crossed\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:33.000\nand you sat down and you seemed very poised and vindicated.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nYou did change in that moment.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:40.000\nThere was a vindication there and wouldn't that be a change?\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nYeah.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nBut then that's short-lived, right?\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nThen all of a sudden you're back at the dirty work of...\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:50.000\nYeah, the same companies that will fire you because they don't give a shit about you\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:53.000\nwill also rehire you because they don't give a shit about you.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:56.000\nYou shouldn't take it as seriously as you do.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nBut I'm going to keep doing it.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nCould you answer honestly?\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nI mean, could you even know the answer to this question?\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:03.000\nWould you rather there was another season of community\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:06.000\nor would you rather there not be one?\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nA sixth season?\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:08.000\nYeah.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:12.000\nNo, I can't answer that question because I have to actively...\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nI think we've already talked about this.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nThis is a very strange thing for me.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:22.000\nI have to actively hope for a sixth season otherwise I wouldn't be able to go to work there.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:25.000\nIf you knew there was going to be a sixth season, would that instantly make you happy\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:29.000\nor would that make you bummed out or worried?\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:32.000\nIt's more complex than that.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nIt's like knowing that you have a baby on the way.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:38.000\nI mean, there's different parts of you that would be like,\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nfuck, am I ready for this?\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:45.000\nShit, I could have used that trip to the Everglades.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:51.000\nCome on, we've all been there.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nIt's just that fantasy of having a kid,\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:57.000\nbut you also want to go on one of those fan boats.\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:00.000\nAnd what could be more mutually exclusive?\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:04.000\nKnowing you for a long time.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:10.000\nSo you say gators is sex is determined by the temperature?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nThat's right.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:17.000\nKeep your babies blanket out of the fan, please.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nYou never see that. It's dangerous.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:23.000\nEither pro-creator or explorer America's swamp lands.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nDo not try both.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:30.000\nKnowing you for a long time, it's hard to say whether you're a happy version of you or a sad version.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:35.000\nYou always come off like you're incomplete, there's a sadness to you,\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:40.000\nbut I would say right now knowing you that you're probably as happy as you've been since I've known you.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nDefinitely, yeah.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:46.000\nBut you don't wear a smile. You're not a smile.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nYou don't do bell kicks down the road.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:51.000\nMy whole life is a smile.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:54.000\nHe said frowningly.\n\n37:54.000 --> 38:00.000\nThe part you get to look at is the little center part of the smile that's the little kissy part.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:06.000\nThe fucking corners of my life are up by my, up by God's ears.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.000\nI'm part of God. I'm God's mouth.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:15.000\nI am God's mouth and I am smiling.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:22.000\nBut the part you get to see for 40 years is a wrinkly little snot gutter\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:25.000\nwith gross mustache hair on it.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:28.000\nYou can never tell if it's smiling.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:33.000\nBut yeah, I like that metaphor. I'm going to refine it and blog about it.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nBut yeah, definitely.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:45.000\nYeah, no, because I've got a lot of stuff. I'm always way happier if there's stuff out there that people are experiencing\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:49.000\nthat can somehow, I can convince myself, reflect on my value as a person.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nWell, simultaneously knowing that it doesn't.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:56.000\nBut I'm way happier having something on the air than not having something on the air.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:59.000\nIf they were to say, hey, we need to succeed as a community,\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:05.000\nI'm going to be just as happy as if they say communities canceled, exactly as happy for totally different reasons.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:11.000\nIt's a completely, I'm fulfilled. I get to do whatever I want.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:14.000\nI get to, I have a fucking giant baby.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:20.000\nJust like a big pacifier in my mouth and now I'm getting married to somebody who's heard me fart\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:26.000\nand I got a dog and it's all, it does it like, I'm not tap dancing every day.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:30.000\nI still got a lot of shit to do, but yeah, you're right. I'm happy.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:38.000\nWhy are you applauding happiness?\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nThat's the one thing that doesn't need, applaud world hunger.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nOh, wait, don't do that. No, don't do that.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:46.000\nWait, that's bad. Okay, I know, I know, I retract my question.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.000\nThat's why you're applauding it.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nYou want to reward it because you want more happiness.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:54.000\nThey're applauding happiness, but it's so funny when you say you're happy, you make an excruciating face.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nI was thinking about their applause.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nIt was like, why do we applaud people saying they're happy?\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nBut you frown before the applause.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:04.000\nYou were saying, I frown when I talk. I'm a thoughtful person.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nNo, but you don't frown all the time.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:14.000\nYou frown more tonight when you said that you're happy and content.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nBecause it's not a natural state.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:20.000\nA happy person's natural state is not talking about how happy they are, why they're happy.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:26.000\nThat's not a natural state. So it takes me out of the happy moment to count the reasons why I'm happy.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nThat's something that dishonest people do.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:34.000\nOh, I love Todd so much. He and I, he did the most sweet thing the other day.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:37.000\nHe and I, we went rock climbing because that's how we met.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:44.000\nAnd he pulled out a tiny rock, the same shape as, and just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:47.000\npress release about how complete you are as a couple, fuck off.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:53.000\nI'm so amazed. I went to Griffith Park today and I went jogging.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:57.000\nI just fucking blew out my quads and my delts and I feel fucking good.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:02.000\nI feel so good. I'm really at a complete place in my life. I don't believe you.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:09.000\nI'm frowning when I talk about whether I'm happy or not because who the fuck talks about that?\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:12.000\nWell, that sounds like you don't, yeah, you're right about that.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:16.000\nBut I feel like part of you is that you don't feel like you're allowed to be happy.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:19.000\nLike you're getting away with something that you're...\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nI don't think I'm allowed to say it.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:26.000\nI think that frowning and scowling and...\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:30.000\nBut if somebody asks you, are you happy, you're allowed to say yes.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:33.000\nSecretly. It's privately. A little more privately then.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:36.000\nI don't think it makes for a good speech.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nLike Hitler didn't say, I'm happy.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nHe wasn't happy!\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nBut he got so much done.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:45.000\nOh boy.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:49.000\nWe may actually have to edit that out.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:54.000\nThat just came together wrong.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:59.000\nI'm so used to using Hitler as a way to make a point.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:04.000\nI accidentally used him to make a point about happiness.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:08.000\nBecause I don't normally talk about how to be happy.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:14.000\nUsually grabbing the Hitler tool out of the toolbox works but I was feeding a baby.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nI grabbed that Hitler.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nOh no, I'm feeding a baby with a Hitler.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:23.000\nBut now you're smiling more tight about Hitler than you did about your own happiness.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:29.000\nLook at the smile on your face. This guy loves Hitler.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:32.000\nYou hate yourself.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:35.000\nI'm smiling because it's fun to make mistakes.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nTheir reaction is fun. We're laughing together.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:41.000\nAnd then the odd thing is, there's so many things that we've talked about on this stage.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:45.000\nWhere everybody's been smiling and happy and feeling free and like nothing's wrong.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:48.000\nAnd then there's the context issue.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:54.000\nHere's a recording, here's a transcript of Dan Harmon talking about his feelings about work.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:57.000\nAnd it's like, it's all fun. Otherwise I wouldn't say it up here.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nI'm trying to make people laugh. I'm trying to make people think.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nI'm trying to make people happy that they spent $10 on something.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nI'm not going to...\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:08.000\nAnd then it's like, I tend to go to the places where these people are happy.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:11.000\nAnd everyone's smiling and interested or whatever.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:15.000\nBut then there's a global context now. It's also fucked up and stupid.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:18.000\nYeah, but fuck that shit. You're allowed to shoot from the hip still.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nYou're never going to stop doing that.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:24.000\nI'm always going to do that, but I don't want to talk about it that anymore.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:27.000\nAnd I also don't want to talk about whether or not I'm happy.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nLike it's some kind of press release.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:32.000\nI understand, but that's a silly thing.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nLike Catherine Hepburn was in some interview.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:37.000\nI want to say it was Dick Cavett. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nAnd there was a leading question.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nKind of like, do you like Hollywood? Do you like Hollywood people?\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:45.000\nAnd she says like, the best people I've ever known lived in Hollywood.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:49.000\nLike, I love being an actress. I love like, I know you want me to say that I like,\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nlike fuck Hollywood and their phonies.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nIt's like the greatest people in the world live in this town.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:56.000\nLike, I'm surrounded by creative people.\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:01.000\nAnd she can say that, but she knows when she says that, that you sound like...\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:09.000\nThat's a very unidentifiable thing to say out loud as he just scatters the stage with ice.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nYou're allowed to be happy. You're allowed to brag about it.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:15.000\nBut you're never going to boast about your happiness,\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:20.000\nbut you're allowed to, you know, kind of smile and chuckle at your own well-being right now.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:25.000\nWell, I think that when you're... I don't know about you.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nWell, I do know about you. You're weird.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:31.000\nBut I know that Dino and I, because I've talked to him about this,\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:40.000\nwhen we're really happy, we get in our car and we play like really fucked up melancholy music.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:46.000\nLike, if I find out that I've been nominated for an Emmy, and I have...\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:51.000\nNo, not recently. Sorry. That wasn't an announcement.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:58.000\nI'm saying, I know, I'm saying like these experiences where it's like in a biopic, you're supposed to simply just go like,\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:03.000\nhuh, like it's more when it happens in real life when you go like,\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:09.000\nI just won this thing or I just achieved this thing or that thing I was working on really hard,\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:12.000\nit's getting picked up and it's going to go and it's going to...\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:18.000\nI tend to just like, I seek isolation in those moments and melancholy.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:24.000\nAnd something to do with like the same fact that the way we appreciate food is we destroy it, we'd shit it out.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:30.000\nOur saliva has enzymes in it that break a thing down so that we can use it in a real way.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:36.000\nAnd I love nothing more if I'm having a really good professional time.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:45.000\nLike, I love to celebrate it quietly but with a drink staring out a window at a Michael Mann Los Angeles skyline\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:50.000\nand play something really synthy and sad and heroin sounding and kind of like,\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:55.000\nand definitely not smile if a camera panned around me, the director might go,\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.000\ncome on, give me a little, you just got nominated for an Emmy.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:04.000\nNo, this is what it looks like. It looks like fucking like, yeah, whoever would have thought.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:11.000\nYou know, you just sort of like slump into it. I'm happy so much that I'm always just doing that.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:16.000\nThat's good to hear. Cause if I was like, if I was waiting tables, if I was lifting crates and stuff and I've had those jobs,\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:25.000\nnot crates, but like, yeah, you come home and then you go right for the, you grab a beer and you chug it down\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:30.000\nand you call a friend and you're like, well, let's have some fun. That might be age too.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:37.000\nLike, I haven't done that stuff since that age, but I have a feeling that working a 12 hour shift at an emergency room\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:41.000\nmakes you want to go out and smile a lot. Excuse me.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:53.000\nBut like, if you, if you, if you get paid to be in your pajamas for four months of the year\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:59.000\nand then, and then drink Starbucks and talk about how to make people laugh for the other part of the year,\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:04.000\nlike, and then if also people tell you that you're doing it well, I don't know.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:10.000\nI don't know how often you'd smile because what's the point?\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:17.000\nYeah, I think of the times when I felt like when I was really at my lowest and like, when I was really broke\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:21.000\nand being evicted and like, like things started finally happening for me like with work.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:26.000\nLike you don't, you don't run out and smile and like call your friends and celebrate you.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nYou sit in the corner in the dark and cry like that.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:35.000\nSome of the happiest moments I've ever had was being completely alone and just like crumpled into a heap.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:42.000\nBut you just said back in those days when both you and I were broke, you were being evicted and all that stuff.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:50.000\nWe, to correct you on that or, or clarify, we, when we would go out, we were, we were laughing all the time.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:51.000\nYeah.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:59.000\nI'm saying that the first moment when the moment, the first moment of safety when, when the phone call came in that a job came in,\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:03.000\nwhen you were going to be on a show or like work came in, you don't go like, woo-hoo.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:07.000\nLike, like, like, it's a new way that you use it.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:08.000\nYeah.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:11.000\nMy knees gave out a couple of times and you just lay on the floor.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nOh yeah.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:13.000\nAnd you talk about those moments.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:18.000\nAnd you put on sad music and later on when you recover, I called up you and you and I would go out there\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:24.000\nand then we would sit there and giggle at our fortune because you and I were paying each other's bills for, for a couple of years.\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:30.000\nLike, we were surviving off of each other's alternate good fortune.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:35.000\nThere, there were times when you and I, I've never seen you or I laugh as much.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:42.000\nBut I agree with you in those moments when, when like, when you're really like happy alone, it's not, you're not Jean Kelly,\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:43.000\nyou know, dancing on the street.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:50.000\nYou're, you're in the corner or in your car, you know, like being wishful and melancholy.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:51.000\nYeah.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:57.000\nYeah. And who's crankier than, I don't know, rich people getting what they want.\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:02.000\nLike, like, they're not, because they're not really experiencing like genuine reasons to be happy.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:06.000\nLike, I, I, like getting a candy bar when you're starving, that's like a big deal.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:13.000\nGetting, getting, getting a really good Kobe steak when you can have anything you want to eat.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:17.000\nLike people tend to go like, Oh, it was a little, it was a little undercooked.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:24.000\nLike you, you still, you enjoy the steak, but the way you express it is with a foodie blog where you complain,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:30.000\nyou nitpick, whereas the person who is starving and you hand them a fucking Snickers bar,\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:34.000\nthey would like kiss it and like break into tongues.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:38.000\nSnickers bar! So fucking hungry.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:42.000\nI've been, I've been lost in the snow. Wolves are eating me and I found toothpaste.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:50.000\nI'm going to eat it. Happiness is like, it's not always an expression of, of, of like satisfaction.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:53.000\nIt's an expression of like going from one extreme to the other.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:56.000\nIt's like that portamento. Is that what they call it?\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nSlide whistle.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:03.000\nYou know, going sliding from one thing to the other where your, where your fingers are on the frets.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nAll right. That's our music segment.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:12.000\nLet's bring out relationship expert, Aaron McAvoy!\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:37.000\nHello, Aaron.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:38.000\nHi, how are you?\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nYeah, how's it going?\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:40.000\nGood.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:41.000\nFun show.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nYeah, it's all right. It's headed moments.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:48.000\nIt's headed ups and a lot of downs.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nI'm enjoying it a lot.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.000\nI feel very happy.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nWell, there's something wrong with you.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nThat's how I receive compliments.\n\n50:56.000 --> 51:00.000\nIt's called deflection. It's one, it's a, it's a new gateway.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:08.000\nIt's like a new Oprah book, like a guy selling a book, like, did you know about deflection?\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:11.000\nDeflect compliments, deflect insults.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:14.000\nJust repeat to yourself the following phrase.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:17.000\nI'm rubber.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:21.000\nDon't worry what they're made out of.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:24.000\nYou're rubber. I'm rubber.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nWhatever you say about me bounces off.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nThat's it.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:33.000\nNice haircut. Fuck off.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:37.000\nDan, that sounded racist. You parked wrong. You scratched my car.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nI don't care.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:40.000\nHave you lost weight?\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.000\nI'm rubber.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nHave you lost some weight?\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nUh, yeah.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:48.000\nThank you.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:51.000\nYou're not rubber. You piece of shit.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:55.000\nNot when I want something to be true.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:58.000\nWhat's life like now that you guys are engaged, like around the house?\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:01.000\nLike, does it change any interactions?\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:05.000\nWell, I have to wash the veil every day.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:08.000\nI wear a veil every day.\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nAnd you get so dirty, you have to wash it every day.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nYou've seen our house and you get a little cluttered.\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nWhat are you doing to dirty your veil all the time?\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nWell, we're Methodist.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:20.000\nAh, you do the math.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:24.000\nYeah, every morning Dan, every morning Dan baptizes me.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:30.000\nWe fill up the bathtub and we write our vows on rose petals.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:33.000\nBut they come from the garden and we don't clean them off.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:36.000\nAnd I'm wearing the veil. Baptism gets dirty.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:37.000\nYeah.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nThese are just traditions.\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:42.000\nThe garden has our neighbor's dogs buried in it.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nThat's the Methodist part.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nYeah.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:49.000\nDid you guys kill the dogs?\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:53.000\nIf they don't die on schedule,\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:56.000\nthat's God asking you to...\n\n52:56.000 --> 53:00.000\nIt's called dog death schedule.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nYou know, Methodist.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nThe old saying, kill a dog with a knife.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:07.000\nBe happily married for the rest of your life.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nWe're just doing that as many times as we can.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.000\nAnd we don't want to kill our own dog because we like our dog.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nKill a dog every Wednesday.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:21.000\nThat's the special spiritual friend's way.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:26.000\nWhich is the name of our denomination of Methodist special spiritual friends.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nIf anyone's interested, we'll be...\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:34.000\nKill a dog on Sunday night, Monday morning, fuck or fight.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nSo that's more of the Appalachian...\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nFuck or fight a dog or another person.\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nEach other, each other.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:46.000\nSo if you kill a dog on Wednesday night?\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:50.000\nKill a dog every Wednesday.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nThat's spiritual friends.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nSunday night, fuck or fight.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:58.000\nIf you have a question, there's a pamphlet under your seat.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:01.000\nIf you don't have any questions but just want to leave,\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:05.000\nthere are armed guards at every door.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:09.000\nWelcome to

Lenev's arm\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nwhile Christopher rubbed meat on it\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000\ntogether they fashioned a paper hairpiece\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nfor Lenev's skull\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nwhich stopped him dead in his tracks\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nthey quit fighting\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nand joined hands and

that we rubbed around it\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nbecause we thought that what a skeleton\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nenjoys having meat on his arm\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nmade sense to me at the time\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nbut more importantly\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nthis was the thing that sealed the deal\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nwe started making him construction paper hair\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nbecause I think\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nthat even when he wasn't a skeleton\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nhe maybe was bald and was insecure about it\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nthat's a speculation\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nthat's not canon\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nbut we are now his friend again\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nand\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nyou re welcome\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\ndid we find the\n\n01:27:36.000
