01:15.000\nWow, you came right out the gate.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:18.000\nI said, I said, I said city on a mountain because I was thinking about the elevation here.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:19.000\nRight.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nAnd then it was like fountain, rhymes with mountain.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:22.000\nRight.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:30.000\nAnd then, and then it was like, but the unfortunate dot connection between pussy and fountain and that makes you think of all kinds of weird stuff.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nI don't want, I don't want it to be that kind of show.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:40.000\nI'm worried about you, if you could do a lot of rap, I mean, I want you to do a lot of rapping tonight, I want you to do your little toddler dance, but at this elevation.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:46.000\nIt is, yeah, I wonder if there's a thing here, I want to, you know, we're exactly a mile above sea level.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:47.000\nExactly.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nExactly a mile above sea level.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\n5,280 feet, or your money back.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd I swear, last time I was in Denver, yeah, I could feel the effects of it, being at this altitude.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nI think I'm going to die because I'm going to be dancing around.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:06.000\nYou're not going to die, you're just going to pass out.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nAnd the audience will be concerned.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nYou're not, are you here by yourself?\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:12.000\nOh, what's your name?\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nI don't want to pick on you.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nMy name's Ryan.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nIs anybody else alone?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nYou are?\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:23.000\nWe got three down front.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nOh, really?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:33.000\nWell, that seems like a shitty seat, do you want to sit at Ryan's table?\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nHey, it's called Harvintown, not Denver Improv Town.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nThey can absolutely suck it.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nYeah, they can't really, yeah.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nI'll pay them a lot of money, I'll write them a check for you.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nYou want to sit there or sit there?\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nI said we got Drew, Drew just moved down from, we're rearranging, so now Drew and Ryan are sitting together.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nAll right, and then that guy that looks exactly like Stephen Schraub, that's his brother.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nOkay, wow, Ryan, I hope you wanted the company because now...\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nYeah.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nA table of one is a table for four now, I love that.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd a finder's fee?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nCheese stick snuffer.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nOh, he's a cheese stick snuffer.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:16.000\nHe's a cheese, a cheese stick snuffer.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:21.000\nYou grab a hold of your cheese sticks.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nHe's like no other.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nHe'll sit for people down to eat their cheese.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nHe's the kind of guy that loves cheese.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nLoves it right between knees.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nIt's dumb, stupid.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nAnd not legally clearable, neither.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nNo, I don't think anybody would sue you for doing that to that song.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nAll right, what are the names here we got?\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:47.000\nI'm Stephen.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.000\nStephen.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nDrew.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nDrew.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nAdam.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.000\nAdam.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nTry to remember that.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nCould one of you be named Dan Thoreau or something?\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nStephen, Drew, Ryan, Adam, right?\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nAll right, the Council of Doom.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nYeah.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nThat is going to make it hard for me to get out there and work the crowd.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nAnd if there's a fire, we're all going to die.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nStephen, you sitting this close to the stage is going to be some hot beard on beard action\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nwhen Spencer comes out.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nLet's get these beards together right now.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:26.000\nAll right.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nBeard on beard.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nGod damn it.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:33.000\nStephen.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nDrew.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:35.000\nAndrew.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nJohn.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nSteve.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nRyan.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.000\nJohn.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nJason.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:41.000\nAdam.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nBob.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nAnd Tim.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nJess, we need more creative parents in this world.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:50.000\nSpeaking as a Dan, we got to...\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nHow about Jeffrey Brian Davis?\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nThat's pretty white.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:59.000\nGod damn it.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nI wish people's names were like...\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nYeah, I mean, I've said this before.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nI want...\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nYou should have...\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nFor the first 11 years of your life, you should just be called kid.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nBecause who gives a shit about you?\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nLike, what do you know?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nYou don't know nothing.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nIt's just kid.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nIt's kid number eight, kid number nine.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd then on your 12th birthday, you should either pick your name\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nor have everybody give you a name.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nIt's like, if you're an asshole, your name should be asshole.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:32.000\nOr if you're like, in the eagles, they could call you eagle, you know?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nI care.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nI just wanted to be specific.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nWhat if you're in the eagles' assholes?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:38.000\nThen you're in the asshole.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:39.000\nThat's exactly...\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:40.000\nI want to...\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nWe got to fix society, Jeff.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nWe got to go to the moon and we got to call it.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nI think your natural instinct, there was a man sitting here alone\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nand we found out that there's lots of singles here tonight.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nBut it's not a surprise with my crowd.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nIt's not a couple's show.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nI guess I'd be more surprised if there was lots of single ladies here.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nYeah, that would be a weird thing.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:02.000\nWoo!\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nBachelorette party!\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nYeah.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nMy beard is getting really long on the road\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nand so it's absorbing a lot of vodka.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nI don't know what to talk about and what not to talk about.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nWe'll edit it out if it's not fruitful.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.000\nBut really, save it for later.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nYou mean the topic or the vodka?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.000\nYou mean the vodka.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:29.000\nIt's one of the ladies that came here to hook up.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:34.000\nOkay, so John, Jake, Ryan, Tim, Steve.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nYou got Steve right through.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nAndrew and Bob.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.000\nOkay.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.000\nAdam.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nAlright, we'll have you guys up later.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nJeff, you're back.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nYou were gone for two episodes.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nThank you very much.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nI had to leave Harmontown sadly.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nIt was weird to be away from you guys for two days.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nI went and joined Ryan Stiles and Greg Proups and Joel Murray in the Northwest\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nand we did three shows.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\nYou guys had a day off.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nYou guys went to the shittiest places in the world.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:06.000\nI leave the group for two days and they are at Dave and Buster's.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:12.000\nIt's possible that you may be the force that brings us to more exquisite places,\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:18.000\nbut it's also possible that in Kansas City, the hotel was next to one of these malls\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nwhere there's just like a dinosaur restaurant and the stand-up club we're performing at.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nAnd it was like Dave Coulier's there on Wednesday and J.J. Walker's there on Friday.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:32.000\nAnd then it said like John Davis and Dan Harmon in their nationally televised podcast,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:37.000\nyou could be in the show. That's what it said.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nI didn't know that we were televised this.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:44.000\nWe are safely away from Kansas City and the people that came to that show,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nthe 60 Harmonians in that audience, I want to say I love you very much,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:51.000\nbut that club sucks.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nThat was bad news.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nIt was like being in a driver's ed class like in the back of a mall.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nIt was not made for us.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nIt was not made for our people.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nIt did show up or bummed out.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nI think it affects me.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nDo you think I'm having a good show right now?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nWe're not talking about anything.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nLet's make with the entertainment.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nEntertainment section.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nEntertainment section.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nEntertainment section.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nShe's about to entertain your balls off right now.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nWelcome to the entertainment section.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nI booked your mama obvious right of erection.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nI booked her instant a day in last week.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nI booked her mama so hard.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nI went to Widow's Peak.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nIt's a special place.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nNick Nolte lives there.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nIt's named after him because of his hair.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nHis hair is a Widow's Peak.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nI don't need to explain myself.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nSee you next week.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nI booked your mama in a hill in a valley.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nI booked your mama until her name was Sally.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nFourth right.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:47.000\nWasn't that a comic?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nI booked your mama on a comic.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nI booked your mama in Denver.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nI booked your mama and she doesn't remember.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nIt's not my fault.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nThat wasn't great.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nI didn't put anything in her drink.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nIt was great.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nShe had a good time.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nHer damn ninja was brought on by my dick.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nWhoa, my dick.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nThe altitude, Jeff, is...\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nI can't rap at this altitude.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nDon't blame the altitude.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nI can't rap at this altitude.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nDon't blame the cheese dick.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nWe're going to be a mile above sea level right now.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nWe are exactly, exactly one mile above sea level.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nThis is the place to be when the polar ice caps melt.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nThis is going to be the last place.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nThis is dry land, right?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nThis is where the...\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nOh, fuck, this altitude.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nYou know who's really good at rapping?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nI mean, a lot of people.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nA lot of professional people.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nDr. Dre.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nSpencer.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nWe found out on the bus last night.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nDo we get Spencer up here?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nSpencer.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nHe's very concerned about being put on the spot\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nabout his rapping.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nBut the truth is, in...\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nSpencer Clinton.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nThe dungeon master.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nI don't know if you guys are avid podcast listeners.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nI assume you bought tickets on that side.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:13.000\nYou may recall that back in Los Angeles,\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nwhen we decided to bring...\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nThat's Raquel.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nMake sure you tip her.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nAnd I don't know everyone's name,\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nbut I thought that would be impressive if I did that.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nWhat's your name right there?\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nMaria.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nMaria.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nYeah, don't tip her.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nYeah, don't.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nShe's working...\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nNo, she's working the same tables as Raquel.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nRaquel doesn't know why she's here.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nNever met her in her life.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nShe's just following Raquel around.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nTaking drinks away that Raquel puts down.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nMaria was fired from this place 15 years ago.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nYeah, Maria.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nSome say she died here.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nFrom a certain angle,\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nyou can still see her haunting other waitresses.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.000\nYeah, there's a photo of Damarera on the wall\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nand Maria's in the background,\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:02.000\nwhich is weird because Damarera was famous in the 20s.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nShining.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nSo Dan...\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nWait, what was I talking about?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nWell, I'll get you back on check.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nI went away for a while.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nI haven't heard Minneapolis,\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nbecause I didn't get a chance to listen to it.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd Kansas City hasn't dropped yet,\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nso I haven't heard that one either.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nSo I don't really know what went on.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:23.000\nI heard that you had the basic upshot with the shows\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nwhere Spencer filled me in on the D&D campaign.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nBut story structure-wise,\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nthere's a thing that you put on Tumblr\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nabout the fact that you felt like,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nif you're the hero of the story,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nthe fact that you haven't changed at all.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nDid you discuss this in the show?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nI talked about it a little bit.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nIt was Kansas City, kind of, right over their heads.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nThis isn't the time to talk about it.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nNothing gets over the heads in Denver.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nThey're a mile above sea level.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nYou did this really fascinating little video on Tumblr.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nIt was amazing, because you didn't edit it.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nYou didn't stutter once.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nIt was really good.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nSecond take.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nThat's nice of you to be honest about that.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nThe altitude.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nWhat is that?\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nAre you like John Herd and Alien?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nHow are your two days off-planet?\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nIt was great. Let's have some more breakfast.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nLet's have some more breakfast.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.000\nSo, you're saying story structure-wise,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nif you're the hero of this tour that you're going on,\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nthe fact that you haven't changed\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nprobably makes you the villain.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nPossibly, yeah.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nPossibly makes you the villain.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nIt certainly makes me at least an extra,\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nor a horse.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nBut Spencer released this beautifully written blog\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nabout his awakening,\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nor his really self-examination.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nHe's on a journey.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nHe's meeting the outside world.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nHe's coming to grips with other people\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nand what that means about him.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nSpencer learned on this journey\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:54.000\nthat everyone in the world could be into him.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nNo one would ever understand him.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nI'm not putting words into it.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nThat sounds pretentious, putting words into his mouth like that.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nBut that's, like, learned.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nIs that about right, Spencer?\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nI wouldn't phrase it that way.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nNo, it would make you sound like a dick, yeah.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nBut you got to a point where it's like,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\npeople were throwing the equivalent of panties at you.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nThat was a wool cap.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nThere were dudes throwing wool caps at you.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nThat's as close as this crowd's going to get to throwing panties.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nThis crowd is a practical crowd.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:30.000\nIf they have panties, they're using them.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nA hipster threw his wool cap at you and said,\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nI don't need this anymore.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nYou take it.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nAnd then, even though that seems like a thing,\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nit's like, oh, I would like that.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nI would like to be able to push a button\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nand feel what it's like to feel everyone liking me,\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\neveryone appreciating me, everyone accepting me.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nAnd you said in your blog entry to paraphrase you,\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nto extrapolate what you were saying,\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:01.000\nthat the rival at that goal actually led you to the realization\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nthat there will still never be a certain connection\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nbetween you and other people.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nYou could be alone for the rest of your life, Spencer.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nI will be. I mean, that's a given.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nSo this motherfuckers on a journey.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nI'm just a fat guy on a bus.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nSo we're going to find out that he's the hero of this.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nAnd that makes me like Jafar.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nI didn't mean to say it like Christopher Walken, but...\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nIt's Jafar.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nThat makes me like Jafar.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nTo his Aladdin.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nMy story circle is crystal ball.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nBut now you're doing Jimmy Stewart.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:45.000\nWell, I'm also Bane from Batman.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nMany people talk like this.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nJafar.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nJimmy Stewart.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nGarrison Keeler.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nBane.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nSo while I was away...\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nChristopher Walken.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nBill Clinton.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nDon Knuts.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nCan we hear...\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nLook at the Popeye.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nCan we hear your Don Knuts?\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nWell, Michael...\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nNo, Bill Clinton.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nI think you should run for president.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nNo, thank you.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nI don't have relations with a woman.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:20.000\nI'm Don Knuts.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nNo, Bill Clinton.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nBill Clinton, please.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nCan you get a little Bill Cosby in there?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:28.000\nOh, what are you two talking about over here?\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:33.000\nWhy got Don Knuts and Bill Clinton talking to me?\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nWell, I'm not talking to you, man.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nI'm talking to Bill Clinton.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nI'm not talking to you either.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nI'm talking to Bill Clinton.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nCan we get him a kiss?\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nOh, Gabby Hayes just walked in.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:48.000\nWell, Michael, I'm Bill Clinton.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nI'm Gabby Hayes.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nI'm Don Knuts.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:56.000\nI'm Bill Cosby.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nDon't embarrass yourselves.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nIt was not full applause.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nThere's giant pockets of no applause.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nAnd those people are heroes.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nThere's people who are like, no, no.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nSwing it amiss.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nThere will be times when I will appreciate effort from you,\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nwhen I will need it.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nBut there are also times when I need to be punished.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nSo if you feel like story structure-wise,\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nbecause we obsessed over this,\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nthat last night was some sort of death\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nbecause of the room you're in and the whole thing,\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nbecause you also found out on the tour bus\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:32.000\ndriving here overnight that...\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nSpencer can rap better than you.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nYeah.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nThat's not true.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:40.000\nWell, that's spoken like a hero.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nDon't turn around.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nYeah.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nDon't turn around.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.000\nJust behind you, always behind you.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nNo matter where you look,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nI'm always gonna be behind you.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nHe just took his dick out.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nHe just bit his ass right there.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nI'm gonna find you flicking in the trees.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nI'm gonna find you.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nJason.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nI fucked your mama so hard, her pussy started to hasten.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nSay, it got really fast.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nI fucked your mama so hard,\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nthe pussy started to blast out from the tarmac in space.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nI fucked your mama regardless of her race.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nShe's bi-racial.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nI fucked your mama.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:25.000\nIt was spatial relations that I needed.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:29.000\nI put my dick down and she heated the call\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nto adventure of my wiener.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nShe came to it and said,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nthis looks cleaner than bacon.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nI put it on her plate.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nI fucked your mama hard because I'm not about hate.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:44.000\nYo, come on down to Harmontown.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nTurn that frown upside down.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nDiversity.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nHe is yellow poop is brown.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nYo, I'm gonna do another verse so that Spencer can do one\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nthat couldn't be worse.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nLower the bar and talk to my people.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nAndy.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nSteeple.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nSee how that works?\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nDidn't matter what his name was.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nI'm a fucking jerk.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nI just wrapped a work in the crowd.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nGonna eat your fry.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nGonna tan out loud.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:20.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nTurn that frown upside down.\n\n18:22.000 -->

--> 18:39.000\nBut bitch, don't be asking what I had for lunch\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nbecause I'll tie you up with ropes and chains.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nAnd when we play in D&D, you know I hold the reins\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nbecause with a lightning bolt or a fireball,\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nyou best roll a climb check before you climb that wall.\n\n18:51.000 -->

25:13.000\nif you're going to have salt,\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nlike, don't put a lake there\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nand vice versa.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nLike, you know, we've heard it before.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nIt just seems like a dumb place\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nto have salt.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nIt's a lake.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:26.000\nIt's going to be cold

29:14.000\nBrandon Lilius.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nFor his debut on stage,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nI'm not mistaken, right?\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nThis sounds made up,\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nbut this sounds absolutely made up.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:26.000\nBrandon is a fourth-generation sound engineer.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nWait, doesn't that predate sound?\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nWell, that's the thing.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nThis sounds absolutely made up.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:36.000\nHis great-grandfather did sound\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\non the jazz singer.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nYeah.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nWas that him?\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nAnd not the Neil Diamond one.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nBut there was actually a movie\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nbefore the Jazz Singer.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nJazz Singer was the first talking,\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nbut there was sound in a movie\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nprevious to that that you're doing.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nDon Juan, yeah.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nBasically, they had sound.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nThey recorded the soundtrack for Don Juan,\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nwhich is music, which at the time,\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nhaving actor talk was very controversial.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nSo, yeah.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nIt sounds made up, right?\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nLike it's a sociopath.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:02.000\nI'm not just a boom operator.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:05.000\nI'm actually part of a low lineage of people who...\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nOh, my old...\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:11.000\nBiff Tannen started holding a boom

there.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:22.000\nIt's a living, but...\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nIf he's lying, he's busted now.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nWhen did you find this out when I was away?\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nYeah, man.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nDude, we grew together.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nFucking hell.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nI'm so jealous.\n\n30:31.000 -->

30:40.000\nI'm shallow.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nI don't deny that,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nbut you've got to be really connecting out there.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.000\nYou're a

way\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:26.000\nand expected me to start rapping for all of y'all.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nI don't even know what I'm havin' a ball.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:32.000\nIt's a really great

you, sir.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nThank you, Brandon.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:36.000\nIt's fantastic.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:39.000\nIt's funny, because his job is to capture sound,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:44.000\nand he's a giant with a booming voice that has a great beatbox.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nHe really is enormous.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nYeah.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nAnd loud.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:53.000\nHe's supposed to capture sound, but he creates so much more than he captures.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nEven more than he captures.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nIt makes him sound like a bad sound guy.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nThe ghost of his great-grandfather's gonna haunt him,\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nand it's gonna say, crisp, clean,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:09.000\nlike, no, there will be no clipping.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:14.000\nThere will be no plosives.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:22.000\nIt's my grandpa, the guy that invented the Dixie Cup and the string.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:31.000\nJeff, how do we make people love each other?\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:35.000\nTurn the lights down real low.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nI think what you do is be honest.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:43.000\nYou expose yourself, and that allows other people to release themselves out there, too.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nAlternate pitch.\n\n33:45.000 --> 34:02.000\nSports Corner!\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nHello, Denver Colorado Sports Corner.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nKevin Asher with your host, Dan Harmon.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nHe loves

What did you take away from that experience?\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:53.000\nIf there's ever been an alter to the grace that is the America's favorite sport, it is Mile High Stadium.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:57.000\nYou can feel the fans there. You can feel that they're getting what they want and wanting what they get.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:04.000\nYou can sense just even when the place is empty, I go down there with my daughter every fall.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:13.000\nThis is the stadium that God built for this sport and this sport alone.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:21.000\nI don't mean to change sports, but what do you think is the most important role on the Colorado Rockies?\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nThe most important position on the Rockies?\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:26.000\nDefinitely the top position.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:31.000\nThe most significant player and role position.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:34.000\nYeah, the highest one.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nThe most significant on the field.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:42.000\nTyler who plays Perry.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:45.000\nTyler who plays Perry.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:50.000\nHe'll be playing Perry next season, but Tyler is on top now.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:53.000\nDo you think the Rockies can be built after the last season?\n\n35:53.000 --> 36:00.000\nI think the Rockies are in the down slide, but that can be a precursor to an upswing.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:05.000\nI believe that as my grandpa used to say in Uncle Homo back when we used to watch the Nuggets.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nUncle Homo?\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:13.000\nI thought you called your grandpa Uncle Homo.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:17.000\nI'm from Wisconsin, Jeff, where grandpa's are known as Uncle Homo's.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:21.000\nIt's like a Mima or a Pop Pop.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:25.000\nIn Wisconsin we called our grandpa's Uncle Homo's.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.000\nI understand that's an offensive phrase, but hey.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:32.000\nI guess what I'm trying to say is what sport do the Rockies play?\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:36.000\nThe America's favorite?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nWhich is?\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:43.000\nThey play football, man. They play football.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nThey play football.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nBasketball.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nThey play basketball.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nWho are you quizzing me? I'm the sports guy.\n\n36:54.000 --> 37:00.000\nThose Nuggets got to get out there, like front and center, or the Rockies are going to take it.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:07.000\nAre you saying that the Denver Nuggets are doing so poorly that the Colorado Rockies might move in on their actions?\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:12.000\nStranger things have happened, Jeff, with the wild card system and going into second procedurals.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:17.000\nWe've got a second tertiary format here, a 7-10 split, veritably speaking.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:21.000\nIn the all conference, if you go to all stars and then you come down to the single individuals,\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:27.000\nthen what we're talking about is a potential Nuggets coup over the Rockies in the spring semester,\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:31.000\nor it's not a 40-point spread.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:37.000\nThey agree. They seem to agree.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:45.000\nI mean, the sports news cycle, we've heard so much about it, but you know more than anybody.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:48.000\nWhen do you think that this NHL lockout is going to end?\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:54.000\nI've got Jeff, if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times. Yardage.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nThat's pretty good.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:08.000\nI can't tell the difference between Grey Goose and Kettle One, but I can tell the difference between Sirach,\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:12.000\nSnap Frost, the venue doesn't have it.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nKettle One had a chance to be our sponsor.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nThey have Grey Goose. Grey Goose is great.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nGoose.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:21.000\nBut it's fine. Vodka's vodka, honestly, kids.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:25.000\nYou know what breaks my heart, Jeff, is when the kids don't know they're vodka?\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nYeah.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:31.000\nWe play these venues under 21-plus or 18-plus, 21 or whatever they are,\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:35.000\nand they're signing things after the show.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:39.000\nEvery once in a while, like two people my age will come up to me and go,\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:47.000\nEric, can you sign us for our daughter, Ariel? She's 16, she's now allowed to come to the show.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:58.000\nAnd I go, well, are you, Jesus Christ, you guys, do you want to cause another fight?\n\n38:58.000 --> 38:59.000\nYes.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:05.000\nI'm sorry I picked that name, but they go, she can't come tonight.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:09.000\nBecause her ponytails are too red and bouncy.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:13.000\nShe had volleyball practice.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:20.000\nMy point, Jeff, is that sometimes, every third city, like a set of parents will come up to me,\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:24.000\none or more parents who aren't even fans of the show, don't even care,\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:30.000\nso who sit for two hours and listen to me talk about Dexon Balls and rapping and Dungeons and Dragons,\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:37.000\nand they're only here just to get a signature for their underage child.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:40.000\nIt really, like, pumps me out.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:44.000\nAnd I'm like, did you have a good time? And they're like, you're great, you're great.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:50.000\nJust, her name's Rachel and can't wait to drive this back to Omaha.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nLike, that's fucked up.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:58.000\nBest parents, first of all, they deserve better than two hours of me.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:02.000\nBest kid in the world, I don't know. What do you do there, Jeff? What do you do?\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nDo you sing a song?\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nNo, no, I'm kidding.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nI think you sing a song.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nLet's meet some people from our audience, Jeff.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:16.000\nI'm spraying, my mustache is, I'm spraying vodka all over everyone.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nYou've eaten all the cheese sticks, so that doesn't matter.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nThere's one left. You want to get that?\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nThere's two left.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nThank you, Ariel.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:30.000\nJeff, I'm going to die.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:34.000\nYou're not putting up much of a fight.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nI'm going to die, Jeff.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:40.000\nThere was 18 pizza boxes in that room today.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:45.000\nDan, you're beautiful. You're beautiful.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nPeople like you.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nThey deserve to be loved.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nDan, Kansas City was a fluke.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:54.000\nThe guy wasn't there. The room was bad.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:59.000\nThey had so many nachos.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:02.000\nI got to get back on my diet, Jeff.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nI'm verging on acryte.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:09.000\nI'm going to be acryte by Portland.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nHe got pretty large.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nAcryte got inexplicably large.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:17.000\nHe'd be into how weird it is, how large he got.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nHe'd be like, oh, it's a mystery.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:22.000\nCrystal Skull made me so fat.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nI told you once that I somehow,\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nafter an after-after-after party,\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nended up at Dan Ackroyd's house,\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:31.000\nand he was as big as a poor person's house.\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nBut fortunately, he had a huge mansion,\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nwhere houses fit inside it.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nThere were poor people living in him.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nHey, keep it down out there.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nWe're trying to write our version of Ghostbusters.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nBut it was like 3 or 4 a.m.,\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nand he just made a pizza.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:49.000\nHe took a Dijonno out of the freezer and put it in the oven.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:52.000\nHe just shook his shirt out.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:55.000\nBalladone came out.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:58.000\nHe put the ear in his fucking sauce.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:01.000\nLike a golden retriever getting out of a river.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:05.000\nHe shook his body, and a pizza came out.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:08.000\nBut I said, I'd be a bad friend if I didn't tell you,\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nthat my best friends and I,\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:13.000\nwe think Ghostbusters is one of the best movies of all time.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:16.000\nHey, you know what?

been journeying\n\n52:42.380 --> 52:44.380\nIn the belly of the beast\n\n52:44.380 --> 52:46.380\nThe mysterious and mythical\n\n52:46.380 --> 52:48.380\nAnd finifish\n\n52:48.380 --> 52:50.380\nAfter Sharpie found what looked like a lung\n\n52:50.380 --> 52:52.380\nThe group rejoined and entered through a large cavity\n\n52:52.380 --> 52:54.380\nThat quark had slashed in the side of the great organ\n\n52:54.380 --> 52:56.380\nEntering the lung\n\n52:56.380 --> 52:58.380\nA slimy creature had dropped in\n\n52:58.380 --> 53:00.380\nFrom the ceiling onto the bottom of this chamber\n\n53:00.380 --> 53:02.380\nFollowed by several electrical spidery minions\n\n53:02.380 --> 53:04.380\nAfter the dust of combat had settled\n\n53:04.380 --> 53:06.380\nSharpie, quark, and Mulraine were victorious\n\n53:06.380 --> 53:08.380\nHoping to damage the lung\n\n53:08.380 --> 53:10.380\nWith the smoke from their smoke sticks\n\n53:10.380 --> 53:12.380\nSharpie and Mulraine ignited them\n\n53:12.380 --> 53:14.380\nAs well as all their torches\n\n53:14.380 --> 53:16.380\nAnd as the damage was being dealt\n\n53:16.380 --> 53:18.380\nTo the vicious lung\n\n53:18.380 --> 53:20.380\nQuark destroyed the remnants\n\n53:20.380 --> 53:22.380\nWith his flaming sword\n\n53:22.380 --> 53:24.380\nAnd together they all fell below\n\n53:24.380 --> 53:26.380\nBack into the chamber before they had left\n\n53:26.380 --> 53:28.380\nAh, yeah\n\n53:28.380 --> 53:30.380\nThey had made some progress\n\n53:30.380 --> 53:32.380\nBut they proceed from here\n\n53:32.380 --> 53:34.380\nThank you, Spencer\n\n53:34.380 --> 53:36.380\nYeah, alright\n\n53:36.380 --> 53:38.380\nSeems like now there's a big wrap start\n\n53:38.380 --> 53:40.380\nNow he's phoning in his DMing\n\n53:40.380 --> 53:42.380\nNo, I just lost my place\n\n53:42.380 --> 53:44.380\nIn the writing, reading\n\n53:44.380 --> 53:46.380\nHe sounds like Don LaFontaine now\n\n53:46.380 --> 53:48.380\nIn a world\n\n53:48.380 --> 53:50.380\nHe's kicking back, he's Snoop-style now\n\n53:50.380 --> 53:52.380\nI don't know\n\n53:52.380 --> 53:54.380\nIn a world, Louis\n\n53:54.380 -->
